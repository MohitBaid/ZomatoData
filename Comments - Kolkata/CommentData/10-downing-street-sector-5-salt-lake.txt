So, I visited this place last Friday, and had an almost good experience. They place is nicely decorated and staff are well behaved..but the only thing is usually the staff are very busy and we had to wait almost quite a long time before we could even ask them for an extra pair of fork and knife. Coming to food, we had butterfly prawns and lamb bourguignon both of which were amazing!
Overall a decent experience.

Not very great ambience. Just overhyped. Wort part was the waiters. Even after explaning the change in order and not taking 2 beers, we were billed for it. Noticed this only after coming back home. Slipery dance floor and mundane dj. Will never bisit again as they dont even provide mouth piece along witj hookah. This was like heights of cheapness.

I visited this restaurant in the second week of December. The ambience is fantastic. If you are into loud music and low lights, this is the place for you. The service was pretty good. The food was nice as well. Comparatively, the rates are a bit on the higher side. But nevermind, that they compensate with their ambience.

So I had been here for another weekend brunch with friends and I have been totally intrigued by the amazing ambiance inside. Starting from the fascinating name to the decor inside, everything is totally great. üíù
So in the starters we had ordered the non-veg Continental platter which was pretty descent and sufficient to suffice 3-4 people. It had fried chicken wings, fried fish and egg preparation dressed beautifully.üíì
Next up we had the Chinese platter which again had some of my personal favourites like dry chilli chicken, chicken wings and chilli fish! üíú
Moving on to drinks, it was quite affordable. üòç
We went for strawberry üçì and watermelon üçâ margaritas which were absolutely delicious!!

Location- 4- If someone is aware of sector 5 area, it is not hard to locate this restaurant. It is situated just near RDB cinemas. 
Ambience- 4.5-Nice ambience, nice decor, vast space, a special mention to the washroom which gives you a relief with their hilarious pun posters.
Service-3.5- Service is a little slow though all the staffs are very courteous.
Food- 4.5- The restaurant offers you with great combo meals at a very pocket friendly budget. The combos include beverages, dessert and a meal. We ordered a chicken cheese lasgne with blue lagoon cocktail and a plate of butter nan along with nawabi chicken. Two scoops of icecreams were served as dessert with the two combos. All the food tasted really good.

Heard a lot about this place but when I paid my much awaited visit to the place I was sadly disappointed. Firstly they had ample.amout of space available but they could not offer us any as because they had bookings for a private party. It was about 5.30 and said booking was from 6.30 so we sat on the bar stools and had a pretty uncomfortable experience. Although the food and drinks served were pretty good along with the hookah. But the seating management was least to say poorly managed.

Awesome place to hangout with friends. I have been here many times, one of the best clubs in the region and mostly a place for the IT crowd, because of its location.

Been here on ladies night( on Wednesday ladies get free shots, males who accompany have to pay a 1k per head as cover charge) and also on Thursday and sometimes weekends.

It's always full of life and the djs are generally good. It's somewhere in between not so expensive and expensive. It depends on the way you place your order ;) 

However, chicken nachos, penne Alfredo pasta, Virgin Mary is a must try. The food tastes really good, I don't remember all the items which we have ordered, because every time we order something new, but we've never been disappointed by them anytime. Drinks they offer is good too and the crowd is decent. It is managed by a good hostess and an austere host and the staff is well behaved and polite. The ambience is great too , I'll surely visit this place again and also I've suggested many people to visit this place.

The Christmas to New Year week has always been a joyous occasion and with the meteoric rise of discotheques and shisha places in Kolkata it is hard to find a hushed place to drink and dine. Then came through the rarities, 10 Downing Street. Located in between BJ Sports and Kareem's, you will face no problem locating it. 

We were in awe of Kareem's, but the d√©cor of 10 downing Street was on another level. The place was dimly lit, although it was post noon, so not sure about the night life here. The highlight of this place would be the gorgeous chandelier shedding its light on the bar counter well managed by the bartenders. The first floor hasn't been opened to guests, but the ground floor is huge enough to attend 50+ guests. The tables are neat and well placed allowing standard privacy. 

We started off with the Continental Menu, which included a Non-Veg main, a drink of your choice, and a dessert. With a whole lot to choose from, we decided to try out Fish and Chips and the Shepherd's Pie paired with our go to Kingfisher Draught Mug and Screwdriver. It was a typical fish and chips dish, but need to mention the wholesome quantity, which made it worth the price. It was the first time we were trying the Shepherd's Pie, and it was delicious and filling to say the least. Coming to the drinks; we have had better screwdrivers, and too many ice cubes neutralised the vodka effect. Needless to mention the Kingfisher Draught, which never disappoints us. 

10 Downing Street is the perfect mix for people who love slow music and delectable dishes paired with courteous staff and an eye-catching d√©cor.

But could have expected more from the crowd. None were dancing, except the four of us and it was already 10pm. 
Reasonable entry price for female stag, different from the rest being today. The food was good and the service was prompt.
What irked me was the security check during entering, stricter than the Airport services. 
Anyway, the overall experience was okay. 
Thank you for having us. :)

There are some places you go for a treating your pallets, then there are those places where you got for the ambience with a bit spark to your taste buds. The food here is good but not great. It's quite better average but not more. Lasagna was good but again not great, the kebabs were fine, the steak was average but tasty, so was the rest of the things and even the fried ice cream. But that's a bad thing, the ambience and the crowd is the best it hangout with friends, and those special friends. Feels modern yet rustic, the drinks is finely priced, just order some and get the conversation flowing.

The place has an amazing ambience. Their playlist is really good, loved the music being played.

We had a chinese platter and chicken Kababs, both of which were great.

Food n drinks are good too..price is very much reasonable in happy hours otherwise it is lil costly as compared to the quantity of food they serve! The biggest issue that I had at this place is they serve diluted cocktails during happy hours..it's like completely fooling the customers! And the staff should work on their behaviour and manners and learn how to welcome the customers! They should also improve the kind of music they play..it should be good enough to suit the exotic decor of this place.

Dear Management,
It is really shocking and disgusting to receive this sms from a brand so famous and reputed as I hadn't provided the same.
By the way please do let me know about what feedback had been provided by me as recieved from your end when I hadn't actually given one.
As for that matter I really wanted to give a feedback because of the numerous problems I had faced today at 10 Downing Street. Out of the numerous problems I would just like to point out one of them for the time being which was the shocking and extremely rude behaviour of your manager. Would definately like to share further.
Thanks.

I visited 10 Downing Street yesterday to catch up with my friends...We spent around 4 hours in this Pub and man we had an awesome time. The British Pub style decor and dim lights emanated a classic English pub ambiance. We went in the afternoon so the occupancy was moderate.

We ordered a few round of drinks, a prawn starter, Fish and Chips, Shepherd's pie, Garlic Chicken Tikka,¬† Chicken Steak and lemon butter fish from the 399 menu. The food was good specially the Shepherd's pie. The Prawns were fresh and crispy. The only down side were the cocktails and the Domestic wine offered as a part of the 399 menu. The Screw Driver could have been better and the White Wine did not suite my taste bud. Service¬† was prompt.¬†

The pocket pinch was 4000 INR for four people which is more or less the amount we end up spending while visiting any good Pub in Sec V.

I would recommend this place to people who want to chill with friends over good food and well priced alcohol. P.S. Happy hours form 4 PM to 8 PM¬† is a catch.

Easily one of the supreme gastropub in the city.  From the very charming name to quintessential London interior, the place is eminent. 

The ambiance will simply blow you away. Typically British, quintessential London. The music on the background is perfect, the chandelier is entrancing, the lighting is perfect.  The seating is plenty and very comfortable.  Interiors swabbed in red give a very regal outlook. 

The food is a real treat to all the taste pallets. I ordered gum rose sheesha, Smirnoff vodka, chicken stroganoff and veg risotto and a screwdriver. Nothing disappointed me. The risotto perfectly pivoted on cheese, veggies and the sauce. The chillam well prepared and the  flavour  of sheesha was smooth. Drinks were great as well. 

Coming to staff. They're very courteous, friendly and warm. But I want to talk about their attention, or the lack thereof. There were times I was sitting idle waiting for someone to bat an eyes to actually ask for something, despite the joint being otherwise quite empty. 

An improved staff can easily make it bag a five star rating. Apart from that, it is quite definitely an amazing place to be, for an entirely wholesome experience. Food to decor to music to sheesha, just perfect. Must try out!

10 Downing Street is located just opposite to RDB Cinemas in Salt Lake, Sector V, beside Kareem's. We visited this place on our third year anniversary and had a great time to be honest. The place has a wonderful decor, completely going by its name having a good, old English bar in the centre of a large space which lots of seating available. The chairs and the sofa, the brick wall decor, the pictures on the wall gave a fantastic setting and showed that the name isn't just a fancy gimmick to pull people. Coming to the food, 10 Downing Street serves an Executive Lunch offer from 12 AM-4 PM and they have their Happy Hours from 4 PM. So in order to gain benefits from both, we decided to visit the place at around 3 PM. Among the several options we had in our hands for having our Executive Lunch, we chose to have one continental dish and one chinese dish. For our continental dish, we decided to have Chicken BBQ and for our chinese dish, we decided on Grilled Chicken Noodles with Sweet & Sour Chicken as per the recommendation of the staff. In addition to the main dish, you can choose one draught beer/red wine/white wine or soup. We decided to have draught beer and white wine, since red wine was not available. This was served along with a complimentary vanilla scoop with chocolate topping for dessert. This was the first time we were having white wine and both of us did not like its taste. The BBQ Chicken was brilliant to taste. The Grilled Chicken Noodles was also great but I did not like the Sweet & Sour Chicken which I expected to be better. Among the Happy Hours offers, we decided to have Blue Riband and Honey Bee Brandy along with Chilli Chicken. Both of us loved Blue Riband which had a sweet tinge about it. Both of them complemented the starter well. 10 Downing Street also has a good ambience. I liked their collection of music and the playlist which was on. Altogether, it was a day well spent which is what I wanted on this important day of both of our lives.

My first time at this joint and it was really a good experience.went there during happy hours and made good use of it.there were select items of veg and non-veg starters in happy hours category like crispy chilli babycorn,chilli chicken dry,dry chilli paneer..we ordered them and imported beer(not in happy hours category).in the liquor segment blackdog came really cheap(happy hours).. we also had Mojito(cocktail) and it was very nice. Also tasted chilli lamb(a bit hard) prawn vallentino and Chinese platter(really good)..everything tasted beautiful specially prawn and fish..very well cooked and just melted in mouth..In main course we had roti with laal maas (combo) and basmati rice with kadai fish(combo)...its equally good like the starters..overall we had our tummy full and also our soul as it was very fulfilling..for 4 people and after so much we had our bill was 7000/-..(thought it would be around 10k)..so it was within our budget..
‚óè‚óèspecial mention for the decor and ambience..
‚óã‚óã‚óãeven more special is the courteous staff..üëçüëç

Located Just Near RDB Cinemas In Salt Lake Sector V, It Was A Sudden Plan With My Cousins During Watching The Movie That We Are Gonna Hop In Here...  I Quickly Made A Reservation Via Dineout App... 
The Entrance Look Is Beautiful As The Name 10 Downing Street Is Written In Big And Wide... 

The Decor And The Interiors Are Nice... Its Very Spacious And Has Cosy Sofas To Settle In... I Felt Relaxed And Comfy With The Ambience Inside... 

We Ordered Avocado Quesadilla With BarBQ Sauce (Had it for the first time And It Was Really Yummy) 
We Ordered Pasta Arrabiata (one of my sister totally loved it, so do I)
We also Ordered Crispy Chilly Baby Corn ( No doubt, i had one of the best baby corn ever) 
Tried One Kiwi flavour Hookah ( it was so smooth, made it to perfection) 

Well From My Perspective The Food Menu Lacked Variety Eg: You Won't Find Pizza In Here... And I Crave For Pizza... :( :( :(

The Staffs Were Polite And Greeted Us Warmly...Would Love To Visit Again...!

Just tried the corporate lunch. They have good choices in Chinese, Continental and Indian. The food quality is very good. Portion size is descent. Not too much not too less. They should add a starter even if half portion. Staff are okay. Want to visit again to try out some more dishes.

The bar here is either absolutely umstocked or they intentionally drop almost all affordable liquor on slow nights. Dont expect plates to be provided to enjoy your appetizers. You have to eat it out of the plate which it comes in irrespective of the number of people sharing it. No water unless asked for. 2 or 3 times. Decor is great though.

Oh yes..this place is worth a visit..the decor..the ambience will definitely take u back to the 80s..
The staff is courteous..and sevice is quite prompt
The best deal..their happy hours...
Undoubtedly one of the best happy hours i hav spent with them..all for 99
We ordered the sex on the beach..exquisite cocktail..one of my favourites from theirs..
Their caipiroska was good as well..
Mojito being a tad bit sweet for me..
The chicken wings..fried to perfection and sauted in a yummy gravy..loved it thoroughly..
The chicken garlic tikka..yumm again..served with a spicy pudina chatni..loved it thoroughly..
The crispy baby corn was a bit less quantitywise..otherwise okay..
The chilli paneer dry was one hell of a dish..loved the soft cooked paneer sauted in a hot fiery sauce...
The american chicken served with mayonese was crispy and good again..loved it thoroughly..
Overall a hearty meal in those happy hours with booze made my taste buds happy and crave for more.

Any place that meets your need above expectations is definitely where you would like to take your special friends for dinner. They serve almost everything. And mind you, customisation is always available. So good for a vegan as well. The live music by various artists after 8 is just cherry on the top. Must try JW cocktail.

Once you enter the pub you'll just fall in love with the interior.
Went there twice and availed the 99 menu offer each time and its a offer you can refuse.
Booze and starter @99
Chugged glasses of draught beer and munched all the starters.
You might think that for 99 the quality of the food me degrade but trust me its no so.
It is absolutely finger licking good.
I had chili chicken, American style chicken and Chicken wings.
They were utterly delicious.
And the 99 offer is available every day of the week can it get any better.
Best place to spend your evening.
Loved it.

This amazing offer at just rs.315(including tax) which includes a drought beer/cocktail/mocktail/soft drinks/soup, main course of your choice(chinese/indian/continental), dessert(vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce).

VERY dissapointed with the staff though. Despite asking for regular water twice, they failed to promptly serve it. After the main course, they took around 40 minutes to just fetch a simple dessert like vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. The lamb in the continental dish was over-roasted on the edges. All the food items were pretty basic I'd say. 
The decor on the inside was quite aesthetic, which along with the behavior of the manager fetches them a 2 point, rest 1 for food and the offer.

We wanted to go to have good continental cuisine and after checking out its good rating in Zomato, chose to give this place a try. However, we were quite disappointed with the experience we had. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn which tasted okay, the one and only dish which was okay. The grilled fish in lemon butter sauce was bitter to the core, the the chicken shashlik was extremely salty, the cheese chicken lasagna was fairly good, though the garlic breads provided with it were hard. We really expected better from this place.

Visited this beautiful and cozy restro pub on Sunday . The whole look and decor of the place is eye pleasing . Beautiful chandeliers , cute little lamps , wall frames with funny quotes adorn the walls . 

We ordered a white wine , a draught beer and the Screwdriver cocktail for drinks . The cocktail could have been better . 

Fir food , we ordered 

‚ö´Ô∏è Stir Fried Chicken in Babycorn : Below average . Was bland and tasted ' not so good ' . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Garlic Fried Rice : This was good . The flavours were awesome and tasted lovely . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Murgh Nawabi : 4 small and succulent chicken pieces in a bharta kind if gravy was lipsmacking .. went pretty well with the butter naan we ordered. 

‚ö´Ô∏è Chicken Cheese Lasagna : The SHOWSTOPPER . Absolutely BRILLIANT . It was cheesy and had loads of chicken in those lasagna sheets . Exactly the way I like . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Vanilla Icecream : Strictly Average . 

Service : A bit slow . They helped us with water after 2-3 reminders . I hope they work on it soon .

10 Downing Street describes itself as an ‚ÄòEnglish restaurant with a modern twist‚Äô. As we stepped in the dimly-lit passage, we felt of coming in the 'Shakespeare Era'.  It took a few seconds for our eyes to adjust and we found ourselves being ushered into a sprawling 8,000sqft bar. Brown leather bar stools, wood-panelled floors and decorated walls complete the English style restaurant d√©cor.The detailing in the d√©cor has made the ambience more intense. 
We opted for the '299 platters' and found it as appreciable as expected. Especially if you are under the guidance of staffs like Gopal while choosing the items,  it'll act like an given advantage to you. 
The platter was a 3 course set menu which included:
1. Drinks (cocktail/white wine/beer/soft drinks) or soup (from the selected menu)
2. Main course (from Indian/chinese/ continental menu) 
3. Dessert( a big white scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce) 
The items that have literally blown our minds away were:
1. Grilled chicken lasagna - a nice combination of spice and cheese
2. Mutton biryani - flavourful and fragrant enough to make you thirsty for biryani. Highly recommended for all biryani fans
3. Garlic chicken rice
4. Kung pao prawn - another luscious prawn dish after the Asia Kitchen tour. Recommended for sure. 
5. Sunghai fish
As far as the quantity and taste is concerned, the price could not even make a scratch in our pocket. Looking forward to visit again.

The newest addition to the city's pub scene, 10DS sure knows how to win hearts. Set up like an English pub with a classic old school decor, wooden floors and elegant British charm, it has 'elite' written all over. Located in the most peaceful part of the city, it is spread out over a wide area. Right from the moment we entered, their courteous staff welcomed us warmly. We were pretty much impressed by the happening energetic vibe with peppy music playing in the backdrop, and this is not even the best part! They provide great offers when it comes to dining and drinks - so be sure to make most of their happy hours and set lunch menus. We opted for the executive lunch (299+ taxes) which included>>
‚àÜ one drink(beer/cocktail/domestic wine/soft drinks/) or one soup
‚àÜ one main course (can be chosen from Chinese/Indian/Continental menu) and
‚àÜ one dessert (a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate sauce).

Now there were 4 of us, so we had ordered four different set of combinations. The items were >>

‚Ä¢ Spicy grilled chicken lasagna - 5/5 ( Strongly recommended!)
‚Ä¢ Dum Biryani (mutton) - 5/5
I loved this fragrant Biryani made in Dum pukht style with succulent pieces of mutton. Must try for all the Biryani lovers.
‚Ä¢ Kung Pao Prawns
‚Ä¢ Shanghai Fish
‚Ä¢ Two kinds of Fried Rice (Non Veg)
We also tried Hot Basil chicken from the Ala carte section, which was a great started that went well with all the drinks.

Coming to the beverages, we had>>
‚Ä¢ Screwdrivers
‚Ä¢ White Wine
‚Ä¢ Draught Beer

And, we finished off with the ice creams in chocolate sauce. Above all, the feast was filling and the pocket pinch was not as much as we expected it to be, considering the quality and portion sizes. I loved every bit of the time spent here, would surely visit again.

Happening place with a good serving of drinks. The only thing to be a bit sceptical about is the food being served late drinks were faster.Sofas were not available to us we were 4 later we found sofas were given to a group of 4.Cover charges are taken before hand hence u have no choice but to keep sitting there.Dance floor is small. First floor sealed for private party.Waiters unable to hear because of loud music and hardly come asking us the requirement. Smoking zone inside is not available. All over a good place could have been better...

Nice decor and the corporate plan was also pocket friendly though the menu was a bit limited.We had a spaghetti combo and fish n chips, both tasted great.Also we got a choice of drink each followed by vanilla ice cream.The service was good but there was a fly looming over our head during the meal which sort off killed the mood Though the needed cutlery was provided to us in a jar on the table the knives were missing.

Food and drinks : Our main motive to visit TDS was to get drunk and dance till we last. The music was good, better than Pour House. The food was very impressive. We ordered the Non veg platter and it was finger licking good!
The booze was good too!

Ambience :  HUGE.

Pocket Pinch : May burn a tiny whole in your pocket, but it's worth it :)

We went there on a weekday, after office around 5. We got the happy hour discount.. 1 + 1 beer.. we also ordered chicken wings to go with the beer.. and another starter whose name I just can't seem to remember.. initially the place was totally empty.. but as time went on, it started getting packed.. the place is literally huge.. you can either sit at the bar or take a table.. food-wise, the chicken wings were good.. it's a bit on the costlier side but that's fine.. only regret.. there wasn't a proper dance floor available..

I can only rave about this place. Sudden afternoon plans ended up here. Ambience as so talked about a British themed wooden upholstered spick and spam place with very little to complain of. Only that the upstairs part which has these plush relaxing sofas was sealed off for a private party which this place is becoming a pro at hosting.
 We would have liked better seats but one side appeared unattended to and we were requested to seat in a particular area.
Opted for their set menu offer arriving before there happy hours at 4. We had a chicken bbq combo and a lamb steak combo.
Its a great deal package. Where at 299 plus taxes we got a choice of drink each ( soup and other options also available) , our main course with a helping of buttered, flavored rice and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce each.
At least 30ml of liquer was given to each if us. The chicken bbq was quite delicious with its sauce. The lamb pieces were succulent. Sauce could be better. Dessert was simple. The ambience was conducive for a great adda, no doubt british style and the pocket pinch was only INR 630. I should say these combo s are great.
Missed the music scene.
Will go back again later. We were well looked after but service could be slightly better.
Smoking zone, bouncers as known are there. Highly recommended place. Upscale with low pocket pinch.

I must say this is one beautiful place, inside out. The decor is truly classy, with good music and great food.
(Please note this review is based on the first time I went there in 2016.)

The food was still good, sheesha was dense, and of course the ambiance was still classy.

We had ordered some Pan flavored sheesha, Veg Penne Alfredo, Chilli Garlic Babycorn and Virgin Mojito.

Food - 9/10

Posh interiors.. good place to get your dates here. Its big in size which gives nice n different seating arrangements. The fancy bar in the centre of the floor and under the opulent chandelier looked fabulous .......... though I wasn't  highly impressed with the food n drinks. I n my friends too, felt the ratio/amount of alcohol in cocktails were too less. So it was disappointing for us because we were paying a lot for those. Staffs weren't up to the mark if compared to the ambience. I don't think il be back there again.

Great decor, too noisy, boring crowd. Okayish DJ and dance floor. Bar menu slightky expensive compared to the location and non premium crowd it pulls -mostly office folks or students. Food is okay. They did not mess up the dishes we ordered- non veg platter, thai rice with thai green chicken curry, baked basa fish in lemon butter, spaghetti Bolognese. The ladies night was a joke where they served 2 30 mls drinks for free choices -vodka shots , vodka , gin , white rum. Ordered there long island ice tea. Pretty okay too. Over priced yet again.

Located right beside Kareem's and close to Barbeque Nation in Sec V, and designed to look like a quaint,  classic old-fashioned British pub - with its wood-finished interior decor, brick-styled walls, dim lamps in sconces, ornamental chandelier, musician statuettes etc. - 10 Downing Street has become a popular classy lounge for corporate parties, birthday bashes, hangout for friends or perhaps even family lunches, serving Indian, Chinese and Continental delicacies at surprisingly reasonable rates.

The ambiance is very soothing and relaxed, with a plush air of sophistication mixed with hip and happening beats of dance tracks in the background, except perhaps a few noisy people celebrating a birthday which does not however mar one's gastronomic experience.

They also serve drinks, hookahs and regularly host live musical events.

They offer various combos under the Indian, Continental and Oriental sections. For each section one has to choose one or two items from the main course under veg/non-veg sections (of good long lists of a variety of delectable offerings) accompanied with either a mocktail/cocktail/domestic wine/soft drink/soup. The dessert is complimentary for all.
From the Indian menu one has to choose a main course item (like a paneer/chicken or mutton dish or any other of one's choice) along with a naan/roti/kulcha/rice item and one's choice of either drink or soup. The Chinese fare offers a combination of veg/non-veg rice/noodles with a chicken/fish/prawn/veg item coupled with the drink or soup. Same goes for the Continental as well. The prices of the veg and non-veg items vary slightly.

We opted for the Mutton Rogan Josh, Roti and Steamed Rice from the Indian course teamed with a fantastic white wine, all for just Rs 299 (non-veg section), and Szechuan Noodles with Stir Fried Chicken with Babycorn and Mushroom from the Oriental section (also non-veg) for a similar price, paired with a kind of tasteful soup with bits and pieces of shredded chicken swimming in the light gravy. The dessert consisted of scoops of vanilla ice cream drizzled with gooey chocolate sauce.

The noodles were extremely delicious and bit spicy, but considerably of very good taste than served in many other reputed places. The mutton and stir-fried chicken were light but with less salt and spices. The ice cream was good too but nothing out of the ordinary. 

Overall we were highly satisfied with food and ambiance but some major drawbacks were noted:

Firstly, though they provided cutlery like spoons, forks and knives in a jar on the table along with paper napkins, two spoons were found unwashed.
Secondly and more importantly, service is quite slow and not good. The attendants are languid with a laid-back and casual attitude and lack in professional proficiency. In most good eateries servers enquire whether to provide regular or mineral water immediately upon being seated but at 10 Downing Street we had to ask THEM to bring us water. Not only such slack service, they even did not bother to refill our glasses with water (the likes of which I have encountered at Blue Nile and C/o. Bangali) which is taken care of with swift efforts at other well-maintained restaurants in the city. The dessert had been forgotten as well and once again we had to ask them to bring it to us. Though their behaviour is polite and courteous, one of theirs was arrogantly irksome.

They fail to manage such a big place and take care of guests at each table once the rush comes along.
The professionalism of the attendants needs to be improved, considering the pub is a well-known food hub in Sec V.

Would have given a 3.5 rating owing to the poor service but decided for a 4 because of the good food, specially the noodles that won my foodie palate and heart. üôÇ

The food and drink is quite tasty in 10 Downing Street. But they are on costly side. Been to these place twice with my colleagues. Thursday night is karaoke night. Wednesday is ladies special.

Another happening place in sector V area. Frequent to this place. Food is delicious, Hookah is good, and dance floor attracts a nice crowd. Can work on their hospitality and crowd management. I had given 4.0 in an earlier review but was compelled to reduce it due to a recent visit.
The food quality have detoriated and they do not have suffice staff to handle a big crowd even though our visit was pre informed
I had ordered Lamb in red wine sauce, which could have been better prepared.

Back reviewing after a long time..... I don‚Äôt visit this side very often but this place was shown to me by my bff and I must say it‚Äôs class apart! Loved the decor and the ambiance! Perfect for a quiet drink after a busy day or if u like classy dates! The cocktail selections and the happy hour menu is very reasonable and attractive! I love the old grandfather clock they have! My tip: must try the nachos here, we finished 3 plates!!!!!

Went there today for the first time. As me and my friend both had an almost full tummy after lunch we planned to keep our order minimal. We opted for happy hour menu and ordered a plate of galric chicken tikka and another plate of chilli chicken , my friend prefers alcohol so opted for beer and I kept my drinks to one sex on the beach and one mocktail.
Garlic chicken tikka was nicely prepared, soft , perfect amount of spices added...We ended up ordering one more plate of it. Chilli chicken was crisp and was really a good combination with drinks we opted for. We asked for the person at our service, Kaushik to suggest one good mocktail of watermelon flavour. He prepared one customised mocktail of watermelon which was extremely good in taste and I was more than happy that I asked him to which he came out with the perfect solution. I owe him a Thanks.
Very nice and cosy ambiance , beautiful decore and lighting, amazing service, amazing crowd,good food. Looking forward to visit again sometime soon.

i really want to give more than 5 star because of what i faced today. I forgot my card at the counter and left the restaurant, but the staff(don't know the name) ran after me to return me the card. I really want to thanks for it.

Apart from the above the food quality, ambience, staff' behaviour, all deserves a five star rating only.

A great place indeed,not to mention the fabulous decor but it limits and end to it only. Key points:
1. A great misbehaving lady owner who doesnt knows how to speak to customer.
2. Management is zero. We did a billing of more than 8k just during the cover charge entry but ordered inside a bill of may be a little extra of few hundreds but the great management team knocked us twice while going out inspite of showing the paid bill.
3. They claim to have some dj nights nd all in the entry of the place but there is absolutely nothing once we enter. However if they charge an amount per head in entry to the bar itself , a person ecpects to enter and use the dance floor too..but no boys are allowed if not accompained by a girl which I found completely iilogical. They should have mentioned us durinng entry itself.

I have nothing much to say about this place after such a bad incident with customers. This place should close down asap to save the money wnd wasted time of every valuable customer.

10 Downing is really winning hearts in kolkata with its mind blowing ambiance and music & like its name it does have a English touch. From the exterior i did not imagine it to be so big and spacious but it is humongous and two storied.For once one can enjoy without being pushed and without having to wait or as a matter of fact without sweating like an animal. 

My husband took me here on my birthday and i had a blast. The place was bang on and most importantly no sleezy crowd. We ordered the non veg downing spl platter i.e the TDS basket which was yum and had a good variety consisting of fish chicken mutton etc. They were all good except the sheek kebab which was very dry & crumbly. The wings were delicious. Next we had the tandoori platter which basically consists of chicken tandoor items . They were cooked very well but nothing new or innovative. For drinks apart from whisky i tried the peach margarita which was a disaster. It not only tasted bad but also lacked alcohol content. Next we had the mojito which was normal and finally had the malibu shot which i felt was the best of all. The place really stands out ambience wise but food wise it is a downer. I wish they put more effort in creating yummy dishes. Good food with good alcohol and music is all party lovers need to get into the groove. My rating is mostly based on ambience and partly on food which i enjoyed gorging on.

Special mention-The manager (a lady) was a wondeful person and very attentive to the guests.

Price wise the place is expensive bit considering the overall ambience i would say its worth it. The staffs needs more polishing. Over smart behaviour will land them in trouble. Hope management takes note of this.

Even a 5 star rating seems less for this place!
Thoroughly impressed with almost everything regarding 10 Downing Street!
With a lavish seating arrangement and a decor set to mesmerise, this place stole my heart the moment I set foot inside.

Coming to food, we had barbeque lamb chops, chicken wings, chicken garlic tikka and American style chicken.
The barbeque lamb chops was cooked to absolute perfection. The lamb was soft, succulent and extremely well marinated. And the gravy was just finger licking delicious!(No kidding!) This was the best lamb chops I've had in quite some time! Highly recommended!

The rest of the items we had ordered were actually from their 99 menu ( valid from 4pm-7pm).
The staff is friendly and the ambience was surreal! They had a brilliant playlist this evening comprising of some of my favourite songs of all time!

Ambience. Dreamlike.
Food. Finger licking good.
Playlist. Brilliant.
And the cherry on the cake was the bill! ( Courtesy: Happy hours!)

If you're in sector 5 and looking for a place to hang out for a couple of hours with someone special or your gang, this is your place! Absolutely MUST visit!

I know I'm eagerly looking forward to my next visit! :)

I‚Äôm writing a review for this place after visiting it two times. The first time I went with my friends for a late evening catch-up with small appetizers. We ordered buttermilk fried chicken, which I found very dry (not recommended) and chicken wings in barbecue sauce, this one my friends enjoyed, although I‚Äôm pretty sure I can make a slightly juicier version of this at home. The ambience of this place is rather nice, its got a cozy ring to it, and thus I decided to visit it again with a gang of ladies for lunch. To our delight, they had a 339/- + taxes menu which offers a drink/soup, a main course and a dessert. For that amount the quantity was pretty good. We ordered two helpings of continental lamb, one helping of fish in lemon butter sauce and vegetarian Chinese food. Both the lamb preps were dry. The capers with the butter in the fish made it too salty for our taste buds and the vegetarian food was ordinary. For dessert they gave us a vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce (which wasn‚Äôt hot-woefully). Our waiter was also not very helpful when we were choosing our menu, considering it was a day which was a holiday for the city, I wouldn‚Äôt really blame him. The concierge was very nice though and the hostess, like always looked stunning. Would probably return.

I have been before just for hookah and beer but after today's food experience, I can't rate them under 5.... From Cocktails to mocktails and from chinese foods to North Indian... All are good... Mindblowing...!!

It's already famous for it's ambience. Nice classy soothing ambience with perfect sections for food and separate for hookah is really commendable. Bar counter is between the restaurant. They had a dj console at one corner.

Strawberry mocktails and litche mocktails was really good. In North Indian food Kebab platters, dal makhni and kofta was really good. We have ordered thai curry too along with fried rice and veg chow with Schezwan side dish of veggies was really good. Even love the chinese platter where crispy chilli potato hits the taste bud with noodle balls...!! Thumbs up..

Have been to this place a few times now, and was always very fond of the decor. It gives me memories of taj Bengals old coffee shop, the stained glass panels, leather furniture, geometric floor, all have been used very tastefully to crate a nice ambiance.

The food has always been nice here. I have preferred the Indian over the Chinese though. The service is nice and friendly.

The veg and nonveg kebab platter is recommended.
Both in quantity and quality, it is total value. One must also try the bhuna gosht, which also is well cooked.

They serve main courses as a complete meal, and one does not need to order ssditinal bread. That is an added advantage for the corporate sector.

Only one little problem  the tables for 4 are really small for people eating a proper meal.

Cheers. Overall a good meal yet again!

I visited this place during Pujas & despite the heavy rush the service was efficient & fast. The place is huge & effortlessly beautiful with a 10/10 ambience. Coming to the food, their Chinese Platter is great - it comes with options ranging from chicken to fish to prawns.The other items I tried here were both mix sauce & white sauce pasta along with chicken biryani. The pasta was good & quantity of the dishes were appealing. Hoping to come here again pretty soon.

The place is huge. There is a bar section in the middle of the pub in the shape of a square which is effectively managed. A dj corner is dedicated  just beside the dance floor to light up the evening. There is a seating area in the upper storey of the pub as well.
We visited last week on a Saturday evening and were asked to pay 2000 as cover charge for a couple. There are a lot of staff on the floor to take care of their customers which is a plus point. After soaking in the lively atmosphere of loud music by Dj and dim lights we decided to ponder over the menu.
We ordered a Teen Paan Shisha and a Crispy Mushroom. The flavor of the shisha was mild and the coal lasted for a longer duration. 
The Mushroom dish was very crispy with spring onions garnished over the dish adding to the taste.
Moving on, we also ordered Veg Nachos and Au Gratin. 
The Nachos were very Tasty and the mayonnaise was evenly spread till the bottom of the bowl. The preparation was very neat and combination of tomato, onion, chilly and pulses took the taste to a different level. 
The Au Gratin was a cheesiest one i have ever tried. I would recommend each foodie to try this. Very nicely baked with Cheese and olive garnish adding a wow to every bite of it. I was highly satisfied with the food after having this dish.
Finally to make up our cover charges we ordered Fried Fish. 
Yes we were surprised that all the above dishes were covered within the cover charge. Hence for the excellent food, outstanding taste, reasonable price and unforgettable experience don't forget to visit this as your next food stop.

I've been to this place once before. Didn't think much of it then and I had thought it was overpriced too. This time I was slightly reluctant to visit again but when my cousins insisted, I had to give in and I am so glad we ended up going here. It had a decent crowd even on a Monday evening. It's easy to locate but finding cabs at night from the area is slightly difficult and the cabs are almost always at a surge here. 

The ambiance is great. Nice music, dimly lit, good decor, very good and chill vibes. We ordered a teen paan rose hookah and on our request they made it lightly flavoured. The food is lip smacking. We ordered the Chinese Platter and the Tandoor Platter. Both were delicious. The Chinese Platter had 4 types of starters and the Tandoor one had 5 types of starters! We liked the Crispy Chilli Baby Corn so much that we ordered a separate portion. We then ordered a Penne Alfredo and Spaghetti Aglio Olio. The Alfredo Pasta was great, the Aglio Olio could have been better. The spaghetti should have been softer. Lastly, we ordered a Dal Makhani with Indian breads and a Fried Rice with Chilly Paneer. The Fried Rice was good and nicely flavoured. None of the food items disappointed and I was quite impressed. We had to stick to non-alcoholic beverages and we tried the Tango one, Pub Special, and Strawberry Mojito. The Pub Special was nice and so was the Mojito. All in all, it was a great visit. I am sure I will come again the next time I'm in town for a chill evening. :)

This place has a very rich crowd presence. It's one of the best places for a Friday or a Saturday night. You can drop in with your colleagues or friends for a drink or two. I visited this place on a Friday evening and found the DJ play in full swing. I ordered a Veg Chinese platter and a mixed sauce pasta which were both good. However the quantity of the platter was very very less. We ordered a hookah which was choking all the time. Overall it is a decent place but a bit too overrated .

1: Ambiance 10/10
2: Service 9.5/10 
3: Music 10/10 
I have been here in the noon time around 3 with offer of 299rs valo from 12pm to 4pm.
Everything is perfect. 
The only thing it needs to focus on is that they should come up with more desserts in the 299rs offer.And the mocktail needs to improve a bit.
Other than all this the food is good.
Really a good place to hangout with friends.
Would like to visit the place once again n explore more about it.

In food we had the the TDS basket, and there was a egg item which surprisingly was the best ! We also tried fried rice and chili chicken , kebabs and some veg appetisers which were also quite good. 
The Drinks were also quite reasonably priced. 
Overall, a great pub!

Excellent ambiance,spacious and perfect sound system. Curious why I then rated only 3??!! Here comes the twist.We entered in the happy hour and they have a separate menu @all 99/ for happy hours which includes alcohol,food as well as cocktails.Sounds great...we jumped onto the menu and planned to order as fast as we could because it was already 6:40 and happy hour billing closes on 7 p.m. sharp. To our utter surprise they said that they can't take big orders on alcohol..they can only serve 30 ml in glass and 30 ml spare for each person at a go...if you want to order more you need to consume your alcohol fast...faster...!!I never experienced before that in happy hours if you really want to be happy enough then you have to consume your alcohol faster !! I don't know if I am being the only one who experienced and felt the same thing but this took out the joy from a festive celebration mood totally and we completed our order and headed for another destination.
Nevertheless I am really happy with your sound system but might not visit soon because in happy hours I want to be really happy,elsewhere.

This makes for a good lunch/post work place. Full marks for the ambience, decor and service. They play good music and have live performances on few days of the week. The food is mostly pub fare, though the chicken I tried was dry and overdone. Nonetheless, you have a long list to choose from.

Definitely going back for a revisit.

Opposite RDB cinema

This was my second visit to 10 Downing Street (TDS)
Earlier I went in for a hour or less just to sip on some mocktail and hookah with a college friend of mine. We wanted to try some more foods but due to lack of time it was'nt possible then. So on my bestfriend's birthday which was on 16 October, we both thought to visit the place.

‚û°Ambience : TDS is a place of class. Their interior is their USP. All done in a royal manner, the seats are mostly of leather and wood.
Chandelier to the Bar to the seating arrangements, everything speaks class and elegance.
The ambience will give you the feel of old English Pub. The place is quite huge and spacious.

‚û°Food : Coming to the food, we tried Teen Paan Shisha which was good.
Non Veg Tandoor Platter which consisted of 8 chicken piece and 2 Fish piece. Pieces were soft, tender and juicy. The platter was amazing and lip-smacking. We also tried our hand on beer as it was my bestiee's birthday. We ordered Kingfisher Lager (330ml)
For main course we ordered Butter Chicken, Naan And Masala Kulcha. Food was Okay.

‚û° Service : Service was decent. Waiters were friendly and courteous. Waiters were asking for ID proof from youngsters ordering hookah and alcohol which was quite strange because no other place had done this before and it was my second visit, earlier i didn't face any such issue but nevertheless after confirming they provided us with the hookah and alcohol.

Overall, a very nice place and a must visit. Kinda expensive for the quantity they provide.

Went on my birthday with my friends and it was a great place to celebrate it with good food, superb ambience and a rocking DJ.¬†

We went during happy hours in which we enjoyed a few drinks along with Chicken Wings which are to die for. In food , we had Chicken Cheese Lasagna which was cheesy and flavorful, Chicken Pepper Steak which was served along with some buttered rice and beans and Nawabi Chicken with Naan.

The DJ plays such rocking music that you are forced to get on your feet and onto the dance floor.

The only negative point that I found was that the service was not upto the mark. You have to keep waiting for the servers to come around which is not that frequent.

Overall, I had a great time and enjoyed a lot. :)

The place is awesome. If you want to enjoy good food with some loud rock/pop/EDM musics around, this is a perfect destination for you.Docoration is beyond good,you will feel a classic antique test in its decoration.Let's talk about food,we ordered chicken fries,prawn double cheese fried balls, they were toothsome.Savoury of these food will urge you to visit the place again.Smoking room is available there with some witty,intelligent quotes on the wall.So over all it's a very awesome experience.If you are a pub goer give it a try.

Visited there on Soshti night this year and spent some wonderful time. The ambience was pretty good with some of my favourite tracks playing accompanied by some lip smacking starters. It was definitely a fun party ambience. We had ordered one Tandoor platter and one Chinese platter along with drinks. Both the platters were equally good; the kababs were juicy n tender and so do the chinese ones. Planning to visit again soon.

This is a combined review of two separate visits to the place. They have this odd system where you have to keep your water bottle outside, I don't understand the logic behind it. Anyway, my peeves aside, we had beer, bacardi rum, Bailey's Irish Creme, LIIT, Crispy chili babycorn, BBQ chicken wings on our visits. The booze is fairly pricey, but not too much. The wings are tasty, juicy and tender with crunch in just the right amount. Same goes for the babycorn, good and in ideal small sized nibbles. Though we felt the babycorn could've been fried a bit more. They make a good LIIT.

There always loud music going on and karaoke on some nights. They have this English style bar with high stools in the middle, which is a great concept. They serve shishas which we felt could be served in a separate section.

The only reason why I wanted to visit this place is because the name sounds so much like 221B Baker Street....and to our pleasure the interior did not disappoint us....It resembles a typical ancient English pub with dim lights and great music playing in the background....The sitting arrangement extends over a large area with a proper bar in the centre....At the farthest end there is a corner resembling a cosy English sitting room with comfortable sofas,fireplace and walls decorated like a bookshelf which is ideal for some classy  photoshoot....

The veg and nonveg combo meals are a total value for money.... It includes: 
1) One soft drinks/beer/wine/soup
2) One main course- Which has the following options: one plate biryani/one side dish with Indian breads
3) One dessert- They were serving only vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce
But we felt the quantity was not sufficient for one individual so we had to order 3 combo meals which was enough for the 2 of us....For the 3 main course we chose 2 plates of biryani and 1 chicken tikka masala which was served with 2 roti....All the dishes were very well prepared....

In addition to everything their superfriendly and helpful staff made our visit to this place even more enjoyable....

What a place! So in love with 10 Downing Street! ‚ù§
Two of us went there and even on a Saturday night they had tables to accommodate us! They have special DJ on Saturdays and man, were the songs good! You will love the ambience if you're in the mood to groove or just enjoy your drink with some best buddies.. Of course don't visit on a Saturday if you're not into loud music. We ordered vodka shots with 7Up and a pitcher of the cocktail Long Island Tea üçπ along with Schezwan Lamb. Everything cost us around 2500 INR.. The cocktail was good and the Schezwan lamb tasted amazing! With the alcohol hitting little and the great music, our mood was set to perfection! The staff was also very attentive and lively!
All hail 10 downing street! Definitely gonna pay a visit again!

I have been generous with my rating of 1.5! There are several things that went wrong. 
To begin with AC was blown to it's lowest temperature. It's becomes so discomforting that you would not even feel your fingers. And instead of cocktails/mocktails you would earnestly seek for a hot and warm drink. A major disconnect for wanting to have coffee in a PUB 
Secondly Continental menu for example Chicken Spicy Grilled Lasagna and Chicken Steak are no where close to what it should be. Seems like someone was on an experimentive spree. Sourness (the kind you get when you have vinegar) overpowers Lasagna. The intense feeling of different textures in Lasagna was a miss. While Chicken Steak, could be beat described as mutton Curry and rice. Steak came without being asked "how would you like your steak" + no steak knife. I am surprised with the layout of dish. I was bewildered when chicken steak came dipped in sauce made of garlic and rice portion tempered with garlic cloves and pepper. Left a distasteful bitter taste
What redeemed my taste buds was Thai Curry! But the damage had been done by Lasagna and Chicken Steak.
Just not sure if food pulls crowd to this place or just the hype of this place?

Food was good, but I was highly disappointed with the inhouse DJ out there.
Choice of song was very poor and didnt liked the mixing of songs. But yes interior was too good.. so good place to hang with your frnds.

Yesterday 30th September we went to visit the pub and at the entrance a lady was in the reception.  We were 2 married couple and 2 guys.  First the lady told us we have a premium seat beside dj but you have to pay 15000 and 10000 is the cover charge. We informed her we don't need premium seat and we are fine with normal seat. Then she told her 1000 per person as cover charge but no seat is available and we forwarded our credit card for payment.  Then she said pay 10000 as cover charge for 6 people we will provide normal seat for you. We asked them are you people bargaining with us and then she gave a very rude reply sir if you pay 10000 we will provide you seat else I cannot ensure you anything for 6000. 

It was a very bad experience for us and will not recommend anyone for this pub. Specially the rude behavior of the lady at last. 

My experience is exactly what happened with us and there is not even 1% masala.

A calm and nice place to chill out with your buddies.
Went today during daytime and the rush was average.
We ordered Johnnie walkers Scotch, B54 & B52 (two of their in-house speciality I suppose). B52 they serve you with a lit of üî• on top. In my case they were kind enough to do it for me since I was new to it. But it's really worth trying. I mean at first instance you might fear at trying but once you do it'll be nothing as such. Like a normal tequila shot.

Starters : Perri perri babycorn was not good. Didn't like it at all :(

Regular hukka (mint flavour) is nice. For veg. folks having brunch as well, Palak Paneer can be given a try.

Overall : 0.5 deducted for slow service, but the place has good environment. Would prefer to go in evening to enjoy live music as well.

Good luck !!

In short 10 D, a new sensation in the city. A club, a lounge, a pub all u can say, located in sector 5 with a classy decor. A pub with a london themed serves great food, great ambience and quite a big space. We visited the place in the Ostomi Night and had a great fun, though the music is bit on a lower side.
Overall a full party place and will become a most popular in future.

A good & uber cool, spacious pub which shows that Kolkata is slowly coming of age. They have happy hours from 4-7 pm & it is located at the corenof Sector V, Salt Lake. The chilli chicken was super duper tasty & but the sisha was not cool even we ordered Icy Mint (I know how Icy Mint tastes like, I have had them in Dubai, London, Abu Dhabi) & the Icy Mind flavor was nowhere near to it. But the attendant was arguing unnecessarily. Anyway, would request the administration to see to it the attendants don‚Äôt argue without knowing the actual taste just for the heck of selling it.

The service is quick, the food was great and the '99' menu is worth it. I had a hookah, one draught beer, crispy chilly baby corn and a long island iced tea. The total bill was of around ‚Çπ1100.

So we went for an office lunch to this place. Ambience was terrific. The place had a separate smoking zone which is highly required after all those pints of beers and wine. 

Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Cheese Lasagna, Shepherd's pie, screw driver and blue lagoon in cocktails.

The Chicken Cheese Lasagna is a must try for all the food lovers out there. The mouth watering combo of the two most resplendent product is surely gonna make you jolt back to desperation of craving more of it and fill you tummy with sumptuousness. 

Shepherd's pie was a good one. The lamb was well cooked. 

Cocktail suggestion would be the screw driver rather than the blue lagoon. 

Coming to the restaurant experience, the staff members greeted us well and were attentive enough to meet our needs and queries. Food was well served and the awesome music was an add on to the splendid dishes.

Overall a lovely experience. 4/5 ^_^

It has been a long time since I went to decent restaurant and I can say it with great sense of satisfaction that today I have been to one. The place looks really good from the inside with music playing in low volume and lights are illuminated just enough to see the person's face sitting opposite of you beautifully while having a nice lunch. The quality of the food is also good, and on top of that it's really affordable. What we had was one Chinese platter, one fresh lime soda, one screwdriver, one lamb bourguignon and one lamb stake. The platter was of course the surprise among all the things we ordered today. The only thing that the place can work better is on the menu. The number of dishes can be increased without changing the old ones. But all said and done, I would love to visit this place again real soon. I thank the people of the restaurant for today's beautiful afternoon. Keep it up.

I had gone there with my friend. The ambience is awesome. It really brings you to the Victorian era. For the prices, the quality of the food was a bit disappointing. The Chinese platter was very delicious(it contained baby corn, a particular type of dim sum, spring rolls and one more thing). However, their 269 offer of a chinese mains (rice or noodles) and a vegetable was not very delicious, and certainly not a restaurant quality dish. The Hunan vegetable was largely tasteless, with nothing except soy sauce in it, and very large chunks of seemingly raw vegetables. In a word, it was tasteless. The presentation was no good either. Now, of course, we were under 18 so we went in the afternoon just to have some food, but I think if someone goes for drinks with their friends, or for a late night party it would be a good choice.

This one has a setting of an old English pub with beautiful decor, a bar counter in the centre and is spacious. It has queen sized sofas to sit around with your loved ones while enjoying your drink and food. 
I went with a group of friends and we ordered :
1. watermelon mojito - I love watermelon mocktails and this one was a good choice.
2. Kiwi fizz- had and typical taste of the kiwi fruit and the drink was very refreshing.
3. Hot basil chicken - tender chicken pieces cooked with basil leaves and a unique sauce to make it taste even better.
4. Lemon garlic Fish-  soft and juicy fish pieces served with a dip and veggies. Great to taste.
5. Lamb chops- not many places can cook lamb chops perfectly, but this one has one of the best lamb chops I have ever tasted. I loved the soft and juicy lamb with the sauce. Commendable taste.
6. Downing special kebabs- this dish has kebabs, juicy and soft served with a dip and 10D has it's unique touch to make it taste top notch.
7. Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce - perfectly grilled fish, tender and juicy served with lemon rice and veggies. A perfect meal.
8. Shanghai prawn served with mushroom noodles- I love prawns and I had to order this. This has Chinese noodles and well-cooked prawn and a perfect combination for lunch.
9. Chicken pepper steak- chicken steak cooked in pepper, served with veggies and rice. One of the best chicken steaks I have tried. 
 This place gets full marks in terms of ambience and service. They play good music in the background and will make you groove with the food and drinks. The quantity and quality of food is very good. The price is a little on the higher side but that's totally worth it. A good place to visit with friends and loved ones.

Wow what a place in Kolkata. Well as the name suggest it is high and lit . It is situated at Ground Floor, PS Srijan Corporate Park, Sector 5, Salt Lake.¬†

Well if you are looking for a place to go clubbing then this place had to be the right place for you.
Been here two times, once during day and once during night. Both the times experienced very different types of atmosphere. During day it was calm and peaceful, during night it was wild.Amazing atmosphere, great drinks, great food. The menu is so exciting. The finger foods, kebabs, and continental menu you would expect mouth watering hole.
 ¬†You'll Feels like heaven on the plate. Seriously never disappoints.

WE had:

DRINKS:

1) Watermelon Mohito : ¬†
Fresh watermelon, lime, mint and soda make the perfect summer afternoon.

2) Tango & Cash :¬†
It's just awesome and refreshing.

3) Kiwi Fizz :
It's light and freshing, perfect for hot summer day. I love it.

Coming to the Starters:
                    

DOWNING SPECIAL KEBABS is the one to die for. The chicken is so soft and tender that "IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH". ¬†

HOT BASIL CHICKEN was a bit of a let down, that flavor you generally expect in a hot basil chicken was missing. The covering outside the chicken was not uniform, and you could taste the lumps which killed the whole thing. But it's good.
                    

LAMB CHOPS tasted good.¬†

LEMON GARLIC FISH :¬†
Nothing quite brings out the delicate taste of fresh white fish like the combination with a lemon-garlic sauce.¬†

And

CHEESE KURKURE :
This is a super crisp aloo stuffed kurkure with a crusty outer layer and soft aloo stuffed with cheese.
                    

Main Courses:

CHICKEN PEPPER STEAK was really good, steak itself was delicious and the pepper and chicken elevated it's flavors to whole new level. Chicken was nicely prepared, the gravy was okay and the mashed potatoes were out of this world.

SHANGHAI PRAWN served with MUSHROOM NOODLES & BAMBOO RICE dish again was extremely good.
                    

Was pretty satisfied with the quality of food and service. Would love to go back again to try out their other dishes.

I went there on the special occasion of ‚Äúmahalaya‚Äù. Office team. 
Before coming I asked to know if there is any buffets?as this culture is overspreading everywhere. They said, they have combo meal at just Rs. 299 for non veg and Rs. 269 for veg. We decided to go as the combo seems cost effective, as we didnot want to spend much before ‚Äúpuja‚Äù. 
Interesting menu on Combos. A bit confusing.
We ordered 2 chicken cheese lasagne, 1 lamb with some black bean sauce with rice  and 1 noodle with chicken, that I have forgotten the name and one veg combo. I started clicking photos through my phone as per demands of colleagues as ‚ÄúThe Decor‚Äù of inside is extremely well. The food was very tasty and also very heavy. Ok, as you already know that I love to drink, this restaurant offers a drink per combo and also an ice cream as dessert as complementary. I took 2 dishes, so a beer that day actually gave me a kick. Loved that place. Hope I will visit soon to get a dig onto their normal menu offerings.

Location : RDB boulevard, sector 5.

Decor & Ambience : 10D's decor resembles an old school English pub. The bar area is magnificent with Chandelier and all, the seating arrangements are beautiful with the sofas and all.

Food :

* Lamb chops : Beautifully cooked. Flavour on point. I quite liked this.

*Lemon garlic fish : The dish was nice and fresh and a perfect accompaniment for alocholic beverages.

* Chicken noodles : One of the best noodles I've had in a pub. The quality is top notch. The noodles had huge chunks of chicken in it and exotic veggies. I loved it.

*Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce : The fish was nicely cooked. The sauce was on point. The rice and veggies along with the fish will fill you up.

10 Downing Street should be on your party list if you're anywhere near Sector 5.

This place was in my bucket list & bang on I got an opportunity to visit!
Situated in the hot and happening part of Sector V, 10 Downing Street brings to you the posh and aristocratic feel of an upbeat London pub, with interiors and d√©cor being classy enough that it can easily be mistaken for a fine dine. The bar takes the centre stage as groovy, in-trend music tracks take you on a swing to Tomorrowland.

Starting with the drinks, we went for non-alcoholics. Watermelon Mojito and Tango & Cash were the picks of the evening.
Time to munch on some appetizers. I was delighted to find that they serve Honey Sesame Crispy Lotus Stem, as it is available at few little places in Kolkata. I also had Stuffed Mushrooms, which were piping hot and delectable.

For the main course, we ordered Basil Pesto Pasta and Cottage Cheese Steak. I personally preferred the steak because of its exceptional barbeque sauce gravy. Definitely recommended.

This is one of the finest places to chill after work. A good food and good alcohol menu is hard to find. 10 Downing Street offers you just that.

A nice place to be on a Friday eve.

This place serves as a good waterhole. And when you have a group of buddies this can turn out to be an amazing place.

The ambience and theme is really nice. The messages in the men's washroom are witty however the ones in the smoking room are gender biased; not good.

I like the way the waiters dress; retro types - nice.

Didn't get to eat much as Kingfisher draught kept me busy. Open till 1 'o' clock on Fridays.

The masala peanuts dish is nice.

However, CORNITOS is not my favourite brand as the nachos is thick and heavy. 10 D, avoid CORNITOS, go for TASTILO or INOX instead. Yeah, 10 D uses CORNITOS.

LIIT was nice as well.

PS. Don't take the last beer order at 12:40am if the plan is to shove people out at 1:00am. 3 ltrs in 20 mins is a lot of burden. We were kicked out of the place at 1'o' clock with disposable beer glasses in hand.

Want to Experience Old London pub in Kolkata!!! or Wanna Relive The Movie Sherlock Holmes then you are at the right place. Pubs in kolkata have been a regular need among the youngsters for some quality time and hangout. Its not only about hangout but also about having some lip smacking food with the taste of wine and fine dine. Salt Lake Sector 5 have been giving the city the best of best¬†
places for a experience of your life time.¬† And 10 Downing Street is just located near the RDB Cinemas.
Its has a huge ambiance with some classy decor and interiors and classy music offcourse. As mentioned above this place takes you to the movie Sherlock Holmes where you get to see the same kind of attire this place has. But its not only about the decor or ambiance but the service has been also a reason to talk about. Men were quick on their feet and listening things properly.

The journey to the 10 downing street went as it was expected...

1. Kiwi Fizz : A simple combination of sparkling water, fresh kiwi and orange juice. It's light and refreshing, perfect for hot summer days.

2.¬† Hot Basil Chicken : This is one of the most popular Thai street food. The chicken is stir fried with Thai holy basil, and was served with the dip. Spicy, juicy and fresh as it can get.

3. Lamb chops : It is said the cover tells the story of the entire book. Grilled Lamb Chops, marinated in fresh garlic, rosemary and thyme. Spices taking the charge and making every bite so soothing.

4. Shanghai Prawn serves with Bamboo Rice : One of my most liked dish for the evening. The Shanghai Prawn was a pure bliss with the taste and the bamboo rice was a shear good compliment for the prawn. Great Combo. Recommended.

The afternoon couldn't have gone so right without those delicious food and drink. It was truly a nice time at the 10 Downing Street with such flavors. I wish them all the very best. Cheers!!

10 Downing Street - one of the most hyped pubs in Sector V! Located near Rdb Cinemas this place gives you the feel of an antique English pub. Had been on my bucket list for too long. Finally visited with a group of friends. 

We started our meal with 3 varieties of mocktails - Watermelon Mojito, Kiwi Fizz and Tango and cash. All the drinks were extremely well prepared, but my favourite was the Kiwi Fizz! Each of the drinks are highly recommended.

Moving on to starters, the first one to arrive was the Hot Basil Chicken which was flavourful and yummy. Next up was the Lemon Garlic Fish which was another gem of a dish. However the stunner of the afternoon was the Lamb chops which were tender and saucy. The next dish was the 10DS Special kebabs which were tender and succulent chicken kebabs baked with cheese and onions. We ended with Cheese Kurkure which was stuffed with cheese and had a crispy outer covering.

The main course started with Chicken Pepper Steak which was served with herb rice. The breast piece was well cooked had had a subtle flavour of pepper which enhanced the taste. Next up was the Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce, yet again served with herb rice. The fish was soft and juicy and went well with the rice. The last dish of the afternoon was Shanghai Prawns with Bamboo Rice. This tasted out of this world. 

Overall we had a gala time. The service is fast, and the playlist is amazing! A must visit for all youngsters.

10 Downing Street had been in my wishlist for long and I finally gave this place a visit with a couple of friends for lunch today. The place resembles a royal English style pub, which perfectly sets the mood to party. We ordered a number of dishes, and each of them turned out to be excellent. 

Among the drinks, The Watermelon Mojito turned out to be my favourite. It was perfectly fizzy and had the sweetness of watermelon along with a kick of lime. The other drinks, Kiwi Fizz and Tango and Cash, were chilled and refreshing. 

In the starters, the Hot Basil Chicken tasted great. The Lemon Garlic Fish won my heart with its texture. The fish was soft and juicy. Next we had Lamb Chops, which were my favourite. The meat was tender. It was spicy and tasted amazing. The Downing Special Kebabs were chicken kebabs coated with cheese and onions. This was quite delicious. 

In the main course, we started with Chicken Pepper Steak. I completely fell in love with the sauce. It was perfectly creamy. The chicken, too, was well cooked. The next dish was Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce. The fish had an amazing tecture, which was well complemented by the mild tangy sauce. We had Shanghai Prawn as well. This was cooked well and the prawns tasted amazing. We paired it up with Mushroom Noodles and Bamboo Rice. I somewhag loved the noodles more.

Overall, it was an amazing meal. Looking forward to visiting this place soon.

Perfectly seasoned chicken pieces and the meat being succulent was literally melting in the mouth.
We tried 3 chicken platter, 1 Dry chilli chicken and two combos of Noddles with a chicken preparation and fried rice with a chicken preparation.
The food was in enough quantity.
This place is highly recommended if you want to try mouth watering dishes.
Happy fooding ‚úå

Coming to the food. It was superb. The platters were amazing. Definitely give it a try. The fried ice cream is to die for.

The ambience was overall good. But WORST SERVICE EVER. We waited for 3 hrs and they couldn't serve 12 of us. After 3 hours , they served three of the children who were with us but not even the proper combo we ordered. And they have a 4.2 rating. Not worth. Simple harrassment. And they didn't even apologize while we were leaving.

This is the worst place. Yesterday we went there group of 14 people for our team lunch around 1:40 pm. We have placed our order around 2:00pm. They started to served our for around 3:30 pm. They don't know how to served the food. First they served side 2-3 dishes after 20 to 30 minutes they served main dish . We asked for late the Waiter gave us bad excuses and argue with us. Also he forgot some dish to served. At that time restaurant was not too crowded.

I have a question to restaurant manager you don't have management capabilities why you open this restaurant? You should need to train your Waiter.

Actually I am giving 1. If there is 0.5 options this is will be good for them.

One more thing, funny quotes written inside males washroom, which makes you laugh.üòÄ
This was absolutely unique , which I have seen first time in any restaurant.

I had heard about 10 Downing Street a lot and was really hyped out about the place. As I entered I was awestruck by the interior decor. Then things crumbled  to the ground. The mocktail I had ordered was good but the Roast Lamb in Red Wine Sauce was very bad. The lamb was just too chewy, the rice did not have the flavour it should have and the veggies didn't add up much to the dish that was already flawed. Disappointed.

It was a bad and embarrasing experince. 
We went here for a friend's birthday. We purchased a deal on little app but they did not accepted it. In the end, after a lot of argument they've accepted it. But the point is, if you guys are not accepting third party deals, then why did you put it on in the first place ? 
Please work on that.

After hearing so much abt the place I ended up at 10 downing street on Sat evening to party
decor were excellent 
Food = draught was not available 2 kebabs I asked were not available so I ended up ordering tandoori Nv platter (that was easy way with limited options) 
Service I hav a table reserve via dineout still they wanted me to sit at bar table on demanding for a table n I got one on extreme corner with words that they said will shift me to other table soon & as expected they  didn't shift us
Staff's hav a coordination prob n every time a new guy is coming to attend me 


Yes we knw u ppl r getting lot of party orders n bookings on weekend from local office etc but if u won't look at other ppl visiting you they will hav to think again before visiting u again 
Next time I will prefer lounge n clubs next to u rather then wasting my money n spoiling my day

great ambiance and feel this place gives to you. didnt try the food here though ordered draught beer. one suggestion is the bar wait staff needs a bit of training while handling queries on the quality of product. when questioned the manager shies off and sends the bar tender to answer the queries.

An expansive place in Sector 5 Pub Hub with live music and a lively ambience, this place though slightly on the pricier side offers an experience that's worth the cost. Food is good and is available in a wide range of cuisines (time to deliver might be really long during peak weekends). There's a lot of variety available in cocktails and the bar does a really good job at that. Staff are helpful and friendly.

The structure of the place and the place is nice. A rectangular bar at the centre with active and cooperative bar tenders. Economically good if you dont go Irish. Music is decent with active members in the small dance floor. Cant comment about the food as I didnt go there to try food. Good smoking room with amazing posters. A humble place.

Chicken cheese lasagna and it was awesome
Chicken teeka masala with butter Nan and it was ok.. not so good. 
Ambience great
Waiting time : a lot
Service person: good

Overall food is what matters most.. the former one was awesome and the later not up to the mark and quantity is lesser than other restaurants.

I will definately go again but will not try the Indian dishes

Fancy as the name goes, this typical English style pub, epitome of wood and leather has been ruling at Sector V, Calcutta for some time now. Full marks for the aura and the ambience the place offers on entering, the place is divided in two floor sections, the upper one mainly for the DJ and the music events and a lavish and spacious ground floor with a full dedicated bar, hookah zone and dining area. All in all it would set your mood just right for a perfect weekend hangover.
Coming to the drinks section my friend went for a draught beer mug on which they were having 1+1 offer post 2pm, but their happy menu @99 starting at 5 left us missing out on the discount as we went for my personal favourite Sex on the beach and the house special coriander flavoured cocktail as suggested by the staff. I liked my SOB though I have had better but the latter was a sheer disappointment. Priced at 600 each that drink had too much coriander taste to it as per my liking which eventually ruined my taste while trying out the other ones.
In the food section they took quite some time to get our order of Chinese Platter ready, but it was worth it. That dish had great value for money as well as the Lollipop, wonton or the pan fried fish each dish tasted quite decent. Out of the main courses I would say their grilled chicken lasagna was great. It was quite cheesy and the meaty inside cooked to perfection, being a lasagna lover I won't complain about their continental skills. The chicken pepper steak was lovely too cooked in mexican pepper sauce served with steamed rice and assorted vegetables. The chicken garlic tikka was average tasting. What made me sad was they didn't have much in desserts except ice cream and brownie.
All in all the service and the ambience here at Downing is absolutely killer, the food is decent and great for your booze story. I would totally recommend this place & love to come by next time but will make sure that I check in during the happy hours, because otherwise the pocket pinch would certainly not be worth the hype.

After hearing so much about this place me and my friends decided to tryout and to my dismay it was indeed a splendid experience.
The food here was of good taste and quality the three course meal plan for 299 + Gst extra was indeed a great choice today we tried our favourite chinese from the menu served with a choice of soup or softdrink/cocktail(indian spirit) with a combination of rice and side dish.
We tried the garlic chicken rice with sliced fish in shanghai sauce, bamboo rice with shanghai chicken and szechuan rice with kung pao fish, for soup we had chicken manchow soup it was incredible and ome of my friends took fresh lime which could had been a lil better since it lacked a bit of sweetness.
Last but not the least all these food were complimented with vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.
This place is a must try and the ambience is something to make you fall in love with, I am going back again.

Finally, after about a year this one opened, we found ourselves in sector V wearing closed shoes and not in baggy bermudas - fit to enter the pub named appropriately after the residence of the Prime Minister of a famously snooty country.

We reached after 10 30, so it was already full and dark and booming with the kind of DJ music that starts playing after one is done with the EDM and techno pop and electronic rock and other such fancy stuff. We did not order anything fancy as well - LIIT, Sangrias, Black Dog and Heinekens. The cocktails were excellent, but the food was not quite up to the mark. The Reshmi Kabab was neither hot nor soft, and the fish in the assorted starters platter was rather smelly.

Full marks for the ambience though, cannot remember the last time I had so much fun dancing. What I liked best was the presence of a couple of bouncers stationed at the dance floor - full marks for getting the no nonsense message loud and clear.

Probably will need to come back at some earlier time, and not at the later stages of pub hopping to appreciate this place more. Even then, it was a good experience no doubt!

Lovely elegant decor and lighting. Perfect location. Least difficulty in parking. Starters are good, including kebab platters, nachos. Drinks are amazing, especially the mocktails (for booze free days) and cocktails. Service is unbelievably swift. Been there few times, one of which was my office party. Had a gala time on the dance floor. Peppy numbers. Amazing ambience. Courteous staff. Fill up your stomach with the alcohol served here, more than the food. :D 
One suggestion: add more beer brands to your tag and you're there! :)

Dropped in a few minutes before their happy hours were about to end. And their happy hours food menu,as well as the bar menu, both are fabulous.
We had chicken garlic tikka, dry chilli chicken,and their non veg platter, washed down with some daiquiri and Sex on the beach. Thumbs up for the taste. And the hookah here is pretty amazing too.
They were a little understaffed that day, service was slow. Ambience is good.
One of the must try pubs in this area.

Pretty nice place I must say. The ambience, the lights with a generous use of timber for the tables and chairs is a nice touch. The lights are of the right warmth , does not hurt your eyes when you are squinting them after a couple of drinks. I think the food was reasonably priced and was quite palatable. Specially the fish , possibly had the word Basil in its name : was too drunk to remember.We also had a Tandoori Platter , and once again I think the fish in it was nice , the thing which was arguably "mutton" in that platter was horrible and had so much spices, it literally felt I was licking a part of a Turkish Spices Baazar. We ordered one more thing and possibly it was the initial Basil Fish we liked so much. Although not that we wanted to try it again, but we were pretty wasted at point to be reading the menu and deciding and ordering , so we went with what we remembered and trusted.

The prices are pretty competitive and enough so to not avoid the rowdy crowd who throws hissy fits after a pint.

P.S : Stop playing Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber though.

Was here on Sunday night. Wasn't expecting much. Most places in this area are loud but, was pleasantly surprised. Though it was loud, the place is very well done and gives out a good vibe. Though, I don't think the music goes with ambience. I understand loud enough/pop music is what is popular, but some rock, acoustic, indie pop, lighter music would also be great some night (for people like me).

One of the reasons I'm rating them a 3.5 because they have this silly rule of not letting boys dance if there are no women on the dance floor. The place literally had 10 people by the end of the night. The boys still weren't allowed to dance. They were just two of them. I understand this rule on a crowded night- trying to avoid certain situations but not, when literally there are two people on the dance floor. Rules are good, but not just for the sake of being implemented.

Writing a review for this restaurant is a Little tricky for me. The food was descent. However the decor is much more appealing than the food. One feel like sitting in London street & having a beer üç∫ with live music. I went for a office lunch but they were not able to organise properly for the buffet. In the lunch time there was too rush and that spoiled the entire game. May be a la carte could have been a better option I guess. Still I think to revisit the place.

Located inside the PS SRIJAN Corporate Park campus in Sector V, opposite RDB Cinemas.

Ambience and decor would leave one spellbound, the posh, luxurious drove, with colourful tiled flooring, good use of wooden structures for accentuation and the gigantic space. Well cushioned sofas and chairs would definitely light up your mood and then they have the dim classical soothing lighting to add to it.

Menu offers continental, Indian and Chinese and hookah, cocktails, alcoholic beverages also.

We ordered chicken shashlik with butter rice, Leon garlic fish with butter rice, Hakka noodles wid veg manchurian and white sauce Alfredo pasta. We got a combo offer and also had blue angel cocktail, silver star cocktail and vanilla ice cream with choco sauce.

The chicken sashlik was an innovative dish, with barbeque seasoned chicken kebabs with tangy sauce .
Lemon garlic fish was of the Highest grade and buttery delicious.
The Hakka noodles would remind you of the classic park street Chinese noodles and the pasta was pure bliss to the tongue.
The cocktails were good if nt great.

Pocket pinch was very low given the fact that we got out combo offers which otherwise too I think would be adequate given its a luxury space.
Quantity wise though they can improve as well as with the size of the tables which forces me to deduct 0.5 from my rating.
A bit more work on the quantity side is the only room for improvement I see.

Super work!!

In one sentence, its the best restaurant with hospitality at its best.
Its opposite rdb cinema hall, with extravagant decor and yummilicious food. We went der during happy hours tried out der continental, indian and Chinese every dish was too tasty. The music was good and everything so apt for a week day lunch to weekend evening. I mentioned hospitality since, there was an instant where we couldn't accommodate everything in a small table with 3 seaters then a lady comes up she brings us a chair and helped us in placing our things. Later we come to know she is the owner, thus even though her staffs missed out but she came up to us greeting so humbly. Thus this place was worth every penny.

This place is a real gem in the heart of sector 5. It's just 1minute walking distance from RDB. When you enter to the pub you're like "just wow". We ordered roast chicken noodles, shredded chicken with red pepper, grilled chicken rice, vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, blue lagoon, sex on the beach.The food tasted so good. Qauntity is enough for two people. Now coming to the ambience, it was great like anything. I personally fell in love with this place. It's a perfect place where you can enjoy with your loved ones!

I feel very happy being here as this place has every thing to turn into a fav hangout destination for the weekends. The food is pretty good and the bar counter at the center with seats all around it add to the decor. The area inside  mind you is huge and will allow you to freely unwind to the music played by the dj , no matter where you're stationed. The only flaw I noticed is that it closes down a bit too early given Saturdays are meant for partying up until next day morning . I've visited this place thrice already and look forward to visiting more often. Cheers‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è

The unit manager by the name of Alka is extremely unprofessional and rude. We had been there before and really liked the place. I had recommended it to alot of people. But we had a terrible experience last night. First the bill was unexplained as it had gst on alcohol. When we asked them to clarify we get another bill that was even more confusing. When we asked the waiter to clarify yet again . He guided to us to this lady Alka. Okay so we asked her the same and what she does is remove the corporate discount that we had and remove the service charge. We never asked that. We don't mind paying Service charge if we are satisfied. But she was rude in explaining the issue and when we asked why she removed the corporate discount she said it's her voluntary decision and they are not tied up with the company anymore. So if you are not tied up why did u offer the discount.please note that we had our Id verified. Extremely unprofessional and I would recommend the management to take adequate measures or you will have lost good customers.

Now what can I say about this amazing place. I'm a regular at this place everytime I visit College More. I should have seen this place earlier. But given the unnatural work timings and the dirty office politics of 'no matter when you come you can't leave office before 8'. I never got the chance to visit this place at the right time. I must say that it's one of the best places to visit between 4pm to 7pm everyday. I regularly order the American Style fried Chicken which is so crispy filled with juicy white chicken and along with that a Mojito. The pair comes at 198 excluding the taxes. Similarly there is a Johnny Walker also at around 200. 

The other thing that is my favourite here is the Chinese Style chicken on the Rs.99 menu (it's the strongest attraction) for me. In short 4 to 7 is heavenly. I recommend that you visit the place regularly.

If you are a restaurant hopper looking for something exotic then this place may not be the place for you. It's a place for regular Hangout and has a small dance floor. It's a place to party.

TDS living up to the expectations... Not allowing people because of their attire... He was just wearing decent shorts... Well dressed... But this is strictly uncalled for... You are still in India, please respect the culture... It's your discretion but still you need to be consistent with your decisions, which you are not. That's where the problem lies. It's high time when you stop this hypocrisy! Let us not turn this into something which is something not acceptable...

I visited the hyderabad's 10 downing and it was so costly that I did not want to visit the kolkata branch atall
But when forced by friends ,I had to and it was the best decision.
We decided to meet after lunch so that we can leave early and that turns out to be the jackpot
They had the rs99 menu from 4-7 , we ordered all the food items in that special menu and finally the bill was per person 1k 

So I will always like to visit the place only between 4-7pm

This is another place I keep going back to . I've been here 2 times both at different time of the day so both had its own charm . I went there first time after a morning show at RDB and this place was so quiet and Serene that I enjoyed a lot with talking to my friend . The next time was totally different as we went there on a week off to have booze and to dance our feet during the evening. The crowd here is too lively and the dj is amazing , danced to various Bollywood as well as English songs . The happy hours are too much hot and happening , the time we we reached was at around 7 PM so there were few minutes left for beer pints just at 99 which we grabbed like around 6 and we had chicken lollypops and chicken drumsticks which tasted like heaven . Then in the later part if the evening we had a beer tower , numerous starters with Chinese combo meals as well as the gigantic kebabs platter which tasted out of the world and the drink including vodka , whisky kept coming . Over all including the service , time management , staff's friendlyness the place is a den for all party freaks as well as for family get togethers since the pub has a classy touch of elegance where you'll easily be comfortable to take your parents or your grand parents . Would love to visit it again and try out other delicacies . Thank you for keeping up the good spirits of hospitality and management .

As per world history,10 Downing Street, colloquially known in United Kingdom as Number 10,is the official residence and office of the First Lord of Treasury.Having office a lot distant from Sector 5,I didn't get a chance to visit over there.It was a treat from our manager.First time I entered the place,I was mesmerized by the pub type ambience.The name itself is justified.The Light and the light cool jazz songs were good enough to make the atmosphere so pleasant.Now coming to the food section we have ordered Butter Nun along with Lal Mas(Mutton with Red Gravy) and Tengdi Masala with a peg of Johnie Ginger.Both the main course items can satisfy your taste buds fully.I will like to visit this restaurant shortly.

Big Centered Bar, A tucked away small cozy dance floor and a very favored ambiance is what greets you at 10 Downing Street, Saltlake. Dim lights , live DJ music and good booze are the savory attraction of this place. The food could however do with some make over as I found the crispy chicken a bit too hard n dry for my taste, it was an overall good experience. For a city as beautiful and charming as kolkata, this place fits right in and is an enjoyable experience with the right company. Would certainly visit again.

After a long time, had a wonderful dinner date. Nice ambiance, light music, good food, courteous staffs. We booked a table for two through Dineout. It was not that crowded at around 6:45 PM. We ordered Blue Lagoon & Mojito @99/- each. Along with that, we requested for a Barbeque Lamb Chops. Chicken cheese Lasagna with garlic bread and Chicken Stoganoff were fantastic as main course. It was really a nice experience. Dishes were more than sufficient for an individual.
Note: They didn't allow the 10% discount by Dineout as there were happy hours.

Overall it's a good place for hanging out with friends for a drink or hookah.

It was a breezy day when we visited this place last week.. beautifully decorated with much elegance, now coming to the experience over there, staffs were really courteous and helpful.. we have ordered lamb chops which was awesome in taste , deep fried fish(basa) was good and in main course chicken lasagna was good and that will also tickle your taste buds and it was enough for two of us, they offered one complimentary drink nd dessert with that so that was cherry on the top, Bailey's irish cream was a pleasant drink..loved the experience keep it up

Ok the ambience is superb.. Food is good but i wouldnt say damn tasty (honestly i have had better) . Full marks on seating arrangements.. Service is good.. But what the hell is the logic behind adding 5% service charge twice on alcohol and food bills separately?? 
And for the people with a pocket crunch u might wanna go and order before 7(selected drinks @99).

P.S. i ordered a tower of beer and was informed that only pitcher was available , half n hr later a tower was served at the table beside me!! Whats up with that??

Its a lovely place to spend your evening. Ambience is good, except sometimes for the music which i felt was too very loud. Coming to the food.... trust me this place serves real quality food.. we ordered chinese platers, kabab platers both of which substantially served well for 3 of us. The taste was also equally good. They serve some unique cocktails which has to be mentioned. Just ask them about their special cocktails and they will suggest you... and please do take their suggestions.. ! Apart from that we were lucky to win 3 free johny walker ginger cocktails by answering few questions asked to us by some johny walker representatives around. All in all nice place.. surely not disappointing and most importantly good crowd.

This place fantastic to be with friends. Totally happening place with dance floor and a big bar in the centre. Ambience is fabulous giving you a feel of a restaurant abroad. Service is something which it should look into but the food is great. Price is obviously on a higher side but if you are with family then you may not like it as hookah and liquor is openly served. Although if you are in Sector V then POUR HOUSE is definitely the place you want to go and enjoy with your friends but then again POUR HOUSE is much more expensive than this.

I along with my wife visited this place last night. We had a very good experience there. We had a wish to taste this one but could not got the time until yesterday. Finally yestrrday we got a chance to walk through the 10 downing stret.

Food quality: very good . Specially continental. Garnishing , taste and quantity was more than suffivient.

Ambiance: very good. Was playing live romantic music which made the evening more colourful. There is a couple dance floor also where you can have a quick dancing time with your loved one. 

Sevice: very satisfactory.

Cost: It is very much cost effective . Specially with this ambiance and quality. The good thing is they have flat price for any dishes. That reduce you headache of choosing.

Overall: if you want a spend a good romantic dinning evening with your partner along with good food, please do visit.

Speciality: continental.

Alright. So this was just a random sunday eve trip on a car with friends after a heavy pour throughout the day. A ride just to lighten up the mind and to be away with the gloomy day. Entering sector 5, and looking at the waterlogged streets we were just planning to escape when 10D came right in front of my eyes. It was an all time visit on my list waiting to be ticked when the plan became on.

Without much expection of the place being as happening as it sounded,(due to huge rain and waterlogged), we just wanted to feel the vibe. And woah woah!! It was a surprise waiting there. What initially planned out to be an hour visit turned out to be a 3hour one and regular would be visit later. 

The grandiose ambience, the savoury food, the pumping music all mashed up to form such an environment that we were amazed even if the crowd was so less. The food was lip-smacking and we were just on the verge of leaving when this guy came in with an accoustic guitar. With no such change of plan as we planned to leave, the sound and the rythm of guitar caught me by surprise yet again. It was a live performance by Saurav which we were not aware of. 

The session continued and we were glued to our seat and kept tapping,rolling, grooving and singing to the wonderful tracks. We played along pretty well.

Overall with the experiece I had and with the expectation of a due visit ona dj night, it is one of a kind recommendation from my side for a must visit at this place.

RDB boulevard has always offered me something to remember! 10 Downing Street is one o those few places that actually blew my mind! Had heard a lot about this place but somehow yesterday was my first visit! The menu card was a bit confusing TBH. After a brief discussion, I and my sister had ordered Chinese Non Veg Platter, Chicken Crackling Rice, Mushroom, Chicken n Babycorn in some White gravy and an LIIT. We had a complementary beer and dessert as well. Each and every dish in the platter had it's own unique taste.
The d√©cor is just not what you will expect! English Chandelier, Wooden French Windows, classic Brown Table and of course a huge bar counter in the centre. There's a drum set on one corner o an upper balcony as well. Service was good and so was the DJ in the house! Yes guys I generally don't comment on tge DJ but this one was worth mentioning.
The only thing I didn't like was the plates in which they serve. Somewhere I felt that the green fibre square plates were off the place o our that brown classy table!

The place is opposite RDB. We tried simple cocktails and simple cuisine like Chinese platter , butter naan and laal mash. The food quality was good. There was a live music going on that too was good. The service was way better than rest factors. Personally I was not very happy with the ambience since it was very loud and poorly lit. The pocket pinch was bit high in comparison to other pubs located at same area. Overall it was a different experience.

In drinks we ordered 3 heineken, 1 mango bloom and 1 watermelon margarita.
This was the best margarita that I have ever had in my life.
In food we ordered 1Non veg Chinese platter. This had 4-5 types of Chinese starters including wantons, lollypop etc. Each and every item was mouthwatering. We also ordered 1 garlic cheese bread toast which was good as well.
We also took 1 teen paan flavored hookah.
The staffs were really courteous and well mannered.

Overall a nice place to hangout with brilliant ambience, good food and great hospitality.

10 downing street is a popular place to hang out and party in the Sector 5 area of Salt lake. Frequented mostly by corporate employees working in and around sector 5, this is also a preferred spot to host team parties and dinners.¬†

I have visited this place few times with my friends as well as with my colleagues for a team dinner and drinks session.

The place is huge and has a very upmarket feel to it. The bar is centrally located and the ambiance is quite classy. The section upstairs usually caters to private parties and corporate get together.¬†

I have a mixed experience at this place - Both the times that ¬†I have visited with my friends, the service was good, the waiters and bar tenders were quite experienced, food and drinks were also decent.¬†

However during my recent visit with my team for a private party, I was disappointed. The bar tenders were quite inexperienced. Service was sluggish and the non veg items on the buffet were not upto the mark. The staff too were impolite at times.¬†

I particularly liked their vegetable au gratin and cheese balls. Hookah was good to taste as well.¬†

They also have a small dance floor in case you wish to shake a leg after a drink or two :)¬†

Over all a nice place to hang out after office, with impressive ambiance

I ll probably never get tired of visiting this place. The entrance itself is so gorgeous! The interiors give you a very vintage feel, with the bar right in the middle, and a huge chandelier on top. 
Dishes I've tried. 

Lamp Chops: 4 pieces of lamb, in kind of a garlic-y spicy sauce. Unless you like spicy food, you'll do better to stay away from this one. I, however, loved this dish.

Chicken Lasagna: Pretty to look at with an exquisite taste. The layers of chicken and cheese is so mouth watering and the buttered bread that is served as a side perfectly compliments it. It is quite a heavy dish and it's more than enough for one person.

Chicken Stroganoff: The best dish ever! The sour cream sauce, with pieces of button mushroom and chicken in it, tastes as good as it sounds. It's a staple for me every time I visit. Definitely a must have.

Shepherd's Pie: Something was wrong with this preparation and I didn't like it. The mashed potato layer tasted a little raw, and I quickly rejected the whole dish, but probably that's just me. 

Chicken Pasta Basilico: Another gem. This white sauce pasta, probably has the same white sauce served with Chicken Stroganoff. The penne pasta was well cooked and was delectable. And surprisingly, it was very filling. It is served with buttered toast. 

Chilli chicken with fried rice: Don't exactly remember the name of this dish but I was amazed that this restaurant serves amazing Chinese food too, with Italian. 

Naan with Punjabi Chicken: Tender, very spicy chicken, with soft naan. Win-win! 

Overall, the food can't get better. I am absolutely in love with this place. Also, they serve a drink of your choice and ice cream with every dish you order. How can you possibly top that? 

The service staff is very friendly and helpful.

Last Tuesday I was been there with my friends.. though it was not the first time for me... I was been there before also. The ambiance is too good here. If you want a peaceful bliss after a hectic office schedule, I am telling you this is the place. The songs they played is mild. You can easily enjoy the moment with your friends or with your special one very peacefully. I would like to mention the below points specially.

1. The ambiance. The mild lights they used and the mild songs they played, is perfect for your mood.
2. The band. They have organised bands to perform. You can request your songs to play.
3. The food quality. For food, I will give 3 out of 5. 10 Downing Street, you can look after the food quality a bit.
4. You will get chilled beer always. If you are looking for chilled beer, this is the place for you.
5. The service of the stuffs are too good. They all are very polite and very helpful. I would like to thank the floor manager of the place. He is very polite and too helpful.
6. The smoking zone. The arrangement they made for the smoking zone is too good. The place is big and clean. You will never feel suffocated there.


Keeping every aspects in mind, this is the very nice place to visit. Definitely a recommendable place to visit.

If you are looking for hangouts and good ambiance then you must visit this place but if you are a foody like me and looking for some yummy preparations then re-think before you pay a visit over here. I had a lot of expectation from this place but I was disappointed with very ordinary tasted cuisines. The only good thing was the Crispy chicken, apart from that nothing so great.  We ordered Nawabi Chicken, Paneer butter masala but all of those were average, nothing special. For me if you are a foody then its a one time visit spot.

What : pub, live music, dance floor, valet parking

Review : Went on last Tuesday, after office hours. It was the first day for live performance for band barefoot. I liked the music, liked the ambiance. The service was also pretty good. The food ok. We ordered shredded lamb which was spicy but tasty. But I liked Lemon grilled fish with butter rice more than everything else. Although a few drops less lemon could have made it much more tastier, I would like to order it once again. The price was a bit on the higher side though. Overall it was a good experience.

Sorry couldn't take much photos.

We went to this place to have some good beers and food..... seating is good, the ambience is very good, staff is attentive and they have a big smoking lounge, these are all the positives I could think of now lets talk about downsides..... they don't have a good selection of beer just the once you get in normal booze shop now for them why would you pay 4 times the cost.... the most important part of any hang out place is their food and that's where downing street sucks..... we orderd fish for snacks which was just okay, in main course we ordered paneer, malai kofta, adraki fish and chicken... chicken was worth less, it was not properly cooked and gravy was pathetic,,, fish in main course was okay, malai kofta was too bad some one shall train them on how to cook malai kofta..... dal makhni was the best part of main course and worth rating...... gravy paneer too was just okay..... all in all I wont like to this place if I want good beers and good food..........

Visited this place with 3 friends of mine. We went there around 8.30pm and they had a big rulebook to consider before our entry(rules followed by guards of the night's watch after 18.30) .
I was asked for an age proof. My friend was denied initially for sandals. After several requests for the footwear, also when I was able to prove with a photo ID that I am above 21 finally we entered.
Ambience: 4/5
Nicely decorated interiors with good music gives nice feel. Not mind blowing but adequately good.
Food & Drinks : 4/5
Very less options in domestic liquor. Options are good if you are going for imported liquors. We had crispy chicken and valentino prawn as starters. Prawn was very nicely cooked. In main course we had chicken stroganoff and schezwan prawn with grilled chicken rice. Taste was fairly good.
Service:4/5
Even though the place was very much crowded the service was quite prompt. They even offered one complimentary on the house drink for ladies around 10pm.
Apart from the initial hiccups it was a good experience. I won't say its outstanding or you will crave to visit again but a decent place to visit once.
Keep in mind that you are properly dressed if you go after 6.30pm! Respect the Guards of the night's watch!

You are charging service charge when your staff do not provide any service at all. They had no idea that they have any advertised a deal on little app. Their stuffs are not even interested to listen when you call then. Took 20 mins to take the order and another 30 mins to serve it.
The mocktails we took were terrible. Hookah had no flavour at all and all we got is the smell of coal throughout. Coming to the food it was too spicy and unhygenic. A street side stall in sec V makes better food!!

Avoid this place by all means!!

Located at the Kolkata hub of IT professionals in Sector 5, Kolkata right opposite RDB, 10 Downing Street can be highly recommended due to is electrifying ambience and the sports bar feel. The place looks amazing for a party with friends or a dine out with your partner. The food is no doubt priced on the higher side and quality is good by a bit saucy. We mainly tried quite a few of their starters and liked most of them except a few. The chicken wanton is a no no. So is the chicken lollipop. The chilli chicken, chicken wings, the paneer chilli, the veg wanton was quite nice. They have a offer of 99 for a few starter dish and drinks from 4-7 PM which can be a good deal of you are looking for a few few drinks. Otherwise the place is recommended only if you are ready to spends some bucks for a lavish dine out. Service is on the slower side but amicable waiters.

10, Downing Street. They don't allow, if you are not wearing covered shoes. Shame on this restaurant. 28th June 2017, 8.45 pm, was wearing slipper with belt. The person, who was at the reception (outside of the restaurant) denied my entry. I simply moved on to another restaurant. Neither you guys are 5 star, nor extra ordinary. Don't want to visit after terrible experience. One of the oldest restaurant "Mocambo" did a very similar behaviour, and got the answer from public. You should get the same.

D0wning Street is falling d0wn, My Fair F00die!

Utterly disappointed with the lunch package they have in here...
First of all, the place is 0ffering the lunch package for getting quick p0pularity but isn't h0nest en0ugh in their appr0ach t0wards preparing the dish, 0r else why w0uld Chicken Shashlik and Mexican Chicken taste the same? Apart from repeating sauces in all dishes, the rati0 of shredded chicken in Mexican Chicken pasta was scanty.
The presentati0n had a heaped up, clumsy l00k.
There are 0nly 2 m0cktails t0 ch00se fr0m and a miserly sc00ped up vanilla ice cream with ch0c0late sauce as the 0nly ch0ice f0r dessert.
The waiter seemed to lack interest in arranging for the package. He also didn't mention that we c0uld have s0up/ beer as starter... He seemed hurried and disoriented.
0ur experience here was m0re kind 0f a private bus ride.

But my opinion changed for this place when we visited for team lunch, we ordered continental dishes and all are awesome really awesome. Their service need a little improvement as to give some extra order for second time we need to call the waiter 4 to 5 times then he listen.

I love this place, the very atmosphere, the managing staff is good, the food appeals to taste buds and makes one crave for more. We tried lasagna, nachos, tandoori platter and black dal - naan combo. Each one of it was equally good. They do take a little time in serving and approaching waiter is not very easy because most of the time they are busy or ignoring. But the ambience, the drink and the food makes it worth going.

10 Downing Street! The headquarters of the Govt. of UK, situated near the Buckingham Palace. I guess, the link to the Palace passes on to TDS (Kolkata), such a royal and grand feel travelling all the way through 5,000 miles!! üè∞üíÇüë∏

Coming to 10 Downing Street, Kolkata! üòÅ
Situated at PS Srijan Corporate Park (near RDB Cinema), TDS is a place of class!! Their interior is their USP. All done in a royal manner, this place is mostly about leather and wood. Starting right from the Chandelier to the Bar to the seating arrangements to anything over here, it speaks Class and Elegance. The d√©cor is simply fantabulous giving the feels of being inside some British Palace. Ambience is really really good.

Coming to food, I've tried their Tex Mex Chicken Spaghetti üçù, Schezuan Riceüçö, Roasted Chicken in Red Chilli Sauceüçó, Crispy Chilli Babycornüç§ and Chinese Platterüç≤. Each item was simply great, be it the food or the mocktail which was Blue Lagoon for us (my all time favourite). The Roasted Chicken and the Spaghetti were exceptionally good. Service was decent.

Overall, a very nice place and a must visit. ‚ò∫üëç

This place is new in town and has created a lot of hypes around it..
So, i decided to visit this place one evening with a friend of mine..
The pub was really big in size nd has some british touch to it..
But they should really work on the food items they offer in the menu..like i went around 5 in the evening and wanted to try some kebabs..but was told that kebabs were not being served at that time and they would serve after 8pm only..which made me a bit disappointed..then we decided to order the Chinese platter as suggested by the waiter himself..but the taste was horrible..and didn't liked the food at all..!!
Apart from that Chinese platter everything that i would see was Chinese food items, sandwiches and burgers..now c'mon there are other pubs in the town who offer a great variety of other food items as well..so i think they should really work on that..
The only thing that made me disappointed was food..apart from that everything was good..

This is currently the best place Salt lake sector 5 is offering in terms of ambience and Beer üç∫. I won't go into too much detailing. It's all rich British era kind of look and 90's music ( I liked it ). Took a shisha which really goes well with Beer followed by food.
Crispy Chilly‚Äã Baby corn- It was on average side.
Asked for Tandoori Alu  It was unavailable. They gave me an alternate as Chilly potatoes which looked like African potatoes however the taste was decent. Wontons was very okay. None of the food made me go wow. That is were Raze The Bar takes an edge. Food needs attention both for quality and quantity. However I liked the Rs 99 deal they run from 4 pm. 
Verdict - Recommended ( Beer üç∫ & Ambience)

Went for a weekday lunch with colleagues. Ordered long island iced tea and chilly fish to start with. The fish was delicious, cooked just right with the right amount of spices. The long island iced tea took ages to come. Service is slow; so dont go if you are in a hurry. For the mains we chose the combo which comprised of a starter, a main course and a dessert. For the mains we chose spaghetti, fried rice combo with chicken and other combo dishes which were quite good and tasty. The decor is splendid, the music is perfect. The only let down is the service which is slow to serve but is in a hurry to remove the dishes before you are done. Overall, a good place to hang out.

Food : 3/5
Value for money : 2.5/5
Ambience : 1/5
Service: 3/5

We went on 17.6.17 (Saturday) at 5pm.
On our entrance the first thing that caught our attention is how dirty the place is. Dirty everywhere. The dim lighting doesn't help in camouflaging the untidy place. We were looking for a seat that had some light; it was very difficult to find one that was clean and had light. Finally we got one.
I think there was some buffet going on in the afternoon. They were busy putting those big rectangular steel containers with lid that are used to serve food in a buffet in a place where it is supposed to be a private dining area. This place was just beside our table. The sound that it made reminded me of a memory long back when I was a kid and we had a function at home and the catering guys were putting away their utensils after the guests left. Not a pleasant sound coz it was quite loud. The sofa I sat on had torn from many places. And really really dirty.
Anyway, coming to the food.
During 4pm to 7pm they have this short food and drinks Menu for Rs.99+tax. We ordered 3 items from there "American style chicken", "fish tikka" and "Veg.wontons". The guy said the fish tikka won't be available and he can give chili fish instead. We agreed. Then he also mentioned that the American style chicken will have corn flakes in the dish so we cancelled it. We asked for the main menu. We ordered chicken shahi patiala and butter Nan. He came after 15 minutes and informed us that he is going to give us jeera rice or plain rice instead of the butter naan because tandoor items won't be available. Absolutely disinterested and regardless of whether or not we at all wanted rice at 5:30pm. We said then cancel the order we will order something Chinese. He was totally reluctant and not at all understanding that we don't want to eat rice. We had to explain ourselves that if we knew that Roti won't be available then we wouldn't have ordered chicken patiala in the first place. He got angry and then agreed to settle for a different order. We then ordered sliced fish in Shanghai sauce along with chicken bamboo noodles. These two dishes came on one single plate.
All the food we ate was edible, nothing special but nothing bad either. The fish they provided was fresh and soft and tasted good, the salads were all dry like straw. The noodles were okay, I liked the diced bamboo thing and the noodles dish was loaded with chicken and veggies.
You can see that in the photos I have uploaded. Anyway we finished our meal , paid our Bill and left the place for good.

10 Downing Street is a gastropub and dance bar located in sector V just across RDB. We were 10 and went there on a Saturday night. The ambience was absolutely euphoric and the place was buzzing with people. Nothing much to comment about the interiors. We were mostly engrossed in booze - LIT, tequila shots etc. We had ordered their platters which came with mushrooms, tandoori potatoes and paneer and all were really good. Must visit specially for ambience, great music and good service.

Awesome ambiance. Its located near RDB movies. We, 4, went to give our birthday treat to our friends. We were in total 10 people.
You have to book a table beforehand if there are lots of people, but it depends, better ask them via call beforehand. We had to wait for an hour to get a table.
It's almost a complete pub(with club maybe in the 1st floor) with fooding/restaurant area at the front part. The ambience is superb.
We were under 21 so we couldn't order any drinks. The food ordering menu was quite different. As you can see in the menu "choose any one". It is actually a kind of combo. There you can choose from any one each from all the three for the price of Rs 279/- or as applicable per person plate.
The mocktails were good(cant say the name as i dont remember, but i suggest get the blue one and not the pink/strawberry one). We got mutton biryani, butter naan, nawabi chicken, punjabi chicken, tangri chicken, jeera rice, steamed rice for all. The food was good quality and more than enough for us all(of course we took a combo for each of 10).
With taxes of around 20% we were billed for Rs3800/-, exactly as planned.
We had an awesome time at that restaurant. At first it might seem the food will be too costly seeing the ambiance of the place, but dont worry. Its resonable. Go for it. Have a great day.

Probably one of the most good looking restaurant in sector V.. outstanding  ambiance classy decor and elegant and comfortable seating arrangements make this one hell of a place... some part of the restaurant was booked for a private party so couldn't get the complete  access. üò£

which includes a main course, a scope of vanilla ice cream üç¶with chocolate üç´sauce, soup or a welcome drink (you can choose either between 2 types of cocktails üçπ or a mug of beer üçª)  the best part about this meal is definitely the  great variety of main courses to choose from... 
‚≠êÔ∏èthe lunch is available 7 days a week between 12pm to 4 pm .

With good interiors, ample amount of space , nice ambience n a prime location this place is a huge hit.
10 Downing Street a popular chain in India is a gem of a place. We visited on Thursday night n we saw that it was kareoke night. It was my first ever experience of a kareoke n it was quite fun. The place was almost full, the music was great, beer was chilled and the kebabs were really succulent. Prices are a little on the higher side. 
Only disappointment was that for the prices they are charging they should atleast offer some condiments with drinks.

This place with such an interesting name has an attractive exterior decor as well. We went for lunch and as soon as we stepped in, I was instantly impressed by the vintage British look that has been so vividly portrayed in the decor. There are different types of seats to choose from. Once you've chosen your favourite seat, let the dimly lit ambience sink in along with the loud music.

We ordered the combos for lunch where they serve you a beverage or soup, a main course and dessert. I chose blue angel for my mocktail which was a litchi flavoured drink while my friend ordered chilled coke. We ordered chicken stroganoff and chicken pasta basilica for the main course. They served vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup for the dessert. We loved everything that they served to the core!

The staffs are courteous and the service is moderately prompt. Though I don't have any idea about the nightlife that the place offers, we had a great time sinking into the couch and tasting the best food for lunch. Looking forward to my second visit.

The happening place to be at evenings these days. Two floors and there is still a queue outside.

The interiors are plush and comfortable. The layout is commendable as it allows for easy movement around the floor without cutting down much on capacity. A reasonable amount of space has been dedicated to the dance floor. And the tv sets all around make it a fun place to be at if an engrossing match is on.

Both the taste and presentation of food met expected standards. Have nothing to complain about, not even nitpick. Although not out of this world, even prawns and mushroom stuffed cheese balls were moist and tender while not feeling underprepared in any way. They also serve a good selection of Sheeshas.

Music hits the right notes and sets the right mood. Before you realize, you are at the dance floor happily tapping away to the tunes.

Service is commendable. Staff are friendly and appear to genuinely enjoy their job of keping guests happy. All orders arrived at the table quite quickly.

Overall a memorable experience which is recommended. Would certainly pay another visit at the next opportunity available.

Ambience-
Perfect night club experience..be it the lights, the wall, the doors , bar table..with an amazing live sports screening..
It brings an aura of lounge and bar..

Service-
Staff is courteous and humble. Ready to your help at all times in all possible ways. Apt in the service being provided.

Food- (North Indian food)
We ordered the  2 veg combo meal which provides-
 
Meal 1-
2 Roti 
1 dum aloo
1 fresh lime soda
1 vanilla ice cream

Meal 2-
1 jeera rice
1 dal makhani
1 fresh lime
1 vanilla ice cream

You can order sabji/dal with breads OR
rice with Sabji/dal AND
Soups/soft drinks/beer AND
Pre decided vanilla ice cream

Each meal costing INR 250 per meal 
Now coming to the taste and quality of the food..the roti was soft and thin.the jeera rice and dal makhani were mouth watering..dum aloo was average to taste.

Conclusion- 
I recommend this place and will come again to try other cuisines of this place. It's highly economical considering the north Indian food and the veg combo offer.
Happy eating.
Well done to the whole 10 D team !

Situated in the heart of saltlake sector-5 it has a plush area, cozy sofas and cool dance floor. We ordered iced tea and watermelon caipiroska along with prawn valentino in starter. In mains we had chicken lasagna and chicken stroganoff. Foods were really tasty. Waiters were very attentive. We loved their playlist. DJ was amazing. Had great fun. Made our day.

I have been waiting for a long time to add a review of this place.
1st of all if you are in doubt visit this place, you will be amazed. According to me they serve one of the best value meals. At least i wasn't expecting‚Äã a value meal or a combo on weekend.
Beautifully decorated, huge and lavish seating arrangements. Service was quick and prompt.
I am very impressed with this food quality. Initially I wasn't sure about the quality because I ordered some starters which was only for Rs 99/- . On that day at that time they were offering alcohol as well as different starters for Rs 99/- which was fantastic.
I had also tried roasted chicken from √† la carte menu. Let me tell me guys all the dishes tasted awesome. There was no quality issue between a value meal and a √† la carte meal.
Last but not the least the somking zone is to die for. They also serve different flavoured hookahs. Music was neither loud nor low.

They usually arrange different events throughout‚Äã the week. So before going to 10 Downing Street check their zomato page.

One of the best places in sector 5 to hang out with friends in elegance and style, especially if you wanna catch some sports on the big screen!

We went on the evening of IPL2017 finals. Sunday Evening + IPL finals + group of 7 people... You can guess that finding a seat wasn't easy. We spoke to a lady who seemed to be in charge of operations there, told her that we wanna see the match here, and she was kind enough to arrange the best seats (at least, we think so üòÑ ) in the house for us, albeit after close to 40 mins of waiting.

The sofas near the dj stand it was, with three screens in clear view! Man, i was already loving the ambience of the place, and it just got even better! What's more, there was an offer till 7pm on select drinks and platters : anything for 99. We ordered i guess about 10 beers and 6 antiquity's, with some chilly lamb, baby corn, chilly chicken and some fish dishes that i dont quite remember. Later came the hookah, and i must say, they make good strong hookahs here ! Its been sometime since i had a hookah this well made. The food was good, the company was awesome and there were beautiful people everywhere. We went to chill with old buddies and see the match over booze and food, and for that, the place was awesome. Will go in another time to really check the food out.

Definitely will recommend it to everyone. Go in.. relax, and have fun !

Worst way of treating your guests. It's we who made you, and it's we who will make u realize how to treat your guests. Just be little bit mature and learn some professionalism. With the other cities within our country. You guys are way behind the world service industry. Kolkata sucks...

The first thing I should mention about this place is that it is very expensive.

Food is not very good, ordered Dry Chilli Chicken which was delicious, Cheese Chicken Lasagna which was dry and a bit bland and some of the items in the Kebab Platter was too hard.

The Sangria and Margarita were fantastic!

The decor is amazing, very dimly lit, loud music. The nightclub feel will hit you as soon as you enter. 

So if you can spend, give this place a try!

I have visited this place twice before.. Both the times my experience with the food, ambience and service was super. So the third time around I got my friends along and the new manager, unable to recall her name, treated us as if we just didn't belong there. Most of the tables had a reserved board so we were told that they wouldn't be able to serve us that day. But just then a couple came along and they requested her to give them a seat and voila! They got it. But we were simply refused. She wasn't at all cordial instead she was kinda rude.

Service is good, ambience is electrifying. Specially if you are there on Wednesday or Saturday night. Grab a drink or two with some foot tapping music and good food. You are in for a treat!

It is located at PS Srijan  Corporate Park Sector -v beside Kareem's Restaurant.  Here I've visited few days ago with my friends. Ambiance of this Restaurant was just Awesome and a Well Decorated with Low Dim light and Soft Music. I love this Place.  This Restaurant has huge Seating Arrangement. They Have some limited Menu and Drinks and Cocktails option at 99 INR in HAPPY HOUR TIME ( 4PM - 7PM) 
Here We ordered Some Starters like  1.Chili Fish 2. Chicken Lolypop 3. Chicken Wings.  Both are very Tasty and delicious specially Chicken Wings. Then We ordered hookah Pan with Rose Based Flavour.  Then we ordered some Cocktails and Mocktails  like 
1. Sex on the Beach 2. Mojito 3. Blue Lagoon 4. Caipiroska 5. Cinderella as a Mocktalks. Both are very tasty and Mouth - watering Specially Mojito and Cinderella.  Over all Good Experience and Staff are very Helpful.  They have Big Smoking Zone.

Takes time to place your dish but I don't mind it as the foods are really heaven. Atmosphere is superb. One of the best nightclubs in Kolkata (my opinion). You can visit and spend an evening without any hesitation.

Visited during their happy hours so got to choose from their 99's menu which had a few drinks n starters on the list. The chilli fish among them was commendable. The pub is quite spacious and beautifully decorated with different kinda seating arrangements. The staff being very attentive too. Also the live screening of the IPL matches were there. The only thing they need to improve on is their music which was rather too dull. Nevertheless a good evening spent.

The ambience is good. People serving there are of polite and friendly nature. Food and drinks are really good and they are having special offers for ladies on Wednesday. So planning to visit on a Wednesday there. Shisha was also good but was served a little late(after half an hour of order). The thumbs down about this place is the open singing invitation to all the people present there and because of that reason you may have a bad time listening to the worst voices of the city giving a performance on stage. And the volume there is so loud your head may burst out. Apart from that, the place is worth a visit.

Extremely disappointing experience.¬†

The servers were literally standing on our heads to finish off the drinks we had ordered because they had no customers and wanted to close down. I was in the restroom when I heard a knock accompanied by a rude voice, "Ma'am time is over". Like really?¬†

Overall the service was so pathetic that a Sesame Fried Chicken took forever to come.¬†
We ordered a Chicken Nachos which got served with our main course!
For the main course, we ordered Chicken Pepper Steak which was nothing but a grilled meat chunk in some sauce served with rice and veggies. Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce was a waste too! Exact same plating, same rice and veggies, same dressing only the sauce was a saviour!

The service was such a let down that I would never really go back anytime soon.
Only 5-star rating would be for my Watermelon Caipiroska.

Thanks to 10 Downing Street, Kolkata that I felt cheated for the paying a bill of 21000/- (inclusive of Service Charge) in exchange of a real bad experience ! The staff should understand that they are here to render services and not to humiliate their customers ! Thanks but no thanks for your Service, FOLKS !!!

My colleagues referred this restaurant...Today we went for the executive lunch (non-veg).¬†
The manchow soup was nice..

For the main course, we had ordered for spicy grilled chicken lasagna,chicken stroganoff, lamb steak,lemon garlic prawns (which was also served with noodles),and sea food -two way(comprises of fish and prawns.. Served with noodles) ..
Lasagna was too good , so was the lamb steak ,lemon garlic prawns , sea food -two way..

Regarding the dessert.. vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce (not really one of favourites), however the texture of the ice-cream was smooth and creamy ..so yes.. I liked it...

Ambience was very nice.. and the manager came and spoke to us as well..

However, serving time could have been less..

Willing to visit this restaurant next time to try out other food items on the menu .... :)

Food was kind of okay-ish to me.
Ambience and decor was good.
But the service here is horrible or at least that's what we witnessed. Had to wait for more than 40 minutes and after that waiter brought the wrong food. And, moreover the waiter started arguing about that. After dessert, bill came after 15 minutes despite of asking them again and again for the bill.
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Its located near rdb cinemas, sector V. 
Huge restaurant with a huge bar in the middle. Comfy seats divided into different sections. You can choose to sit in the comfy sofas, or on the high round tables, or you can sit at the bar. Though there's a top floor too but i guess its only for private bookings. 
The music over here is perfect - neither too loud nor too soft. Nice Ambience. Attentive waiters

The food here is good too. Tasty n quite fulfilling. Quantity given is sufficient. 
Have ordered on various occasions both indian n chinese dishes. Noodles, manchurian, paneer, dal, naan kulcha etc everything tasted great. Drinks are reasonably priced n served chilled üçª
Love this place

Though i had faced an issue over here once. Had booked a table in advance. But when we called at the appropriate time to confirm again, they mentioned not to bring kids along.. If only they could have mentioned that part earlier at the time of the booking. I clearly remember that i had specified we needed a table for 11 incl 2 kids. N they had happily confirmed. 
Apart from this glitch, everything else has been good so far. Though after this incident, I'm not gonna book a table over here in advancs as they cancel it at the last minute

Had a wonderful lunch with friends!
The ambience is awesome to start with. Plus being a group of 6 people we got the side cabin -- ideal for adda! 
We ordered Shredded Lamb, Valentino Prawn, Mutton Biriyani, Mutton Roganjosh and Fried Ice creams.  The Mutton pieces on both the Roganjosh and Biriyani were soft, succulent and juicy. The same goes for tender lamb pieces. Prawn was also decent in taste. Just loved the fried ice cream though!
Pocket pinch was also reasonable considering the amount we consumed. One can easily manage normal portions for around 700 bucks per person.
The 0.5 deduction is only for the waiting time -- surely that can be improved.

These are probably some of the pointers you would look for while entering into a pub or a lounge.. All checks for 10 downing street. My first visit was a let down since they were yet to get the liquor license. However that was long back. And this time i had no complaints since they have been serving your favourite drinks in the house and that too in KKR attire since IPL season is on! The in house DJ plays some really groovy tracks! So overall a pleasant experience. And a must for all the party lovers..

As it says its more of a Pub and according to that the ambience was 4 on 5. Food was not at all great. The staff was good in attending the guests but there was a problem. I ordered veg chinese platter and before ordering it I even asked the person taking my order about its content. Everything was going great but when the platter came they replaced the chilli paneer with chilli potato as I was told that it will contain chilli paneer. Then I took this issue to a senior level manager therr and he said that it ia fine we sometime do thia to bring different tastes and to avoid monotony. I even questioned him back that is it ok to replace a paneer item with a potato item and he again said yes and that too very confidently.
Keeping this issue aside in food everything was quite extreme. Chilly item was damn Tart and the mocktails were excessively sweet.
I ordered veg chinese platter, cottage cheese fingers, blue angel and silver star. I will rate food 2 on 5.
The total bill was of 1225 so I found it appropriate based on the money they are spending on ambience and staff but still from food point of view i found it .overpriced.
The staff was welcoming but not at all considerate towards the complaint made by me so that pissed me off.
So over all you don't deserve more that 3 but based on my experience I will rate 2.5

This place has a nice ambience and great value for money but that's where it stops. The service is painfully slow. The food is run of the mill. They serve a lot on your plate but don't allow you to take the portions you can't have making you wonder what becomes of it. The music is loud enough to drown all voices. Overall, an ideal place for a team lunch or a birthday treat where people are looking for inexpensive places without a care for the finer aspects of cuisine.

Beautiful setup...  Superb interiors..!! A very spacious place -  a rare in the city...!!  The place oozes class and comfort.  Tried the ipl special 999/- offer which includes 4 starters(2 veg+2 non-veg)  &  unlimited beer...!!  I believe the food(apart from the 1 thats provided in the offer)  is good out here as well. DJ played good music.  This place gets you in a good mood simply with its decor. A must visit...!!!

I went there with my mom & bro. It is MAGNIFICENT! The decor, the ambience, da space everything is fabulous. My mom had gone there twice before in two months, so he had got to know a waiter by his name, Mithun. He again served us. He served us really well. & then came the food. I haven't tasted anything like it before, in that price. It was just amazing. The lasagna, the white sauce seafood platter, these were my favorite dishes. I still dream about it every night :D it was a wonderful experience :)

5 stars to this amazing place.
Hands down one of the best pub/lounge I've been to.
Well me and my girl wanted to go to preach but changed our mood and thought to check out this place. 
As soon as I entered I was blown away by the interiors. It'll give you a royal feeling. 
They don't have a lot of hookah flavours but they do make some great hookah with the flavors they have. It's costs around 400. 
In food we ordered chicken nachos and chilly chicken. The nachos are "THE BEST" nachos I've ever tasted. 
We even ordered 2 vodka, 2 Pepsi and a beer. 
Even after ordering so much our bill was only 1470 including taxes.
The staffs were very friendly and co-operative. Always had a smile on their face. 
Will definitely visit the place again. Big thumbs up!

10 Downing street is located in the It hub of Kolkata in sector 5 beside the RDB Boulevard building. 
The interiors are elegant and sophisticated. There are different arenas for seating. 
You have the option of sitting high bar stools as well as comfortable and large sofas.
The waiters are extremely helpful and cordial. We had  ordered three Chinese platters which included a soup, a main course , a sides and a dessert. 
The quantity is enough for one person and you can choose each of these dishes among a variety of dishes.
We had ordered 6 pint of beers which we enjoyed sipping in the smoking room without any disturbance.
The smoking room is large and extremely clean.
This place is easy on the pocket but offers you a luxurious experience.
Surely a recommendation. :)

Went there on a Tuesday night. Not many people. Booked through Zomato hassle-free.
We ordered buckets of 6 beers and whisky. They only had Kingfisher Ultra and Corona though. You'll get bottles of all the booze here, so that's a plus.

Ordered the Chinese platter, which was good, especially the fish. But the Lamb Chops were outstanding, so good that we ordered the same thing thrice. Nothing else.
Very courteous staff.

Beautiful ambience. And it's surprisingly big. Lot of space and all full of retro styling. Loved all that. The bar in the centre with a chandelier atop looks very classy. Awesome smoking room too.

For all the men reading this, the quotes above the urinals are pretty clever. So are the posters in the smoking room. Worth checking out.

So, I went there on a Saturday evening with friends. The decor is great, it radiates of a 1900s British era. The music wasn't that loud, which was perfect for us and they were screening football matches, so perfect. 

Coming to the food, we ordered Tandoori Aloo tikka, Chicken Lollipop and Wonton during the Happy hours, which were quite good for the price. The were crispy and fresh. 

After that for main course, we wanted to try something new and we decided to ask the waiter, Shubir (who has an excellent sense of humour and deserves and made the visit worthwhile), who suggested Volcano and a Veg platter to go with it.

The cocktail was excellent. One of the best I've had. The Veg platter was also good even though there were two types of paneer, which is just unnecessary but then what else can you add in a platter. 

So, overall great place if you have really good company. The food is good, the service is excellent. The music not so much, but that gets compensated.

Looking for a place to goto for a round of lagers with mates at the beginning of the week, we chanced upon this place. Presumably part of the chain of pubs across Hyderabad etc, this came as a real pleasant surprise. A huge place with high ceilings, good lighting, comfortable seating, music at the right volume and the usual 10 Downing Street look in the place. As we reached early, there was a special menu till 2000 that offered starters at 99 bucks! The beers were cold, the starters were all good (we had over a dozen different types) and the service prompt. Economical as well! Not much more one can ask for.

At the onset I would like to say that the outer and inner facade and the food quality is very good, though the quantity is bad. While the first impression was great,everything went downhill from there. I went there for an office lunch and our team consisted of around 100 people. Unfortunately, they are not capable enough to take care of such a large party, both manpower wise and attitude wise. When you are accepting a corporate order, then you have to be on your toes, be quick and agile and be clear headed enough to serve the orders to the right people. But this place lacked manpower, did not know what to give and what not to give and that in turn led to total confusion and a bad lunch experience for us. Considering your location, you will have to pull up your socks quickly. How can a classy place like this have just one waiter catering to all the table? It is obvious that mismanagement was at ply. Moreover, the orders took such a long time in coming that we all lost our appetite. If anyone is planning to go there for a team event, then reconsider the decision. But those going in small parties can definitely try this place.

Great one.. That too in Sector 5. Amazing location. Loved the interiors. Classic English bar look and feel. Attendants are well behaved. Hookas are amazing. They have an 99/- happy hours offer where you can have one small peg of selected drink or pint of Indian beer and selected non veg and veg starters. Well its a great place to party with friends. A thumbs up from me. Visit and h@ave fun..

This is a spacious place with comfortable seating arrangements. There's  some 99 offers going on when I hopped into this place-that sounds amazing.
The food is ok- not something that u will remember ever
But the service was very poor,the worst!!!
Firstly they made some mistakes in the bill when they were asked to revisit it,they made us wait for long time. That I found quite disgusting!!

located @ sector V and is a good place with great ambience and the staff are attentive and polite , they told us about what was available and what nights are good, which is overall a British culture, missing the red telephone box & a red London bus lol, everything is good and the place have a good feeling and we enjoyed our night, they have plenty of seating areas, plenty of drinks at the bar, ¬† hey could do with some sort of offers during the week?? otherwise the place is good for a drink or two :-) seen the menu and overall it looked interesting but never tried anything, ¬†but Im sure we will in the near future. I like to think this an add onto CM Mamata Banerjee vision of Kolkata becoming London :-) just a recommendation have a bell at the bar, its an British thing to inform all customers last round at the bar :-) try it management , its a great idea

Located at the heart of the IT hub in Sector 5, this place has got all the ingredients to become one of the best places to chill out in Kolkata. I happened to visit this place on 14th Feb and got surprised with the entire decor of the lounge. In Kolkata there are few lounges which has got so much sitting space like this one. We had ordered the veg platter and it had got wantons,crispy chilli corn, potato fillets and few more items and it was actually very filling. The pros of the restaurant are the quantity and quality of the food, the spacious sitting arrangement and the soothing music. The cons would be the variety of alcoholic drinks specially beer were very less and they have got only 3 flavors of hookah and the service personnel were less aware of the menu as they fumbled to give a clear idea of the dishes ordered. But overall it is definitely a worth it place to visit.

This was in the wish list from a long time. In wish list because of d overall review i saw here in zomato. And yes of course a lot of expectation with it.

Location: in the heart of sector 5. Just near the RDB cinema. Very easy to locate.

Decoration: it's quite unique. As you go by the name u can get the feel also. It's like old British building and decorations. Quite liked it.

Now coming to the food:
___________________________

‚àö chili chicken: it came with the offer of 99 rs. , 6 pieces. Very ordinary in taste.

‚àö chicken lasange : very good in taste.

‚àö Tandoori platter: it comes with fish, Chicken, mutton kebabs. It was very hard, too much spicy. I mean just too much. It did not taste good even. We didn't even able to complete that, it's a horrible experience.

Beverages:
_______________
‚àö pub special (gueva) : it taste really poor. Very disappointed.

‚àö  tango and cash mocktail: seems to be some syrup without any taste. Disappointing.

Now coming to dessert:
_________________________

‚àö Fried ice cream: it's also a disappointment. 


There service is quite good. But trust me the items we tried all are really disappointed. Only what i found the continental dish is quite good.

All that cost 1970 INR.

It's a pretty bad experience.

This might be the newest kid in the block around sector 5 and it is trying its best to conquer its place among the biggies. 
*****Decor - full marks, kind of hard rock cafe vibes (minus the instruments)
*****Ambience - Shades and lights combined gives a nice feel.
*****Liquor - A bit expensive but it won't disappoint you !! Cocktails like mint/apple martini, watermelon margarita, Harvey Wallbanger stirs up the taste.
*****Food - Lamp chops, Barbecue chicken, Chilli lamb are some of their bests.
P.S. their newly introduced lunch buffet menu (Drink+Main Course+Dessert) is pretty great.

Though it's not that top-listed yet, it's expected that very soon it'll claim it's place.

First- great ambience... The place is great and it definitely gives the feeling of a place in Britain. 4 of my colleagues went on lunch on a package of 279+taxes with a non veg meal plan. We had red wine, which was okayish. The pepper chicken steak in mushroom sauce was great. One of my colleagues had lamb steak in red wine sauce, which was a bit undercooked. And finally, there was vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, which is the best of them all. We asked for extra chocolate sauce, which was happily provided. The food servings were swift and fine timed. Thumbs up for this place.

Like they all say..... If you like it appreciate it.. Not just criticize.... we were going to an entirely different destination for lunch.... when we noticed this place. With a lot of expection in heart we got in. I must say it exceeded all our expectations with it's palatial decor inside.... very well manifested planning with all wooden furnitures with cushioned chairs.. wooden railings on one side enclosing a few tables.. raised wooden platform for a few sitters on the other side.. centrally located huge bar with associated bronze British idols on the rack.. one dance floor at the back with a well arranged DJ.. though the dance floor is a bit small.. glass painted dividers.. shiny mosaic tiles with dim chandeliers adding to the ambiance.. That's more or less how it looks.. 

Now regarding the food.. firstly we ordered continental.. However after sometime the chef came back stating continential area is still not ready we can start with the Chinese. Peopler serving here should basically speak in either Bengali or Hindi if they are finding it difficult in English otherwise pronounciation changes the entire meaning. However, they are very well behaved and well dressed. Probably trying to keep a pace with the decor is what they are struggling with.

Food is interestingly priced. They have almost all the dishes in 279 and more. Interesting part is if you just pay 279 plus taxes you can choose one main course and one side dish.. along with it you get an ice cream with chocolate sauce complimentary and choice of drink.. (Can be anything of the mentioned ones - White rum based mojito or soup or fresh lime or premium wine or soft drink etc). Which altogether is just enough for what a person generally looks for. If you take conti similar pricing stays.. We took few of them which tasted above average. The one which I took was Roast Chicken Fried Rice and Grilled chicken gravy which tasted pretty good.. We had Peking duck noodles too. Taste wise I would say it's quite standard and tasty however not at par with their own ambience. Talking about Pocket pinch.. it's quite pocket friendly.. came upto 700+ for two of us after what we ordered as mentioned above. Hookah people are welcome. People can have some real good moments with the classy royal feeling.

They are good to host parties as well which need 15 days prior information.

Overall it's good to try the place now..

The greatest part about this restaurant is it's ambiance but sadly that's the be all and end all. The plush leather sofas, the moody wallpaper and dim lights set the tone perfectly. The bar is one of the best looking ones I've seen in the city. However the  food is just menh, neither good or bad enough to remark on it. The chilli lamb was however amazing. The music of the place does not suit the overall ambience at all as it plays typical club music. And the smoking room has some extremely chauvinistic posters.

This restaurant have introduced a budget 3 course lunch menu. That was the main attraction of our visit. The ambience is good but lighting should be a bit more. In the meal, we took blue heaven mocktail. In main course I took chicken Shanghai rice and shredded chicken in red pepper. The quantity and taste was satisfactory. In dessert they gave vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. It was a value for money lunch.

But next time when I went there with my friends after my exams, we were denied entry because we were in our college uniforms. I mean our attire is none of your business. This was really disgusting and I won't like to visit this place again.

The food is upto the mark. The bill will not cause too much pain. The music is refined. The seating arrangement is also cleverly placed with the bar counter in the middle. I will suggest this place for a small reunion or for celebration purpose. I was really contended with the service, the ambience, food. Will surely love to visit again and again.

They are currently running a promotion where for Rs 355 incl Tax you can have 1 soft drink/beer/cocktail, 1 main course item and a desert. This is a pretty good offer given that you choose from continental, Indian and chinese for your main course. The decor is like a typical british pub. Good soothing music. Given the offer is to attract office crowd during lunchtime so tends to get noisy. Opted for chicken cheese lasagna and Mojito. There was only 2 cocktail choices. You dont have desert option..they only have vanilla icecream. Quality wise the maincourse really lives upto the ambience however the cocktail is below par. Overall good option for a team lunch.

Went to dis place on a Sunday afternoon.. firstly loved the ambience.. english pub themed decor.. with a soft music in background.. the playlist had nice tracks..
Secondly the staffs were really well behaved.. they were veey helpful..
Now coming to the food. We ordered chilli lamb.. which was really spicy.. way more spicy for a normal taste bud to handle.. but me and my friend loved it..
The chinese platter served chilli fish.. 4 pcs chicken drumstick, garlic chicken and dumplings.. all of them tasted awesome..
The only disappointment (although a slight) was in drinks.. they did not have draught beer.. there were many in the menu but they only had kingfisher and heineken... in flavored vodka they only had coffee flavored vodka..
Overall a very nice place to be.. will surely visit again to try the shephard's pie and chicken lasagna..

To start with it's one of the best place I have ever been to ! From the ambience to the food to the behaviour with the guests everything was top class!
The ambience reflects to that of the French era, symbolizes the famous UK 10 downing street.
The location is prime. For starters we had a kebab platter which not only looked mouth watering but tasted yummy too. For main course we had lasagne and let me tell you that was the show stopper! We also had chicken steak which was also good. We even tried a few mocktails which was awesome and along with it the complimentary cocktails added to the happiness :*
This place is new, fresh and full of energy!
Love to visit again.

 TDS staff - poor service
food quality - average
Lack of booze options - varieties are listed in menu but not available

I will not recommend Kolkata TDS if looking for some good time with friends...

Has a good old charm and you feel really good after entering the place. They have happy hours where certain stuff is priced only at 99. Do try that .
We ordered non veg platter which had good mix of chicken , mutton and fish. Chicken noodles and rice was good as well . Serving is less for chicken wings . 
Service needs to improve dramatically. Staff had to be reminded time and again to serve quickly. We went at non - peak hours but still the service was slow . Sheesh is also served .
It's a great place to chill out with friends!

Well to start it off.. the ambience of the place is like that of an authentic bar/pub.. well as authentic as it can be here..
I loved the decor and that soft music playing..
The staff was quick to address issues..
Started with chilli lamb.. it was really good.. it was spicy too.. a bit much for those who can't handle it,like my friend..he had literally teara flowing down his cheeks üòÇ
Then we ordered (and we didn't know they had a combo offer) the following dishes and with them we got a free mocktail(only 2 are free) and dessert which is an ice cream
The chicken stroganoff was awesome and so was lamb bourignan(sorry,maybe the spelling is wrong)
But we also wanted to try a dish that all the friends fan out there have heard it.. Shepherd's pie.. it was delicious and the dish itself looked awesome.
Ice cream was good .
The lighting in the place though can be a bit bright and they took a bit too much time to provide the order, i would highly recommend this place.

Went here again after few months and ordered a lot of stuff and they were all awesome.. but forgot to edit the review and thus forgot the names.. :'(

An excellent place to chill out with your friends! Honestly the decor has been such tastefully done that it completely lives up to the expectation of the idea of "10 Downing Street " .. but apart from that we had ordered for LIT and Mojitos which were really good. Every starter that we ordered was satisfying to our tastebuds.. special mentions are Valentino prawns n the salt n pepper chicken.. we are also looking forward to the ladies nights on Wednesdays.. all in all a very good up to the mark Restuarant !

The decor seems straight out of mediaeval British museum. Simply Classic. Well lit and feels warm.

The food served in good quantity and the service is good too. The taste of the food is also good. We had ordered a platter and every item in there tasted good. 

Unfortunately Visited on Thursday when they don't serve drinks so couldn't stay there for long but the brief period we were there it was a good experience.

Didn't like this place. Visited twice. On the 1st visit they refused to serve alcohol as they were having issues with their bar licence. On the 2nd visit i liked the decor and the ambience. But they didn't have the basic beers inspite of being mentioned in the bar menu.Its gives you the feel of an european pub.Didn't like their playlist at all. Smoking room the best place of this restaurant with its own posters and decor. Food is average.

Went for a late lunch on a Sunday.Got the place thankfully.Situated at the heart of Sector 5.The place is always bustling wit people. So many options to explore for food and drinks.Yet this place stands out. A fav hangout place for many.As you enter the place you are welcomed wit a magnificent setting.Ground plus a floor abv.We dint go for starters (we wud surely try in our next visit) as we were already late for lunch. The main course was mouth watering and exquisite. Tried limited items and relished each one of them.Drinks were worth it.

Sheer disappointment. I will leave here as soon as my drink is over.
Do what you were meant to do. You'd be better.

But it's a good drink. A strong LIT, and spicy nachos.

First, this is a chain of English feel Pubs.
I loved it in Chennai and couldn't wait to visit it in Calcutta.

What I actually got was place with the d√©cor of a club and the volume and lights of a night club.
So it did neither role well.

10 Downing Street is located near RDB, sector v,salt lake.This was very spacious than 10 downing Street of Hyderabad.I never tried Virgin Mary, so I ordered. That was nothing but pure tomato juice.I tried to complete it but didn't happen.Ambience was great but service was little bit slow.

Everything lies in the name of this joint. The intriguing name took me to this place. The decor is superb, the layout is fantastic. A British touch cannot be denied. Another catch aspects of this place is the taglines in their washrooms, Read Enjoy Laugh alone. Anyway its main concern is food and drinks and I should not sway from it, well trying to. Their menu is not at all innovative and new. Located in a place that houses similar other places, you got to have everything above everyone. This is where they are lacking, quality wise food is above average but i felt variety is poor. Another turn off was their excuse of not serving hookah as they were unable to cope up with the increased demand and hence could not replenish their stock, i mean who gives such an excuse in such a competitive market. The build up to this place was superb revolving around the intriguing name, i had expunged the possibility of this being an average place, but was proved wrong. Guys be innvotaive with the menu and keep your stocks full. Cheers.

Classy with a modern touch- that‚Äôs how I would like to describe this place.. Finally this franchise opened up in Kolkata at one of the most happening locations, just adjacent to Infiniti Benchmark building.. Having prior experience of visiting TDS at Indore I do have high hopes going in and it did live up mostly to my expectations.. What was more delightful, they provided 20% corporate discount on food on producing the ID card..

This place boasts of a huge array of Alcohol, Cocktails and an extensively covered pub grubs menu to satiate your palate.. TDS is truly an old world British Pub in all aspects.. The huge chandelier, the high pub stools, the extravagant couches to the wall decors, you will feel like entering some Royal Brit Ballroom.. Green seemed to be the chosen color alongwith brick finished walls.. The interior is huge with multiple seating arrangements and a wooden stair leading to a mezzanine floor.. Service still has areas for improvement as we need to ask twice for waters and time and again the server would delay while responding to your call.. Since this place serves multi-cuisine menu we opted for a mix and match:

Roast Chicken: Chicken roasted and saut√©ed with tomatoes, spring onions and black pepper resulting in a delectable affair.. A perfect companion for a bottle of chilled beer, the portions were generous and the chicken was soft and aptly cooked..

Loose Prawns: Seemed to a house specialty as have never tasted this before in any other pub of the city.. Basically open wanton baskets comprising spot prawns tossed with onions, tomatoes and capsicums in a peppery base, even the baskets were crisp and tasteful.. Passionately Recommended..

Soya Chili Fish: Ordered on the servers recommendation.. overdone with soy sauce resulting in a bit bitter taste.. felt that they need to add a few more fish starters to their menu..

Tava Fish: This was better, basically fish fillets pan tossed with Indian spices and topped with coriander leaves.. it was spicy, it was tangy and the dish served piping hot tasted blissful..

Alongwith the food we ordered 1 large Bacardi Super, 2 large Smirnoff, 3 Heineken 330ml, 3 LIIT to accompany the long hours of conversation.. We felt that they still need to work on their LIIT to hit the right balance and kick.. The presentation of the dish deserved special mention being done in concurrence with modern global cuisine.. Overall our total cheque was Rs. 3953/- (all incl.) for 3 people.. Definitely this place is not for the regular drinks but a nice option for a Grand Evening, once in a while..

Food: 4/5

Pricing: 3/5

Service: 4/5

Ambiance: 5/5

We went to 10 downing street on Valentine's eve. There was a contest going on the FB page of 10 downing street. Luckily I was one of the winners who got complimentary couple dinner voucher. I was told that all food & mocktail would be on them and if we order alcoholic drinks it would be on us. We entered 10 DS and we were welcomed by the manager and waiters. As soon as I told them about my¬† voucher they told me as assured without alcoholic drinks every thing is complementary and unlimited. 

We ordered - 
Cinderella, Fruit Punch & Lime Soda, Ceaser salad, potato wedges ( I am in love with the wedges), butterfly prawn(it was awesome), chicken wings ( some of the wings were hard but many were soft too), Lamb chops (again it was good) and Tandoor platter ( I was too full to have that , but my fiance had that and told it was good). Lastly, we ordered fried ice cream - this was something I never had and loved it very much. 

The ambiance was awesome and they were playing soft romantic songs. We two were amazed. 
They gave me one chocolate as we entered DS. 

Overall, the experience was so good. Thank you 10 DS.

It was 9th September. We were wondering where to go to for lunch the next afternoon. I wanted to do something special the next day because it was my partner‚Äôs birthday. So I came back home from university and sat in front of computer and opened Zomato.  I was going through all the popular Dine outs in Kolkata but everything was looking expensive and the cheaper ones didn‚Äôt excite me much. And I almost gave up hope and thought tomorrow is just going to get wasted because of my foolishness. And I was sitting down with an unhappy face. Suddenly this restaurant came to my notice, most probably in the second page of popular eateries with not so high pinch in the pocket. 

I opened the menu card and looked at the various items it served. From Continental to Chinese to Indian, and I was puzzled to choose which one among the many. So I made a plan. Let her choose which one she wants after all it was her day tomorrow. And that‚Äôs exactly what happened.  She saw the menu card and was bewildered. Then finally we ordered a Chinese and a Continental dish which included two mock tails and two ice creams. 

The only con about this place is that it‚Äôs very far from almost every residential locality, located in Sector 5 opposite the RDB cinemas. But the pros outstands the only con. Once we entered this place, it was just as cool as possible, the soft music, the ambience, the bar type sitting arrangement in the middle, with tables for the couples and every other group throughout the area. The waiters were friendly and nice too. The food was good, but the quantity was little less than the usual. But with this kind of atmosphere everything is manageable. 

I would suggest everyone to visit this place at least once, to experience the freshness of this bar cum restaurant. And you won‚Äôt be disappointed, I promise.

This place is right in the heart of the sector 5 area and is quite spacious from within! Even though the drinks menu looks fancy it doesn't taste extra ordinary. On the other hand the food menu though simple offers standard but nice food. The starters - crispy chili babycorn and the veg tandoori platter were really nice though the main course wasn't that good. Overall a nice place to hangout!

First time at 10 Downing Street, nice decor, music is good but found it pretty loud for a Friday night with 70% occupancy. If you are going for dinner with friends where you wanna chat and catch up - in that case, I would suggest some other place however, it's a fun pub and has nice dance floor. "Smoking room" is pretty big too. Food was good and affordable. 

Overall a fun place to be if you wanna get drunk and dance to the core!!!

Located in the heart of asrctor V, 10 Downing Street is indeed a nice pub for drinks and food. The interiors are brilliant and will definitely give you a feel of England. The bar area is really amazing with the grandiloquent chandelier. We ordered chicken drumsticks: they were spicy and juicy, too good actually. Then we had mixed hakka noodles and chilli chicken: both were amazing. The staffs were nice and friendly.

The food was awesome. So was the interior. And the service, outstanding.
So first of all the ambience was cozy and warm and since it was the Republic Day, the theme added tone to the place. It is a beautiful place for intimate formal meetings or for a party with friends. With booth sitting and dimly lit lights creating a homely feel to the table. The table itself gives a sheer feel of perfection. We ordered a minimal meal of chicken teak with bread and lamb with rice. Other places did not serve the rice/breads as far as I was concerned. So that pleased me. Then comes the service, The waiters were as sweet as they could be. Even I had low battery and as I searched for a charge port, they took it on themselves and helped me through it, and all through my dining, the phone was kept on charging (with no extra charges for electricity, as many other places did). With hookah on demand and with adequate television systems, one can even enjoy the ambience, if left alone. I gave it a 5star, you go and give a visit and feel it for yourself.
And just so I finish let me add another small detail, it is not at all a huge pocket pinch. With a total of 650/- we had a tummy-filling lunch.

The ambience of this place is fabulous. I would give a 5* for that but the food is pretty average. Went to this place today with a friend. We had ordered Chinese platter and Garlic rice with Vegetable Manchurian, it was very ordinary, nothing that would make you feel that its quite delectable or out of the world! However, the quantity is very good, one dish is quite sufficient for two people, so do not order more at one go. My only disappointment was their lack of enough drinks on their bar tab. Its very limited, and lacks even the mention of well known beer and Indian whiskey. 
All in all, if you are someone on the lookout who's willing to try a restaurant and visits the place because of its interiors and decors, then this place is for you! Do visit this place if you want to enjoy a great ambience and click some great selfie with friends!

Here we have another pub in the sec 5, 10 Downing Street boasts of a chic interior and decor. The chandelier is pretty while the rest if the furniture can is colonial in design. There is also a dance floor however the track selection of music doesn't justify of it being a clubbing place.
The food here is quite good. We had tasted chicken kebabs and garlic crispy chicken in starters while in mains we ordered for a chicken lasagne. The lasagne was delicious and garlic chicken was good too. The kebabs were generic.
The place however lacks the energy and can feel boring at times. Service is just about ok. A pubbing place like this needs to pull up in terms of creating a vibrant environment. All in all we would like to bisit here again!

So far I've only tried a couple of their dishes and they were nothing extraordinary to be honest. Some of my friends rated this place so highly and hence I had high expectations but it didn't live up to the hype. Need to try a few more dishes here and hopefully increase the rating in the near future.

10 Downing Street promises a great ambience coupled with mouth watering dishes. That is what the old saying goes. Unfortunately the restaurant banks with its previous reviews and the fact that it provides a "fine dining" experience to people who go there.

Having said that, the food quality has fallen quite a bit. More so has their attitude towards pleasing customers. My friend and his father had gone today for a quiet family dinner, but had a terrible experience. I write this review on behalf of them.

Firstly, LOUD EDM music during dinner time? Seriously? Secondly, if you had a party going there, why did you guys prompt customers to come inside and take a seat? You could have politely turned them away saying the floor was booked. When my friend asked to reduce the volume, the restaurant didn't keep his request and said weird things about how the volume would go up as the night would progress.¬†

Seems like you guys need to revise your hospitality management syllabus. ¬†Please do so, and save yourselves from reviews like this. ¬†Also, please if your managers cannot speak proper fluent English, at least don't pull gimmicks and send away people wearing Indian ethnic clothes. Pathetic.

I went here today for lunch with group of 9 people. we have ordered lots of different kinds of dishes and had a mixed experience.

We have ordered Chinese Platter, Tandoori Platter, Chili Lamb, Szechuan Lamb in starter. All of them were pretty good in taste, quantity was good but not exactly value for money.

In main courses, we have ordered Chinese and continental. Chicken Bamboo Rice, Lemon Garlic Chicken, Mushroom Noodles, Pepper Sauce Chicken, Chili Garlic Noodles, Thai Curry Chicken, Chicken Pasta Basilico & Chicken Lasagna. Chinese dishes were good but not extra ordinary with respect to its prices. Not typical Chinese tastes. Chicken pasta was good in taste. We had ordered two, but in one dish no chicken was there. Lasagna was not properly baked, not good in taste also, even toppings were not properly in it.

Lastly, we have faced very pathetic service there today. They took more than 45 minutes to serve the main courses, still some foods were not properly cooked.

Nice place good ambience but a very disheartening hospitality. It was very shocking that we being in the group of 15 were denied for simple things like Papad , peanuts, etc. The staffs were to jittery to do simple things such as split of mocktails in two glasses for small kids. Such comfortable and strong sofas meant for guests convenience but the manager did not have a hesitation to stop a 14yr old boy on sitting on the arms of the sofa. Agreed 10 Downing Street is an international chain but rules very shocking is against the pleasure and convenience of its customers.

10 Downing Street is an excellent pub located at Sector V near RDB. The ambience is a resemblance to the British architecture. However, like all good pubs should be, their drinks and food are excellent and well priced. I request the DJ to play some more happening songs. Rest all are top notch. We had many sumptuous dishes, the best Chicken Stragnoff.

I have been a fan of was a kid. This was the pub at Mayfair Bhubaneswar and we used to be regulars at the joint. I understand that it has no affiliation whatsoever with the Bhubaneswar outlet whatsoever but I found a stark similarity with the decor and ann mbience. nThaannsame all wood decor with the English sofas and chandeliers . The bar counter needs a special mention as it immediately transports you into a
But last night I was disappointed with the food that was served. Me and my fiance had been there hoping to get a drink but unfortunately they weren't serving alcohol.

In terms of food , we ordered the Chicken Lasagna and The Crispy Chilli Garlic Noodles.

The Lasagna was good but they over did the Cheese . I mean I know it's supposed to be cheesy but it was too much and nothing over done is ever nice.

Coming to the Chilli Garlic Noodles. It was a disaster. I mean you could have called it jst noodles. I have had Chilli Garlic noodles at over a 100 places but this was nothing like anything. It was plain, bland, had only slit green chilli's and not a hint of Garlic. I don't know if this was a one off affair, but if this is the regular Chilli Garlic noodles , you should do some homework.

Looking forward to being there and trying out the other dishes on offer.

Good food, nice decor, comfortable seating and overall, an impressive ambience. Visited this restaurant for lunch with colleagues since it is located in our office building. We availed their lunch combo - chicken soup, one portion of non-veg dish (indian or chinese), one portion of naan/kulcha/jeera rice or chinese rice or noodles and ice-cream as dessert. The food, both indian and chinese were lovely, every bit of it. I particularly loved the butter chicken and mutton handi (finger licking good). The service was decent. Overall a good experience. Would love to visit again. A couple of points to note, lunch combo is available from 12 noon to 4 pm. Another thing is they take service charge just like Pizza hut do. So dont be surprised if the tax component is a little high.

Ambiance is nice, but in terms of service it is one of the worst restaurants I have ever visited. Amidst lunch we found a strand of hair in the non-veg platter. When the matter was reported, the restaurant's staff member did not bother to replace the platter. They did not even offer an apology. To worsen the situation, the staff members kept arguing that the hair (that was wrapped around a kebab) actually came from our end. So, overall a good establishment, but I would not like visit the place again.

One lavish establishment , spread over a huge space on groundfloor with a squarish bar illumated by a huge chandelier in the middle , low couches as well as high tables , one library section , one private corner , a flight of stairs to the mezzaine floor , everything lit with gloomy yellow lights in a set up dominated mainly by wood and leather seats giving vibe of vintage english pub with posh and royal arrangements . There was a small section on the upper level with some drums and instruments kept , guess for some live performances , band shows or stand up comedies. The washrooms are nicely planned as well and one empty area , that may be converted to a dance floor if needed. Overall the interiors will definitely amaze you.

No liquor license yet does not justify the ambience . They at times serve alcohol during weekends , also it will be available today onwards till the year ending as the staff informed us . Yesterday it was quite empty with very few guests, so not a happening experience for us .

Next i was quite surprised seeing the menu which has options in chinese , indian as well as continental and the rates were so reasonable. Most of the starters and main course plates come in and around Rs 250. Worth trying isn't it !!

We ordered

STUFFED CHICKEN MUSHROOM - spiced chicken mince stuffed in mushrooms and baked with cheese. MUST TRY item for mushroom lovers. Those were balls of pure happiness.

FRIED FISH N CHIPS : classic dish. No chips but fries with three fiillets . Tartar sauce was nice, no complains.

CHICKEN PEPPER STEAK : one large breast of tender chicken topped with not so peppery brown sauce with overdominating shredded mushroom , with more than sufficient amount of herb rice and some sauteed vegetables. It was a filling platter.

Dessert section dissapointed us , there wasn't a dessert menu and we were given choices between fried ice cream and brownie , which we skipped.

The food was value for money and service was satisfactory as well.

While the brand name is derived from the British PM's iconic address in London, sadly, British culture ¬†have also creeped in. Their rule of not allowing anyone who is wearing sandals is callback to the colonial times ("No Indians and Dogs Allowed"). Also, the food is not up to the mark for the prices they charge. I would recommend everyone who are turned off by their snobbish wanna-be colonialist attitude, should perhaps be better off by taking their business to a lovely establishment called One Sports Lounge nearby. Saved money, had a better experience and lip-smacking food.¬†

Yours truly,
The Rs. 10,000/- business you refused yesterday.

With a typically british like interior with a small dance floor , a private section for parties and a full bar the place looks very impressive . The food was amazing - the tandoori platter and saute vegetables if u are a veggie fan is a must try - 
Food - amazing

Writing this as we still eat.. The pasta is as bad as the starters are good! We ordered a mixed sauce pasta and it turned out sweet...  I mean sweet? Why??? So we call the waiter and he assures us that pasta will always be sweet - whether it's red, white or mixed sauce. So we give him the benefit of doubt for his ignorance and ask for the chef. Mr wobbling chef assures us pasta in white sauce will be perfect - so we order that - and to our delight - its sweet as a Rossogulla! 
All the best to those who plan to visit here - we definitely won't again! üò¨

This is Junk restaurant. My wife and self came here for dinner. I parked my car and asked the man at gate for a table for 2. He stopped me just because I was wearing open shoes (sandals). I have been to many many restaurants in Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi and Kolkata, even in US and Thailand. Never seen a crap restaurant questioning on the comfort attire of guests. This is a ridiculous restaurant I have ever seen. BEWARE!!

Went there on 23rd November for dinner with few people. We had a prior booking made. As I was entering the gate alone, two person one on the left and a fat bouncer on the right, both stopped me showing their fore finger....just imagine their way. I was shocked at such pathetic courtesy and unprofessional behavior. A courteous & appropriate way to greet patrons and query them (if any) is required. A lady was just standing and staring the whole thing without a say to such bad attitude. I later came to know she was the Manager there. Coming to the food, starters were good, main course (North Indian) just ok, nothing great. Dal Makhani didn't taste good at all. Service ok. Ambiance ok. Overall decent food made bad by unwanted behavior and dismal body language.......

Ten Downing Street it is people ! Really wanna know as to why this name though. Anyways. My first thought as I entered was- Wooaah ! Really glad for Kolkata.

-The first thing that caught my eye was the magnificent bar adorned with huge light bulbs all around. The center of attraction was the gigantic chandelier hanging from the beautiful wooden hollow grid ceiling which looked grand.¬†
-The next thing that caught my eye for a really long time was the drum set peacefully resting in the Romeo-Juliet Veranda. Can never move my eyes when I see a Drum Set OR such verandas ! Both together, was a sight for me ! How I wish I knew the drums. Would be magical to play the them on that kind of a veranda !¬†
-The flooring- Beautiful ! (I'm thinking of something to complaint about.) I really fancy brick walls. And you people have nailed it. The twin antique lights adds to the charm.
-The entire place had been detailed and very well balanced with frames and antiques and the colours and lights etc. Appreciate the efforts you have put into the design of this place. Wonderful.

Coming to the food, we couldn't order much since we went post dinner. But still, had ordered for-

Virgin Mary
Veg Chinese Platter (Had to take-away)
Alfredo Pasta

Till now, no complaints with the food or service. Have to try more dishes from the menu for a better judgement of the food. :)

Very well done. *Applauds* :D

I recently visited this place and had a terrible experience. The interiors were really nice and it felt good sitting in a nice ambiance but the food takes away all the pleasure. We ordered for a chinese platter and what arrived at the table was nothing more than a Tomato puree platter. The Babycorn and the wantons were probably dipped and soaked in tomato puree for 24 hours before they were served, just imagine how soggy both were. The potato fitters were oily and tasteless. The only thing that was probably edible in the platter was spring roll which has some taste because it had salt unlike other items on the plate.And above that they really don't care about customer satisfaction. ¬†I told this to the waiter but he reacted as if he didn't care. I even wrote my review and handed over to them but there was no call or mail to resolve the issue by the management till date.

Awesome place in Sector v Salt Lake. As you enter you feel the grand ambience of a British Pub, with complete wooden interiors, tastefully decorated. As I took my seat , I was greeted by a pleasant server, who took care of my table till the end. I carefully observed, the Outlet was managed in a seamless fashion, though it was busy and crowded. The menu price will pinch your pocket, as its on the higher side. But if you want a drink with your friends in a premium place, try this one!! I tried their mocktails and they were well made and well presented. Staff look professional. Overall a good experience

Visited on SATURDAY at 5.30pm
And there actually was quite a lot of crowd! UNEXPECTED! 
Ambience: Decor is like every other Pub in London. It is spacious, and well organised. Also has a mezzanine floor,ideal for parties and get togethers.
Food: The Chinese platter was not up to the mark,but can be tried if you want to try all Chinese starters together. Quantity of the platter is sufficient for 4 people. The spinach and corn lasagne was good,a must try but a little on the cheesier side.Ordered a Pasta Neapolitan which didn't taste anything like a pasta, thank god we had oregano and chilly flakes to our rescue.
Drinks: Ordered a basic sweet lime soda, and it was decent.
Hookah: It took them 20minutes to get us one hookah. Really disappointing.
You can try this place, not that bad but wouldn't really recommend you to go here. There are many more better place! Plus cleanliness is extremely poor.

Zomato is slightly misleading by showing "full bar available" when actually they haven't got the liquor licence yet,and all u get are mocktails which are nothing extraordinary.the food is average and the waiters aren't fully trained yet.but the ambience is very good and it has got great potential to become one of the happening places in Kolkata once they get the liquor licence.

I will say the ambience 1st...
Like superb ambience, a must visit place just for this only. The lighting the decor like every thing was superb.
Now about the food tried an altogether different mock fail and yes the courtesy goes to the waiter who suggested us for the same... the mocktail had not sweet stuff in it it was spiecy in nature... now about the the lazania and the lamb with herb rice the quality was just superb.
But the again I loved the lazania more and about the other dish I loved the herb rice more than the lamb.
About the price yes it's on the higher side. But yes the pice and quality goes hand in hand. In other word you must visit the place at least once if not more.

The dj looked bored since there was no one at the floor! He thought he was killing it by mixing old classics such as Bon Jovi and GnR but in the process he was killing the song! Nevertheless it's good

This time when I came to Kolkata, I decided to go to this place and boy! It did live upto the expectations! Classic English style pub, good hospitality. Even hukka was available, good songs making the ambiance even better..Since then, I have started comparing almost every pub to this place as this sets on a benchmark. I simply loved this place. Even if you don't have company, just come, chill and unwind. We had ordered Chicken Stroganoff, chicken lasagna. Both were good. One thing which I felt bad was when the first time I tried entering, I went with my sister. They wrote our names, stamped on our wrists and allowed us to enter. A lady came up and asked for identity cards. She asked if we were above 21 years. My sister was not. So she requested that since security is very strict we should leave. I'm okay to comply with rules but then why did you allow in the first place! Even then I didn't think it to be a issue. The very next day I came with my friends. No identity checking and all. Well and good. Even that lady was there. But I saw a couple with a kid and their friends (along with the couple) entering. Fine maybe she allowed because the kid was a minor and had guardians, but what kind of guardians are they who were making their kid inhale hukka was the kid was puffing and giving weird facial expression and the couple were laughing! All I'm saying is that if you want to show strictness, be uniform!

It was a Diwali catch up with a dear friend and we wanted it to be special. Both of us have known each other for eons and have almost too much in common, so when we look for a place to eat, we usually look for one that serves good food and alcohol.

Having heard much about this place we went there on Diwali afternoon for a quiet lunch to mull over things. The decor is understated and holds potential to transform the place into a classy affair. However, there definitely is scope for improvement. We ordered a watermelon caprioska and peach margarita for drinks. The drinks tasted fine all right, but I got a peach martini in place of the margarita. Not that I really minded - but the details count for someone like me. Also the wine collection is severely limited.

For food, we went for chicken wantons in a sauce, barbequed lamb chops, and fish and chips. We divided all three amongst us. The wantons were nice and tasty and I recommend them. The lamb chops were a disaster - they were tough and fraught with bones. My hands started to pain trying to manoeuvre my knife and fork and in the end I just gave up and asked the waiter to take my plate away. The fish and chips were strictly OK - honestly I have never visited a place that serves one large, one medium, and one small piece of fish in a dish of fish and chips.

For dessert, we were offered just two options - deep fried ice-cream and ice-cream on brownie. I loathe deep fried desserts, so we had to go for option two. Again, it was strictly OK. 

For the 2.5k that we got billed, I would seriously ask for better food and service or I am not considering this place as a lunch/dinner option. I could do a couple of drinks, but then again Opium is bang opposite and has good food at much cheaper rates.

I'm writing this review from 10 Downing Street itself. This is my first visit to the place and I'm really awed by the ambience and space. This place has huge potential be one of the best pubs in the city but only if the management realizes. To start with let me start by pointing out the negatives (just being a little critical because I love this place and would like it to prosper), the staff is a little inattentive, coasters are missing, only fork at the table without knife and spoon (when asked for it the staff brought the knife with his bare hands without wrapping them in a napkin), mocktail was served and the drink was dripping from all sides making it messy, all of a sudden the music decibel was unbearable when asked a staff, said that they will not be able to control the volume... apparently it will increase with the hour. Enough said...I don't want to throw this place under the bus...just that if the Management and Staff are little more cautious and skilled....it will be an amazing place. The food tastes quite good and I'm sure it will improve with time. Please do not fade away in the competition rather turn it into Paradise.

Location is near RDB Boulevard. Ambience is good. But I won't say food is awesome. We went there 12 people together for a small team lunch. In starter, tandoor platter was good with a healthy quantity, more than enough for 2 people to share. Same goes with veg platter. But Reshmi Kebab and Garlic Kebab was just ordinary. Chicken Lasagna was very tasty. Hunan Chicken as well as Kung Pao Chicken was good enough. I won't say those were awesome, but more or less good. Fried ice-cream was a disappointment. They served a large scoop within some cover made from coconut. Not at all worthy.
Service was good and they really helped us in choosing menu. Music was not loud, more or less soothing. Not very much overpriced. So, if you want to try some new restaurants at Sector 5, you can try it.
Note: They don't provide corporate discount

After entering to this place the ambiance we felt was just wow like we entered to a place other than just a restaurant in Kolkata. But the disappointment came when it came to ordering the food. Cocktails were in the menu but was not available. Also the menu we saw and went to the place was not same as the menu given to us. Many dishes were not present. We ordered Valentino prawns and special downing strt kebab as starters. Valentino prawns were awesum but the chicken kebab was ok ok. In the mains were took chicken lasagne which was good but could have been better. We also took hakka noodles and 2 chinese chicken dishes in the mains. They tasted good but not extraordinary. The main disappointment came after we asked for deserts, they told only vanilla ice cream available, so skipped the deserts. It was a good experience. What really I liked is the ambiance and decor of the place which is just awesum.

The decor was British Club themed. The bar with enthusiastic bartenders shaking drinks and smoking shisha looked amazing. Food was fine, we had the grilled whole betki on the waiter's recommendation. It smelt fishy in places but wasnt bad overall. We had a glass of wine, a martini and a mocktail. 
But the noise, on Saturday, the 22nd October, was intolerable. It was average Bolly beats but it blared tastelessly, contrasting with the decor. Given its a resto_pub and not a disco, the volume and beats should be adjusted accordingly. It was tasteless and crass. We would have stayed longer had the music been better.

Visited the place with office colleagues for a birthday party. The place is good in terms of the quality of liquor it provides and the finger foods. However, the ambience can be better and so does the food quality. Though the music is apt for the dance floor, it need not be played in the whole dining area. A bit over priced for the quality of food served.

Very tasty food... Ambiance is just awesome ... U may click some nice snap as well and it will be DP worthy no doubt ... I tried some fish and chicken starters that were delicious... Starters and ambiance can pull you there again and again.. Main courses were also tasty... But moctails quality should be improved i believe though the moctails decorations are impressive üòä

Well, I was just here today for lunch. The combination meal which are available only during lunch time are an amazing option, although I should warn you that the quantity they serve is more for 1 person. Me and my friend ordered 2 of those and had a hard time struggling to finish. What gets me is that we were full so we left in a hurry. Later when I reached home, I realised they probably had a dessert option. Which I realised was to served after the meal. So that's the only reason I'm giving this a 2.5. Especially because we were there for a while after finishing our meal. Such a surprise.

This was my third visit to this place, everytime it just fulfilled all my expectations and came out with very good results.

Classic british ambience, place which is very easy to locate, near rdb cinemas, opposite to opium, in sector 5, not only the interiors, the outside view even, time you enter the main door, corporate park, it gives a royal üëë feeling, they have wide parking area, and even the building is beautifully designed.

Interiors here gives u a full feel of a pure british pub, rich and spacious, not only spacious and beautiful they have quality sitting arrangement, lovely loud music, and the highlight of place is their bar section, its just wow, that section above the counter, hanging glassses, so huge with full variety of drinks, its disappointing that still they don't have the license and that's have not started serving alcohol. Mocktails they serve are really good well crafted, looking forward for cocktailsüôà

Ambrosial sheesha n it amazing for food, appealing food presentation, appetizing menu with copious amount of food, tantalizing starters with fantastic epicurean taste, u can just munch on n get indulged.

Have already tried their kebab platter, veg hakka noodles. Well marinated encrusted variety of veg kebabs containing paneer tikka, some tricky baby corn dish, other with aloo, a roasted papad nd classic tangy flavoursome green chutney complementing the whole platter.

Places like this are like feathers to the crown of salt lake recently growing as a food hub of calcutta. Highly recommended!! Must visitüíú

Mark this place as a must-visit right now !
It was sosthi, and since we decided to see the saltlake pujas, a good lunch  was necessary. 
First of all this place is huge, and the ambience is straight outta a 70s restro pub. The waiters were all dressed up.  The bar is really a sight to see. With dim lightings and Chandeliers, it really puts  you in a good mood. 
We took a mocktail: Cinderella, good flavors and a nice aftertaste. It looks like the sunset drink I had at a cafe before. 
To the food now. We had #Barbequed Lamb Chops and a sumptuous plate full of #Chilli basil Fish. 
Both of those dishes were fantastic. The lamb chops were tender, grilled well and had a sweet and tangy flavor. Loved it. Loved the use of tamarind flavor in it.
The chilli basil fish was a star too. Light cumin and basil flavor which went really well with the pan seared fish.
Finally for the dessert we had the Fried Ice Cream, and it was a large one. Enough to be shared by two people.  
Looking forward to my next visit.

Ambience was good. It was really nice initially. Music is pathetic and top of that overtly loud, i could neither talk nor listen to my friend. Food was bad, but wont judge on that since it was during pujo. But my god the place is so costly. There was a series of taxes in between the basic rate and the price that we ultimately had to pay. Overall i was really dissapointed with the place.

Firstly its a awesome place...I have been there on last Friday with 14 of my friends and 1 of my friend was there with his daughter. As we all know we cannot enter into a pub with child so we have decided to move somewhere else. The the manager came out and allowed us to enter. Even she arranged a place for us @ upstairs.  Then we enjoyed a lot. The food quality, ambience, music, dj everything is fantastic. A must go for party lovers.Those people who served us they are aslo very joyful and well mannered. Again a special thanks to the lady manager.

Loved the place, too good of ambience. Visited yesterday on Navami pre dinner time.. The place is huge and was half-full. We went there fr catching up with few old friends over a couple of drinks and hookah. But upon entering we were told that they don't have bar license for that particular day. We were let down definitely, but we stayed back solely because of the ambience. Great music and the place has an amazing British feel to it. For the first time I heard a place in Calcutta play French music. Totally awesome. We ordered some hookah and light snacks. We longed to stay more, but due to lack of alchohol, we left in an hour's time. Wish to be back soon fr a detailed food review.

Stood up to the expectations considering the Interior and Location...food was overall ok ok....as in dishes were very less compared to the menu uploaded on Zomato...maybe coz of Puja time...
Now as per food...when I ordered Mix Sauce Pasta they said that they don't serve Mix Sauce...so I was like are you kidding me...how can you not serve Mix Sauce Pasta... although I got it afterwards but first reaction was like seriously....
Pasta was too dry...then Chilli Garlic Noodles were ok ok... lacked some puch though...Veg Au Gratin were good....and the Best was Chilli Mushrooms üòçüòçüòç like seriously I've become their fan for this Mushrooms.... whenever I visit this place it's for sure I'll have Chilli Mushrooms....
Over all food needs a little attention...but on a serious note the thing which needs serious attention is the Service... seriously I got so pissed that I was asking to cancel my order and I was ready to leave the place... It was seriously very difficult to get the waiter's attention....only to call the waiter we needed to look around and wait Eagerly as in we were in desperate need of his attention...
Service was seriously very very bad...
Just Thankful to God that we got Mr. Amit's attention...he was a good fellow... he was really polite and made us sit there for some more time... otherwise I would have left for sure...
Do look in this matter Management..!!
Overall Ok Ok..!!

Fancy name,amazing decor,good playlist but that's it.Wanted to get away from the crowd on saptami '16.Hence dropped in here.It is located near the RDB boulevard in sector 5.The place is beautiful,very impressive decor,they could have fit in way more tables in there but they focused on the spaciousness which is good.We had ordered a plate of chicken kebabs,Mixed fried rice and Hunan fish.Those were the worst kebabs I have ever tasted,tough,chewy and simply bad.The rice said mixed.So we expected shrimps to be in there.But no,only chicken n eggs.The fish had a way thicker batter and was salty.Overpriced.And disgusting food.Never ever ever coming back again.

A new addition to the city's limited number of pubs, 10 Downing Street creates a good first impression. With a large facade and ample parking, it opens to a very British pub feel inside with a bar in the centre. The music is loud though the sound quality leaves some room for improvement. The staff was friendly and efficient even on a Durga Puja day. Coming to the food, of the three starters we ordered, all of them were average. The meat was not tender, and the preparation nothing to right home about. For main course we ordered lasagna and noodles. Again, these too were satisfactory. Overall, a good place to enjoy a drink and hookah, and hang with friends. The food is just average so better to plan the grub somewhere else.

This place has potential if they can cut down on all the noise and play some decent music. For a pub named 10, Downing Street they play, rather blare, Punjabi and Bollywood songs. Only couples are allowed of the dance. The collection of liquor is quite good. But couldn't hang around for long because of the noise

We were a group of six and were prepared for lunch here at saptami noon.The order started with 1 Barbeque lamb and 2 hot basil chicken as starters. I really liked the hot basil chicken personally...as a result of which the 2nd one was reordered. If you are here you must try this hot basil chicken. Along with we hard a regular hookah. I ordered one small Johnnie Walker while my friends opted for vodka and mojito. Then came the big thing...the surprise of the lunch...the whole bhetki...and my friends ...I tell you it was finger licking and was served hot and crispy. With almost no room in stomach we ordered simple  main dishes of steamed/fried rice customised with Lamb Bourguignon, chicken Stroganoff, oyster chicken and chili garlic chicken...all food were up to mark and satisfied both our tongue and belly. The food is reasonable too as it all cost us around 6K excluding taxes. Last but not the least the interior is awesome with a bit loud music (may be because its a pub) and soothing ambience

To avoid the maddening crowd came to sector yesterday. Had heard a lot of nice things about the place. 
Coming to the pros first. Service was really good. Decor is really well done. The place is huge. The starters were good. Both in quantity and quality were well.
But the drinks are a complete let down. The biggest con in my eyes since it is supposed to be a pub.
They have no pitcher system which is fine. But the beer options are limited and priced way to high. The cocktails were a complete let down. Both the long island iced tea and sex on the beach. The taste somehow did not click and made me go wow. The mocktails were average. The spicy punch had no spiciness whatsoever and was a basic 'shaadi Bari' type drink and the virgin mojito was just average.
I was wanting to give a 3 but since it's the festive time and the place had no waiting time, giving the 0.5 extra.

it has become the worst from the best (1 month back). i went there for the 4th time and was really surprised to see staffs attitude. the only thing is good food they serve, but now they have reduced the menu to half. they stated that we will be getting the bar license soon, so they are avoiding north indian food. we got the water after 20 mins ( asking twice). food was still the same good quality. when we asked for the finger bowl - they took almost 15 mins even when there was not much rush there. i feel they are getting arrogant bcz now they are going to get the bar license. well i think managent should take the action for the sudden change in quality of service, otherwise there are so many good choices around - take pour house for example.

MESMERIZING! Everything at 10 d is just top notch. As soon as I entered 10 D, I was just floored looking at the ambiance. It felt like I was in England. The entire decor is very beautifully done. In love with the fire place and the bar area.

Coming to the food, we tried the lasagna, veg shashlik and the noodles. In love with all the dishes. My personal favorite is the lasagna. We also ordered for a couple of mocktails and they were perfect. Kudos to the bartender.

Service - Hospitality at its best!The waiters were very courteous and the service was super quick. They made sure we had a good time.

This place really brings you the interior of a majestic pub lounge. The decor and the lighting are music to eyes. Stuffs are good and helpful. Food is very good and above all the portions they serve per plate is hard to find anywhere in kolkata. Music is heart pumping with a dance floor to let yourself loose. Will visit again surely.

Yesterday (07/10/2016) we went to this place called 10 downing street. We were 5 families with a kid. We were mostly in Bengali ethnic wear (punjabi/kurta, pajama/jeans, open shoes) as it was Durga puja time and we were having an ethnic day in our office. 

Now we tried to enter waiter at the gate stopped us and called up one lady for reservation/entry. That lady was a 'British look alike' came out with a walky-talky and instantly said that we cannot be allowed to get in with those open shoes. We really had no clue. They we asked - "What do you expect people should wear shoes with this attire?". In reply, she simply said, "I understand sir, but we cannot allow". "Do you mean then you don't allow ethnic wears?" - we asked further. She again with a gentle smile replied - "<b>Yes, we do not allow ethnic wear </b>". 

Can anyone believe it? During Durga puja, in Kolkata, one restaurant is refusing 12 well dressed, with family people from entering into their restaurant just because they are wearing ethnic dress?i

Her attitude was simply redefined that phrase - "(Dogs and) Bengalis in their ethnic wear are not allowed".

And see just a couple of month back, how they celebrated Independence.

We, a group of 6 friends were meeting after sometime and we wanted the evening to be very special. Although I reserved in advance, we were offered a seat with 2 small oval tables. We soon realized it was getting little difficult to communicate with each other with the seating arrangement. So my friend requested the waiter to get a seat with an arrangement of one table instead of 2, where we all could be comfy with each other.
The waiter took us to the far corner and showed us a table near to the dance floor which was liked. He then helped us shifting. The lady manager came and started creating a scene. She bluntly told us that she cannot allow us there since the seats were reserved. We said that we did not intrude the area like that, we were shown the seats by the restaurant's own staff and then only we shifted. She kept on saying that the seats are for some "VIP guests". We were right from our end since we did not force in to the restaurant or the seats. She kept on saying the same thing. This conversation went on for sometime then she gave in. Once she gave in, the waiter came and said that "Ma'am, I tried to help you find a good seat and you this is what you did in return, now I will be in trouble".¬†
We just decided to leave the place. None of my friends were comfortable with the situation of the manager looking down upon us. Being a manager of a restaurant like that, a person should understand that people don't come there to just eat food, pay the bill and go home. People go there to enjoy. you cannot make them feel insulted.¬†
My friends had not finished the initial drink but we paid the bill and just left the place. While we were coming out, the lady tried to apologize, but it was really too late.¬†

We are regular visitors in sector 5. Although we were little bored with the same place, we went to Bar B Q Nation and had a great time.

No, it was not Park Street. It was our very own Sector 5, the IT hub in Salt Lake.
Neither was it Mocambo. It was a newbie in the Kolkata gastronomic map,: 10, Downing Street. 
But the saga of rejection was chillingly similar.
We were debarred from entry right at the doorway. All 12 of us. Between us, we represented some of the best Software Companies in Kolkata. But that is another story.
"Ethnic wear is not allowed here", the lady said in her outlandish English accent, traced to an origin between Tripoli and Timbuctoo. She seemed scandalised at the fine silk sarees and Fab India Kurtas we had on. 
"You absolutely must not come in with those open shoes", she stated in apparent disgust, gaping at the most refined Jodhpuri and Kolhapuri sandals we wore. 
It was ethnic wear day at office. We came straight for dinner from work, picking our families on the way. We all had ethnic clothes on. Perfectly respectable, genuinely Indian and decent dresses.
Yet she wouldn't let us in.
We argued. This is Kolkata, India. It is the time of our biggest festivities, the Durga Puja. Anyone wearing Western wear would look out of place now, we opined. 
Her chuckle was defiantly derisive. "You are not going in. We are not any other restaurant. We are 10, Downing Street."
We left, but not before I told her "Thou shalt be Mocambo-ed". 
How many years did you say we stopped being ruled by 10, Downing Street, London (office of the British PM)? 69 years?
Well, nothing has changed.
We will follow this through. We won't take it lying down. 
This happened on 6 October, 2016. The day was Maha Panchami of the Durga Puja. We all had dinner instead at Barbeque Nation next door, which was next door.

A catchy name And good decor can take you only part of the way !

We went for lunch from office on panchami
And the experience was horrible

Worst service imaginable (had to ask 4 times for a glass of water and 3 times for a fork)
The staff is indifferent with no menu suggestions, do not know about dishes

The bar was closed but we were informed of the same after we had placed orders for the starters

And the wait time for food boy o boy ... We even forgot what was ordered inspite of the place only 1/2 full and a truncated menuand the food quality is bad to average

Never going back !!!!

The place has a nice, eye catching interiors. The food tastes average. Plz note, that it is not a fine dining restaurant. The music is so loud that after a certain point of time, one will feel irritated. The tracks are not at all good. The ambience is good, but then the loud music destroys it all.

Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. ‚ô•
From the ambience to the food to the behaviour of the staffs, everything was amazing. We went in a group of 10 people yesterday.It was a birthday treat. And we spend nearly 3 hours there eating, clicking pictures,gossiping. It was ecstatic inside. Truly ecstatic. A british pub with a dance floor, fireplace, comfy sofas, bar (though they dont serve alcohol yet) and amazing tracks playing in the background. The food was tasty too especially the chicken lasagna ‚ô•
In short, we all loved it. :)
Thank you 10 Downing Street for sucha lovely time.

The one thing that stands out as soon as you enter is the ambience. But then, morning always doesn't show the day. Ordered Tangy Chicken and Lamb Bourguignon. While the Tangy Chicken was tasty, the lamb dish was thoroughly disappointing. There was only one dessert available, fried ice cream. Gave it a try and was disappointed once again. The real put off though was the music. Who listens to the Vengaboys in 2016?

This was my third visit to this place and there are a few disappointments.¬†
¬† - They yet to receive the full bar license and hence not serving alcohol.¬†
¬† - They have shortened their menu for the festive season, when its still a week away and there isn't much rush yet. Lots of dishes are not available.
¬† - The service is quite worse than my earlier visits. We had to wait so long for the main course after our starters are over, we almost forgot what we have ordered.

However on the bright side, the quality of food is really good as earlier. Hope it will not degrade owing to festive season pressure. We really liked the kebabs we ordered. The chicken pepper steak was really yummy. The ambiance is awesome and its a very good place ¬†to hang out with friends.

We went there on the occasion of mahalaya. The first thing about the place is a pretty english feeling. The dressing of the serving staff is impeccable. I am a vegetarian and my taste buds felt awesome that day. I would have given it a 5 star it is just that my non-veg colleagues were dissapointed with the food on offer. I wish they work on it.

its a nice place for dining, good quality food, taste is also very good, ambiance is awesome, every thing is very good of this restaurant except their serving time, we have to wait 40 mins to be served the main course which was very disappointing, requesting the authority of the restaurant to serve the food a little earlier if you really want people to visit here twice. Other than this no other issues were faced.

Got to hear a lot about the ambience of this place- and it was all true. The ambience and feel of this place really stands out - one of its kind in Kolkata. We ordered for a continental combo - spaghetti in red sauce - it was very average. The combo also had a drink similiar to Blue lagoon - again very average. We ordered for pan rasna orange sheesha - I will call it below average. The service was good and waiters were courteous.

The moment you enter you get the typical British ambience. Its a well spread out place with decent British interiors. The food items we tried tasted really good. We were 5. All of us enjoyed their food service(have to mention Joys name-he was very well behaved polite and he took personal interests in our orders the way your family members take. 
The fun part was we could not finish the chicken pasta which we ordered for our child. We asked him to pack so that we can take it back home as it was only 30% consumed. That was not given to us. We also forgot. Otherwise a good experience.

The interior decoration was immaculate! They tried to create a irish pub feel. The overall veneer would have gone great with hard drinks. 
The FOOD is good, not top notch but pretty good. We ordered the special kebab, it was tasty, could have been a little more tender, the shepherds pie was ok, the Spaghetti in white sauce was creamy and smooth, with a hint of black olives, it was really good and finally we ordered the lasagne, which was excellent.
The ESTIMATION for 2 is not 800, it should be more around the neighbourhood of 1200 though, if you are not just looking for snacks. Basically the quantity of food they serve are comparatively less to what other restaurants serve for the same dishes.

Located in sector 5 (salt lake) this place is a definite go in my book. Walking in, the first thing you will say to yourself is how suave this place looks. No doubt the ambience here is pretty rad and the staff is quite friendly as well. Coming to the food- we started off with the kebabs- which I would recommend to everyone, next we took the Shepard's Lamb- now me & my friends we took a gamble with this one & frustratingly so we were to an extent left disappointed. After that we took spaghetti and ended it with a lasagna both of which were equally good & the lasagna is a must try. Good place- good food. Go ahead.

The ambience looks perfectly like an American pub with a marvellous mocktail counter decorated with glasses and high seats. Though liqours are not available but their mocktails are also very good. Crispy chilli babycorn &  lasania are the best in veg starters. In main course we had north indian among which i liked the kadai paneer and lachha paratha the most. Staffs are at their toe and very responsive. Quite expensive place with average sheesha. Good place for a dine in with your family.

This is a place in Sector 5. In a word the place is amazing! The restaurant has a British pub like theme. The place has three sections to sit in. The ambience is great and the music is good too. Now coming to the food,we had ordered the non veg Tandoor platter for appetizers. It was absolutely lip smacking,delicious and mouth watering! It consisted of fish,chicken and mutton kebabs. Then for main course we had ordered Chicken lasagna, pasta Alfredo, BBQ chicken and Lamb Bourguignon. The lasagna was the best! It was perfect and a must-have. Just order it without thinking. The pasta was good too. The lamb and the BBQ chicken is served with rice and vegetables. And the pasta and the lasagna are accompanied with breads. The BBQ chicken and the lamb were good but nothing extra ordinary. Overall the service was good,the ambience was great and the food was absolutely amazing! Would love to visit there again.

Great restaurants. Amazing environment. Huge size. Foods are comparatively cheap. Well behaved waiter. Location is also very accessible. In the heart of Sector V , salt lake, just opposite to RDB. We have ordered Panraas HUKKA, mocktails, chicken kebab,schezwan noodles, prawn. Prawn was delicious. Though we went for dinner, they also have complimentary mocktails for lunch. Inside the restaurant you can feel British Colonial culture. They also have a small dance floor which is ideal for small group hang out or office party. There is a big screen inside the restaurant, sports lovers can also visit and use it as a sports bar and watch the games together in a big screen. Overall it's a great restaurants and a must visit.

So, Finally I being to this Place Again,yes ! Again.
It was my second visit to this place ,as the first one was of too short term to put a review on.
So, the first thing that 10 Downing Street impress u,is itz decor. You feel being into a british pub.
The most amazing thing of the Restaurant is there combo offer.We tried from Chines and Indian menu,where u get one mocktail/soup , any side dish and any main course .
The only i didnt like was that they dnt hv ny separate section for hooka lovers.
I m personally not a hooka lover , so yaaah it bothered me abit.
But in all great food, great stuff.Hope visit soon.

the service is okay, the food is good comparatively. the lamb was tender, and the chicken was seasoned well. the chicken mushrooms were something new I got to try, and they did not disappoint me. the bill too came reasonable enough.

they like to call it England oriented, but the decors could have been a little more British.
and, only if they served alcohol. :P

Retro British Pub themed interiors, the chandeliers add to the Victorian feel...
Dim-lighting but overall the ambience is really good....

We ordered:-
2 mocktails- Tango & Cash, and Silver Star: they were a bit too fruity but nice and refreshing....
Veg Chinese Platter: an assortment of 4 chinese snacks, the chilly potatoes in it really stood out and were awesome....
Chilly Garlic Noodles: they were nice and spicy.
Fried Ice Cream: deep fried vanilla ice cream with corn flakes and grated coconut; nice taste, the fried outer layer with coconut added a fun twist to the texture...

P.S.: they don't have a lot of options for desserts.

The staff is good and courteous.
Service is fast.

There's no separate hookah section, all the seating is in one big hall, and it doesn't feel good that people are smoking around family and kids....

Overall a nice experience, would like to visit again.....

Its situated inside corporate park building and it is absolutely stunning! The look from outside looks grand but its not that expensive too. The interior designing just looks as fabulous as outside. It has that old school look and i just totally loved it. Everything about it is good. The service as well as the courteous behavior of the staff members. Even the food was delicious and hookah didnt choke us at all. But one thing i would like it is if they could make a separate room for hookah smokers because i see a lot of family groups coming in with their kids so it doesnt feel good to smoke in front of the kids. Nonetheless it was a good experience and would like to come back again! Keep it up.

There is no one word that describes this place. I have to indulge myself with the use of a number of adjectives such as classy, beautiful and perfect mood booster, to explain the place at the least. To top it all, the food is not disappointing either.¬†

I dropped into this place sometime back and was very pleased with the mocktails, the service and the all over ambiance at the establishment. All the mocktails were specially customized for us. While I wanted something fresh and refreshing, another friend wanted something more cooling and fruitier. The third friend on the table requested for something basic and likeable. We were served with drinks that ticked all the right boxes with us. If you are dropping in, please ask for the bar tender to customize the drinks for your, the specialist has some extraordinary creations up his sleeve.¬†

The fact that the food is arranged in combos or a platter system is great for people not wanting to fuss over the menu for long. They can choose any combos from the menu and have it served to the table within no time. We ordered the tandoori platter in the first course. Apart from a single cylindrical kebab, the rest were quite nicely done and beyond a doubt, impressive. For the main course, we moved on to, a plate each of Crumb Fried Fish and chips, Kung Pao chicken with chili garlic noodles and Chicken Straganoff. The food was satisfactory.¬†

For desserts, we ended up ordering fried ice cream and brownies with ice cream. Afte a lovely meal, the desserts failed to reach the level set by the other dishes. That is surely a point that the kitchen can work on. Other than that, there is hardly any other thing that needs correction or mentioning.

While the place might look uber costly, the bill isn't, which helps the experience at 10 Downing street be a little more enjoyable.

Just when i was enjoying my freedom on Independence day with newly hitched brother.. Ironical yes;) yet twas fun to be at 10 Downing street and its etched in one of my fond memories... So i remember twas Independence Day coz the foodie in me vividly remembers that she was served Tri-colour Paneer specially for that day.. Dont ya guys worry il come to Food part later.. ;)
First up is The Ambience: I was kept waiting coz twas crowded sunday eve.. Or maybe twas a trick to create the hype for that place coz upon entering the place i could see some tables vacant.. Very Brit Victorian like decor.. One half of the wall had an inbuilt square shaped mirror.. Which was lookin very different.. Very very spacious.. Extremely decorated place!
Next comes The Food: So heres what i ordered:
Tri -colour Paneer tikka: Twas specially made for Independence Day.. Proud to be an Indian and have food related to that.. Kudos Chef for creating it and making it all the more delicious! Loved it to bits..
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: This was Soggy and not upto the mark..
Finally, The Service and Pocket Pinch: The staff are good and courteous.. Serves quick.. However the place is on the expensive side.. But i loved the entire getup of the place and also love the fact that Its close to my nest.. Do post your thoughts.. Waiting for them.. Thanks!

Went to this place for the 1st time today and it was a pleasant experience. After entering I was amazed by the ambiance which was based on british theme. It offers a variety of food dishes that include Continental, Chinese and Mughlai/Indian cuisines. We decided to go ahead with Indian food and the food was tasty. However for 1 chicken dish the chicken seemed a bit undercooked. Overall we had a good time and will definitely like to visit again.

Huge place with the atmosphere of an out and out pub/bar. I found the menu out of sync with the restaurant's positioning.
Anyways, chili baby corn was actually crispy while makhmali kabab too little in qty to review. The nachos just about ok, the white sauce pasta was good but the risotto mediocre. The garlic toast was good but uneven in taste with a few pieces drenched in garlic. The Virgin Mojito was good. The fried ice cream was a disappointment.
Shall come back once the bar is operational. The qty served is miniscule. 
The ambience and positioning as a pub and hukka place seems perfect.

Very well decorated resturant. Music is good & great ambience. Staff very courteous.

Food also very tasty.
Just one complaint, i ordered continental dish which was great in taste but the non veg quantity in it was very low i felt.
For instance, i ordered lamb bourgonion... there was too much rice and very less lamb. That needs to be increase.

Else everything is very very good. Price also affordable

Probably the best place in the city for a corporate lunch. The ambience is very good and staff are really professional. I keep visit the outlet every month. Sinchan, the guy is the best. Even without the liquor he makes the sitting remarkable with his opinion and gesture. Nowadays I let him decide my menu, and that never disappoint me. To retain a customer you don't really need discounts, you need the welcoming gesture. When Sinchan is there, I feel very comfortable and privileged. He is a Star. I keep visiting the 10D Hyderabad Begumpet one, so nothing extra to say about their food. Yes, a small request please procure your liquor license ASAP and let us taste your great food with the cocktails in the city of Joy. Keep hiring good staff and make the place one of the best in Kolkata. Cheers

The ambience of the restaurant is fab. Reflects typical central London look and feel. The food is good but I felt that this place could actually do better. 

Pros - Ambience, service and mock tails.

Cons - Food quality expected to be better and no liquor.

Had gone there with a lot of expectations but it turned out to be an entire disaster. At the very outset they tried to turn us away by ¬†saying the waiting time would be too long & they won't be serving liquor. The food was good as far as taste & quality was concerned but the the staffs were too ill equipped to deal with the sunday evening rush. I must mention that the quantity is also very less.The waiter who took our order didn't have any idea about the quantity of food which is to be served to a group of five.We had ordered for the Chicken fry which had only 4 pieces, but the waiter neither did mention the quantity nor did he recommend us for an increase in no. of plates(considering we were 5 people.) Further most of the items we asked from the menu was not available(it was told that those options are only available during lunch hours), they only had the basic dishes available.The decor is very nice, ambience is also good but as far as servie is concerned it's a total disappointment

The foremost thing.. No alcohol was being served, no liquor license.. Dunno if they have procured one now.

Ambience: The interiors are fab, chandeliers, the balcony set up, the linear section, the couches and all, just look so apt.

Food: we just ordered for a nachos, it was the worst I have ever had. Maybe my bad luck cos my friends tell the food is superb here. 

Hookah: disappointing.. Choking very less smoke!!

Music was good.. Very less footfall.. 
This place has to live up to the name.. Gotta work harder!!

The moment we entered this place, we just loved it. It has a nice ambience paired with some really helpful staff. 

We ordered a tandoori platter,crispy garlic chicken, lemon coraider chicken, chiken tikka masala, dal makhani, and kulcha naan. Every thing was well cooked and the quantity served was sufficient for 5 people. The sweet lime soda ordered was not sweet, but then the waiter immediately got us the sugar syrup. 

There was a dj in the house, who played hindi songs from the very starting, which was a refreshing change. And to top up there was a fire show performed by the bartenders. 

Enjoyed every minute of the experience. Looking forward to visit this place again.

The price is higher than most of the adjoining places. Thiugh the ambience is good but their serving time is more than usual. We tasted Biritani - which though tasted good but did not have the taste of typical Bengal Biriyani - I would not comment on the same as I enjoyed the dish a lot.

It was a lunch treat by a friend of mine. I totally liked the ambience, interior decor and staff service. The food was superbly awesome!
In the starters had baked mushrooms with stuffed chicken and it was good. Then had pepper chicken steak with breads and shepherd's pie with breads. Both of them were delicious and specially pepper chicken steak. In deserts had vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce which perfectly complimented the launch end.

Recently opened at PS Srijan Tech park, and for those who do not know where it is....Its just diagonally opposite to rdb cinemas. To begin with, the decor defines what a pub should look like, and its great. The food was brilliant and worth trying. Its at a reasonable price range and one can easily spend hours with a mug in such an ambience. Will visit as soon as they start serving alcohol. Cheers!

I dont usually hang around in Sector V, but I'd heard so much about this place that I decided to go and I'm so glad I did!
Firstly, as soon as you spot the place with its HUGE board, you can feel the grandeur!
The ambience is just soo good. With the dim lighting and leather-feel chairs, I immediately felt like I was in an old London pub! It's so spacious and well thought out.
The food was good and the portion size for the starters was pretty good as well. Really loved the chinese platter that we ordered. 
The choice of music was excellent as well. 
All in all, I had a really good time and I'm sure that once they have their liquor license.. the place is gonna be full all day üòÄ

A British pub feel, the ambiance is great and the interiors are extremely well done. The management is friendly and courteous. Coming to the food, the Caribbean exotica, spaghetti and the au gratin were delicious but the babycorn tempura was a big let down. Also i found the vegetarian options very limited.
But overall a good experience, would definitely visit again.

A place with this kind of ambience and that to in kolkata is a must visit place. I have visited many places in Bangalore and it just brought my Bangalore days back. Then the food is a best part. Different types of dishes with a totally different taste was the best part. The mocktails had a great taste and the hooka was fab. Its a must visit place in town with family or friends. The best part was the desert. They named it fried Ice cream and the taste was so good.

If you are a snob when it comes to dining, and if you prefer to second a taste of colonial bourgeois, 10 Downing Street is the place for you. With a smoky(metaphorically and literally)  and somewhat retro suited ambiance, this place is perfect to hang out with your friends. Order a hookah and chill out as modern tracks play around you, adding a retro-modern aura to the whole restaurant. The food is pretty good. I'd recommend the Shepherd's Pie and the Lasagna. They are meticulously prepared delicacies with a touch of Indian spices. The waiters are incredibly polite or at least the person who served us was. 
This place is going to stand out in your themed restaurant wishlist. Do pay them a visit. You'll not regret it.

Went to this amazing hidden treasure in the afternoon when they provide complimentary dessert and mocktail. Chicken stroganoff and oyster chicken was delicious. The creamy chicken will just melt in your mouth. However the noodles were a bit spicy. 5/5 for creating the perfect british pub ambience, however they are not serving alcoholic drinks at the moment. We had to ask the waiter to fill our glass and also had to wait a tad bit longer for our food. The dessert was nothing extraordinary just plain vanilla ice cream topped with a generous amount of chocolate sauce. The sparkling mocktail was delectable and refreshing. Will definitely visit it again when they start serving alcoholic drinks.

Visited the restaurant on Independence Day. There was a waiting for around 15 min to get our table, however upon entering I found that there were many empty tables. Couldn't understand why I was made to wait. However, loved the ambience and loved the food. We ordered Indian and everything was upto our expectations. The upper section is more neatly done and would visit again. However, the service was slow. Otherwise everything was good.

Visited this restaurant twice in last two months  and I must say that the decor and interiors are outstanding. Located in the office locality of Sector v,  Salt Lake this place is a perfect hang out destination for office goers and youngsters. The canopy above the windows outside gives a very English feel, so does the entrance door. As you enter the vast area of the restaurant is the first thing to catch your eyes. On both sides there are the English style furniture welcoming you. Then comes the bar or liquor counter. It's huge with an array of cutlery and well lit lights. The bar chairs placed along the counter gives a very peppy feeling. The DJ console and the dance floor is quite big and is accompanied by further seats next to it. I liked the pseudo bookshelf but I so wish there were real books instead. Upstairs there is this private party area which is again enough to hold a hundred guests easily. 
Now coming to the food... Well I am very disappointed by both the quality and taste of it. The veg au gratin was less than average. The sesame chicken fry was nothing interesting. The mock tail too sweet for the flavour I chose. The veg noodles I ordered yesterday was worse than a roadside stall selling noodles in the same area. The chicken steak was pathetic in presentation, quantity and taste. We ordered for cheese garlic bread but then it was taking a long time to be served. When we asked the waiter who took our order he was like 'sorry sir I forgot to place the order'. We had to ask for water,  napkins and knives when these are the basics to be served readily. Only thing I liked both the days was the shisha. We ordered for brain freezer flavour and it was nice. The music is nice and it's a nice place which I am sure will pick up once the alcohol starts.  They have a lot of room for improvement.

Been to this place on sunday, I must say that they have put a lot of effort into creating that retro British pub infused with the new age club thing and it shows. In terms of the ambience it is unmatched in the category however I was not very pleased with the service which was more or less fast but at the start of the scene, the person taking orders tells me that you need to only look for me and not to call other waiters which to be honest was unprofessional and not classy. I ordered the usual non complex dishes such as pasta, platters etc. and for food I would give it a 3 maybe a 3.5 at the end the machine wouldnt work and they had to swipe my card several times another bummer .

I was awstruck once i entred this place. Its a huge place with amazing interiors like that of a Britishpub.
Another happening place in Sector 5, makes me more happier.
Has a wonderful capacity and lotsa options for all kinds groups small or big, couples etc
The interior also looks familiar to a casino ;-)
They are yet to start with the Bar but i guess no sooner or later they will and then there is no stopping for this place.
Food was very good and tasty.
Staff was always very corteous and round the corner.
Looking forward to further visits with friends.

Only Con: It also allows very small kids, ¬†a place where you are using hookah, should not be for kids or vice versa.
Atleast maintain separate sections. I hope you will take note.

Went to this on a weekday lunch.... loved the ambience... best restaurant in sector v in terms of ambience...

Pros:
1. Ambience ambience ambience....
2. Food tasted great.. starters (most suggested by our servers) were great...

Cons:
1. Service was not great.... had to wait nearly 30 mins for starers to arrive... and similar wait time for main course.
2. Seating arrangement is more like a lounge... while that makes a cozy environment on friday evening, it's not the best for a team lunch with more thab 6/7 folks...

Overall, will definitely visit again... and hope the service would have improved by then :-)

We went there on a Sunday afternoon that too on friendship day and the place was completely packed. Very comfortable and classic place. Super music , fantastic ambiance!! If you want to party and can't decide where to go , just hop in here! Very nice crowd. Very clean and clear . water melon martini tasted amazing. Paneepaneer tikka, veg pasta was also not bad.  It was quick, hot and fresh. They serve hukkha too . My opinion should have a separate section for smoking shisha. Service was quick. But honestly I didn't liked that hukkha. They should take care of that shisha part.  I loved that live liquor section at the center,  looks stunning.  Interior looks superb. Couldn't try more food and and drink as we had no time. And couldn't even click much picture of it , will click next time we visit :) surely gona visit soon with more time.

We went to 10 Downing Street with a lot of high hopes and expectations but the experience ended in a bad note . This maybe the most recent addition to the huge chain of pubs that are already in sector 5 trying to give the IT masses something different each day . But sometimes you have to ponder how "different" can you offer or you are trying to offer . 10D boasts a huge offering in terms of ambience and grandeur , then what does it lack ? It lacks the sincerety and precision in service and food quality which is so much required in a place where it is already cramped with so many options . 

¬∞ Location :- Located opposite to the famous Opium , which in turn is opposite to RDB boulevard in salt lake sector 5 .

¬∞ Ambience ( 5 / 5 ) :-  Probably the only decent factor and the one that is pulling the crowd in . It is a Britain styled decor that catches the eye upon entrance . The main door which bears resemblance to the original abode in 10 Downing Street which supposedly is the resistance of the prime minister of England . Once you enter the place , it's a treat to the eye . The beautifully created bar in the middle is the main jewel which creates an aura around it . The chandelier on the top will make you feel as if you are in the Royal palace of England . The design on the walls are similar to that of British styled wallpapers and the seatings are comfy and perfect . So, everything upto now seemed to be perfect for us . 

¬∞ Food :- First and foremost , they have this controversial menu that is just not perfect for an Ala carte diner . If you see their menu then you will realize that it is customized based on a combo lunch offering . Dishes are based on a common price and it is hard to get the price of individual price . So, if you are planning to have a fried rice and a chicken item you are confused because both the items are priced together by a common value . So there you have to ask them what the individual price is and then they would give you a number . This is really pathetic and pissed us off . They should have a separate and proper menu for the ala carte dinner . If you see the menu you won't find a price for nun, kulcha . If I have to ask them then what is the point of having a menu . Anyways , we went in a big group and we ordered different items . I can personally give you an idea of the following ones : -

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STARTER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Baby corn Tempura ( 4 / 5 ) :- Or rather similar to Crispy chilli babycorn , it was a fine veg starter to begin with . The corns were perfectly fried and was really spicy . Had a beautiful aroma and we just loved it . A very much recommended dish .

2. Tandoori platter ( 3 / 5 ) :- Had really high hopes with this . But after waiting for about 20 minutes when the dish finally arrive it was a stalemate . With the steep price , it should have accommodated a prawn item . The dish consisted of a variety of tandoori items served together in pieces of 3 . The kabaabs were basically dried. The tangri kabaab was really thin , less meat . The fish kabaab was small and  the spices with which it was marinated was not good . The mutton seekh kabaab was very very dry and over grilled . Not much of a recommendation but they still have a wide variety to choose from .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN COURSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Chicken Pepper steak ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- This is the dish I personally had so I can give you the best picture of it . This is a mould or rather a patty with stuffed chicken and herbs and cheese in the middle.  The mould is served with yellow herb rice and sauted veggies. It could have been a 5 star dish but failed because the size of the mould was small . The mould on the other hand was tasty to be honest . The molten cheese in the middle was really an awesome experience.  If you ask me , yes I would recommend it but it will not fill your appetite . 

2. BBQ chicken ( 3 / 5 ) :- I tasted this dish and I felt they should improve the sauce . These are pieces if boneless chicken which was supposed to be cooked in BarBQ sauce but instead in a red gravy which resemblances nothing to BBQ sauce . Instead the gravy was a bit salty and not tangy at all which is the original BBQ sauce taste . Served with the same rice like that of the chicken steak this is not a great dish and not recommended .

3. Mexican chicken pasta ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Not bad one . Called Mexican but mostly resembles the pasta arrabiata which is spicy . Yes , this dish is a tad spicy but tasty . The pasta is cooked properly with some prices of chicken and served with 2 garlic bread . But once again this dish fails miserable on the aspect of quantity . Only suggested for a light meal .

Some of my colleagues took to Indian choices and were complaining a lot so I went over to them to taste the dishes . The butter nun was stiff and rubbery . The mutton Rogan josh had a very bad flavor and the mutton was not tender at all.  The veg navratna curry was a disaster with a very bland taste . So, after slight tasting I understood what the fuss was about . So the continental seems to be a better option to select but that is also ordinary here .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

¬∞ Service ( 1 / 5 ) :- This is where they just lost it . Probably the worst service that I have encountered after so many experiences in all over the city . Maybe the place is new and the waiters are still learning but that is simply not an excuse for the lack of attitude and unprofessionalism in them . Certain points here :- 

1. On entry didnot serve us water . We were in a group of 17 and after 45 mixture we requested and they did which in turn took another 10 minutes .

2. While ordering I asked what was the price of a normal fried rice since I was confused by their stupid menu so they replied that it costs 190 and serves only one . What kind of restaurant serves a fried rice at 190 and serves only one . That would be only this joint .

3 . Their food service time is around an hour . After the main course finally arrived the left out 3 items.  After waiting for one hour and 5 mintues we complained to the manager who told us that the prawn in the item was stale . We didnot buy that after being left out for over an hour . 

We went there after seeing a lot of good reviews and we had only good things in our mind but I believe they are just not ready yet to serve a big group which makes the place unprepared . I will suggest the. Authority to please consider the following :-

1. Change your menu and make it a proper one . List all the items by price . 

2. Improve your service and service time .

3. Improve the quality of the Indian items .

They points mentioned above are the 3 crucial points to make a good restaurant . You boast a great ambience so donot let yourself down by serving ordinary food and bad service . I am sure you will improve but for now not recommended for a group outing . For small outing it will be ordinary .

The theme they have selected is of a typical london pub. Its nice gives you a good feeling overall. But music is not good. They need to change speakers and update their playlist. Hookah was one of the best I have ever had Brain freezer Grape Mint. Food was also very good. Will surely visit next time. Only let down was they haven't started the bar yet.

Beautiful property. Spacious with beautiful interiors. The music is good as well. They have not got their liquor licence yet but their mocktails were okay. We ordered the American style chicken (amazing), downing Street kebab (murgh malai- decent) and the veg kebab platter. For main course we had a mix sauce pasta which had very little veggies; however the sauce was delicious. We ended with fried  ice cream which was not bad. On the whole a great experience. I definitely recommend it.

Planned to visit 10 Downing street since its opening date. Then finally on the friendship day we went . This restaurant is located opposite to Opium. The grand entrance, huge area, warm welcome from the staff will increase the craving for knowing the place better. We ordered chicken lasagna roll which is a preparation of shredded chicken,corn , cheese and jalape√±o served with garlic bread, kung pao chicken and grilled chicken rice. Food was very tasty. Quality well maintained, quantity is adequate, service is good, pocket friendly. Will definitely visit the place to try other items.

As the name suggests,its a British themed pub. Located just opposite to RDB. They have got separate place for parking which is really good.
To start with,its a total ritzy caf√© or pub. 
Was at awe when I entered the place. I loved the ambiance and the interiors. Totally a feel Of London. 
Sophisticated and classy d√©cor and quite spacious. I liked the taste of their music collection as well.
Coming to food,
We ordered Stuffed Mushroom which was really good. It had stuffings of cheese,paneer and then it was fried which made it crisp and delectable.
Next we tried Veg. Lasagna which was accompanied by garlic bread and it was simply appetising and very well prepared.
Veg. Tandoori platter which had baby corn, potato,hara bhara kabab,mushroom,paneer and all in all the platter was decent.
Among mocktails,tried Blue lagoon which was average.
It was a very good experience and I would definitely come here to try other items. 
Just a suggestion that the waiters should be more attentive. They keep on rushing listening half and are a lil impatient.

Very conveniently located opposite to opium.Loved the ambiance as soon as I stepped in. Had already decided what to order upon recommendations from fellow reviewers on zomato. Ordered mutton chops, chilli lambs,shepherds pie, lamb bourguignon. The mutton chops was good though it was a bit hard. The chilli lambs was simply awesome!! Not a fan of lamb nd I hardly prefer having it,having said that, i simply loved everything about the chilli lambs. It was very very soft nd tasted super awesome...highly recommended!! The bourguignon was also very nice nd very well cooked. Though, the shepherds pie was good but not awesome. We really missed liquor nd also the desert section of the menu was deserted to say the least. Would be great if they had some good deserts!! Even though,Thumbs up for the food & concept nd would be visiting soon again!!

Tremendous ambience, amazing food and reasonable prices are just a few reasons why one should visit this place. The decor is amazing. The waiter is courteous and the foods are delicious.. Do try the sweet corn chicken soup and Punjabi chicken. This place offers everything one could wish for in a joint, starting from hookah, to alcohol and great food. Visit with friends to complete an amazing day out. It is not hard to spot as well, situated right opposite RDB. I will visit them again.

Right in the middle of all the hustle bustle  stands this brilliant building - which had me impressed with the very first look.
This is opposite to rdb cinemas in sector v .. probably they couldn't have chosen a better place for letting the tortured souls of IT Industry unwind themselves.
The grandiose decor, the wooden floors panels, the shades and lamps - everything about the interior was just amazing. The service too needs to be appreciated as they were prompt and helpful. We ordered nachos, baby corn fried in a batter, spinach corn lasagna,chicken lasagna, chicken Alfredo pasta, barbeque chicken and pepper chicken steak. However while ordering we were told the barbeque chicken too would have a steak portion but it didn't - it comprised of pieces of chicken. The hookah and the mocktail did set up the perfect mood. Will definitely revisit!

To be honest, I was totally awestruck by this place and was looking all around it because it is really very beautifully designed . The ambience is mind blowing and food complimented the air.
We ordered a Mushroom and Corn Lasagna which was very cheesy.. stuffed mushrooms and we also ordered for shashlick with rice . But I feel they can improvise a little in decorating the dishes and work on presentation . Everything was good and it was overall a nice experience ‚òÖ

To be honest, i was amazed by the grandeur of the place at the first sight. It was amazing to see the quality of interiors which the Kolkata market has matured to. Ambience is by far the top notch in the city. Kudos to you guys for carrying out that.¬†

I went there on a weekday, it was almost empty. The service was good. Our server really took good care of us.¬†

Coming to the food, we ate Chilli chicken, the chinese platter, crackling rice and manchurian. i can say that the food was perfect. the chilli chicken was cooked to perfection, with exactly the perfect amount of chilli. Chinese platter was good. (only the babycorn was a little off. but its ignorable). Rice and manchurian was equally perfect to taste. I tried the pinacolada, which was again very good.¬†

Im looking forward to come to you again and very soon. Do keep up the good work. :)

Came here for lunch with a friend. The first thing that you will notice is its Victorian decor and its ambience. This is a newly opened place and is already grabbing eyes. Coming to the food we ordered 2 mocktails and chicken lasagna. Let me tell you, the food there was just too good. This place, I heard, serves some really good mocktails , well it does so. One was the pub special which was a watermelon smoothie kind of thing and another one was a mango smoothie. Both were really good. The lasagna was exceptional.
Recommendations : try the mocktalis
chicken Lasagna

Probably one of the best decorated lounge in the city. The name of the place gives us the expectation to which it stands tall. Chandeliers, wooden floor, the interiors give you a feeling that you are in London. Coming to food, we ordered chicken pepper steak accompanied with the mocktail which was lychee flavoured . Steak was certainly not we expected, it was more like a patty which was frozen and not freshly made. The mushroom pepper sauce and the saffron rice was the saviour for that dish . Next we had chicken peking noodles and chicken in hoisin sauce. The chicken was juicy and the noodles too was made with care though we would have  wanted more shreds of chicken in the noodles as there was more veggies than chicken . Lastly we had ice cream with chocolate sauce.
Service is extremely great. Hookah is also served here. But, unlike other lounges it is well lit and the service is extremely good. We will definitely come back here.
Though would want the steak to improve ; )

The interiors enthralled us upon entering this new place. It looked fanciful and very welcoming but we were unattended for more than a minute or two. Ultimately we ourselves had to find a table (1st disappointment).¬†
While we gazed at the decor and praised the ambiance, we were still unsuccessful is grabbing any of the attendant's attention. After a wait of 5-6 mins, one of the attendant's approached our table but could not help us out with the menu (which had limited items - 2nd disappointment).¬†
They were quick to serve the food and the taste didn't disappoint us. Even the dessert (plain vanilla ice cream too tasted good).

Apart from our disappointments here, we loved this place for its decor, ambiance, food quality and pricing. But would be happy if the hospitality and the timing for attending a table is improved soon.

Now coming to the food, we ordered hunan chicken, sanghai chicken noodles & a moctail and those dishes were good though the chicken preparation was not so special. The staffs were really  cordial and the service was good. Definitely want to come back soon :)

As you enter ,you suddenly get a feeling of english pubs , wooden flooring wooden walls , a big bar counter setting right at the centre. It is quite spacious one of the biggest of it's kind in kolkata. The food was √†mazing , specially the north indian cuisine , hookah was decent too. They have prompt service . It has 2 sections even though one is basicaly for private parties or if you have a big group, also boast of outdoor seating. 10/10 scores for basically all aspects .

A huge shout out to the management. This is a definite pub place, folks. Get the alcohol in and see your sales roar up real high.
Decent hookah, nice ambience and definitely good food; but the alcohol is missing.
Also, the lights you have used is little on the brighter side, dimmer lights increases the swag level.
Huge turn on: Amazing crowd. Thumbs up on that.

I have been to many of these 10D outlets. So I knew what I expected from it. The ambience was as usual good, the staff being polite and music was kickass. I would surely recommend this to people who love partying. The only aspect which disappointed me about this place is that they don't serve alcohol here. That gets a big NO from me. I had a talk with the staff they said they'll be getting that soon. All in all these place is a nice 4 out of 5 place. ‚úå

Excellent continental food, surprisingly good decorations, very smooth shisha and the bright chandelier light made our rainy evening a memorable one. We were six friends, having a dinner together after more than one year and this was the place we had chosen. Well, we were happy. The place is right opposite to RDB boulevard, towards opium. From outside it's just another restaurant, but the moment you step in, the first thing you notice is the space. Ceiling is very high, spacious seat arrangement with a big chandelier in the middle of the huge room will make you feel like British officers club room in colonial India ( never been in one though, just read about). We have chosen a cozy sofa set to have our chat. 
Lets talk about the food now,
For starters we had 10 Downing street kebab, Bhatti da murg and paneer tikka. Eight pieces a plate, all the three starters were served just in time. 
10 Downing street kebab was boneless. The meat was tender and juicy, with the right amount of spices to enhance the taste. 
Bhatti the murg had some leg pieces, like chicken lollypop, a bit more like chicken tandoori.
Paneer tikka was really good, enriched with spices.
In the main course, we had chicken barbeque, chicken lasagne, chicken pasta and one veg dish. 
Chicken lasagne was the star of the main course! I am not very fond of continental food, but this chicken lasagne was something I never tasted before. From the cheesy upper crust till the spicy bottom, it was just awesome!
Chicken pasta and chicken barbeque tasted good but not extraordinary, as per my opinion.
For dessert we had fried ice cream, a bit different in taste, you can try it one time.
We had two cocktails, spicy long island and micky mouse. Spicy long island was really good, but drink it as long as it is cold.
We had a shisha, elaichi flavoured. It was made with expertise, smooth as silk, not a single cough in it's entire span!
Overall a really good place, but price with tax is on the higher side. So plan accordingly. 
Will be back there for the shisha though ;)

The place has got an amazing Ambience but here is the "World Class Service" where you feel disappointed.It was a Sunday Night out for us.We got the table for 7 after much contemplation.We were served Water after 30 minutes.The Starters took another 30 minutes to reach our taste buds.The Starters were average. We ordered Hara Bhara kabab nd Spring roll.The Kababs were average but the Spring rolls were hell lot greasy.The Main Course arrived a little faster within 25 Minutes.We ordered Chatpata Veg, Paneer Punjabi Masala, Masala kulcha nd Naan.Kulchas were Great but we were disappointed by the paneer.We didn't even think of ordering Dessert.Hope their service improves in near future.I would have given it 3.5 stars but deducted 2 stars for the service.

Went with my office colleagues. The place is new and ambience is quite impressive. Decorations are exquisite. Lots of staffs. There is a bar counter like thing at the center, but they don't serve alcoholic drinks as of now. Talking about food, they were good but could have been better. Although I didn't like the Lamb chops, they were smelly. And mocktail items need to be increased. 

Hoping to visit again a few week later...looking forward to betterness !!!

After seeing the reviews in zomato we decided to go for a dinner in this restaurant. No doubt the interior and the ambience was good, but the service was very poor. It seems like they are not able to manage it properly. And the food was also below expectations. We tried Italian and Indian food. Italian was good, but Indian was totally waste of money.

This place located right opposite to rdb cinemas at Sector 5, salt lake is a beautifully decorated restaurant resembling a typical English/Irish pub. The wooden furniture, spectacular chandelier, bar counter, tiny dance floor, interesting wall hangings is simply on point. The seats are comfortable and the area is pretty widespread comprising of two stories.  Coming to the food, its reasonable more or less. I had tried their lasagna and chicken wings with barbeque sauce. The food tasted good but they took a really long time (30 mins) to get the food to our table. So the service needs to be quick. The staff is quite attentive and well behaved, no complaints there.  The biggest glitch?! No liquor license yet!!!! One has to settle for mocktails for now. üòí That apart, a good experience. üòä ( Please introduce alcohol to the menu soon.)

I visited this recently-opened restaurant (which is very hard to miss; it's a huge two storeyed building ¬†bang opposite RDB Boulevard in Sector 5 Salt Lake) last night, for dinner, with friends. The place is huge and luxuriously spacious; though the table we were sat at was a little cramped. The decor is very aesthetically pleasing.¬†
Coming to the food, we had mutton chops as the entree, Shepherd's Pie and Chicken Stroganoff as the main dishes. They don't seem to have a dessert menu, which was odd. The food was simply delicious. The mutton chops had this subtle spicy flavour which made them lip-smacking; the other two dishes are standard Continental fare which pretty much lived up to our expectations.¬†
As for the service, I must say it was a trifle disappointing. We had to ask the staff to give us our starter plates and cutlery, and when we asked for a change of plates for the main course, we were given starter plates again! We had to request them for bigger plates once again. It was almost as if they were running short of plates!¬†
All in all, for the prices charged, I'd say it was a great meal. The decor and the food were both very satisfying indeed. I do hope they step up their service a notch.

An excellent discovery. This is a newly opened restaurant just opposite to RDB cinemas. The ambience is excellent and is made to resemble the pubs of UK. The food is very good. There are Indian, Chinese and Continental spreads to choose from and having tried a couple of dishes from each spread, I can safely say they are all great. I specially Ioved the Downing Street special chicken kabab and the Prawn Florentine. The mains were all great. There is no alcohol yet but that should start as soon as they get a license. Will be a complete package. To add to this the staff are extremely courteous and helpful. It was a great experience overall. Would definitely go back

This is the classiest place in all of Salt lake. The entire area is unbelievably big, and the decor is simply out of the world( and easily throws challenge to Someplace Else).The mock tails were exquisite,and starters were damn good.And The bar counter is truly of International standard and turns head the moment you enter.

Only Con-

1) Main courses fall clearly short of the standard compared to mock tails and kebabs.

2) No liquor license yet(Asked  a waiter and came to know it's coming in August.I'm pretty sure when it comes ,The restaurant will have the same condition as opium,i.e. no place to sit on Fridays .)

10 Downing Street. The name itself has gained so much popularity in a few days that I couldn't resist visiting this place located opposite the Infinity building in Salt Lake. The location is extremely beautiful and so are its interiors. The staff was cordial too.
However, this place has yet to improve on its food. The menu is vast but food quality needs to be improved. Risotto rice was average even after sprinkling oregno herbs and chilli flakes on top of it. Lime soda was too strong. The Veg Chinese Platter was good.

Went there for the dinner! I am a huge fan of 10 D. Since I was in hyderabad so, I knew 10D chain from earlier. It took me some time to dine here! Since I was waiting for them to get liquor licence, which is still missing! I was a regular customer of 10D hyd and hoping to continue here so! The best part of 10D is there ambiance. They have this same type of old wooden english classy ambiance! I liked the ambiance of kol branch more than the hyd one! Since here it is far more big and have a dedicated dance floor! Also, if they have this platter system which is awesome for throwing away any bday party or for college guys who is low on pocket money! 

I wanted to give 5! But dropping .5 for the the alcohol part! 

I was confirmed that they will soon get liquor licence in August! Will definitely run to 10D than! Trust me guys! 10D will be one of the most happening place in kolkata once they start with liquor! Great! Going 10D.. I want you to keep the good work as you guys did on other city branches!

As the name suggests, you truly feel as if you are in some pub or bar or club in London. The bar section is yet to open. 

We stole some time from our schedules and decided to land in this place called " 10 Downing Street". They have an exclusively parking area, guided by security guys, so that takes away your parking areas. They greet you nicely, accompany you till you settle down. Ambience inside is very English types, loved it. They have open area which is probably a dance floor. 

Well food was equally good. We ordered for a tandoori platter which costs you 600rs + taxes and a combi of stuffed ginger fish, mixed fried rice, mocktails and a desert, this entire course comes at 250rs plus taxes. What more you can expect. 

I had been to quite a few restaurants, but then this one stands out. 

Highly recommended !

Do visit this place during lunch hours(12-4) they serve free mocktail (from choice of 3) and a free dessert (vanilla ice cream to be specific) with every main course. We were even offered a side dish free with hakka noodles.

Firstly,would like to mention tat the plc z worth d visit.
Had visited this plc last month over for lunch wd a friend on a Sunday afternoon.
The area is huge,old British style decor,wooden furniture, well lit plc,great fusion whch gvs u a feeling of sitting at any upscale English dining anywhr in Europe being in saltlake.
The plc has also sheesha whch was kinda ok as we being regular sheesha lovers very particular abt d flavor n smoke,it ddnt impress us as much d food did..
Had ordered bhetki fish fingers and the head chef made it just perfect as we had personally asked him to prepare it as per our liking.
The Mocktail was good and the Thai mixed rice was equally appetizing.

Was it value for money??
Uhmm on second thoughts a bit nt much over priced but fr a nice family tym,couple dinner or lunch or a gang of frnz,it wudnt pinch much

All in all more than d food it was d decor dat appealed me..n would recommend everyone to visit.

The palce is a must visit, specially for the ambience. Maybe once it gets the liquor license, the place will become more interesting. 
We ordered for the double apple with mint hookah, which was really good.
Unfortunately, they do not offer the first free coal service 
We dint order much food, and only had the fried chicken with mayo, and shredded lamb with barbeque sauce.
The chicken was good, a li'l on the drier side. The lamb was hard and overcooked, but the flavour of the sauce was nice. 
We had to wait a good 30 min for each about appetizers to arrive.

10D is an insane place to spend time after a long days work, no doubt the interiors have to be good the English touch is very rare to find in Kolkata, a huge outlet with great ambiance and good food isnt rare to find in Sector V area now. But this place stands out a little more if u want to enjoy a sophisticated time, with great crowd. They are doing an amazing job.

On a warm Eid evening in Kolkata, 10 Downing Street was our chosen place for dinner. The dinner was special more so because it would be written down as my "500th" review, a feat I am extremely proud of.
It seems like yesterday when a phone call from a ¬†dear friend, Shahbaaz¬†changed my entire perspective about food, foodies, blogging, zomato, and reviews! With him I began my 200th review and 2 months later, I am here writing my 500th review. I owe it to him, of course! He introduced me to this, and he deserves a special mention! :) :)
10 Downing street is an experience in itself. It is huge, spread across two floors. The old Brit charm is evident. The dominated yellow light s add on to the experience. It is lavish and beautiful. The tables are all round and tad a bit too small.¬†
We had ordered for a tandoori platter, priced at 600 plus taxes, it is a good mix of fish and meat kebabs. Recommended. Tried their cheese mushroom balls, a big disaster. Tasteless and dry.
It seems their Indian fares are way better than their chinese or conti items. Their quantity is good. We also ordered for Dal Makhni, Tandoori rotis, and Masala Kulchas!
The place was quite filled with guests for a Thursday evening!

Coming back to the fact that this is my 500th review, I cannot help but brag enough simply because I am quite surprised I have trodden the path so far. My fellow foodie friends have supported me throughout, this also won't have been possible with out you guys!!! So, cheers to you SZ, cheers to us as a huge foodie family...let's continue the full-filled journey..Thanks guys!

This place is worth a visit for its ambience itself only. 
It's huge and overwhelmingly beautiful. 
Food isn't that great and is also overpriced. 
The chicken lasagna was great but the mocktails(mickey mouse, pub's special and frooty punch) and sheperd's pie were pretty ordinary. 
Hookah wasn't that great either. 
But it's a great place for hanging outalso a place to enjoy live sports with chilled beer.

Good Food, Good Ambience,Good Music and Good service. Sector V is now a hub for places like these and this is the latest addition. We ordered the Chinese Platter, a value for money meal. Pasta Alfreda was good, not extraordinary. Mocktail and dessert is complimentary for visitors from 12-4! For the desert they have a vanilla ice cream which is fixed. For Mocktail, one can choose. 
All in all, would love to visit again.

After long tiring day at office on a state holiday my mood was enlivened after coming here for a drink and smoke. Located just opposite to RDB boulevard left side on way to opium. This place serves Italian, Mexican, tandoori, Tex-Mex and many other types of food. We ordered fruit punch, mickey mouse mocktail, ¬†pub special, garlic chicken fried, shepherd's pie and lasagna. Fruit punch and pub special with cranberry juice base was great but the other drink was an unforeseen combo of pepsi and vanilla ice cream, It was not good. The chicken lasagna was out of the world whereas the shepherd's ¬†pie turned me down. We took gum supari flavor for hookah which was smooth and we liked the feel. Music, ambiance and the warmth pleased me to the core of my heart. You guys made my night. Price was a little on the higher side. It costed Rs.2110.oo for the whole spread. Please go from 12:00pm to 4:00pm for happy hour discounts, it will really make you happy.

When we came here, we were told that the waiting time was indefinite, but as we were about to leave, they said they could give us a table in 10 mins. The ambience and decor was very nice and different. Coming to the food, we had the tandoori platter and Chinese platter. The platters were good for 4 people but as we were 6, we shared and had half of most of the things. The taste, though was very good. For main course we had the crackling noodles, garlic rice and the alfredo pasta. All were prepared well. Specially liked the rice. The service was very fast so ordering dishes after the food had arrived was not a problem. My point of concern was mainly the portion sizes which were very small considering the prices.

Nice place, loved the food also. Almost like an English pub and that too with a matching name; only if they had a bar license. Best choice is to go with their cheap meal options for veg n non-veg; they have Chinese, continental and Indian options. Great ambience with hookah too...

This place was on the list for quite some time, but due to some plan or the other i always missed it, but finally managed to catch up here with a few friends and cousins. Firstly, before you go, make sure you have a reservation or atleast you make a call regarding the availability of a seat here. This place from what it seemed is always decked up with people especially over weekends. Now coming down to the ambiance, well have to say one of the best around, incredible interiors, good music, classy couches, great crockery, an ideal place for a date, or a catch up with friends and family, works both way.

The food is decent, i would actually rephrase that and say more than decent, they put up Hookahs as well, which they have over a variety of flavors, which is actually good. However, the price is a bit taxing to the wallet, and especially after the taxes, it really pinches you. They are yet to serve alcohol here, as i believe they have not got the liquor license but the mocktails are good. If you are not even a foodie and like to visit cafe and pubs for an decent evening with friends and family, this is a must visit place for you.

ope the review helps ! Cheers ! Happy Munchin :)

Been here twice. Pricing is quite reasonable and the interiors elegant and elaborate.¬†

I love the lounge located upstairs with the couches.¬†

Food is finger licking. We always order the Veg Kabab Platter which has a good serving. The Nachos are also good with handsome amounts of cheese. North Indian Cuisine is also yummy.¬†

If they can maintain the food quality and taste, i am sure they will give others a run for their money.

Recently visited this place with a friend for lunch and am definitely coming back for round 2. The ambience is great. The music collection is amazziing and to die for. The food is great but be ready to wait if you're ordering continental. What's more? They even serve hookah! The plus points would have to include how spacious the place is.

Nice decor and ambience. Very much spacious. The service was good, but can be improved upon. They had North Indian, continental and Chinese cuisines. We had a non veg tandoori platter. The quantity was not that great with respect to the price, but the quality was recommendable. We moved on to the continental dishes and ordered fish fries with chips and pasta alfredo phungi chicken. Both the dishes were good. Moreover we got complimentary mocktails and ice cream for both of the continental dishes ordered. Overall good experience.

This is a new baby in sector v area and this baby will have very good impact on the other big babas in the area like barbeque nation, ocean grill , chai break etc.
A team of 14 members went there to have dinner last night. Ambience is superb , they have spent a lot of money to create this atmosphere. Coming to the main part that is food. Boy ohh boy it was too good. From mix kabab platter to daal , rice and garlic naan everything was cooked very properly and cleanly. But their service is slow , may be they didn't expect so many at same time. Although a great experience and will definitely come back this place very soon for food and their hooka ( I missed it this time üò≠)

In the main course we ordered chicken stroganoff with rice ,chicken steak with rice ,chilly garlic noodles with stuffed fish and punjabi chicken with naan... food was good...specially Chinese and continental dishes are very good..

Following was a review we gave in good spirit.

However, seeing that you do not intend to serve Bengalis in ethnic ware I feel forced to change your rating.¬†

"This restaurant is definitely the place to be in future. Situated smack middle of Sector V the place boasts a beautiful decor, great legroom and nice food. The to be opened bar promises to be one good place where friends can meet after a hard days work. 

The proper London ambience creates the mood. The foods are affordable and suits your pocket. What I liked most is that you order a combination as main course not a single dish. The combined dishes are exactly the proportion you can eat; not more not less. Most importantly the combination costs max Rs 250. 

Our recommendation: Chicken bamboo rice with Malaysian Red Curry. Grilled chicken noodles with Kungpao Chicken. You can try out the continental dishes too. 

P.S. The hookah bar is already open."

10 Downing Street is a decidedly unimpressive restaurant.¬†
The food ranges from barely tolerable Chinese to mildly tasty North Indian. The flavours are simple and unexciting. But even so, there is comfort in familiar flavours if they are done right. Sadly, that didn't turn out to be the case here. The Chinese is inexplicably salty and rice noticeably undercooked. Specifically, you might want to stay away from the Bamboo Rice. If you're going to eat here at all, I'd suggest sticking to the North Indian section of their menu booklet.¬†

The setting is an inexplicable, eclectic and confusing potpourri - except that it does not smell nice. The ground floor architecture is a little older, with attempts at grandoise. It's rather vast floor area is dotted with tables which are way too small and a make-believe bar counter at the centre. I say make-believe because they only sell mocktails (Bummer, right?). With all this traditional architecture being thrown in your face, it's a little confusing why they have bassy disco music playing loudly in the background. Conversations become somewhat of a task. And for some baffling reason, their menu is embellished with United Kingdom symbols (they don't even serve English cuisine!). In general, the place is as distracting as it is off-putting - with waiters running around to scale the vast floor area while you wait for food at your cramped table.

The service was a pleasant surprise, thankfully. Although, the waiter's pleasantness didn't come without its share of mistakes - including bringing a rice dish we didn't order.

Overall, the place is strikingly dissatisfying - and doesn't merit a second visit (or even a first, really).

Visited on weekdays. Ambience is really good. The leather backed chairs, sofas, marble and wooden floors take the decor to a much appreciated level. 
We did not try many items. We had garlic chilli baby corn, mocktails, tandoori roti and paneer. Food was good and service was equally praise worthy. 
A good place to visit. :)

Location : ¬†Diagonally opposite to RDB Cinemas , Ground Floor of Srijan Corporate Park , sector -5¬†

Ambiance : ¬†Certainly looks the part . Upholstered seats in Leather. Dim lights here and there sure does remind you of power hungry corridors of her Majesty's Secret Service . Totally old school charm in play here.

Service : Courteous enough but no one exactly knew proper english !! Not the authentic service one would hope for . Well at least they knew most of the dishes inside out so that one could make an informed decision and informed us beforehand of the offer . Waiting time was about right for continental dishes : 20 mins.

Food : ¬†With a name such as this how can one even think of trying out chinese ¬†/ Indian Cuisine which do occupy quite a lot of the menu . Hence continental it was. Ordered the BBQ Chicken ¬†and the Lamb Bourguignon . The Blue Angel and Silver Star mocktalis came before the main dishes . The silver star was the clear winner here with an undertone of " Litchi " flavour . Could have drank an entire bottle of that :P . Both the dishes BBQ and the Lamb came with a helping of rice mind you . The order also included a free Mocktail and a compulsory Ice cream . The first thing you observe : Quantity not upto the mark ! The BBQ chicken had a orangy hue to it and didn't quite taste like a traditional BBQ dish would but it wasn't bad either .¬†
The lamb was done up in Brown sauce and tasted quite nice . Just the right amount of chewy .The rice was covered in Black olives and somewhat complimented the Lamb and the Chicken . Finally it was time for the dessert : Vanilla ice cream covered in scarce helpings of Chocolate . Probably the best vanilla ice cream i've had till now .¬†

Cost for 2 : 700/- plus ( average estimate )

Conclusion : Genuineness on point but quantity wise was disheartening . The main course looked like a snack ! Just a one time visit at best if you're eyeing continental . Not too expensive so most wouldn't have a hole in their pockets .

I went with a group to this place for sunday lunch..The place s really nice, ambience is  superb and must complement them for d decor.. The place s gud for group hogs as well as romantic dates.. They have some really interesting combos which are worth trying if i think economically, i.e doesn't burn ur pockets...But hang on before u make any judgements..I must say, whatever i, rather we had was really tasty and delicious...however the dishes mentioned in the menu are quite different from what actually lands up on the table.. Well, actually this goes for the Continental dishes..Indian n chinese cuisines are authentic but it ws actually disheartening to see punjabi style 'tadka' BBQ chicken and steaks with Indian gravy.. Nevertheless, I cant be too harsh on them coz the experience was really gud, service ws prompt backed by a courteous cheerful staff...I dont mind going bak to TDS.. My advice to the joint - Pl luk into the Continental section n pls get d liquor license asap....

We ordered fish n chips and Downing Street special Kabab which tasted perfect. We also ordered combo of butter chicken and Kadai Chicken and its taste was very good. They have different varieties of mocktail.
Service is very fast. The staff is very courteous and polite ready to please you.

Amazing ambience, best so far in sector 5 salt lake. They have decorated it to top level. Now comes to restaurant. We took combo lunch, which comes at 249+ tax. But it's a bit confusing while selecting the main course, they have lots of options.
Food was good, but the thing is quantity was not enough to feed to hungry tummy. We ordered tandoori roti, mutton kadai, and some Chinese dishes. Their Chinese items are a catch.
I must say they should improve their food service.
Some cons that I found:
1. They don't have any separate smoking zone, so it may be annoying when someone is smoking hukka just in the next table.
2. Service is a little slow.

This is a new restaurant, I will expect a little improvement on my next visit. I'm gonna go for ala carte this time.

One look at the interiors and you fall in love with this place. It has that nice British lounge kind of feel. The ambience receives five stars.
Coming to the food, we ordered the Chinese Platter, Tandoori Platter & Arrabiata Pasta. Delicious and good value for money. The portions were also generous. They haven't started drinks yet but I am waiting eagerly for them to start. Hookah was also made to perfection. 
Overall, it's an amazing new place to hang out with friends and family. Wish them all the luck. Looking forward to visit again.

Worst experience! Waste of time!  Pathetic service!  Uncaring attitude of staffs n waiters! 1 hour wait for the main course n when u complain they behave as of they don't care! If they continue like this they will soon have to close down! Pl don't waste ur time here! There are other better places in Salt Lake to hang out! I hope the management is taking note of this n they are not God save them.!

VEGETARIAN REVIEW.

I have this habit of going to new places which are cropping up in Calcutta at the speed of light which many of us foodies here have developed because that's basically what Calcutta has become good for.

So I came to know about this place from a friend who decided to give his birthday treat and boy oh boy! I have been here for more than 3 times in the past month.

Let's get on with the review then in which I will try to cover everything for a new cover.

1. How to get there: At a stone's throw from RDB cinemas which you can reach either by Uber using the Navigation or come to Karunamoyee Bus Stand from an Auto and then there's direct Auto to RDB Cinemas where you'll see a huge yellow sign board shouting '10 Downing Street!'

Ease of reaching there: 3.5/5

2. Ambiance: The biggest positive for this place is its Ambiance! It's huge. Like fucking huge. How do you define huge? It's bigger than that! I see people mentioning it to be 'British' themed, but truly speaking I don't have any idea how 'British' themed restaurants/cafes are so I wouldn't comment on that. You wouldn't feel congested at all as it's pretty open and has high ceiling!
The management of 10 Downing, you're yet to get a good playlist. Although the music has improved a lot since the past 2 visits but there's a lot to improve.

Rating of Ambience: 4.5/5

3. Furniture: The interiors are made of dark wood and you'll feel energized right when you enter to it. The whole place is neatly divided into 3 sections which serve the same purpose although the division is visible due to different seating! The first division is lush ambrosial sofas with wooden flooring! As you enter there's the Bar right in the center of the whole thing where you can see the bartenders doing there thing, you know bottling and stuff. The second division is normal. Where as the third division has high lifted chairs and tables. There's another floor which are preferable for a bigger group of 8-10.

The thing which I DIDN'T LIKE AT ALL was small tables! Both in the ground and first floor. And its quite irritating and annoying to be honest. The tables are so small that it feels full even with the glasses of water and there's no space for the dishes and other cutlery. And as a direct after effect, they don't keep ketchup, and oregano and the usual stuff which we find at other places for which you have to call the waiter everytime you remember you need something.

Rating of Furniture: 2.5/5

4. Food: The food is delectable. Not Finger Licking though. It's not at all bad. You'll leave satisfied. The service is on the slower side so be ready for a healthy dose of chatter otherwise you'll literally be killing time. But they have plenty of waiters to cover up for it. The menu is limited, small in size and and not at all detailed.

What I DIDN'T LIKE was that first off, they still don't have the license to sell alcohol although I am pretty sure that's coming up soon and will have more foot fall than ever. Secondly. They don't use good Oil and other raw materials. I could feel it in the fried stuff in the Indian Vegetarian Platter. The oil is SUBSTANDARD. See I ain't no expert foodie but if I can feel the low quality then be prepared for the heat from the health conscious and connoisseurs.

Rating for food: 3.5/5

5. My order and Recommendations: I ordered for 2 Mocktails which have so limited options that even girls won't have any confusion in ordering it, Fresh Lime Soda, Rissoto, Lasagna, Veg Indian Platter (Which is pretty decent with a lot of options, check picture) and one Fried Ice cream.

Rissoto, Lasagna and veg platter was very delicious. The mocktails were decent, they have just 3 options for desserts which is pretty disappointing. And to make things worse 2 of them were not available on a weekend. And the one which I ordered was a complete turn off. 'Fried' Ice-cream, again the low quality fry. A single vanilla scoop which chocolate sauce as low as water in a real desert.

6. Burn in the pocket: 1800 for 3. The food has been priced very correctly but the mocktails, 210 for one? That's a complete waste of money. It should be priced around 150-170 for the quality and quantity they provide.

7. Overall experience: The only thing that keeps me make going over there is its ambiance. If you're with your friends. It's a complete chillout place. Shisha. Music. Humoungous area. Although there's a lot lot to improve as has been pointed specifically above! I recommend this place!

10ds is a nation wide famous name in pubs. Finally it is here. We went for lunch. They have not got license to serve alcohol. The place is huge and ambience superb. It is grand and elegant. Wooden wall and wooden flooring with antique light shades, picture frames, high stools and couches. It is a 5 on 5 interior. Coming to food we had a type chicken kabab which was well made. We ordered pasta and lasagna and noodles. Those were also good. But nothing exceptional. The offered free mocktail / soup with every main course from 12 pm to 4pm. Mocktail was very flat and soup was just ok. All in all descent but not very impressive food. In fact menu wise i expected it to be more elaborate one. They do not have ham, pork or beef and that is a turn down for me in a pub with european dinning concept. Service was good but I would except the waiters to know more about the food they serve. None of them were able to explain few items which we asked. The price is reasonable. Only food will cost you around 500 per head.

An exquisitely decorated restaurant with lavish 1920s British themed interiors, I fell in love with this place the moment I walked in. 

The bar setting is brilliant with the vintage saloon chairs and the food is amazing! I have had my fair share of Dal Makhni but the Dal here beats everywhere. Brilliant Shisha too. I ordered my staple Teen Paan Rose and it was nicely made with enerous smoke. 

It has already become my hangout place. Keep up the good work guys! üòÅ

After having heard a lot about this place, came to know the reviews were not enough.
The ambience and feel of the place is typical british cafe with modern amenities. I loved the bar or the counter in the middle it is very attractive, the seating on the sofa/couches were comfortable (i dint try the chairs) there were 2 sofas in a corner with a illusion of room warmer fire (same as that in HIMYM) was very impressive. 
The food was good with a smooth hookah, i suggest to expand the menu to some other cusines and some signature dishes. Also, to have some plus points on the hookah as well to make the feel even more luxurious(may be an ice pipe or bong) 
The rates were reasonable. 
Also the floor for dance adds up to the potential of the place.
Good management and reasonable rates will give this place a constant footfal.
All the best,
Looking forward to visting again

Located in the heart of the Sector V near RDB cinemas ,the restaurant gets an ample opportunity to attract foodies.

Lets start with ambiance i will rate it 5/5. The restaurant atmosphere truly complies with the name and as i was there for dinner, dim lights was icing on the cake.

Food was preety good could be given 3.5/5, being a veg i tasted Chinese wanton (oily), nachos (excellent) and some other stuffs not worth mentioning.

In service the restaurant has a miles to go. Though they were quick in their services (could find only few foodie at the time i visited) but still they were pressing hard for some of their dishes in spite of our reluctance. Service could be rated 2.5/5.

Things I didn't like was the loud music played by them all the time because of the dance floor.Over all the restaurant is worth paying a visit for veg.

Located in sector v near Infinity buildings, I had visited this place once when it had not opened and I had received a tour of the resteraunt from the manager. 
Come to 26th May, 2016. I finally got an opportunity to visit 10 downing street for dinner with my friends. 

AMBIANCE : Grand. It is simply grand. The British themed resteraunt is going to take your breath away for a second. The moment you enter you are in awe of the sheer size and grandeur of the place. The sofas make for a very comfortable sitting. The resteraunt is pretty huge and is spread over multiple floors. The seating capacity must easily hit triple digits. 

Food : Decent. Just simply decent. Not great. Not bad. We had the standard north Indian dishes.. Naan, kuclha, paneer, aloo. Etc etc and lasangia. Nothing will wow you. 

Service : slow. They need to improve in their service. It takes usually 30 minutes and that's uncomfortably long waiting time at any resteraunt. 

Music : Sad music. The management really needs to update their music collection. The music wasn't groovy or catchy. Just didn't know whether they knew what they were playing. 

Things to look out for : if you are looking to mix dining with a some drags of hookah, this is the place to be. They serve hookah and they make a pretty decent one indeed which was quite surprising. 

They don't have a bar license as of now but you can very well imagine how this place is going to rock once it gets its license. 

Pocket pinch : On the cheaper side indeed. A meal for two will cost you 500 to 700 per head.

The d√©cor and the interiors is just fab..I was a lil disappointed with the service I.e. I did not find the servers attentive enough to refill water glasses on there own (since we wanted regular house water).
On the other hand loved the Thai green curry and the Greek salad..but the Chinese was so so..
So over all an above average place..but not very thrilled with the place...

Celebrated my birthday in this place.
Can easily vouch for the fact that give this restaurant 1 more month and it's going to be a legendary one in kolkata. The service and food are both  up top. The floor managers, the waiters ,all of them, very polite and eager to help.
The interiors speak of themselves.
And there's going to be a beautiful dance floor and DJs and every day is going to be a special one like Karaoke nights, or Ladies nights, etc.
On the 2nd floor it also has a huge projector, so party plannings are totally in too!

It's going to be huge. And did get a gist of it that evening.
Highly recommended.

Oh and have the fried ice cream for dessert. It's delicious!

We waited for abt an hr for starters to come in... then wat u receive is a "tandoori" platter with cold starters with 2 pcs of an item ! Then u wait for another hr fr main course to come in. Wen u pay so much , u deserve a better service . No doubt the food was OK, but not the worth of time & place. at this competition level & rising prices , this place is a total waste to visit !! Definitely not recommended

Yesterday Night unfortunately visited 10 Downing Street and I say unfortunate because its was nothing less then a nightmare to be there.

We were instantly impressed with the ambiance and decor  of the place and had a immediate liking for it but sadly all end there.

We ordered Manchow Soup and a Veg tandoori platter to start, Soup was served after 20 min which was really cold even after specific instruction at time of order that we need really hot, Veg Platter took about 1 hour to serve that too after 5-7 reminders, we were tolerant till then as the taste was ok, but then the real ordeal started, main course was order as soon as we had the platter, Pindi Chana, Daal Makhani, Mushroom Masala, Cheese Olive Kulcha Onion Kulcha, Harich Parantha. 

No waiter was interested in refilling the empty water glass even after repeated request, a plate with 4 thin slices of Onion & lime was served between 4 people, looking at the time taken for starter after 30 min we started reminding for order to the person who has taken our order & every time we got answer it will be severed in 5 min, after another 15 min or so we got up from table and asked the person sitting on Cash counter to look into the matter and get service done but still nothing, we kept asking and reminding every other person we could get hold on for the order, after about 1 hour had passed we decided to quit and asked them to cancel the  order and bill for what already served, they were not ready to cancel and finally food was served, which took 15-20 reminders, some arguments &  1 hour 15 min  of time.

In the mean time we had asked for more onions and we kept reminding for it when the food was being served, even after the service we asked for it a minimum of 10 times, lastly when we were stern about it we got the reply we are sorry we dont serve free onions (what the F***) I think serving of Pickle & Onion with Indian Food is almost customary, even smallest of joint serves that, and even if you do not serve complimentary onions why you served those 4 slices on first place, then why dont you have Onion Salad on your menu and why dont you inform this when first time we asked for it.

Now coming to the food, Mushroom was good, Daal was ordinary and Pindi Chana was horrendous, Breads where ok, As soon as Chana for served we called upon waiter to take it back as the Bowl was 1/3 full of OIL and all the plates were oiled from the serve, we somehow had half the meal as we have gotten really hungry with the wait, we could not eat any further due the Onion Fiasco which was still going on and the plate that was messed with all the oil from Chana, we asked to clear the plates and where amazed by the speed it was done and bill presented (they never even bothered to ask why so much food was left or for deserts.) 

Then came the ultimate part, Pinidi Chana was charged in the bill, when we pointed it out to the person on Billing counter (who seemed to be from management) we were told that very little of serving was there in the bowl returned (how much will be left from one serve if its has been serviced in 4 plates) Look at the audacity, even after all the fiasco, forget an apology they were not ready to deduct it from the bill, (so guys if you are still visiting this doomed place and happen to return back any dish which is not upto standard remember to empty back the serve from the plates), we finally paid the full bill and left, they had no remorse to what have happened and to how miserably they have failed in customer service.

BUT there is one Brownie point, as there were no Napkins or tissue paper on table and looking at the service my wife decided to fetch some herself from restroom and we applaud them for the excellent quality of paper towel kept there.

So Visit this place (if u really do) with loads and loads of Tolerance & Patience.

Hats off to them for creating a new bench mark for low.

Lastly the name itself says all DOWN(ing) .

This is 10 drowning street. An evening totally ruined. The service is nowhere close to be called a service. The waiters were hapless and were totally unaware of what they were doing. We'd to wait for 1.5 hours to get our food. Well the decor and food was good. That was the only plus point. But the guys really need to put their boots up and treat the place as palatial as exhibited. I am not visiting again.

Located near Infinity Building - Sector 5, a wonderful place has opened up for a regular hangout.
To start with, it has amazing interiors, with a perfect English look (as the name suggests) with ample seating capacity. Its well spacious especially the ground floor, the mezzanine one is a bit congested.
They have a decent variety of mocktails, with watermelon cooler being a recommendation. We ordered a Chinese platter which was tooooo oily, a paneer tikka which had a decent portion size and a Sheesha (Spring water-kiwi) which was very well made.
The only negative is they haven't started serving alcohol yet.

I would like to give A+ for the decor and ambience. Food quality is good. The tandoori platter is an attraction more than the Chinese one. Combos are available only for lunch at a reasonable price. However the waiters need be little more trained. Hours could be spend on chatting while smoking various flavours of hookah. If chilled beer could be served then that would give the non smokers to spend equal time with hookah lovers.

New place to try out in sector 5. Very convenient location wise. Not many people know about it now so it would be relatively crowd free. Great to enjoy a casual dinner with your friends. The decor and ambience is lovely. Better than most of the places near Rdb.
Food is pretty decent, if not great... We tried the regular stuff. I had stuffed mushrooms and chicken kebab for starters which were good.we chose fried rice, chilly chicken dry and Thai veg curry for main course. Good value for money for the food served. Won't burn a hole in your pocket.
They are yet to get their liquor license.
Worth a try!

10 downing street is known as the address of first prime minister of United Kingdom and trust me this place will give you the Royal feeling as soon as you arrive there. It is a very new name added to the list of foodies in the city.

Located just near the RDB adlabs movie theater at saltlake sector v. Easy to locate.

They have totally justified their name in terms of Decor and ambiance. Wow.. I was just mesmerized by the look of this place. The mezzanine floor with the lovely chandelier hanging was giving this a royal look and the set up all around was just perfect with the look. Though they are yet to get their liquor license but the bar counter has been set up amazingly. Marvellous..

**Food**
"With great power comes a great responsibility" we know this quote and believe in it. So with the majestic presence the expectations was set at a standard for the food as well. But it was a total let down I would say.. We started off with two starters having in mind to have out dinner but the experience changed our mind totally.

Nawabi Malai Kebab was just about okay which more of tasted like reshmi Kebab to be very honest but was decent

Chicken Lasagna was a total disappointment when we were served with smelly cheese added to it. Didn't like it.

We cut sort our meal there and backed off

**Service**
Their service was a genuine issue. Very very slow and disorganized. A simple Kebab took 40mins to reach our table where there were hardly some guests in the place. Opening a huge place and but not giving a good service is always a turn off for everybody. I hope management will take this seriously and work on it from the very beginning.

In midst of all hush of sector v, u will find this place which will surely make you feel that it is certainly a time machine. Old craft,dim light and great ambience. Perfect hangout place. Ambience is just mesmerizing and so is the food. Service is bit on the slow side and you may lose patience sometimes. But if you go in a group that surely wont hurt you as you can have lots of fun with everyone.

A CROWD PULLER INDEED as one of my friends said..!!!¬†
Loved the ambience, ¬†mammoth floor area, the typical looks of english/irish pub, high ceilings, superb use of wood & glass, spacious seating arrangements, polite waiters, lovely food, Value for money(Key to survive in a business hub like Salt Lake Sector 5).
TOTALLY LOVED THE EXPERIENCE..!! 

This place will be the most sought after place, sooner or later, in Salt Lake Sector 5. A big competition for THE BAKSTAGE once they get the license to serve liquor..!!

BEING A NEARBY RESIDENT I WILL DEFINITELY BE A FREQUENT VISITOR WITH FRNZ AND FAMILY TILL I GET BORED OF THE PLACE..!!¬†

Only One Suggestion: Please let the customers use WI-FI because of such low network connectivity inside the place..!! It would add to your value..!!

I went to this place on 15.05 for the 1st time to celebrate my mom's b'day.
We waited around 45 mins, would have left much earlier if the security was little more updated on a/c of timings. After the wait was finally over & we entered inside(thank god) we waited more of 10-15 mins as the table wasn't clean...

When we entered the restaurant , I said myself that did I step into a time machine and went back to the victorian era?
A very nice well decorated place with very well behaved waiters but I think given the ambience , the people should be trained in that way. Nevertheless, a very nice experience
Coming to the food , we ordered golden garlic soup,lemon chicken coriander soup as starters. The golden garlic soup was absolutely marvellous with right amount of veggies and right amount of garlic. The lemon chickn soup was ok because i felt it was a bit sour .We also ordered a kabab platter , which was very good. If you go in a group of 4-5 ,one plate is sufficient for all.It contained one mutton , 2 types of fish kebab n 2 types of chicken kabab.
For the main course we ordered a garlic chilli haka noodle which was made medium spicy on request with chicken in black bean sauce and lamb chunks in sanghai sauce as side dish. All of them were very good and tasted perfect. specially the lamb chunks were very soft, palatable and a flavour that will savour your mouth.
Fried ice cream was the target as soon as we saw the dessert menu . It was huge, yummiest filled with coconut and once you cut it open the ice cream comes out. A must must try in the dessert menu.
The cons of the restaurant is that it punched a hole in our pocket claiming 600 rs for the taxes only. moreover it did not provide us any corporate discount despite of being situated in sec 5.

Its a newly opened one but that makes it no less better than the others in sector-5. It does not have any liquor license as of now. The dim lighting is perfect for partying. It has got a huge place making it suitable for bringing groups of frns here. The set meal is enuf when you r not very hungry that too at a very reasonable price. I am definitely going there once iy gets the liquor license. The service is a lil slow bit the staff welcomes u warmly. They even ask for ur feedback once you r done eating. Make sure you visit this place.

I visited this place when it was under construction and was expecting to open after their liquor licence. Interiors are nice and so is the total space but the mezzanine level looks little congested. Yet to try the food but got average review about it.

Really had great expectations from this place, but I have to say was disappointed about a lot of things.
Firstly it is not a family restaurant. They don't have big long tables. So if you are in a big group you'll have to adjust in many tables of 4.
The ambience and feel of the place is great. Very comfortable chairs, very nice decor and nice music.
Coming to the food, we ordered their kebab platter which was quite good. We ordered manchow and hot and sour soup. It was really nice. We had dal makhni, mix vegetable and a Paneer dish. Overall I was happy with the food.
They charge 5% for the service. I am very sorry to say that the staff though polite and not at all well trained. They keep running around. They don't have any clue about the billing system. And this was the common opinion about other people in the restaurant as well. There was another large family sitting near us. They had a huge argument with the waiters because of their poor service. Other restaurants which charge for service have much better service.
I would end by saying that, your ambience is great, food is quite good. But with this kind of service you are not going to have happy customers. I can see that the average rating is around 3.4 but I had a pretty bad experience with the service. That 5% which the charged for service is not worth at all. It was totally unprofessional and chaotic.

Our city moves closer to becoming 'London' with '10, Downing Street' opening in the Sector V area after 'The Big Ben', which has been running successfully for a very long time (I don't mean that clock tower in Lake Town but the pub in Kenilworth Hotel). Jokes apart this is an excellent restaurant & hopefully they'll soon be functioning as a pub as it was originally intended. The service here is impeccable, certainly one of the best in this city, and the ambience is just awesome. They've a pub lunch offer going on from 12 to 4 in the afternoon which everyone should try out. As for the food it is very good. We had the Butter Chicken with Steamed Rice, Kung Pao Fish with Hakka Noodles & Chicken Stroganoff. Mocktails/soft drinks, soup & dessert were also part of the combo offer. The Butter Chicken & Kung Pao fish were outstanding while the Stroganoff was good. Though I've tasted better Stroganoff elsewhere. A place definitely worth checking out. The competition in the locality is tough so I do hope they keep up their high standards.

Firstly I would say as soon as u enter the place it's gives u vintage feeling as in you have entered a castle somewhere in United Kingdom and it's obvious as the name suggests. The place is quite spacious and menu was elaborate. The staff is cordial and well mannered. Liquor license is still awaited but hookah, mocktails and starters were well prepared and served. The only thing that puts you off is the music. Overall we liked the place and looking forward to next visit.

A brilliant place to hangout with your friends. The interiors and the ambience is mind blowing. The English theme will impress you the moment you reach the main gate. Food is fabulous. Mocktails are brilliant as well. Plus I personally liked the staff a lot. We wanted a Mocktail which was not on the menu and they obliged and it was equally brilliant. One should definitely try their Tandoor platter which has a lot of brilliant options and speaks volumes of the brilliant food they serve. They hope to acquire the bar license soon and I'm sure once they do that, the atmosphere will be buzzing. Full marks to the staff for they were very welcoming.

The grandeur and regality of this place make it stand out of the crowd of restaurants. People are now looking for something different in restaurants and this one has struck the right chord. The ambience is very good and you might really feel that you are sitting inside the namesake of this place some five thousand miles away :p. Food variety and quality is good but there is scope for improvements in them. I'm hopeful that this place will be within top three of the list of best restaurants at sector v in near future.

5/5 to this fantabulous place! Two words to describe this - Grand and Classy! Won't be too long, when this place would be most talked about in town! A bit of gamble to open such a plush, luxury, biig, large investment place in North Kolkata! Hope they don't close down coz we want to go there again n again! They have hookah too, n learnt from manager that they are soon going to get liquor license. Food tastes good too, complementing the d√©cor. Have never been to this beautifully decorated restaurant in the city. A must must go, for dates, for family dining, for hangout, for taking guests from other city here to feel proud ;) everything is good about this place. The beautifully decorated bar, the antiques, paintings, wooden furniture, wooden floor and stairs, wallpapers, clocks. Way to go 10DS!!

My 2nd visit - am disappointed with the veg Chinese starter platter. It had everything battered and fried! Wontons, spring rolls, baby corn tempura, and some horrible bread with sesame seeds thing! It was baaad. Never order. May be too much of innovation on one simple Chinese starter platter was a disaster. Also ordered corn cheese lasagna which was good.

My 3rd visit - so much disappointed with the hookah. Always choking. Tried fried ice cream, it was just amazing. Vanilla ice cream balls coated with coconut powder and fried.

'MAJESTIC' is the only word that popped up into my head, the moment I entered 10 Downing Street. The interiors of this restaurant is meant to emulate an old British palatial structure from the colonial age; and I must say, they have done full justice to it. Located at sector V, near Opium; this restaurant (soon to turn into a watering hole) took me by surprise.

Its a hugeeeee place, and the moment you enter; an enormous chandelier and a very well decorated & elaborate bar section welcomes you. The entire restaurant is divided into different sections and each section has a different sort of furniture, as if like different rooms in a palatial building. Everything is elaborate and everything is old British, starting from high ceilings, imposing furniture, a false fire place, old style telephone, a false balcony, an iron-finish bar counter, wallpapers of book shelves,wall hangings of kings and queens. They also have a small secluded area, maybe that will be turned into a dance floor once they obtain their liquor license. I was personally quite overwhelmed by the interiors. What i didn't like was the music, i found it to be too peppy; also they have big LCD TV, neither of which complimented the old British style interiors.

Now, coming to the food. We ordered nawabi chicken kabab. This was primarily a chicken rashmi kabab stuffed with cashews and raisins. And it came with some salad and pudina dip. This kabab was nice and fresh, but not exceptional. First we ordered only the kabab which took really long (about 40mins), we were left waiting hungry. Then we ordered the chicken lasagne and after taking a few bites, all of us realized that the cheese had gone bad. We immediately complained and they changed the lasagne without any troubles. The next lasagne that came was definitely much, much better and was lot more creamier. It was quite delicious.

A special mention needs to be made of the manager Sinchan Sarkar who was courteous, and helpful throughout the evening, and our server Barun Mondal who was well versed with the menu and made helpful suggestions.

Wishing team 10 Downing Street all the very beat for the future!

Tendys in Kolkata, I had to be there the moment I heard of it and yes they are associated with the original 10 downing Street. We were greated well on entering, spacious and lovely interiors speaks of its class! We called for a chicken nawabi kebab which arrived post 30 minutes after ordering... It tasted decent though, more like a simple reshmi kebab. Then it was a disasterous chicken lasagne which smelled of rotten cheese, on complaining it was replaced with a nice lasagne made with different cheese. A few things they need to look into being a new place. We wanted to speak to someone of authority but the manager could not help us much. Overall a decent experience, hope they get better with days :)

Strategically placed very near to sdf and rdb cinemas, it's hard not to notice this place. Even though part of the building is under construction, the look of the building was enough to draw us in.
Walking in, you are sure to notice the lovely interiors and fab ambience. They offer nice combos for lunch which we decided to try.
We ordered two continental combos with chicken lasagna and bbq chicken.
The soup and mocktails were nice. The lasagna was delicious but the bbq chicken slightly over. For desert, for now they only have vanilla ice cream.
They are yet to open the bar which will certainly make this place more happening.
Overall, a lovely experience and surely will go back for more.

A newly opened watering hole ( minus the bar as they still haven't got their bar licence, hopefully they'll get it soon) in sector 5 Salt Lake. It's quite easy to locate being near Rdb boulevard. It's located in a pretty impressive building and there's no problem of car parking. The interiors are done up very beautifully and tastefully keeping to the theme. It's named 10 Downing Street band the decor  somewhat adheres to it. There are British Knick knacks all over and even photos of the Queen. There is even a faux fireplace.( quirky but interesting) The bar area is situated in the middle of the restaurant and at present are only serving mocktails, all of which we had were excellent. The food too is good and tasty, we had North Indian and liked it a lot. I hope they continue to serve good tasty food,maintain their standards. Hope they are able to get their permit to open their bar soon . Cheers!!!
