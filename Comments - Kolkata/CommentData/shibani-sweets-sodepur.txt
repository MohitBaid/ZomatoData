Good place to grab quick and pocket friendly evening snacks... But their sitting area is worst.... Sweets are good... Specially baked rasogolla and baked mihidana was very good.

Extremely crowdy place. Really slow service. Food is also really unhygienic. Sweeta and fries have a lot of varients. Not that bad but wouldn't recommend.

Good one !!!! A restaurant for vegetarians.......
Tasted almost each item.. paovaji is just excellent in taste here...
Dhokla, dhosa & pooris are also good. Also I like the evening snacks,chowmin, fried rice & chilli paneer here ... But don't try veg momos here..paneer momo is good & the soup is also good which they provide with momos...
The main thing is that seating is not available inside that shop... But there are some seats at the side of bt road ... They should be careful about the roadside dust .. it's an awareness.....
Hope they should think about it..

I think this is not best sweet shop in sodepur. Modan Mohan mistanna bhander just beside sriniketan fashion limited is more better than that though after death of the Woner , quality goes down too much but till it is better than that. Beside this subal is another shop .with respect of card I think it is better. It is like famous Amrit's card north kolkata fariya pukur. Ashesh also another for some kind of sweets.for amrity  misti only one shop is better just beside 4 no platform ticket counter shop. They only this sweet in their kitchen. Others may be taken from outside. U must feel it when u will bite that sweet. Swarada  for its special khirkadam. After all it is not so good. Only kachuri is good from all others but quality goes down.

A prominent sweet shop on B.T. Road, the outlet has an outdoor seating arrangement for it's customers. The quality of sweets is really good and hopefully they continue to maintain that to stay in competition with some other big names in the area. Not only the sweets, but also the snacks items are well prepared and taste delicious. A one time experience may turn into a frequent affair.

For those who do not stay close to the highway, you can enjoy the sweets at their other outlet beside Sodepur railway station, which also remains pretty busy all day.

Such a good place to hang around with friends and family. The best thing is that everythinhg is vegetarian and no non veg items are available. Everything here starting from paw bhaji,masala dosa,chilli momo,dahi bada ,noodles tandoors all are very tasty. Recently they have launched the baked rasogolla and its the best in sodpure. Very tasty. Just love this place .

This sweet confectionary is near sodepur station, which sells a variety of sweets & snacks. 

Ambience is ok with quick service and nice staffs.

I tried sondesh, dahi vada, momo, which were all ok but nothing to rave about.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

Caters the need of local people very well, but true food lovers like me has many other options.

This sweetshop as well as snacks corner serves some quality foods. It's a completely veg food joint which serves many items like paw bhaji, dahi Vada, dhosa, dhokla, veg momo, noodles etc. I liked their paw bhaji and dahi Vada. I have heard that the noodles are quite good. Sweets are good like chocolate sandesh, malpoa etc. Though I didn't like their 'labanga latika' much. Momo was also good. The location of this joint is quite good.

A well known place in Sodepur, specially because of the great variety of sweets it has on offer.
Primarily a sweet shop it also has a savoury section to it that serves veg snacks such as Pav Bhaji, Dahi Vada and more. 
The eatery is a strict vegetarian one so it doesn't put Onion and Garlic in the food. 

Thy serve really delicious Schezwan Noodles. The dahi vada and Pav Bhaji are all time favourites. The Spring roll needs to step up, it is very bland but still good in terms of the fact that no onion or Garlic is used.

It is primarily a sweet shop and hence they retain their forte and make delicious sweets. A must try is their sugar free sandesh which is very healthy. 

Happy eating !!!

I have been here for many times...have tried so many items ...ABSOLUTELY VEGGIE..no items with onion and garlic also..so strict vegans can try this outlet..now they have proper seating arrangements outside the main shop..
All items taste good..HUGE QUANTITY of every item is served in tables.....
Every item cost also pocket preferable..buttttt there is a very disadvantage point that they use low quality oil ...not good for health..
Talking about food items..all curry items are good ..and I think they must have a world record for sharing sooo much paneer in every item ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚......believe me the mom is they prepare are at the level of BETASTE MOMO....but not comparable with wow mono brands...sooo recommend for all veggies in zomato.......thankssss

This sweet cum savoury shop on BT Road is taking the whole of sodepur by storm.People throng to this place in great number and for sometime you may even have to wait to be seated.

There is an air conditioned shop which serves the mishtis,dhoklas. There Â is no seating arrangement within the shop.
There is an outside open air seating arrangement which serves savouries like chinese samosa,dosa,chowmein,pav bhaji and momos.

I am more of a savory person and I ordered chowmein which at 60 bucks was reasonable.All the items are vegetarian items.The quantity and the quality is quite good.
I took home paneer momos and ladoos. They served both the soup as well as the chilli sauce.The soup was quite tasty in comparison to the soup given with momos outside rabindra sadan metro station.
Overall a good place.

This place is just beside the Sodepur station. While returning home, many a times I shop for the  sweets.
Not only sweets they do keep samosas which are huge in size and  one samosa can fill u up.
They have variety of other options such as kachoris, veg chops, paneer chops.
I am great fan of their gulab jamun which is served piping hot.
Pocket pinch is very friendly.

This kind of shop is what Sodepur has been in dire need of. Not a traditional sweet shop. But a dry foods shop with the sweets option. All the food items available here are very good welcomes for your taste buds...trust me. And during weekends, you had better come early, 'cause there's a line out the door!!

Okay, this is just what I needed in Sodepur. I agree that there were already 2/3 sweet shops here providing quality items, but the idea of innovation in those items were missing. Then comes this shop, an absolute delight according to me- providing both quality and innovation in sweets and that too, at a very affordable rate.Â 
They have two shops: one on B.T.Road near Sodepur Traffic mor crossing; and another one near the Sodepur Railway Station. They also serve snacks alongside. Dahi vada, Masala Dhokla, Paneer chop and the Kachori they serve deserve special mention. The B.T.Road outlet serves more variety and also has an outdoor seating facility. The station outlet suffers from a space crunch though.Â 

I recently had the special chocolate sweet items they've introduced at 10, 15 and 20 INR; and trust me, they're worth the price. One can get sweets starting from 6,7 rupees to 25-30 rupees as well. Do try their Rajbhog as well.Â 

Highly recommended.
