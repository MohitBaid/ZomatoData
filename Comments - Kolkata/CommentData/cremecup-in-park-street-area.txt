so I was craving for cakes on Friday night and I ordered Caramel butterscotch... these people are so kind they took my orders 10 minutes before they close and delivered in 3 hours! Freshly baked, perfect amount of sweetness and crunchiness of butterscotch and hugs for delivering it in such a short time üòòü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è

Worstttt cake I had in my life..I wonder how people rate 4.5 after having Flurys and Lalit Bakery...
I ordered for a chocolate cheesecake..whch was like paneer...no creme no cake..nothing..instead try lalit bakery at this price. Worst ever cake shop. Please do not order..cakes r horrible shit. 

Not recommended at all. I would rather gv a negatv rating and have thrown the cake in dustbin. Spoiler for a brthday. Never order please..never.

Bad experience. ordered 6 pcs of donuts to gift someone. Delivered before time. but wrong things delivered. On complaining ....they just went on arguing......I shall never ever order from Cremecup.
¬†They do not know to how retain customer and provide delightful service.
As per them, the delivery boy has confirmed that there were no mispicking. How can a delivery boy confirm that the ordered products only were delivered !!!!!!
Quality not superb compared to the price.

Pathetic service, didn't deliver. I ordered a cake for a friend which was supposed to be delivered by night.  These guys kept me waiting for God knows how long. I called them, they said the cake will be delivered soon. After that  I couldn't even contact them, idk nobody picked up or their customer care didn't receive the calls. They are a big time party spoiler. We had to go to at 11 in night to get a cake. Not experimenting with this place again.

Today I ordered a Caramel Brownie for a very sweet person. She was delighted when it arrived. Apparently she loved it and she was very happy which in turn made me happy so. Keep spreading the joy!

They don‚Äôt even deserve half a star. Third time in a row I‚Äôve had a bad experience with them. They shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äòdelivery only‚Äô bakery if they cannot cope with weekend rush. They accept the order but then themselves ask to cancel it. Pathetic service! Not worth the time at all!

It was my best friend‚Äôs birthday and I was in another city. That‚Äôs when I came across cremecup.in  
I ordered for their truffle cake as the safest option and called in to make customisations. They were very polite and extremely accommodating. 
They delivered the cake within 2 hours on the dot, and it was so well packaged that my friend funnily thought I had shipped it! 
The cake, as I found out later, had been fresh, moist and  ridiculously delicious. 
The best blind online ordering experience I‚Äôve had.

I just ordered blueberry cheesecake and I loved it. They make it really really well and the one pound cake, even though it's a bit small is really worth the money. I don't think there's any bakery in Kolkata that matches up such cost effective cheesecakes. Though I feel that they can increase the variety of cheesecakes available at the place.

It's pretty reasonable for birthdays as they serve more cheesecakes compared to others. Kit Kat cake was totally amazing, you can gift anyone on their birthdays.

Somewhat disappointed with my order of cookies. I expected them to be nice and chewy but they were more like a hard biscuit. A little overpriced for what they are. I'd advise to find a new recipe for proper cookies.
                    

- gave us another batch of cookies, I think they are just not my type. They are not badly made at all, but they are more of a biscuit than a cookie (quite hard when I prefer them to be chewy). But for the customer service provided I can definitely give a nice review & we will definitely sample some other items from the menu sometime.¬†

Ordered a 1lbs Black Forest Cake. The taste was good and delivery was smooth. The layers of cake had choco chips and strawberry blended. Very different from the regular Mio Amore ones. But they can improve to a top notch cake spclst with time. Not a bad first experience. But one point to mention, prices are much higher and can be revised.

Hello Friends...I would say their r not poor but horrible in their services. On 10th March I have ordered for a cake for my mother in the mid morning. The time slot within which they were supposed to deliver was post 6 pm. I got a call as well as mail saying that I would receive the delivery within 5:30 pm latest. Though it was a prepaid order the cake never reached me that day in spite of several calls and emails. I had to call and check with them if at all they are sending. Yes it was raining bad that day and they have a reason. My problem starts after that...I called them up around 7 pm to say I have left and if they could initiate the process of refunding my money. To which Somnath Mallick the guy I was coordinating with said he would initiate the refund process immediately and I would get the mails and sms update. Its 15th of March and still no mails and sms has reached me and I cannot see any proactive initiative from the team. I called them up yesterday, response: "we will get back" and today again "we will get back". Horrible shit happening here...Never been harassed this way...Please do not order from this site or take their service. It sucks to the core...Such unprofessional attitude and such poor customer service is just not accepted!!!

Whether you're celebrating or not, Creme Cup is sure to scintillate your tastebuds!  I used to have to purchase different products from different places until I discovered Cremecup.in. They have everything I need in one place and that too delivered at your doorstep. Creme Cup is fresh and full of newness too. Each time I attempt to order I discover some exciting new stuff that I'm quite tempted to try. The impressive prices, free and efficient delivery are also welcome too! Whenever I have called a member of their team, they have been amicable, helpful and know their stuff. Their cakes are fresh, gorgeous and scrumptious. Creme Cup has very much been part of my celebrations and I wholeheartedly recommend this online bakery to all. Thank you Creme Cup for making it special.

Both the cakes were awesome. It makes your tastebuds tingle with the yummy flavours. Had ordered two cakes for my sister's bday. Quality , packaging and everything else was really commendable. Just one thing that I need to mention is that the delivery was extremely late. Even the coordination during this process was not what I expected and I was disappointed. Since there were guests waiting and I was assured by the restaurant person that there wouldn't be a delay. But delay was for almost of two hours. If they just improve on this part then it would be really nice. I would specially Thank Zomato Customer care support for coordinating during the entire process of the order to the delivery... The support from the support team of Zomato is amazing... Hats off...

Location-Park Street,Kolkata.

Cremecup.in is India's first online bakery and it was for the first time we have ordered a cake from this place.Our eyes was dazzled after seeing such adorable varieties on their website.After a lot of confusion we finally decided to order a "Dairy Milk Cake" and indeed it was a right decision for us.The cake was layered with melted dairymilk and it was so gooey that it just run into our mouth.They also have an excellent service and our cake was delivered with in 4 hours.

I ordered customised donuts for my bestie's birthday. The donuts arrived right on time in a nice cool(literally) box. I expected them to be a bit bigger in size but still never the less they were nicely done. One area of improvement is that the bread of the donut could be made softer but so far it's the best donut I have had in Kolkata. Keep up the good job. You can expect more orders from me. And my bestie simply loved it...So I forgive the two spelling mistakes you did in writing the messages. :)

A friend had ordered for a chocolate cake from Creme Cup for my brother's birthday. The first thing that caught my eye (of course) was the packaging. It was a clean and minimalist design. The bold color choices balanced in a smooth way with the typography took away at least ten minutes of my time. Lovely. So didn't wanna discard it.

Coming to the cake. It looked okay. Not great. But the taste was good enough. Very smooth though and it melted like butter. :)

To be honest, can't wait to order one myself. Definitely would.¬†

Oh and when I realized that it was ordered online and delivered, couldn't wait to check out the website myself. Good concept. :) Kolkata needed it.

Looks like the biggest mistake ever!!!!Do not at any cost order from here guys!They took ¬†6 hours to deliver 6 mini and stale doughnuts that costed me a bomb Rs 443 to be specific!!!Most disgusting doughnuts that I have ever tasted

after ordering online,a lady called in to confirm the order.I asked her specifically that if it is a white cream filled doughnuts and she confirmed that it was.But when I get the delivery I see white chocolate coated on top ¬†of stale doughnut bread!!!!Most horrible and completely disappointing.

If given an option I would not have given it even 1 that's how disgusted I am.

‚ÄãCremecup.in, India‚Äôs first online bakery, has already changed our concept on cakes and bakes. They have certainly proved their tagline with time, which says, ‚ÄúChanging the way India eats Cake‚Äù. With every festival in the city, Cremecup.in has always geared up itself and has launched a wide range of cakes and goodies. With Diwali knocking at the door, they are ready with some amazing products which they have named as ‚ÄúDiwali Delights‚Äú. Let‚Äôs go into details !

I needed a custom build birthday cake. Their service was awesome and prompt, I was extremely satisfied. They couldn't deliver the exact one i had in mind, even after talking to the cake artist at a length, but the service they provide makes me wonder whether i wasn't clear enough with my instructions. I am extremely happy with your service. Just hope you would deliver what you are expected, P.S. the concept of flowers on a birthday cake as a decor put me off, but the cake you delivered wasn't bad either... :D "kudos to you people". Thank you

My sister ordered a Blueberry cheese cake from cremecup.in for my birthday. It was beautifully presented right from the packaging to the decoration of the cake.

The best part was the way the cake was set. The cake had a base of biscuit crumb with the most beautiful cheese cake base topped with a Blueberry glaze with lots of blueberry bits.
Cutting the cake was not a messy affair. 

I would not be wrong if I said this was the best cheesecake in terms of texture I've had in the city.

 My only suggestion being the addition of coconut flavoured biscuits to the base should be stopped because of which my brother refused to have the cake. A few of my friends are also averse to coconut flavour in desserts.

Tomorrow with huge expectations I ordered an one pound Mango Cheese Cake from here.... Topping of Mango gelatin had totally disappointed me, it tasted not up to the mark.... Although Cheese Cake and biscuits crumbles were good.... I love their packaging, it is very elegant and classy.... Delivery boy was well behaved.... Cost of the cake was okish...

Have ordered for the chocolate cheese cake for my mom's birthday.The cake was awesome. Was totally impressed by the quality & the presentation, the cake tasted as good as it looks. The delivery technique is also very well curated...they had delivered the cake to my Saltlake residence(all the way from Park Street) & the cake was completely undisturbed & they have given delivery bang on the schedule time.

This joint is very famous for their lovely cakes. the best thing is they don‚Äôt compromise with the quality.their corporate office located in park street but right now they don‚Äôt have any outlet.i was recently invited with my fellow foodies by the management of creamcup for their newly launched cakes,pastries and rakhi special platter. the most unique concept which they introduced it is their box surrounded by dry ice.which helps to keep the cake cold. not only various types of cakes they launched some lovely fresh croissants,quiches.we started our tasting session with lovely croissants and quiches.

Celebrate the joyous occasion of Rakshabandhan with Creme Cup..!

If anything sets apart Cremecup from rest of the patisseries, it is their thirst for innovation and to use high quality ingredients. Everything from the very start till the end is highly efficient and professional, and hence gives you very less or almost no chance to put up any complain. Their designs are unparalleled and these guys are mostly known for the Custom Cakes they dish out for their patrons. They mostly boast about the packing box they had invented something which is very rare and I personally haven‚Äôt heard about it anywhere else. It is a specially designed box, which helps to keep the cake cold, for 12/24 hours. A design, which has brought them much fame, glory and popularity, is on its way to be patented. The owner of Cr√®me Cup said, that they took much pride in what Cremecup has been doing, and no other bakery has come up with such an innovative idea.

For the time being, Cr√®me Cup does not have a walk-in store, but has a corporate office at Park Street. To place an order for your beloved one is as simple as eating a cake yourself. Log into their website, select the cake you want to choose and voila, its done! The order needs to be placed a couple of hours in advance, as everything is done here from the scratch. Once the cake is done, it is then carefully packed, and delivered to your preferred drop point upon a superfast bike. This popular patisserie, on the eve of blessed Rakshabandhan, has come forward with their Rakhi special platters, cupcakes and other savories to make this festival a memorable one. For those brothers who want to gift something special to their sisters, or to those sisters who want to treat their brothers with some ‚Äòsweet‚Äô cakes, after tying the ‚ÄòRakhi‚Äô onto their hand, look no further! Simply choose the Rakhi platter or one of their customized or flavored cakes!

Team #panchphoron was cordially invited, for a brief tasting session, to try out the Rakhi Special platters, cupcakes and other savories, and for us, Rakshabandhan came a little bit early. The spread was huge, the choices were virtually unlimited and the options seemed neverending. Who doesn‚Äôt love cakes and pastries? Being a Bong, you are born with a ‚Äòsweet tooth‚Äô, and nothing can keep us separate from having good desert or anything sweet at any hour of the day. After a quick round of photosession, we were treated with these delicious goodies, and we couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

Following is the list which was put up for us. The same can also be availed on the eve of this Rakshabandhan:

Cakes:

¬†

1.       Lemon Mousse Cake

2.       Mango Chili cheese cake

3.       Mango Chocolate Cake

4.       Water Melon Cake

5.       Rose Pistachio Cake

6.       Bubble Gum Cake

¬†

Croissants:

1.       Spinach & Corn

2.       Tandoori Paneer

¬†

Quiche:

1.       Spinach & Cottage Cheese-

¬†2.       Sundried Tomato & Olive

¬†

Rakhi Platter

¬†

Cupcakes in the Rakhi Platter-

‚Ä¢         Salted Caramel Cupcake in a jar

‚Ä¢         Chocolate Oreo Cupcake in a jar

‚Ä¢         Bubble Gum Cupcake in a jar

‚Ä¢         Rose Pistachio Cupcake in a jar

What impressed me the most is the individuality and uniqueness in each of the items we had tried. For the Lemon Mousse Cake, the slight tanginess of the lemon left us mesmerized. The Mango Chili Cheese Cake, had the perfect infusion of mango and the spicyness of the chili. With layers of mango and cheese, with a bit of chili infused in them, it was a sheer delight to the tastebuds. The Watermelon cake again was a pure delight, with flavors and taste of a real watermelon. The star of the night, was however the Bubblegum cake. If one remembers, the classic Bubblegum, Boomer, and other similar chewing gum nostalgics, it would simply be a trip down to the memory lane. The exact same flavors of the Bubblegum this was one cake, I personally wished to try even more. The Chief Curator of Cr√®me Cup deserves all praise for this lovely piece of art.

The Croissants and Quiches tasted excellent too. The combination of spinach and corn, spinach and cottage cheese, tandoori paneer which had paneer cooked with capsicum and tandoori masala, sundried tomato and olive among the exotic ones, each of them deserves a special mention. For the cupcakes, I really liked the Salted Caramel one. The sweetness of Caramel just got beaten by the slight salt quotient, creating a nice mix-match of flavors! The Rose Pistachio cupcake was again excellent, with the flavor of the rose getting perfectly complimented by the nuttiness of the pistachio. As such, the Rakhi Platter, comprises of these 4 cupcakes, namely, Salted Caramel Cupcake, Chocolate Oreo Cupcake, Bubble Gum Cupcake, Rose Pistachio Cupcake. Four absolutely wonderful creations, all for this wonderful occasion. Thus, look no further, head on their website and place the order right now, to make the pious celebration of Rakhi a joyous and memorable one with the perfect goodies from Cremecup!

If you are bored with the monotony of diary based sweetmeats & want to try something new, cremecup has got your back. Yes, the same company which is known for its cake delivery boxes (which has dry ice inside to prevent the cake from spoiling), has come up with the rakhi special platter, which can be the gift of your choice, this Rakshabandhan.
Taking the concept of cupcakes in a jar a notch higher, Cremecup has created this special platter designed as a gift set which includes the following:
1. Salted Caramel Cupcake in a jar.
2. Chocolate Oreo Cupcake in a jar.
3. Bubblegum Cupcake in a jar.
4. Rose Pistachio Cupcake in a jar.
Each of these items are available as standalone cakes from the company, which themselves taste amazing. The Bubblegum & Rose Pistachio flavour are pretty innovative, while the other two may seem regular flavours, don‚Äôt lose out on taste.

details in the blog.

I ordered double chocolate chip cookies and I must say, I  had high expectations from this place.... these expectations were not fulfilled. Maybe the cakes are very good (though I haven't ordered one yet), but the cookies were nothing special.  They weren't bad, per se, but, like I  said before, didn't reach my expectations. I felt that they were too crispy, slightly burnt at the edges, not chewy at all... also, there were very less no. of chocolate chips. Maybe next time I'll try a cake.

Order : Butterscotch Caramel Cake - In one word - yummy - superbly done - the cream is worth mention - Caramel in abundance and perfect mix - butterscotch superbly evident - We loved it ! 4.5/5

I recently ordered a few muffins. Raspberry muffins to be precise.

Must say this is one of the finest muffins I have had.
Soft,warm and fresh baked -the perfect taste that lingers!
But am not sure if it was raspberry muffins or plain vanilla muffins with raspberry frosting?
Again I found the frosting to be inadequate(given the size of the muffin) and hence made a separate buttercream frosting altogether. (Thats only when they looked fair enough to satiate my craving for these gorgeous beauties.:P)

And yes they possibly use eggs and could be a turn off for a few.
Otherwise this is so worth a recommendation.

Cheers folks !:)

The exact same flavors of the Bubblegum this was one cake, I personally wished to try even more. The Chief Curator of Cr√®me Cup deserves all praise for this lovely piece of art.

The Croissants and Quiches tasted excellent too. The combination of spinach and corn, spinach and cottage cheese, tandoori paneer which had paneer cooked with capsicum and tandoori masala, sundried tomato and olive among the exotic ones, each of them deserves a special mention. For the cupcakes, I really liked the Salted Caramel one. The sweetness of Caramel just got beaten by the slight salt quotient, creating a nice mix-match of flavors! The Rose Pistachio cupcake was again excellent, with the flavor of the rose getting perfectly complimented by the nuttiness of the pistachio. As such, the Rakhi Platter, comprises of these 4 cupcakes, namely, Salted Caramel Cupcake, Chocolate Oreo Cupcake, Bubble Gum Cupcake, Rose Pistachio Cupcake. Four absolutely wonderful creations, all for this wonderful occasion. Thus, look no further, head on their website and place the order right now, to make the pious celebration of Rakhi a joyous and memorable one with the perfect goodies from Cremecup!

If you are bored with the monotony of diary based sweetmeats & want to try something new, cremecup has got your back. Yes, the same company which is known for its cake delivery boxes (which has dry ice inside to prevent the cake from spoiling), has come up with the rakhi special platter, which can be the gift of your choice, this Rakshabandhan.
Taking the concept of cupcakes in a jar a notch higher, Cremecup has created this special platter designed as a gift set which includes the following:
1. Salted Caramel Cupcake in a jar.
2. Chocolate Oreo Cupcake in a jar.
3. Bubblegum Cupcake in a jar.
4. Rose Pistachio Cupcake in a jar.
Each of these items are available as standalone cakes from the company, which themselves taste amazing. The Bubblegum & Rose Pistachio flavour are pretty innovative, while the other two may seem regular flavours, don‚Äôt lose out on taste.

I ordered double chocolate chip cookies and I must say, I  had high expectations from this place.... these expectations were not fulfilled. Maybe the cakes are very good (though I haven't ordered one yet), but the cookies were nothing special.  They weren't bad, per se, but, like I  said before, didn't reach my expectations. I felt that they were too crispy, slightly burnt at the edges, not chewy at all... also, there were very less no. of chocolate chips. Maybe next time I'll try a cake.

Intro : Ordered through Zomato - hence won't be able to update on the joint . Really good that we can now order cakes to be home delivered - comes handy when you are running a tight schedule ! 

Order : Butterscotch Caramel Cake - In one word - yummy - superbly done - the cream is worth mention - Caramel in abundance and perfect mix - butterscotch superbly evident - We loved it ! 4.5/5

I recently ordered a few muffins. Raspberry muffins to be precise.

Must say this is one of the finest muffins I have had.
Soft,warm and fresh baked -the perfect taste that lingers!
But am not sure if it was raspberry muffins or plain vanilla muffins with raspberry frosting?
Again I found the frosting to be inadequate(given the size of the muffin) and hence made a separate buttercream frosting altogether. (Thats only when they looked fair enough to satiate my craving for these gorgeous beauties.:P)

And yes they possibly use eggs and could be a turn off for a few.
Otherwise this is so worth a recommendation.

Cheers folks !:)

This place is the first online bakery in the city and I must say they are just awesome, in one word! I wished to try their delicacies for long and it was today, I got a chance to try few if their best treats. 
Dairy Milk Cake, Chocolate Mousse Cake and Watermelon Cake were on the list. I can't say which one was the best because each one of them tasted better than the other. 
The dairy milk cake was so gooey, chocolatey and yummy. The frosting which gradually melted looked so tempting and the cake was soft, one of the best I had till date.
The mousse cake on the other hand was super delicious. The balance was struck perfectly of sweetness and bitter taste. I loved the caramel praline on top. 
The watermelon cake too, my first experience with this, was fresh, refreshing and very good. It had the perfect balance of the fruit flavour. Use of colour in the cake too was in the right amount.
The quality of the cake is extraordinary beyond doubt. They are freshly baked, soft, delicious and balanced with perfection of baking. The tempered chocolate in both the chocolate cakes were topnotch. I don't know if they used fondant or marzipan in the watermelon cake, but it tasted great, I must say. 
Packaging is elegant and classy. They had put all the stuffs in an ice packaging and everything was alright till it came all the way from Park Street to Netaji Nagar. I loved it. Absolutely.
The whole experience was wonderful. Will order from them soon. Cheers to Team Cremecup. Happy Dining! :)

Went through many positive reviews from experts in Zomato and chose to order a cake for my wife's birthday. I ordered a mango chilli cheesecake and looked forward to the experience. Once we opened the box the disappointment was huge and it was only the beginning. To start with it looked a complete mess. The topping of fresh mango was scattered all over and the inscription was all messed up. The cake itself was tilted. Worse still, the box had lots of dirt inside in the sides. I consoled myself saying that the taste would make up for the deficiency in the look. Once I took my first bite, the disappointment was even bigger. The mango jelly tasted synthetic. The cheesecake lacked taste. The chilli, which was flakes (the kind that comes with pizza) was actually irritating. Before you think otherwise, we enjoy hot spicy food. I looked around and found that everybody (five more people with differing palates) was trying to finish it without being rude. There was no second helping! It ruined an excellent dinner.

I feel that the service (part of a campaign) provided free of cost to targeted reviewers in Zomato was of different class from the paying customers.

Experience: Massive disappointment.
Reason: Saturday morning.. zomato---cremecup.in---online order 15% discount(wow).. delivery time couple of hours to your chosen address(elated) minimum order nil.. (overwhelmed. ) With no delay I placed my order for a few cupcakes.
Up came the response after 15mins.. "the restaurant cancelled your order because there is no one to deliver the same"
Oh my.....
I mean what's the point.? Captions and discounts and offers just to woo customers and then disappoint them?if not anything else.. they could have provided with some kind of alternative.. maybe a delayed delivery or something!
Li'l piece of advice: Make sure you have a second option in hand and not just count on them... for we Never know.. they might just run  out of delivery staff once again!

Amazing cake! Ordered one for my wife's birthday. It was baked properly. Cream was blender nicely. Not too sweet. This is going to be our one stop destination for cakes from now on. 
Great if you can supply an use & throw knife with the pack. It's handy.

Wanted to write a review immediately I tried the first cake. But then waited until I got a taste of a different variant from their menu.

I have so far tried two cakes. 1. Tiramisu and 2. Dairy Milk. All in all, the experience on both the occasions has been pretty amazing.

Coming to the Tiramisu cake, you have to admire the strong coffee flavour. For everyone who loves Tiramisu will definitely admire this creation from Cremecup. But then if you don't like coffee much, this cake isn't made for you.

The Dairy Milk cake steals the spotlight for me. Rich in cream and the sponiginess is just perfect. Plus when you take the first bite, you get an instant taste of dairy milk which makes the cake all the more tempting. Anyone who loves chocolate or cakes for that matter, will definitely love this lipsmacking cake from cremecup.

The experience on both the occasions has been amazing. If you're in the mood for trying some different and tasty cakes, cremecup is totally made for you.

4 of us polished off a 1 pound cake in 30 minutes - that's how good the cake was! We ordered it from Zomato, and they delivered bang on time - the packaging was excellent, and prevented the cake from getting spoilt in the heat. We ordered the Chocolate Mango cake and it was delicious! Not too sweet - just right. Want to try a few other things off their menu soon!

#MyCheesecakeStory

When you live in the suburbs of Kolkata, and are on a budget, you get very limited options for an online cake delivery and that too, with huge delivery charges. So luckily, one day, I stumbled upon this site, which won my heart just with their home page and their unique selection of cakes and other baked goods. I ordered a strawberry cheesecake for my parents' anniversary, mostly hoping to have the larger share for myself though(Yes, I am a shameless glutton). However, on the delivery day itself, there is a huge delay in delivery due to torrential rains in Kolkata and I was growing more paranoid with every passing minute. I called up their customer service and they patiently explained every single time I called(which were a lot, btw!); they kept me updated on their current location and kept assuring me that the cake would reach and also they apologized for their delay in service. Finally the cake did arrive and I kept it on a stone slab away from the window. After a few hours when we went to cut the cake, it had melted to a puddle. Needless to say, tears were shed. And after a lot of hyperventilating, we called the customer service once again. I had no idea on whether to refrigerate the cake, because it hadn't been mentioned anywhere on the box or the site.

The person who answered the phone was called Raj. And you won't believe how understanding he was of our situation. He apologised a million times probably. Told us it was indeed their fault and though I didn't ask for it, offered to send me a replacement the very next day. He even assured us that they will take this feedback seriously and update their site or add the instructions. I was blown away by his attitude. Never have I spoken to any other restaurant customer service who is this polite. Instead of blaming it on us, he did the needful. Such a gesture was the best surprise. And totally made our day.

The replacement did arrive promptly the very next day. And oh! It was amazing. Packed in a sturdy box, it was beautiful and tasted divine. And I did get the larger share for myself. :p
I wish cremecup.in flourishes, opens more outlets all over Kolkata and earns huge fame. I sincerely wish the best for you guys. And I recommend this place to every guy with a sweet tooth.

Picture this- Its someone's birthday but your forgetful self acts in ( or the lack of action) and there is no planning from your end. You frantically search zomato for a place to go buy a cake but you know that the standard places will stock well standard cakes! 
That's where cremecup.in perfectly fits in. In a city buzzing with new bakeries, patisseries and dessert places, this place stands out as a first ever online bakery with home delivery service.
On offer are mouthwatering cheesecakes, assortment of special cakes, dry cakes, donuts, crossaints, quiches and tarts! (Heaven)

My first order from here was a blueberry cheesecake and six tarts ( nutella and lemon) and trust me I was very content with my order!
Loved the consistent cheesecake( though they don't use Philadelphia cheese) and the tarts were buttery soft and the lemon curd and nutella filling respectively did wonders!
Prices are decent and they offer 20 percent off on first delivery. 
A special shout out to Raj( I believe this venture is his brainchild), who patiently handled my queries on the phone for booking. Thank you for the great service.
Another mention is that they offer same day delivery and you get to choose the time slot! 
The delivery was on time and the packaging? Blue corrugated boxes, neatly packed! 
My order looked exactly like in the pics on the website, so another point for that! 

Cremecup.in is my current favorite for bakeries and I wish the team nothing but the best! 
Cheers!

After a spurge of newly established bakeries in every nook and corner of the city, a new era has dawned in the form of online bakeries. A special thanks to Samridhi for introducing us to this amazing online portal, Cremecup.in, as got to take home a box of surprize after a lovely Zomato meetup.

The cake was packed inside a sturdy blue box, but the ultimate flabbergast lay within. As I opened the package, and voila!!
A wave of dense smoke started to flow out of the box. After it precipitated, I realised the case had been holding liquid nitrogen, rigged to flow out as soon as it was opened. I was completely awestruck at the sight of it. Compliments for designing the box as well, so that it could hold the liquid nitrogen without getting damaged.
Yet another major delight awaited me. The ever natural and seasonal special, Mixed Fruit Cake. As eye catching it was, the quality of it was nothing short of exquisiteness. It was beautifully decorated with mango, kiwi, pineapples and cherry. As I cut through it, the knife slid in like it goes through butter, displaying its smoothness. The quality of the fruits was remarkable and the frosting had been done pitch perfectly.

I have had fruit cakes before, but nothing compared to this level. 800 bucks for this piece is pure value for money. Don‚Äôt fear about spoilage, as the box in durable enough to protect your cake. So go ahead and order ASAP.

PS : They bake completely eggless.

I would like to take the pleasure to thank Zomato for introducing us with this wonderful home bakery. This online home bakery of Kolkata, serves amazingly awesome mouth watering delights, and at the same time provides a new dimension to the concept of dessert. 
So far the packaging and presentation is concerned, it is simply great from both the aspects of aesthetic, and utility. The packaging is designed so carefully that it looks aesthetically pleasing, and takes the ultimate care so as to ascertain that the inner contents of the pack don't get damaged during transit. 
Coming to taste, from the very first bite, it melts in your mouth, and then it melts your heart, and leave you in heavenly wonder.
The perfect balance of sweetness is perhaps the biggest USP of this place, that many bakeries lack nowadays.
A must try for all the foodies and dessert aficionados out there.

This is the first online bakery I've come across. I haven't really been able to find good places in Kolkata which serve good donuts , but the ones I had from creme cup were really good. I normally like the cinnamon and sugar dusted donuts but that option wasn't available , so I ordered for a normal sugar frosted donut. Their serving size is 6 items and they serve it in a beautiful blue and red box which is sturdy and packed well. They usually deliver in 3-4 hours. So I ordered the donuts which were smaller than the normal size and I also felt that six donuts for 450 rupees that too , the size in which they came was a bit overpriced. I even ordered three spinach and cottage cheese croissants and three hazelnut and chocolate croissants. The hazelnut one had a good texture but it was lacking something I felt. The spinach a fun cottage cheese one was really good. But again , 450 for six croissants is a bit over priced. The delivery charge is free. It's a good initiative taken by them to start this online and have a lot of tempting things to offer.

FINALLY, FINALLY, I have found a bakery that delivers to my locality! Why only mine? It delivers all over Kolkata! Yes, Cremecup.in is the first online bakery in (India, they claim-not so sure about that) Kolkata that delivers all over Kolkata for free.

First of all, let's go through the procedure for ordering. You just go to their website www.cremecup.in and you're greeted with beautiful pictures of cakes and donuts and all the beauties they have to offer. The various things they have to offer include:
1. Donuts
2. Cakes
3. Cheese Cakes
4. Brownies
5. Quiches
6. Tarts
7. Croissants
8. Dry Cakes
9. Cookies

The cakes and quiches come in weights of 1 lb or 2 lb. For the rest, the minimum number of pieces you need to order is 6.
And another piece of information that you MUST know before ordering is that the minimum time taken is 5-6 hours after the order is placed.

For ordering, you need to login and select among the various categories of products available, which will direct you to the required page. Another thing that impressed me was the fact that they offer actual pictures of the products so that you have the flexibility of knowing beforehand what you're spending your money on, and not get a shock later. You select those pictures, and when your box is full, you either checkout or shop more! The prices of the products displayed are inclusive of taxes. Now, I found the prices to be a little on the higher side, probably because they include the taxes and also some money is reserved for the free delivery.

After you're through with the ordering and waiting, the delivery finally comes in a hard, corrugated blue box that ensures that your products don't get damaged or turned upside-down on the way.

Now, I had ordered one piece each of the 6 different varieties of tart that they have to offer, around 11.30 a.m. and my order reached me around 7.30 p.m. Another thing they need to include soon is the auto-tracking option. For now, you need to call up the helpline so that they can fetch that information for you. And the receptionist is extremely polite to do so.

Coming to the real part, the tarts. (Keeping the tarts in the refrigerator before consuming it would help get that crunchy feel in my opinion.)

1. Nutella Tart: What can possibly go wrong with Nutella? And it doesn't. However, instead of leaving Nutella to save the tart, they can do with some innovations.

2. Fresh Fruit Tart: This one tastes of fresh cream and fruits like melon, red grapes or cranberries or plum, pineapple and few others I couldn't recognise. Quite the usual, I would say.

3. Lemon Tart: This one tastes of pure and thick lime with a cherry on top! The perfect balance of the sour and sweet taste makes it one of the best they have to offer.

4. Mocha Tart: This oozes out the coffee essence and flavour.

5. Baked Jam Tart: This did disappoint me, though. It's nothing but just baked jam packed into the crust.

6. Walnut Caramel Tart: This was an absolute winner! The apricot (and almond?) paste filled with the goodness of caramel was a sheer delight from the very first bite.

Overall, I would say, it's an excellent attempt to introduce a completely eggless bakery in Kolkata. And I would love to try some of their other offerings as well.

Cremecup.in is a NEWLY OPENED online bakery which delivers all over Kolkata and that too for free! The products that they have got are amazing and there is no compromise in terms of quality. I was recently contacted by them for a food tasting session at this place and I opted for a doorstep delivery at my workplace. I found the delivery was seamless and the package that was handed over had some well-designed robust packaging.

The place serves a wide range of products namely ‚Äì cupcakes, brownies, croissants, doughnuts, birthday cakes, tarts, quiches, cheesecakes, cookies, muffins, etc. The point which should be noted here is ‚Äì all their cakes are 100% eggless and the rest of the products are all vegetarian. But being at ardent non-vegetarian I can vouch for the vegetarian products that they serve, which are extremely flavorful and very well-prepared. I have learnt that they have their own kitchen so they can monitor the activities and assure better quality control and checks.

Let‚Äôs discuss briefly about their Website since anyway it is their medium to interact with their customers or the users. The website cremecup.in is very nicely prepared with an unruffled User Interface (UI) that exudes elegance which is quite important to build an image when the customer logs in for the first time. I found it to be pretty user friendly. The homepage directs you to the shopping page, you need to login and then in the shopping page you have varieties of products available (mentioned above in this post) lined up on the left and which are hyperlinked. Once you click them, the corresponding page opens up with the sub-categories of that product which you can directly add to your shopping cart. Then you can continue shopping or checkout to directly purchase that product right away (though various payment options that includes COD). Overall I loved my experience with the website and playing with it, I specially loved the fact that all the product images are available that helps in deciding your order quickly (although you can‚Äôt zoom in those pictures or you don‚Äôt have their descriptions written there). All the product photographs are crisp, clear and vibrant and the banner photograph is also very apt and enticing! The prices mentioned in the website are tax inclusive and no extra packaging or delivery charge is added on top of it. Only couple of observations ‚Äì there is no Live chat option which is sometimes helpful and I found the Subscribe (to product offers/newsletters,etc) button is not functioning with the ‚Äòon-click‚Äô operation, but I guess these glitches can be fixed anytime.

Now coming to their packaging ‚Äì your order will be efficiently delivered on bikes and the corrugated boxes will be hard and robust specially designed to combat the humid and hot city weather. The cakes will mostly be packed with dry ice insulations by their side and all the items whether it is cake or croissant will be delivered in those robust boxes. It is so well packed that it is ensured that the product inside is not making too much of a movement. 

In the complimentary box which I received for tasting purpose had six amazingly soft and fluffy Croissants with flavorful fillings! These were some best-in-class products and I have never tasted such premium quality croissant in any bakery in India. There were three varieties of croissants (also called ‚Äòcuerno‚Äô in Spanish, meaning ‚Äòhorn‚Äô) delivered with two pieces of each. I absolutely loved the Spinach and Cottage Cheese croissant, only I wish a bit more filling was there, anyway the filling provided was marginally optimum in quantity. It was basically the Indian palak paneer kinda flavor but the ultimate magic was spelled by the croissant cover that was not at all flaky or hard. It had a hint of moisture in there and redefined the word ‚Äòsoft‚Äô with respect to the croissants. Each layer of the yeast-leavened dough was consistent and was not breaking apart from the other. The Tandoori paneer croissant was also good and a bit spicy for kids but anyway very flavorful, it is hard not to devour such appetizing stuffs if placed in front of you! Frankly speaking I am really not a croissant fan but now I am absolutely in love with the Cremecup.in croissants!      

To conclude, I would like to mention that their products are always oven-fresh since they prepare it after you place the order. The delivery and packaging which has already been discussed is simply top-notch. The online ordering system provides you convenience and with the Cash-on-delivery option available it is more than blissful to order the best quality freshly baked cakes, croissants, muffins or quiches to be delivered at your doorsteps. I guess we were really waiting for this to happen in Kolkata. Thanks Cremecup.in for making Kolkata a lot more ‚Äòdelicious place‚Äô to live in!

Cheers!
                                          ...

I came to know about cremecup.in when they send me a complimentary cake for tasting. I went through their site and loved the idea. There are already bakeries in Kolkata who operate on delivery only model, but the ease of placing the order online, as far as I know, was not available before. And I personally love online ordering. Also everything is made after the order is placed. So, although there is a 5-6 hours waiting time, everything we get are freshly prepared.

Add to that, they deliver throughout Kolkata for free. Where most eateries deliver within a short radius, covering the whole city, according to me, is a huge plus.

Packaging is also an important part when you are delivering. Specially dealing with cakes in a hot and humid city like ours. I loved the way they have solved this issue. The box (which is a real sturdy one) comes with dry ice compartments to keep the cake cool and fresh. In fact when I took the box from the delivery boy, I was surprised to find the base of the box chilled and full of water droplets. Loved this implementation too.

They are a 100% veg bakery and all the items are eggless. So, I am sure, it will be huge hit with the vegetarians. Also great news for people who are not complete vegetarians, but eat veg on certain days. So, the next time there are any anniversaries on these days, you know from where to order your cake.

The cake I tasted was a Chocolate truffle one, decorated with chocolate leaves and roses on top. Looked great. It was not too sweet, which I personally like. The cake and the cream both tasted good.¬† The outer chocolate coating was also delicious. We loved the cake.

They have a great menu and I am planning to order their quiches real soon.

You cannot really ask for more when you have sweetness delivered at your doorstep. That is precisely what this online, exclusively vegetarian, Bakery is about. We got a good old Chocolate Truffle Cake from them and was darn impressed with their delivery and packaging. Despite the soaring temperature outside, the cake sat nice and pretty in the package flanked by dry ice insulations! Well that was cool! A truffle cake cannot really go wrong and so was this one‚Ä¶sinful and delicious!

Recently Creme Cup got in touch and offered to send me their bakery items to try out. To be honest, I had not heard of Creme Cup before so when they said that they are a Kolkata based online bakery, I was definitely intrigued and super happy. The one thing I've always wanted in Kolkata is a bakery where you can place your orders online but there were no options available. Creme Cup aims to fill in that void. They deliver cakes, brownies, cookies, tarts, quiches etc anywhere in the city. All one needs to do is go to www.cremecup.in, place the order and either pay online or opt for COD. Creme Cup is a vegetarian bakery and all its products are eggless. The products are made fresh after receiving the order so they need 5-6 hours time before delivering.

I was sent a chocolate truffle cake by Creme Cup and it was delivered to my house by Pickji. The first thing that impressed me was the packaging. The cake came in a large sturdy cardboard blue box with slots inside for dry ice. This ensured that even in this sweltering heat, the cake came to me fresh and in one piece without melting. Coming to the cake itself, it was a delicious fresh rich chocolate cake with layers of chocolate inside. It was decorated well with chocolate shards on top. The cake was not too sweet and had the perfect balance of cream and chocolate. If I did not know, would have never guessed that it was an eggless cake!

Overall, I was quite impressed by Creme Cup- their packaging, quality and taste. I plan to try more stuff from them.

Valentine Cake @ Cremecup.in, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Unfailingly, Cremecup.in innovates a whole new range of relevant cakes and other bakes (all eggless) to commemorate each and every popular social and religious festival.

Valentine 2017 is no different.

They made my Valentine Day special by sending me their Valentine Special snowy white Vanilla Sky Cake (eggless).

This cake is circular and has 3 layers of moist and sweetened bread. Each bread layer is followed by a layer of chopped cashews and praline, and finally rich cream. The topmost cream layer is quite thick. The sides of the cake are also covered with this cream. Heart and love based fondant design in red and pink adorn the cake top. A fondant based red ribbon ring is pasted at the bottom of the cake.

The cake was fresh and tasty and the chopped cashews and praline provided a nice sweet crunch.

Cake Details -

Weight: 750 gm, Diameter: 6", Price: Rs. 900/-

You can always order for a bigger cake. If your order size equals to or exceeds 3 pounds, then you can also get it customized by getting your photo imprinted on it!

Happy Valentine's Day to ALL ... ‚ò∫

Received an East-Meets-West style Innovative Cake for Tasting ‚ò∫

All city based dessert shops and chefs are gearing up for the upcoming Rakhi Festival. Fusion and innovation is the mantra of the day.

Cremecup.in (Kolkata), the online cakes and desserts company, that provides home delivery of it's freshly prepared eggles wares, is all laced up with it's own set of innovations to adorn the Rakhi platter.

This weekend I was informed that I will soon be receiving their Rose Pistachio Cake for tasting. Hearing this, immediately my creative foodie mind, conjured up an image of a two layered 'pista gulkand barfi', which had the shiny pista layer at the bottom and aromatic gulkand layer on the top. Determined to use this styling in the near future, I kept on wondering how would Cremecup.in use such royal Indian flavors in a sponge textured western dessert!

Finally, the mysterious cake arrived. And what an amalgamation it was, of a western dessert with eastern flavors! An apt fusion for Rakhi.

It was a beautiful round cake which displayed only two colors - pink and green. Pista flavored and green colored cake sponge or body was neatly alternated with rose flavored and pink colored cream. Three such layering combinations were there. And they were absolutely equal in size. No lumps or uneven layering at all. The entire outer coating was made of the aforesaid pink cream. The sides were garnished with abundant pistachio slivers. The top was adorned with a big buttercream flower, which constituted of a big pink (a darker shade) rose, surrounded with evenly placed five green petals.

The cake was fresh and moist. It tasted excellent. Pistachios used, were of good quality. The dominant rose flavor, incorporated a certain exuberance to every bite!

Thanks Cremecup.in for such a nice and soulful tasting.

Assorted Eggless Donuts @ Cremecup.in, Kolkata ‚ò∫

A donut or a doughnut is a deep fried confectionary food made of flour dough. It is usually ring shaped, and comes with sweetened fillings and/or toppings.

Being an avid reader and watcher of English (American) fiction books and movies, many a times I would come across scenerios, wherein, one of the characters would ask all the others present, about their preferred choice of donut topping, before leaving to get a box full of assorted donuts. And he would always be welcomed with chuckles and cheers!

Seeing this, every time I would wonder, when would my City of Joy provide us such an opportunity, and that too in eggless option? When will we be able to order beyond frosted and chocolate toppings?

Thanks to Cremecup.in, I was able to order a fine selection of the following eggless donuts - (Clockwise in the pic) Oreo, Coffee Caramel, Mint, White Chocolate and Nutella Infused (the top one).

Cremecup.in being an online ordering company, I ordered the aforesaid donuts on the phone, as alongside online ordering via their website, they also take orders by phone. And voila! a fresh batch of super fresh donuts, made from freshly kneaded dough was on my doorstep within 2.5 hours! And yes, they were received with chuckles and cheers by all!

The despatched doughnuts were relatively smaller than the ones that we come across in general. They were soft and super fresh, but not firm in shape. Toppings were fantastic, but the dough body could have been cooked a tad bit more.

Oreo, Mint and White Chocolate were the donuts with outer toppings, and were ring shaped. While, Coffee Caramel and Nutella Infused were the donuts with inner gooey fillings, and were circular in shape.

Coffee Caramel was the hero of this entire selection. It was a melt in the mouth preparation, with a wonderful after taste.

Note: I purchased these Donuts. They were not sent for tasting.

100% Eggless Dessert & Savoury Tasting Invitation @ Cremecup.in, Kolkata :)

Http://cremecup.in is the first 100% vegetarian and eggless online bakery in Kolkata, that home delivers, desserts and savouries, within 3-4 hours of receiving the client's order.

Dessert and Savouries presented in the tasting session were -

But with gaining popularity, a couple of it's veg options can be seen in, most of the local bakeries.

Both the Quiches were soft, well buttered and nice. Mushroom Cheese Quiche, we had seen before, but, Tandoori Paneer was a nice try at fusion.

Chocolate Truffle Cake: It consisted of, layers of dark chocolate cake, alternated with whipped ganache, surrounded with sugar lace, and topped with a dark chocolate rose surrounded with three white chocolate petals.

It was soft, spongy and tasted very nice. Perhaps, it was one of the best eggless chocolate cake, that we have had in Kolkata till date!
