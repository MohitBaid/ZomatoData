Ordered a cake from here through swiggy for a friend's birthday. She received it in time. I didn't taste it but she said it was very good in taste. Pretty affordable prices too. Would like to try some of their items personally sometime.

This is an outlet outside AE market. It is quite new and the food is good!
I tried the Oreo cheesecake, for Rs 25/- only it was one amazing treat!
