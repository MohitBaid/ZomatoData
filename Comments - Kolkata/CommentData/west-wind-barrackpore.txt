I have visited this place multiple times. It is good place to have food in. The noodles are prepared very nicely. I think they are better at preparing Chinese items than the traditional Indian ones. The ambience is really nice. One can always eat here.

The menu shown here is not provided..I went there today(so many days after durga puja) and  they are still giving this puja menu with limited items and hiked prices.This was very disappointing.
Ok now coming to the food
9 people went.
5 mutton biriyanis and one non-veg hakka noodles and a schezwan chicken was order cuz we hardly had other options
drums of heaven was the starter we ordered-it was good but the amount of sauce served with 6 pieces was only enough for a single piece
The biriyani was not quiet good..quantity was ok..mutton was too undercooked to be eaten
The noodles and chicken was good.The quantity was ok
This is the first place i saw serving chinese but not babycorn
They dont even serve fresh lime soda..
I havent seen this ever before.
The waiters have this very strange attitude.They hardly pay attention to what people are saying.
The current went of twice and we had to wait 5 mins in complete darkness each time.This was miserable
There were mosquitoes.The ac dint work properly.People were sweating.
The waiters waited just by the side and its very akward to pay in front of them...
This wasnt the first time i went there.
But this time the whole experince was miserable.I wont go there ever again.

Some of the dishes might surprise you. Service and ambience not the best. This restaurant is way better than it looks. Recommended: chicken zacuti, which is a Goan delicacy.

West wind located very close to the Barrackpore railway station has always been the place my family has been since it opened.
Unlike every other one of my visits this one has been very dissapointing.

Ambience: Pathetic, I felt like I was sitting in some low budget bengali wedding instead of a posh restaurant.
Unlike the ambience in the ground floor the top floor was a complete disaster.

Service: Okayish but has a lot more scope of improvement.

Food: We ordered-

1) Mutton kosha = I personally didn't like it very much, the pieces of the mutton were very bad, some of them had no meat at all.

2) Biryani = Again, it was okayish nothing so great.

3) Chicken kebab = Now, I have seen this is in many restaurants in kolkata where they literally don't understand what kebab is. When you ask for Kebab they serve you tikka, like that's what they call a kebab. But it's wrong.
I would request the chef to look into this matter. Please DO NOT serve tikka in the name of kebab!
I wonder what they would have served me if I had asked for a tikka instead. -_-

4) Roasted chicken = Lacked flavours, texture was fine.

5) Fried rice = Meh

Ps: The breads were initially denied but later bought when asked them to, which was the only thing that tasted good in this restaurant.

Worst possible experience. Chicken was smelly. Biriyani was tasteless. Side dish felt like some home cooked gravy. Will not recommend EVER!
This is simply robbery! They are taking advantage of a huge puja crowd. Utter shame.

Located near barrackpore rail way station.. nice ambience with slow music.. beautiful wooden decor and good seating arrangement.. and the food is very delicious.. drums of heaven were so good in taste.. schezwan rice was just awesome and very spicy.. other chinese side dishes were also good..due to delay of preparing food,they served us 'papad' as appetiser.. good pricing and service is nice.. staffs are also polite and friendly..

Service and ambiance is amazing here. The staff is amazingly friendly and cooperative. They allow cakessnd softdrinks from bakeries outside into their restaurants if their is a birthday celebration. The food is lip smacking in every context and presentation takes the crown. Around barrackpore, this one is among the top 5 restaurants.

Remember having biriyani here, when I was in my final school years! It was horrible. They should probably focus more on how well their food is prepared.. Because at the end of the day, good food in your tummy from an average place is better than not being satisfied with the food from a posh looking restaurant. :)

I feel that dal makhni needs bit improvement I had tasted it before also in my last visit . It has gonna down. But chicken tikka masala was good  with naan . Fresh lime was al so good . Overall the visit was good .Felt great to be back at this place .After four years.

Let me be honest, bottom line to every restaurant is how good they prepare the dishes they claim to offer. Hands down, that is the only thing that matters at the end. This is one place who have their hands full trying at a number of cuisines and clearly not having the expertise in some of them. They have a long list of menu with some difficult dishes included. I ordered one of my favourite ones, Laal Mans, an excuisite preparation if made correctly. To my disappointment, it was far from everything it should have been. It was sweet,like a malai kofta of sorts.On telling them that this is sweet, the staff told us that that was the spiciest thing they had and I probably eat too much spices and they thought that they could not eat it being so spicy. I had never heard such a ridiculous excuse ever where one claims something sweet to be hot. Pathetic. Now coming to the worst part of the story. This was only after tasting the gravy. I had not tasted the meat yet. Biting into it, I was shocked. It was a frozen piece of meat which they had just brought out of the freezer, fried a bit and put into the gravy. It was tough as a shoe and the fat over the meat had sunk in deep, clearly indicating that it was at least 4-5 days old. Pathetic experience. I always say however good a place is decorated, however quick the service, however presentable food might look, the line is drawn at the taste and quality of it. Unfortunate they dont know this. I only rated it 2 because of all the other aspects except the food

First of all, they should change their Menu Card ,which I think they are destroying their goodwill, if any, it is a Menu card with damp and soiled paper card and no main items are there!!! So we can easily imagine , what should be the quality of their cooked  food !!!
Please rectify yourselves.

Parhetic. Right from serving time to food quality to price- taste ratio, the term is pathetic! I assure never ever order kebabs there, you will be greeted by stale chicken with soft drinks that's never a soft drink at all.
Due to this, West Wind has lost business over the years so it's beneficial if you want a crowd less place!!

Coming to food the panner tikkia masala wss too sour , chicken salika was good however , tandoori chck was just of moderate quality .

We ordered tandoori roti, masaala kulcha , Mutton mussallam and kadrai chckn.
Mutton mussalam was the worst I have ever tasted .fells like normal roadside hotels mutton. Overall experience was not so good not so bad . I time visited and that over from my end.

Mediocre food, horrible maintenance of decor and poor hospitality. Entire restaurant was empty except us. One of my colleagues found a hair in the food, another found a cockroach running on the floor. Tandoori chicken wasn't that juicy, and the rice tasted so mild. Shanghai chicken was okay. What I liked the most was the hot and sour chicken soup.
Overpriced food and the bill includes vat.

I ordered a dessert which costs over 100 rupees and was served with nothing but a gulab jamun and 10 rupees worth cup ice cream. Not going back there again. Oh and FYI, the staff here doesn't have any knowledge to how to handle a debit card.

If you've lived anywhere around Barrackpore you've gotta hear of Westwind. Situated right outside the railway station this place has been one of the favourite dining out place for years now. And I had a good chance to go and see for myself why.

I was hanging out with an old friend who's a die hard meat lover so we ordered Chicken drumsticks with pepper sauce for starters, which the waiter recommended. It took some time arrive on the table, about half an hour, but the wait was worth it. They were crispy on the outside with sweet and hot sauce and deliciously tender and juicy on the inside.

We ordered mutton biriyani, roghan josh mutton, naan and green salad for the main course. Again we had to wait a good twenty minutes before the food arrived. The biriyani was mildly aromatic. The roghanjosh was loud with spices and went well with the naan.

Other than the food the place has a an interesting deco with wooden tables and benches and warm yellow lights. The staff is courteous and the food is reasonably priced. All in all a good place to visit with friends and family.

Barrackpore's one of the popular multicuisine restaurants, since this place really lacks good quality food joints. 

Location: Near Barrackpore rly stn, just beside Debasree cinema hall.

Ambiance: Nice and cozy, Wooden decor and low lights give a soothing environment to enjoy your food peacefully (if, at all, the food satisfy your taste buds). 3.5/5

Service: Well, the staffs are well behaved, but they lack basic knowledge of the cuisines. They have no idea about the availability of a dish, always have to go to kitchen to check it and most of the times, the answer is NO. You will only get very common dishes, no variety. 1/5

Food: It was good earlier, but now the quality has degraded awfully. I have tasted chinese, north indian and tandoor here. The food quality is BELOW than average. They use same gravy for any dishes of that genre (For eg. if u order paneer and chicken of chinese flavor, they often use the same gravy). The naan gets bit harder after few minutes. Also, if you want to order ice cream, they always come up with excuses of not having this or that. Same goes for beverages also. 2/5

Overall, very disappointing. Not worth the price, at all.

This is the first time I have chosen this restaurant for hanging out with friends. Okay the place is pretty good for couple to spend time. But lets talk about the food, they have a huge menu card. You may need 15-20 min to decide what do you want to order if that is your first time. Then they will take more 30min to prepare your order. Food are little expensive and taste is average. Nothing special. We tried kulcha with chicken tandoori masala which is their special dish, it tastes average. Then we tried mixed fried rice with chicken schezwan. It was very hard to find some chicken in mixed fried rice and the chicken schezwan tastes good, but chicken was very stiffy. 
Finally I recommend this restaurant if you want a solitary place to spend with your girlfriend.

West Wind is Barrackpore's attempt at bringing fine dining experience to the area and however modest it might be, the place does have its charms. Located just beside the Barrackpore railway station, its not very hard to reach and once there, the place is worth a shot.It's designed on a theme of wooden lounges and the sitting arrangement is quite cozy. They do have separate corner tables for couples, so, if you are there with your loved ones, you might end up having a decent conversation,over your meal.The food is average, nothing exceedingly good to write home about although you would want to try out couple of their signature kababs. The service is pretty decent as well.All said, this place is quite well enough and also goes easy on the pocket, so, if you are looking to impress your loved one over a meal or take that person on a date while being easy on your wallet, West WInd would be a good place to land up.

A good place to be near Barrackpore station. We used to visit here with our group and some of our girlfriends(sic). The ambiance which they provide I believe best in the area. Food quality is also good which we never mind during our days in the city as it used to be costlier than the other restaurants which we used to visit. But overall I recommend this restaurant for family goers.

Situated at the Barrackpore station area. Been there a multiple number of times due to easy conveyance .  Ambience is good. Food quality is very good. I have tried most of the dishes during my visit here and all the good. Good place to spend time with family and friends. Price little on the higher side compare to the other restaurants in the vicinity.

The food is the best in Barrackpore.The atmosphere is also very good. The mocktail is the best specially the West Wind special is awasome.

Not so bad at all for medium price! Good place to sit and talk and enjoy the weather and the food! Relaxing environment!! And food quality is not bad at all.
