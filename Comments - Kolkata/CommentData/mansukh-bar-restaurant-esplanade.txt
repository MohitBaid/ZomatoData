It is a mainly Bar oriented restaurant, I have visited this restaurant many years ago and find it's food quality was better and service is average. I have enjoyed their delicious Paneer Labbadar which is makhmali feel, I feel this restaurant is mainly for alcohol lover as it's ambiance is quite suffocating and congested and toilet is too small unpleasant.

BEWARE OF MANSUKH RESTAURANT & BAR.... We have ordered 2 no. 60 ML Blenders sprit along with 1 Frosted, again  ordered 30 ML Blenders Sprite but when bill received we found that there were a discrepency in the bill. We haven't ordered any TEACHER  BRAND but they made a bill and charged Rs. 600/- for that which they have  charged in the bill. So whenever you all planning to visit for Mansukh Restaurant 'BEAWARE
