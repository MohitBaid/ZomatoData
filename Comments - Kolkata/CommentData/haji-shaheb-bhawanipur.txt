Had their chicken roll , mutton roll and tikya roll. They make the best chicken rolls which sufficient chicken stuffing and a green chutney that adds ample flavour to this simple road side food . A must try. Though had a load of times , my heart wants their chicken roll once more😋

Been to this joint more like fifty times and it has never failed to get my taste buds dancing! The price is quite cheap so you won't feel that much a pocket pinch. Rolls are absolutely awesome! The parathas are quite flakey and it kinda gets really heavy so I'd suggest you to ask for Dry Parathas for your rolls. The Mutton Tikiya and Chicken roll be constant love. Other than that, Biryani and Tandoori items are quite good but the Mutton Shami Kebab is a bit disappointing. Overall it's a nice choice for a quick bite or two.

I love this joint ever since I tasted their rolls. The parathas are absolutely amazing they are flaky and moist at the same time. The chicken is tender and buttery. And the best part about this is that green chutney that adds a whole new level to the flavor with that extra bit of acidic kick and punch.

Ordered the chicken roll. It was amazing! The chicken was juicy and succulent. Skip the sauces and opt for just onion with a dash of lime. It was perfect. Also tried the chicken bharta and rumali roti . The chicken was tender with a nice flavour, a must try. Do give this place a try!

This is simple take away outlet.. They dont have a dine in arrangement, apart from that being a local boy, I havent seen Haji is without customer for a single second.. Try out the rolls, the rolls are lachha paratha with chicken botis and Green Chutney, the main thing which oversums the taste..
And there Biryani is heavenly, a little oily and spicy, but it had never let me down till now..

The chicken biryani here is good but a bit more greasy than usual some times. But luckily today it was just on point. The potato was well cooked but yes, it lacked the flavours that should had been infused within. Else it was totally satisfying with the chicken being cooked really well and it was indeed mouth watering.  The mutton biryani here is not so special. But the chicken biryani definitely was a good eat. Totally recommended!

I love this joint . 5 mins from my house so I am a regular here . The rolls here are to die for - Chicken and Mutton Rolls are worth a mention . They have a few chairs if you want to sit and have a light meal . The Rumali Roti with Mutton Tikia is very good apart from the fact that many people might freak out seeing the amount of oil that accumulates in your plate :P I am not a healthy food seeker so that doesn't really bother me xD .
The Biryani and chaap are average .

I would recommended this only for it's mouthwatering rolls or some tikia .

Ambience is ok with no sitting arrangements.

Staffs are nice and service is quick.

Tried chicken roll, which was very tasty ,  soft paratha with tangy generous fillings. 

Overall a nice experience .

My mother often gets food from here due to it's proximity from her office. After much deliberation and trying out a lot of their dishes, I have reached the following conclusion

They have a total of 3 gravies, one white, one brown and one very dry for the chaap. Whatever you order, they dunk in the standard gravy and serve you. I have found mutton pieces in my chicken biriyani at times as well.

The rolls are the best thing here.

I had one egg chicken roll during durga puja last time. Crispy laccha paratha and spicy tango tikkas wrapped inside the paratha roll make it a perfect kolkata roll as it should be. Rolls are must have one here. Next time i will try something else.

Whenever i talk about Haji Shaheb it makes me feel Nostalgic. After school i used to come here with friends and have rolls and parathas. The reason i gave it a 4.5 rate not only because it is close to my heart but for the ● Chicken/ Mutton Rolls they make. 
The best rolls i ever had in my life. 
●There is a special green Chatni they put inside the roll. It is too good! Delicious! ● The roll parathas are soft and more like Lachha parathas inside there is solid roasted chicken stuffed with onion,chillies and the green chatni. 
You must try this place. :)

The food is very nice. Although number of items available are limited. Yet, whatever is available is totally worth your bucks. For snacks, go for the amazing rolls. There are variety of them. And they are extremely tasty.
The biriyani is superb. Tasty, delicious, always cooked fresh, properly cooked meat.. so many qualities this place have. Also, it is one of the places which serve both aloo and egg in biriyani..
The kebabs are also very tasty. Please taste the mutton tikia. It is very cheap and very delicious.
Except for the fact that there's no place to sit and have food, this place has no other disadvantages.

An ideal place to drop by, if you are a fan of the quintessential rolls. Warm fluffly parathas, used to wrap in juicy succulent portions of chicken. Have tried the Egg Roll here and the Egg Chicken Roll. Both were good, but the latter stole the show. More of a take-away joint, would like to drop in some day to try their Biryani.

Before going into details about the food, guys let me first tell you, its "Haji Shaheb" and its no kin of the famous Haji Saheb outlets of Behala and Park Circus. But if this fact is making you turn away from the eatery, trust me, just don't. Because, if you do so, you might be depriving your taste buds from having the tastiest egg chicken roll they ever had. There are three things that set it apart from the egg chicken rolls of other eateries I had before- the paratha, the chicken pieces and the heavenly coriander chutney they spread on the paratha. Often I find that the paratha dough of rolls is just too over-kneaded. But I was pleasantly surprised by the ideal dough they had prepared. It was just right. The glutten was niether too tight nor too flowy. As a result, the paratha was perfect and tasted marvellous without being too oily either. The juicy chicken pieces were abundant and their taste blended perfectly with the coriander chilli chutney (no idea about what more magic ingredients they added, because it tasted other wordly) they spread of the paratha. If you want this heavenly taste, stop them from adding any sauces like tomato sauce to it while they are preparing the roll. I heard the place teems with people in the evening, but surprising today it was not so and I got my roll in a matter of minutes. Stop overthinking guys, just go and give your taste buds a treat! Its located just beside the Netaji Bhavan metro station at Jadu Bazaar.

Finally decided to post a review on Haji Saheb. Situated in one of the oldest markets of Kolkata (Jadu Babu Bazaar).. For around past 4 years I often visit this place to take a quick bite whenever I feel hungry or just wish to taste something good..
I always have their egg rolls, egg-chicken rolls, chicken or double chicken rolls and tried their butter chicken dish once.. The roll that blew my mind was the paneer roll which I tried now I don't know why I didn't try it earlier.

Anyway,
Their egg rolls are just fine.. The only good taste you'll get is just because of the laccha paratha, otherwise this roll is just average and dry..

Chicken roll is filling and tastier, the green chutney added makes it all the more better. Double chicken roll is not for people with low appetite. It is equal to having a proper heavy meal.

Egg-chicken roll is just like mixture of egg and chicken roll, I know I don't need to say that.

Now the paneer roll, it is just amazing.. Amongst the other rolls I've tried, this one is the best. It is filling, and extra spices and not at all dry like the other rolls.. I still remember that amazing taste. For the next few months this is going to be my fixed order now..

And the gravy items and biryani are also very famous here but I've tried the Butter chicken only in which they provide decent quantity at decent price, will try other items soon..
Note: Prices of rolls keeps rolling up compulsory every year, they must do something about it..

First of all I want to say that this is not a Haji Saheb branch and its "Haji Shaheb" which is located near Netaji Bhawan Metro Station in Jadu Babur Bazar. This place quite popular in the locality as a food joint which serves great rolls. The rolls here are really good and I love their Egg Chicken Rolls. Its quite often when I have a quick bite after my college from this place. Another thing which makes this place popular is their Biryani. The quality of Biryani and Chaps are something commendable. The service is quite fast and you don't have to wait much to get your order.
The place is preferred for take away rather than dine in. One thing they should look after is the hygiene. The plain is not very clean.
Overall a good place to have rolls and Biryani.

Haji Shaheb is a great place to have Biriyanis and kebabs. Their highlights are their Rolls and Biriyanis: the lachcha with the chicken and green chutney, has just the right balance of flavors which leaves a lasting impression and the biriyanis are very good, they serve it with an egg, something most places don't. The biriyani, the chicken or mutton they use in it is just very , very tasty.
Their kebabs are very flavorful, but the big thing is value for many. The size of the pieces at their price is just mind blowing. 
It's a great place to have your food from, you'll never be disappointed.

A take away joint to be specific, one of the mouth watering and tastiest biryani served. The best part about this place is that it's not fancy and yet serves one of the best biryani in town however a must try is the mutton chap and chicken chap wit rumali, the rolls are ok but u will need to be specific how wld u want the roll to be else at times they can mess it up, the staff is polite and friendly however there's only thing they really need to work on is there service and delivery service, once that is sorted out it would be an additional advantage to them.

Haji Shaheb - An eatery near the Food Market and Netaji Metro.
=====
Intro + Location:
Zomato please take notice that it's haji shaheb and not 'saheb' as it's not a part of the haji saheb outlets. This outlet was visited yesterday with my cousin. She personally wanted to have Kolkata's chaps and somehow convinced me to go there. This place is not at all difficult to locate as its just near the main road in one of the bylanes. 

Landmark: Very near to Raviz Restaurant. 

The ambience of this place is nothing great and the hygiene is also an issue here. Nevertheless, they just had four table and chairs as they cater more to takeaway and home delivery customers. I somehow find this place could have utilised the space effectively. I wanted to order soft drink and water which they did not have as well. 
=====
What i ordered: 

1) Chicken Biryani - The price was 130 inclusive of taxes. Rice served with Boiled Egg(Which was cold), Chicken Piece (Hot, Succulent and Big Size) and Aloo (Smoky hot as well). They served us in usual paper plate and with plastic spoon. Personally, i din't like it. However, the taste was good no doubt. The oil content needs to be reduced. The biryani was flavorful though. 

2) Mutton Champ - I am not a lover of mutton but my cousin wanted to try it so we went on eating it.  We also ordered for Roomali Rotis. The roomali roti was made in front of us and served hot with green chutney and salad. The combination was really good. and It costed us about 60-70 bucks. It was kind of the person to offer us more gravy as well. 
=====
Pros:
1) Prime Location.
2) Food was served hot except for the egg. 
3) Very reasonably priced.

Cons:
1) Hygiene is a big issue here.
2) Seating isn't comfortable. 
3) Lack of proper utilisation of space. 
4) Not much of a vegetarian place. 
===== 
Meal for two: We finished at near about 200 bucks. Meal for two would be 200-450 max
=====
Expert Suggestions:
1) Improve your hygiene.
2) Seating can be improved and even space can be efficiently utilized.
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 3.6/5
Food Taste 3.7/5
Food Presentation 3.3/5
Food Quantity 3.7/5
Hygiene 2.8/5
Ambiance 3.1/5
=====
Conclusion: I would visit this place for a takeaway and not for dine in for sure. Nevertheless, really reasonably priced. 
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

I was real hungry and vulnerable due to my emptiness but haji saheb compelled me at 5 o'clock with its awesome biriyani. It was served in a paper plate and i couldn't complete as the quantity was really for two. It had an egg whom i adore inn biriyani but hard to find in Kolkata. The tandoor murg were sooo tender and tasty, more than Arsalan of Hatibagan(as i just had them there 2 days ago). This place is not for family dine and those high-nosy people should avoid this place. Small side sitting area around kitchen is making this hard to sit but manageable only for a good food lover. Price is reasonable, quantity is good, hygiene can be an issue but not a problem and taste is same like kolkata type biriyani with an egg inside. Would go again once i visit for food here but ONLY PARCEL.

It's a place to have some on the go rolls and snacks. Food is good. But the staffs are not friendly at all and the place is dirty. Too damn dirty. No hygiene. I only had food from here a few times just because its close to my place.l and convenient for me. Otherwise would have avoided it.

Finally, Haji Saheb of Bhawanipur is in Zomato. I am a frequent customer of this eatery. It is located in Jadu Babu's market. The shop is a small one. Ambience is below par but the food makes up for it. They make the best rolls of bhwanipur. I had their egg roll and chicken roll. The egg roll is delicious, the paratha is thick and crispy, a tad bit oily but tastes awesome. The Chicken roll is delicious as well. The Chicken pieces are soft and juicy. They apply a green gravy inside thr rolls which increases the taste ten folds. I will definitely visit it again.

Located at an obscure corner close to jadubabu bazar this place is a classic example of how to increasingly spoil the food quality. At one point of time this place served one of the best rolls in the whole of Kolkata but as time passed by it no longer is the place it used to be.

Awesome egg and chicken 🍗 roll quality.
Specially the chicken 🍗 roll with those green sauce is superb.
It's a five minutes walking 🚶 distance from my home.
So I like to go everyday.

Finally Zomato got haji saheb bhawanipur on the list. Went there couple of times. Till the last time I went to this place it was not in Zomato(so no photo). It's located just beside the jodu babu bazar on the road going towards padmapukur. The place is small with the roll counter at the entrance of the restaurant. Inside there are no tables just a wall fitted stainless steel rack and few plastic stool. The kitchen is live and you can see them making rolls and trying the parathas to perfection. The place is not very up to the mark in terms of hygiene specially their back kitchen.
Coming to food. I mostly had their rolls and biriyani. The rolls are simply awesome and I would recommend everyone to try. The best thing about the rolls here is the paratha. The gives luccha parathas and those are fried crisp golden from outside and soft tasty from inside. A simple egg roll would cost you just 25 rupees. The tikkia rolls are also awesome to taste with fried tikkia with good amount of onion and capsicum wrapped in laccha paratha and best thing that no other roll shop will give is the dash of green Chutney . The green chutney makes the roll from good to awesome.
The biriyani that I had once was also nice and the meat was also well done and the rice was also cooked to perfection.
This is an excellent place for various kinds of rolls. I like this place more than Gariahat Bedwin as they don't give luccha paratha for their rolls. So, If you are roll lover Plan your visit soon.

So finally haji saheb bhawanipur is on zomato !! I love this place. They dont have a dine in option, but still the people of the area are fan of their food
It is located just beside netaji bhawan metro near jadubabu bazar. Their speciality is their roll. They use lacha paratha and filling is curry based woth dhaniya chutney. The chicken roll is one of the best i can ever have.
Also the flavour of their chicken biryani is top notch and the chicken kasa is heavenly. The food is a little oily so is not meant for health conscious people but the taste of every item is just the best. Every occasion in my family is incomplete without haji's biryani. Once you visit this place, you cant stop coming here !! :D
