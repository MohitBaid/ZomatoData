Ambience- Pub wise 4/5
Loud music , huge screen for football, cricket matches and a huge pool table!
Its a little dark for my taste! Could hardly see anything on the 1st floor!
The service is not prompt enough. You have to keep calling them.
We had one lime margarita which was okay and their speciality green chilly chicken as starter which was really delicious- Recommended!
There is a separate smoking area as well.

Service can be better!
Location is on the Sarat Bose Road. Lane opposite to Barista after you turn left from Desopriya park crossing! (Located exactly opposite to Tolly Tales)

We visited this place place on 31st December with a couple of friends.Special rates were there for that day.But the staffs partially lied about what were there in the package that we choosed. Otherwise they were polite and friendly.
The ambience was good. If you are a sports geek, you will love this place. 
Coming to the food, We ordered crispy fried seseam chicken, which was pretty ordinary and the quantity was also less for the price we paid. Roasted chicken wings was found to be better than that. 
The DJ was good.The place is okay for hangout with friends or for couple.

The place was clumsy and dark. I understand the lighting is made according to the decor yet its too dark. Food was average. But the drinks were budget friendly. We had order 3 pitcher of beer, 5 tequilla shots and one round of vodka. It costed us around 3k for 3 people.

After a heavy night of gorging, wanted some edm to jiggle ourselves. So ended up at this place.

A bright entrance welcomed us. The ground floor is designed like that of a sports bar what with its pool table & large screen muted tv playing some sports.

The atmo was instantly engaging with the typical loop music played by a duo of jockeys. Since we were gastronomically full, we settled for a pint of Bira!

Need a revisit to this place to give a better and comprehensive review...

Surprisingly Zomato says highlight is draught beer. There is no draught beer in this place. Pint of beer costs 160 as per Zomato whereas the place has no beer below 300. Either the place is wrong or Zomato has different expectation bout the place. Would rate the place as very bad considering the availability of items, price point, service and location. Otherwise the environment is good, almost tempted to give a better rating if I was sitting here not ordering anything.

This place is actually too costly and zomato approximation didn't come anywhere near to our actual bill. We spent a Christmas evening here. Cigarette smoke could be felt all around the place. So, if you are here just for drinks and hate smoking, this place isn't for you.

Snooker table and sitting downstairs, only seeing upwards and big screen in the middle which can be seen from both the floors. Had some beer, breezer, mohito and other drinks along with some cheese nachos. Though had not ordered any meal but would love to try that out the next time.

I went to Xrong place with my best friend few days bsck after lots of planning.  It is situated just opposite Tolly Tales. The ambience is so warm and nice.  Decor is above standard.  We were lucky that we went during happy hours. We had our drinks and along with that we ordered chicken nuggets.  It was amazing!  The crowd there was good aswell. I loved it there and I'll definitely go back. Service there was very quick n the waiters were very attentive.  There is a separate smoking area for people. It has got the full ambience of that bar with sophistication.  I loved it! Highly recommended.

Location- on southern Avenue, in the same lane as Tolly Tales.

It's a pub and is a great one too for this genre.

Wooden finish walls, pool table, great but loud music and wonderful sofas and high chair and tables for your comfort.

We had lasagna, fresh lime, crispy lamb, pepper fish and pan fried prawns and another chicken starter.

The fresh lime was the worst you can get anywhere in Kolkata.

The lasagna was okayish, lamb was good, so was the prawn, the best was the fish and chicken dishes.

Price is clearly on the higher side.

They can try a lower volume so that people can hear each other and probably a bit more light instead of the dark theme they now have.

But a nice place to hangout with your gang!

These people are legitimate thieves, they would cheat you on your bill, hike atleast 50% during puja adding an extra tax to it. The last time we went a couple of days back their staff misbehaved with 7 of us urging to leave the last corner seats as it was booked which was totally a lie. We went directly to China whites, we have options everywhere! Kbye! üòÄ

How is Xrong Place considered a Pub??? I totally wonder!!¬†

One of the worst pubs in Kolkata.
This is my 2nd visit to this place, and for the second time also I left the place disheartened.
The pub has quite a large space and the decor comes in a pretty unique and classy manner. While the service is extremely poor. To give an order you need to almost run every time to the cash counter to ask for the waiter to come to your table.
The food is quite tasty but it burns a deep hole in your pocket and the quantity is not at all satisfying.

Items Ordered: Basket of fries, Chicken wings in B.B.Q sauce & Crispy Fried Sesame Chicken
Alcohol Ordered: 2 Heiniken tower (4ltrs) & 30ml*4 Ballantines Finest¬†
Pocket Pinch: Rs.3987 (Including GST)

I would recommend people not to visit this place as it will burn a deep hole in your pocket and wont satisfy with the quantity. And the service is very poor!
Cost for two: Rs.1600 approx including Alcohol (Including GST)

If you have no where else to party or drink, then only come here!

The place has an ambience like an English pub. Woody texture, pool table, decent lighting and really cute bar stools. I was suggested to try the 'Green chilli dry chicken' which had a tangy first taste followed by a hot chilli after taste. This was something new I had. I asked them to spice up the dry pork which tasted even better. It had the perfect blend of fat and fiber.

Being a beer person I missed the pitcher/towers although I could see the empty ones lying at the corner of the pub. I hope the next time I go, the pork would taste even better with a chilled draught beer.

We had to wait outside for around 25 minutes.  High waiting time brings high expectations from the place, so we decided to give a try.

Bakery items (garlic bread) took more time to serve than any other dishes we ordered. So 1 point went for late service.

Ambience is good, as per the expectations of a sports bar. Food taste was average. 
One time try i would say!

Xrong place was a long due on my to-do list, glad to have finally visited it during the pujo. 
Packed with people, I must say the staff were s bit clumsy at dealing with the guests. I'm not sure if this is the scene for the regular days too. 
People mostly grab a drink and share a talk or two in groups or are all couples. However we opted for their food. 
Tried their super chicken nachos. It comes in a bowl with decent amount of chicken but that's pretty bland in taste. There were few nachos without any flavor. The baked cheese topping was already cold by the time it was served. 
We weren't served any salt even after asking. It tasted bland. 
The only good thing was the ambiance, the good music and fairy lights were a plus point. 
Summing up, it wasn't good enough. I don't know about their drinks as I haven't tasted any of them. 

Thanks.

They started charging entry fee after 6pm

Visited this place on Saptami eve, with my friends. Good experience overall. Breaking it into sections. Pocket pinch: They charged us 500/- per head as cover chrage. Which is obviously redeemable and not refundable. Can be redeemed on the entire bill. So don't worry. 
Food: Food quality is average. We ordered Fish n chips, Green chilli chicken , chicken kebabs and other I don't remember the name. We also ordered two classic LIITs which were very light felt like mocktails ,  because if am not LIIT is a strong drink. 
Service: Staffs and service is good but slow in terms of serving your table but you actually can't complain since it was Puja and the place was packed. 
Ambiance: If you are a person who likes to have her/his drink in a peaceful ambiance then this is not for you. Loud songs and strong beats with live dj makes the place very lively. Over-all it's a good place but I would not visit again cos I take my drink with a light music playing at my background.

Horrible management and staff behaviour. Overpriced food. Untidy washroom. The taste of the food was not good either. 
After 20 minutes of ordering starter they came and told us they cannot serve any shredded chicken item. 
Morover the told us we must 1side dish for 1main course (rice or noodles) this is thus horrible..

Zomato please look into the pricing mentioned for this place. Here it is mentioned a pint of beer cost 160(aprox) but they charged us 350 for a pint of beer.

The place is quite a good one to visit on a boring Tuesday however as I went on a occasion didn't expect it to be so refreshing . The staff was friendly , keeping our moods by getting us our orders one time . The food was yummy as I only had cheesy fries . They were free shots and cocktails for ladies which was pretty amazing , isn't it ? It was a Tallee Tuesday Night . Though I did not get drunk like hell but pretty enjoyed dancing , grooving and drinking . Would like to explore their food a bit more . The drinks were good with the Tang and the spicyness . I loved the decor , it reminded me of the Tito's bar because of the staircase . The hanging lights within the bottles were eye catchers and guess what I'm planning to get one for myself.

They should not be charging for games instead they can restrict it to few rounds. So that everyone can enjoy . Or give one board free so then charge for rest.

I went on a thursday night when it was karaoke night. The ambience was good but music was too loud and also the food is not that great. The waiters are not cooperative and also it takes a lot of time for them to serve.

The club is located in Sarat Banerjee Road, Southern Avenue. It stands opposite to Tolly Tales. This is definitely one of the coolest place to hangout. It is divided into two floors. The ground floor has a pool table. There are live screenings of matches and of course, a DJ. The ambience is really good and the music will get you grooving in no time! The food is good too. Service here is quick and there is a separate smoking room. Tuesdays here are known as Talle Tuesdays as there are ladies night here every Tuesdays. Different cocktails and shots are on the house. There is not much of a dance floor though. The place gets crowded after 10pm. You can also avail the Happy Hours from Monday to Friday.

Could have given it a 5 starts but they don't serve 1:1 on happy hours anymore. 
Ambiance is topnotch. 
Could work a little with the music though. 
I've been here more than 15 times, already have the play list memorised.

Great ambience!  Visited many times and will liked to visit more, specially for Draught Beer and baked french fry! Staff's are good but if  service time decreased it will be better..! Only the cons is there I didn't got any tap tower anytime as every time I order tower only, which was served in boot and jug and its get's room before completing as its lack of ice in the tower ! And Happy hour offer should be increased..! 
Overall good pocket friendly place and ambience to hangout.! Loved to visit :)

The place is really good and the staff is also friendly. Great place to go with your squad and chill. One shouldn't miss out the ladies night on Tuesdays. 
Although the boot wasn't available when we ordered for it. Reason why my rating is 3.5.

Good for an afternoon chill. They dont have beer towers in stock so they provide draught beer in 2-3 pitchers incase of 2 litres. The food here is good and alcohol price is reasonable. Thus, dropping here often can be fun.

Are you looking for a typical western styled texas bar in the city ?
Well Xrong place is where you should keep your bets hands down .
The styling and decor is completely slick.the atmosphere is pretty good and the crowd is awesome.A great place to hang out with friends at weekends and get sloshed with beer and drinks .
The wine could be a bit better ,nevertheless a pretty great place according to me .
The food is pretty good .infact i would advise people to try the moroccan chicken skewers and sicilian garlic chicken .my favourite would be pork chops with BBQ SAUCE ...ahh thats just too delicious . . So go out and try this place its pretty awesome

Terrible experience. Food served was cold. The waiter was irresponsible and we had to call them number of times for our order. Such a bad experience that we left food incomplete. The waiter who took the order suddenly disappeared and didn't feel the urge to inform anybody about our order, neither did he left anybody to attend us. Never going to visit again. Would have given a minus rating if possible.

Good gals go to heaven, bad gals go everywhere!! So our girl gang decided to visit Xrong Place and we are  glad that we chose the place to chill. Wooden floor, soothing lights nice music set our mood. We ordered for  beer in pitcher( it was served in cute lil boot) along with Cheesy Mushroom cap, Veg Platter n Green Chilli Chicken.Green Chilli Chicken was served first and none of us liked d taste...overloaded with unnecessary spices and too oily. Next came Cheesy Mushroom Caps. Needless to say Button Mushroom caps  filled with warm gooey cheese n  herbs was an instant hit. We enjoyed every bit of it. The  Veg Platter had combi of Cheese Balls,  Baked Potato Skin, Garlic Mushrooms and Green Cottage Cheese. We were not keen to eat green cottage cheese because of our prior experience with Green Chilli Chicken and requested Cottage Cheese Skewers in BBQ Sauce instead. They readily agreed and served the platter. It was perfectly balanced platter...deep fries...baked...less spicy and more spicy items. My personal favorite was hot garlic mushrooms.
Friday...Friends...Food...Beer...and Taylor Swift singing "Shake it off"....can't get better than this. Thank you Xrong Place will keep coming back.

I would rather tag this as a "one time try out" place. The first drawback was when two of us entered today(saturday) evening and instead of helping us with seats  one of the staff was asking us to decide where we wanted to sit. However I believe this may not happen on weekdays. Second drawback was when they had nothing as complimentary snacks. We ordered  draught beer and had to wait almost 20 mins for the starter we ordered. Food was on a plus side as we liked the preparations! We ordered green chilli chicken (3/5) and baked potato wedges with cheese (5/5).  As we did not ate much... bill was pocket friendly. Crowd consisted more of young college goers. Could be a must visit for young people hanging out with bunch of friends.

We visited this place three days in a row and became quick acquainted with the manager Pallavi. On our last day, we left just before the closing time and quickly came back for a bottle of water. Just as we were entering back a wait staff named Mark asked us what we wanted and when we said we needed water he tried to shoo us out. We told him we knew the manager and he questions us saying he didn't even knew her. Another wait staff who was serving us came running and took us to the manager who was kind enough to give us our bottle of water but when we were coming down with two bottle of water Mark started questioning the other wait staff asking them rudely who gave us that. 

We had a fun three days in Xrong place but this one experience spoiled everything. Water is basic requirement and no one can refuse it. I took two bottles of 500ml of water and gave the wait staff a hundred bucks to keep. This cannot be tolerated. Xrong place management please take action. I

Dark Ambience and wooden floor which give a different look. They have 2 floors. In ground floor they have pool game. And bar counter is on the first floor. 

They serve good food as well. We ordered green chilli chicken, which was damn soft and not soo spicyüëå, our next order was  bake fishüòç. I just fall in love with this dish. Baked Basa fish with cheesy feeling. 

We ordered beer and some vodka as well 

Prompt service and stuffs are all friendly.

One evening, me and some of my friends decided to visit some cafe..so xrong place was 2nd on our list, some other overhyped cafe being 1st..
So,as per plan we went to that overhyped cafe and got dissapointed and decided to leave that cafe and visit xrong place instead..
Food at xrong place is superb üëåüèº..
We had green chilly chicken üçó, panfried fish üêü..
Both were equally delicious..üëåüèº
And had beer in the boots, some tequilas, cutty shark whisky..and what not..!!
This place seemed too reasonable for us after that overhyped cafe..üòú

The place had been in my bookmarks since a long time now and I finally got the opportunity to visit this place with some friends today. It is located near Sarat Bose Road Post Office; opposite to Tolly Tales in Southern Avenue.
Xrong Place has the classic pub look and interiors with dim lights and wooden furnishings. There is also a dance floor below.

We tried some items from their newly launched menu. Stuffed Cheese Mushroom Caps were my favourite as I love mushrooms anyways. The mushrooms were juicy and of top quality. Baked Potato Skin was also nice. The baked potatoes were topped with cheese and stuffed with cheese and corn. Cottage Cheese Skewers were served with Barbeque Sauce, thus giving your classic paneer tikka an American twist.

The service was a delight. A special mention to Mr. Pradip, who was managing our table.

*Peri Peri prawns : Hot and spicy prawn skewers that are a great compliment with drinks
*Baked Fish : fish cooked in mustard and honey served with toasted bread.
*Greek Meat balls :Delicious and juicy lamb meat balls.
*Cheese Mushroom caps : mushroom stuffed with cheese

I'm beverage I loved the cranberry Juice in particular 

Special mention to Pradip. He served us really well :)

Me and my buddy went this afternoon. The waiter has no idea what he is talking about. He told initially drinks in happy hours are 1:1 but denied later. The lady manager who stepped in was a very rude arrogant Illbehaved lady . She doesn't even know@a the basic norms of customer service and lacked basic courtesy to speak with customers. Worst customer service I have ever scene. I would warn guys that these guys are not crystal clear and they lie to attract people. Unbelievable . The owner shud look in serious terms.

But the smoking zone is a bit small and its AC remains off sometimes. They have a pool table which is another attraction of the place. The music played by them is not good always.

Pretty cool ambiance n comfortable seating arrangement, just make sure to avoid the tables that have stools, as those stools don't have backrest and tend to trip at times. 

Music is average, the DJ is just for show I guess, he doesn't do much.

Staffs are nice and well-behaved, though not too professional n well-trained. They won't offer you a spare plate to share a single dish with your friend, they simply assume that you all will eat from the same bowl, so they just leave you spare forks n spoons. They never intend to serve anything, it's more like 'help yourself'. However I don't really mind that, after all it's a bar, not a fine dine place. But still, some of the bars in Kolkata do show these courtesies. 

I and my friend ordered Peri Peri Prawn and Baked Fish with Draught Beer.  Baked Fish was simply awesome, but the Peri Peri Prawn was equally trashy.

Anyway, if you overlook these small flaws, this place is pretty cool to hang out with friends. 

Cheers!

I have visited this place quite some times & my opinion is that it is losing its charm recently due to poor customer service. Personally i like the location & ambience very much and get positive vibes immediately upon entering. But, the vibes start to fade away once you start ordering. My last visit was on a saturday evening & draught beer was not available. Are you serious?!! The only beer available was Heineken. Obviously they got a lot more on the menu! However do try out their baked fish. Its awesome!! Cocktails are so so. 4 stars only for their food & ambience. The waiters will be busy with their own work gossiping amongst themselves, so be prepared to give a shout out several times. If you can bear with that, this place is enjoyable. And yes, they have a smoking room inside.

A modestly priced pub with surfeit of items in beverage and food to choose from. It's the most economical pub with a minimalist ambience that I've been to in Kolkata .
You get the old school feeling in this place. 
Things I dislike about this place is stinking washroom. 
Sound system is quite below par and you don't get "that feel" when music is being played.
It's very dimly lit and I don't like places with too much subdued lighting (but it's alright) .
All in all I've had a good time.

One of the few only exquisite pub in town!!! The music, the ambience, the decor, the wooden floors, the pool table-- nothing can go 'Xrong' at Xrong Place!!! The cocktails served are simply awesome. A shoutout for their cheesy French Fries. Awesomely loaded with loads of cheese, exactly the way I loveeeeee it. Kudos

I have gone there on Valentines Day. The place was very crowded because of the usual reasons. However, the waitera managed everything quite efficiently. The drinks were served quite quickly. I haven't ordered anything to eat so I don't know about the quality of their food.
The music that was played in the background was quite peppy.

The bar here is an absolute delight. The ambience is perfect for sitting and chatting with friends. The cocktails were the absolute companion one can ask for while out with friends. The music was good. Being a die hard F.R.I.E.N.D.S. fan, when the title track was played, it was just the right place for us to be that evening. Good friends is all you need and the rest(good liquor, good music, fantastic ambience) will be provided by them.

I find the price little overpriced.

Food- okayish.

This pub would easily win the "Worst Pub in the world" award thanks to their staff. Extremely rude staff. Asked us to wait outside for 30mins when the pub was actually nearly empty. We went on the 6th of January,2016 at 8.15pm (this is so that the management knows about the staff working those shifts).
We were asked to leave our bike helmets outside at the front counter as apparantly there was no space inside. The pub was nearly empty which we found out when we went in. Next we sat down and started to give our order. The person serving us said that they have only heiniken and kingfisher premium from the drinks menu and nothing else. We still went ahead and ordered. We also ordered fish and chips which was really nice. But the chicken crispy that we had ordered was horrible.¬†

The seats were a bit uncomfortable ( the short stools) so we asked the staff if we could just take a chair from one of the empty tables. To this the guy said " We cannot be responsible for the comfort factor of people who come here and No you cannot take the chair". I dont know who he is to decide upon the comfort factor of customers and if you treat customers like that then why open a pub. The server was least interested in serving customers he was no where to be seen, we had to physically go and find him to give our orders.¬†
He gave us a boot(1.5l) of beer but did not give us glasses with it. So again we had to go and find him to ask for glasses. Now doing this everytime you have to order (when the pub is not even half full) is really not how I would like to spend a night out with friends.

Okay so after being really fed up of the service we decided to leave and go somewhere else. We paid the bill and walked towards the front desk to fetch our helmets. There we found that one of their Manager had taken one of our helmets and had gone home. Instead of apologising and calling the manager the guy said that come tomorow at 3pm and collect your helmet( and we live in salt lake). As if that was our fault. After having service like this we got fed up and called the manager and asked him to come back to the pub and return the helmet.¬†

We had to repeatedly call the manager till he finally came to return the helmet and then he shows attitude and says that "for you people I had to drive all the way back from home". Now when your staff has made a mistake why should we the customers experience such incidents.

Bottom Line...................... We had a very bad experience there are much better pubs in kolkata so my word of advice is to avoid this place.

You need more places like this in Kolkata with educated and decent crowd where you can visit with your friends and family and enjoy the time without any worries.¬†
Firstly, the decor is good and nicely planned . The screen is large and placed well so that it is visible from all the angles. The pool table surely gives an added attraction to the look. Lighting is perfect and gives you a sense of privacy.
The service is decent and professional where the people are interested in you and want to serve you as per your liking.
Secondly , the drinks are great. I went on a Saturday evening with my friends to have beer and we ordered 2X1 litres of beer which is served in very nice pitcher resembling a ladies boot and the presentation helped the ambiance to go up further. The drinks are reasonably priced and on the cheaper side along with some good cocktails and is a perfect joint to booze and enjoy with friends ¬†and the close ones.
Thirdly, the music is very nicely assembled. They were mostly playing the pop hits of late 90's and early 2000's which every one can relate to as the ¬†average age of the crowd will fall in that category where you can relate to those hits . The DJ just by the side of the smoking room was looking least interested about it though.
Finally, the food. Well I would say I really like the quality and quantity of the food served in xrong place. The appetizers were really tasty the pan fried fish, the dry chilli chicken were all perfect with the drinks and increased my hunger further. The baked fish with cheese and mustard deserves a special mention and is highly recommended. I even opted for a rice and fish combo and was surprised by the quantity and taste of it as well.

Finally the pocket pinch was INR 4000 for 4 people with many drinks, starters and main course for 4 whicxh as per me is absolutely Okay. Coming out of Xrong place you will have a few extra social network likes in your photos and some happy memories.

The Food is Very Nice but I find the price little overpriced.
The plave has amazing offers on liquor and s very cheap in this case.
Xrong Place is still one of the better Place to grab a beer or 2 in the area.
Visited more than twice and will surely,visit again.

The waiters didn't know how to talk to their customers. They took us in, in spite of having lack of seats. We were 9 people, some of us had to sit on a pool table. And when we sat there, the waiters started telling us rudely to get down. The prices of food are exorbitant. One of the worst places I ever had to go to.

Went there on a lazy Thursday evening with my friend .. It was a disappointment when we were informed that there is no happy hours or any such deal in this festive season üò¢ .. the Thursday karaoke was also to happen late at night üòë ... So we just sat and ate and drank our evening out in the lovely cozy ambience .. The stuff was helpful and courteous and the service was not as slow as some fellow zomatoans have mentioned .. We were not that hungry .. so we just went for fish finger and their famous green chilly chicken ... The later didn't meet my expectations as I found nothing to go gaga about it .. tasted more like a chicken salad .. really liked the fish fingers though .. one of the best in town .. overall a nice place to hang out ... but may burn a hole in your pocket üòã

Having been coming to this place since it opened up during the first IPL Season 2008-2009, this was the neighborhood joint where we would chill and watch matches. 
Today having gone there for just a beer with a female friend the service staff asked us to sit in a two seater instead of 4 seaters sighting reasons of tables being reserved without a board. So much so that having being seated for 30mintues no order was taken. Some guy called prashant dey said that two people can sit only in two seaters and not anywhere else. 
Such is the state of hospitality in the neighborhood.
I guess that proves what happens when a bunch of losers run hospitality places without the knowledge of being hospitable and hire ill mannered staff to serve

Xrong place is seriously one of my biggest disappointments till date. I believe that customer relations and service is important irrespective of where you belong. Now I have been to this place before with my 'local' lads and they treated us well but when I went with my own 'kin' they asked us to finish our beer and gave a fake cops have come excuse and that they need to shut it down. Now the question may arise that were we drunk or did we cross the time limit? We were told to move out at around 11.15 even though the place is supposed to be open till 12.
Guys get a life... If you people don't know how to respect and treat people well... Why the heck are you even keeping your business open. The manager was least interested in solving our problems.
P.s- The opposite restaurant(Tolly) has better food/drinks option.. Give it a go like we did. Not to forget they have better staff service too and plus they are open till late.

Alcohol is quite pricey but mostly they run happy hours which goes easy on pockets.draught beer is almost always available.  Not a place to miss if you haven't been to xrong place yet .

The place is pretty good, the atmosphere, the crowd, decorations are fine except the dj. It's like a dj who plays the tracks by his phone with poor playlist. And the most important thing is the combination of song n tv doesn't match. Like you are watching final over of the match with a romantic track. I think they should think about it.
Food is delicious n worth of money.

Xrong is the kind of place where you go to after a hectic day, with a few friends and you order a tower of beer and just peace out.

It is amazing for just that, the crowd is usually good, they have some sport always on, they have a pool table if you feel sporty after a few drinks and the food is good too. Service isn't great but it's not bad either, its a noisy pub and its okay if you have to shout out your order before they get it.

All in all, a great place where everything is priced just right.

Xrong place is a actually a wrong place to party. We went in a group and had pre-booked package. After we arrived, the drinks weren't ready. The staff took 30 min to arrange for the drink. Snacks were COLD. Fish was half baked and smelly. Dinner was awful. We tried out few food options but none of them were good. Staff behavior was unacceptable. Even the manager didnt bother to resolve our issues. Overall, Food is horrible, ambiance - average and service awful. Check out other places which are far better than Xrong place. Do avoid this place.

I wasn't aware that people still practiced patriarchal practices like handing the bill to the man only, in metropolitan cities. Thank you for correcting me Xrong Place and not handing me the cheque despite holding out my hand for it which the server ignored and promptly placed the bill in front of my male companion. How dare I have asked for the bill! My mistake. And when I pointed this out to the server he declared that "the bill is always given to gents." Kudos for this sexism!

Nyc place. Awesome ambience. Rock n roll music. Best when visited during happy hour. 3pm to 7pm. You get beer pint 1 free with 1 and also certain whiskeys.
Staff and people are good. The food is awesome. We had hot and garlic prawn, sausage wrapped in bacon, baked fish and char'ed mushroom. The mushroom was so so, rest of the items were awesome.
A little bit hard on the pocket pinch.. but you ll enjoy visiting there with friends.

Located in a prime area of South Kolkata offering good drinks. A little more variety in the drinks menu will be well appreciated. The food menu is ok. Also the smoking zone is small for such a place. Good music and interiors. All in all it's a decent place to be at especially on a weekend!!!

Heard a lot about it so wished for a long time to visit this place. Finally got a chance this pujo. We planned for a pub hopping and started with it on shoshthi evening. It's like just another above average pub in mumbai. Nothing felt so amazing. But yes, it was packed and to get a table was difficult. Ordered LIIT, but didn't like it here. Beer options were limited too. Ordered food, it appeared very late. Thus I am not that happy with it.

Went there during Dashami this year for a round of beer. Located near Lake Mall, Rashbehari Avenue, this place is certainly one of the best pubs in the town. The ambience was very nice with groovy music and dimly lit surroundings. They had a snooker table also which was chargeable. 

Since they didn't have the happy hours because pujo (which is sad) we ordered 3 boots of beers (each boot being 1 litre). 

Overall the place is very nice to relax and spend time with friends over booze. Though the service is a bit let down and the pocket pinch is slightly on the rise.

Groovy ambience yet a bit dark, too loud music and very cramped up and lacking amole space for people to sit comfortably. Have tried a lot to imitate a normal Bombay pub but have failed miserably. Highly overpriced and over-hyped. The pub is two storied. The washroom is in the 1st floor. The most awkward experience I faced on my 1st visit during Durga Puja on Sashti is that I was waiting in the queue outside the ladies washroom- 1st a guy came out and a few seconds later a girl from the LADIES WASHROOM.  Have never faved such sort of thing in pubs in Mumbai. Nonetheless, the washroom area is extremely dark.

Worst pub ever visited. First ordered heineken pint which was good as it should be. Then we ordered 1liter boot beer of the same.. And it was bloody mixed with water and tasted aweful.When d manager was confronted he said it can be because of difference in barrels.AC also doesnt work.Not at all recommended.

After a brief visit to South City Mall, it was time to crash somewhere. Checked for happy hours nearby and came upon this place which was just 10 mins drive from the mall.

Now this place was in trend for quite sometime and we did have some expectation. Located in a bylane, place is quite dark because of extra dim lightings. Wooden seating arrangements and mid 90's rock was on full flow. So basically nice ambiance. First we climbed up first floor but then decided to settle ourselves in the ground floor as snooker table was kept there.

We ordered for beer by the boot and Konjee crispy lamb. First thing as shock was that the happy hours is not being followed for the puja. Secondly only Heineken was available at that time. We just confirmed the order as no other option was there. 

We tried our hand on snooker by that time which was chargeable as 100 bucks per game.

By that time stuff's arrived and cheeselings were served. Have to mention it as one of the best complimentary option along with drinks. Konjee crispy lamp was prepared nicely. The guy serving us refilled plate of cheeselings which was definitely a nice gesture.

The scene which looked awkward was that in middle of our course, the staff came up and asked whether we need anything else as his shift was over. After we replied nothing for the moment, in the next minute he came up with the check. Really looks awkward when still you were not done halfway even. It seemed as if directly mentioning to leave. Would ask team to look into these instances.

Visited on a Friday night with a couple of colleagues. Really liked the vibe of this place. You can relax with a couple of beers and finger food. We ordered a crispy fried sesame chicken, crispy chilli baby corn and veg platter. The food took around 10-15 minutes and it was pretty good. Total pocket pinch was 1600 for three with a couple of vodka shots. The music too was good and not too loud which makes it easy to have a conversation. Will visit agin for sure.

It can be located easily being just opposite to Tolly Tales. I visited this place yesterday with a friend of mine. This place has that dim-pub-chic look which gives you a pleasant high( of course one you are drunk ). It has a pool table in the left hand side the moment you enter in and a projection screen for live matches. The staircase takes you up to the area of sitting and the bar. The Bar has a good range of drinks and the food has improved quite a lot from before. Though I still believe the quantity could have been a little more  with respect to the price. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. 

What we had :  

Cheese corn balls.
Beer 
Shots
Cocktail. 

This place happens to be one of the most favourite places of mine and would visit again for sure.

Very slow service.. on top of that, they refused to take orders on which offers were applicable because of some system problem.. a restaurant/lounge not taking orders is the last thing expected... The lucrative offers are just a sham.. they won't give any offer but force you to order without any offers by giving an excuse of system failure!!
Very much dissatisfied!!
PS: If you people are going there because of the lucrative offers, then it's a bis No No!!!

Also, there was a rat in the ground floor area! üòïüò®

Xrong place is the right place to be in when you need to party or unwind.Located in the Sara those road this place attracts people of all age groups. As soon as you enter this place your spritis are automatically lifted up. With the wooden staircase and and wooden floors with barrels this place has a very irish pub feel to it. The service is a bit problematic sometimes but they take good care of their customers. The dry chilli chicken is quite tasty and has a tangy taste to it. The alcohols are a bit costly but the mocktail are very good. We tried the Virgin mojito and it was really good. A great place to unwind and relax.

This is one of the best pubs in South Kolkata. Upon entering the place you would know that you have come into an Irish pub. I love the wooden interiors with the narrow staircase leading to the first floor and the barrel situated near the big wooden door. I had gone there on my birthday which also happened to be a ladies night. I rather enjoyed myself amidst the good ambience,great music and good crowd. We clicked lots of pictures with the props available there. I didn't try any food here. Had lots of cocktails,it being Ladies Night ;). The alcohol content ws low in the cockatiels but that's understandable in free drinks :-P. The service wasn't slow and the drinks kept coming. Lovely place to hangout with your friends :-). Would go back surely,especially for the Karaoke night held here.

Nothing seems to go wrong with this place..!! This has always been my personal choice for catching up with old friends.. Good music, great ambience, a pool table on the ground floor, lip smacking foods, and lastly a good collection of hard drinks!! All of them come with a price that one may feel to be on the higher end, but once again not to forget; it's a lounge! N probably to me it's the best one can get in south Calcutta!

I first visited this place many years ago during the first pub quiz ever held in Calcutta and liked the ambiance. I went back again a few days ago to enjoy a nice evening with a couple of friends. It wasn't crowded as it was a weekday. The place is spacious with nice and comfortable sofas, classy wooden furniture and interesting decorations. Music was decent. We especially liked the ¬†Devils on Horseback (smoked bacon wrapped sausage). The fish steak and chicken shepherd's pie were also quite tasty.¬†
The draught beer by the boot was enjoyable and quirky in it's presentation. However, I'd prefer glass shot-glasses instead of the plastic ones for my tequila. Service was good but a faulty card reader is a bad excuse for such a place where pocket pinch per head can easily touch 4 digits.

We went for a friends reunion and ordered breezer for me as I am a tee-totalier, and sided by salt and pepper fish, pan fried chilly fish, pan fried paneer for my veggie friends. The food was good. I liked the fish and the taste. The salt and pepper was distinct in the fish. The ambience is great with good music and screen. For main course we order veg noodle and exotic veggies and I had grilled fish steak with veggies and sashed potato. I liked the steak but it was a bit overcooked although I loved the the quality of the fish. 
Ambience is great
Staff behaviour is great. Food is also very good. 

Over all, in a residential area to have a great pub was to find a diamond in the cold. 
Good for couples as they have sofas to have a good privacy.

Food is good, music is loud (which i like it) but they need to check on their music collections, ambiance is nice with specific smoking zone area that's adds a plus point to the place and service is smooth...
Well to conclude Beers with Chicken wings in BBQ sauce (last Saturday) made my day... Yay!!! Cheers... :)

"OK kind of a place" will be a decent way to describe. Come, gulp quick and get going. I'm possibly having a bias as I had a pretty poor experience over phone when I called up to enquire about whether it was open or not. If you've seen how sellers push sell during "sale"...that's exactly what these guys do. To make you come over, they'll take lame ways.

We ended up here quite by chance on the recommendation of the Uber driver (or Uber Dost in company speak!). It's on a pretty banged up street and looks a bit forlorn from the outside. Once inside however, it's a lot better. Split spatially into two levels with a sporty snooker table kind of set up at the bottom followed by a bar and seating area upstairs. It immediately reminds you of the Saturday or Tolly Club bars with updated look and feel but the same mix of all-day adda fans, the office worker bees, the odd performing artist and their posse, college students and of course the local 'para couple'. It's like India Coffee House crowd meets the Ballygunge bhadrolok and everyone's happily having a drink! Speaking of which, they are well priced (accounting no doubt for some of the popularity) and plentiful. The service was also pretty friendly and quick for the crowd size. Music was completely choppy (at one point the DJ inexplicably went silent midway in a number and made some random scratch attempts before starting the next one!) and largely a tired mix of nineties rock and roll (think Guns 'n Roses and oddly enough "Sweet Home Alabama"...seriously;). The DJ himself looked like he was on a Red Bull diet or something else from the amount of hyperkinetic changes to the rhythm and the pace of the music so at times it would get a bit awkward like your mom calling in middle of that heart skipping moment with your love! Notwithstanding the music, this place is a must go for that retro feeling of familiarity and friendliness without the soulless and fake vibes of mall bars. So stop by if you want to experience the right time for all the other wrong ones!

"Xrong" place to be

Visited this pub, owing to multiple recommendations by some friends. The liquor menu is expansive and attractive, but the ambience, which in my opinion separates one pub from the other (given that the liquor brands are homogeneous) is where this place falters.
The ambience isn't cool. I happen to be a teetotaller so i have the senses to notice the ambience, the food menu and the mocktails. This place has very limited options. We like the Super chicken nachos but the pub burger was not there. The other finger food items were mediocre. Also the range of mocktails is very limited and nothing extraordinary. Given the above feedback, it was overpriced. ¬†Visit if you want to be charged a bomb for something which you can enjoy for half the price..

Ambience-2/5
Service- 3/5
Taste-3/5
Value for money-2/5

How have I missed reviewing this one now! One of my favorite places to meet friends and grab a drink! 
Located on Sarat Bose road( opp to tolly tales), Xrong place has a cool vibe attached to it. Once you enter the place you know you have entered an Irish pub or tavern and that itself lifts your spirits! The wooden interiors, the large heavy door, the lights all add up to the concept of a tavern.
The loud music, seating arrangements and the crowd make for a complete place to unwind.
I have been here a lot of times and have tried Cajun potatoes, fried baskets, veg combo platters and the food is good with the Chinese based dishes and finger food being the best. 
The mocktail are nice too, I remember trying one apple based. Mojitos are good! 
The alcohol is a little expensive here. 
The service can be a little problematic at times but overall is good!

When in southern avenue and wanting to unwind, don't miss this one!

Went there with great expectations as I have heard about this place from many, but it was really disappointing experience that we had.
We four friends went there to Booze from Tower of Beer and we were also very excited as we entered the place, loud music were played and everything was good until the guy came to take order.
They have a huge menu showing a great collection that they have but don't be lured by that. That evening we asked for Drought beer, they didn't have that. We asked for Carlsburg, not even that. They said they don't have any other beer other then Kingfisher or Heniken.
One of my friend don't like Kingfisher and the other didn't like Heniken. And our entire excitement was down. At last we took a tower of Heniken to pass our evening.
Management authority if you don't have the items you mention why do you keep them on the menu.
Later I came to know from one of my friend that even he faced the same situation there when he went.

If anyday I wish to hangout with friends and have a chilling session,this place is the first to strike in my mind. The ambience is pretty shady (in a good way),the crowd is good,the service is prompt and the staffs are more importantly cordial. Whenever I go there to drink I ask for the complimentary snack bowl munchies and they happily refill and serve me innumerable times. People who want to visit it should visit this place on Thursday's. The place comes alive with unknown people being your friends and singing with you along during karaoke nights and cheering you. Plus if you are good,you are getting a free drink. Coming to the food,it's pretty average but good,you wouldn't complain about it. Also,it is fairly economical compared to what the other pubs serve in terms of food and beverage. All in all,Xrong place might not be too much hyped up in the city,but it definitely is a hidden gem for the youth in the city.

I had been here today with one of my friend to celebrate the Friendship day. The ambiance of this place is quite lively and cheering despite being quite dimly lit. The place is divided into two sections. Below section comprise of a pool table whereas the above section comprises of a bar, projector screen and a smoking room with a dj to play music. This place did give me a pub feel and i would surely recommend on people to try on this one. The music is quite loud and it‚Äôs a good place to party and just enjoy the time out. The a la carte is quite simple and soothing to the eyes.

It's an okayish place. Somehow the seats I get the two times I have been are right near the speakers so it's  pretty loud and conversations are difficult. 
All in all it's  pretty average. And most of the time they don't  have the beer I usually drink.  Can do better.

Another pub in southern avenue, easy to locate near deshapriya crossing only. Parking is even allowed here in this lane.

 As one enters there's a staircase in the front only. Wooden flooring with different sitting arrangement. A bar counter on the very front. They even have a pool table on the ground floor just beside the staircase. Wooden floor and that dark ambience gives it a different look. As thinking about others  they have maintained this rule what i liked was they have a separate smoking room.

Staffs their are not that responsible, i have been here so many times. It gets so packed on weekends with a lot of crowd. I love the way they serve beer, as in a boot, its something different. Everytime we visit this place so in a mood to drink so i have just tried their crispy american corn which was nice to have.
So when you just want to chill out with few pegs of drink just go for it. . .you'll definitely find it a perfect one for yourself.

They come up with great offers on drinks all tym and thats the usp. Ambiance is great for a sports bar. For couples upper floor seating is cosy and romantic. Price is on lower side considering the offers they run on drinks and all those combo offers that goes on. Food quantity could have been improved and service could have been fast!

I somewhat liked the place although it seemed overpraised and overpriced to me... Good place to have drinks and for a date... They have their own smoking zone inside the bar...

Waiters are helpful and management keeps an eye on them... They have their own valet parking...

Overall, a good place if you can afford to spend 500 rupees...

Loud music, dimly lit ambience, beer being served from preacher, young vibrant crowd and tasty appetizer ... these sum up the place. This is basically a sports lounge.. at the entrance, you'll get to see a pool table ! Live games are being screened on the wall mounted televisions. Food and drinks are moderately priced. Waiters are a tad sloppy , take above average time to place orders on table. However, the overall experience is fair enough !

Wish to experience an Irish countryside sitting in good old Kolkata? Well, Xrong place is the answer. Get everything alcoholic at cheap rates at the somewhat cluttered little sports bar. Enjoy in a laid back manner on the wooden seats or on high chairs near the 'well-equipped' bar. Better to have your tummies tucked before you go as they offer finger foods, the prices of which shoot towards the higher range. The beer menu looks attractive and reasonable (tower, pitcher, boot) and cocktails are marvellous too. The decor is simple yet elegant with wooden furnishings and a dimly lit ambience. What adds more to the fun is the music. From Elvis Presley to Drek, you can bang heads and tap your feet to all! The staff is extremely friendly, jovial and super prompt! Smokers can enjoy in a cozy smoking zone adjacent to the DJ box. If you're a game addict then no place can be better than this! With watching UEFA on the giant screen to poker, you can indulge in one pure Irish evening. Want happy hours and special discounts? Hop in as you don't want to miss the Xrong UEFA grandeur! Looking forward to more visits here! Untill then keep rocking..

I have been visiting this place since last 5 years or maybe more . Ambiance here is great and on most days you Will have to wait till you get a seat. Drinks here are averagely priced . Food is a bit too much on the expensive side . For example a burger will set you back by 250 plus taxes. A bit tooo much .. coming to the food their cigar rolls are great . So is their corn salt and pepper . Will surely keep on visiting but I could have been a regular if there we're price cuts on the food .

Talk about ambience and AMBIENCE alone! 
Tho' it's subjective. But. 
Those wooden decks and floors, everything is woody burst, those dim lights, the low buzz of people chattering, the reverberation of footfalls on wooden stairs. Tell me what else do you need to enjoy a drink ? 
Good company ? Yes. That's all. 
This bar just makes you picture those classic Irish countryside bars. Such warm feeling. 
And the lights. They broke the beverage bottles neat and put bulbs in there hanging them upside down. Real cool right ?
You really can't take nice pictures with them BTW. Not that it matters much. 
Coming to the real part, drinks are just fine. 
Say some Tequila shots, or cocktails. 
I didn't really order any solids here. So can't say much. Guess I'm gonna visit this place real soon and review for rest. 
You can really come here just for ambience, I tell you. :)

Nice place to chill with the closest of your friends. .they'll let you stay as long as you want! The interiors have soft lighting, wooden finish and is divided into 2 floors. .we were guided to the top floor. Coming to food, we ordered crispy konjee lamb, peri peri prawns and angels on horseback ( bacon wrapped cheese). The crispy konjee lamb was excellent. The covering was crunchy but at the same time it melted in my mouth as I ate it. The gravy was spicy and yummy! It was perfect. We order two more servings of the dish later on.
Peri peri prawns tasted good as well. .and as for bacon wrapped cheese, what's not to love about it!
So all of the dishes we tried were good..only downside being the fact that they come in small servings.
The drinks are a bit on the costlier side, so if you're planning to visit..visiting during happy hours would be a wise choice. However,even happy hours donot apply for all of the drinks on their menu and is limited to a selected few drinks only.
Chances of the bill being limited to just 1200 for 2 as mentioned here are slim. However, you will have a good time once you're in there.
P.s. Do check out their posters when you're there. There are some really funny, smartass posters!

Nice place to have a drink with friends. Not much of a sports bar, however two pool tables are available, and that adds up to the attraction of the place.

Wide range of alcohols and alcoholic beverages. Food is fine. Liked the BBQ wings, cheesy fries, chill garlic lamb, chicken skewers. The chicken casserole, chicken steak, roasted chicken, roasted lamb are good but the mash served is not up to the mark. It is not creamy enough. In fact the mash makes the shepherd's pie dull.

The decor is simple yet elegant. The ambience is good and the service is decent. The music is sometimes bit too loud for the space, but the choice of music is cool enough. Would recommend to visit on a live music day.

It's probably the cheapest among the posh bars in Calcutta. It offers some amazing happy hours when you can drink to your heart's content without thinking about the price. Also, they serve good sausages at least that's the best that you can expect from a bar and it has a good playlist.

This den is pretty easy to locate, its in one of the lanes of Deshapriya park opposite to Tolly Tales.
So on what grounds Xrong place is distinctive from other places?
Well it has an aura of its own, with the perfect ambience for boozing. Lights which can make you drool, GnR , Pink Floyd played along with it...with big giant screen for live screening of matches, sometimes if you get lucky you can get live DJ.
Best interior decor for a bar and then courteous staffs all along giving it a "hit the bar" kinda experience!
Coming to drinks they have almost entire variety.
Finger foods are quite tasty as well.
So if you wanna enjoy some quality booze time, with an awesome ambience and also you wanna shed bucks, buddy this is your place!

RATINGS : :
FOOD : 4/5
SERVICE : 3.5/5
AMBIENCE : 5/5
VFM : 4/5

***Try Mahou!
***you can also try out pool

Nothing wrong about this place certainly!
Been there a number of times. 
Located near the SBI, Deshapriya Park, this place, though not that spacious, is a stunner nonetheless. Absolutely great interiors with good loud music and charming decor. It has a pool table and a foosball table as well. Went during the IPL, it has a large screen for live screening of matches. 
What's more interesting is the 1 for 1 offer during the Happy Hours, valid on selected alcohol. The food is standard but that's what you'll expect from a pub. The bar serves good cocktails
Though it has two floors, we were made to sit upstairs which I thought was a bit too crowded. 
Apart from that, this place is a must visit for those frequent hangouts and booze nights.

This place is in Southern Avenue. Its a sports pub. Loud music playing in the background with pool table downstairs. Smoking zone on the other side and the entire place is with wooden furnitures. Me and my huge group of friends went there on 23rd December 2015. We were asked to sit upstairs. We were almost 12-14 people and they gave us a smaller couch to fit in. Whereas the other couches were empty. We asked them to shift but the poor management couldnt help us. We ordered 2 beer towers and they took almost 45mins to serve that. Management is poor. They dunno whats going on. They are clueless most of the time. We dint order any food but the beer was good. Ambience is good too. Just the management spoiled all the fun.

Never ceases to amaze, this place is a gift to Kolkata, for the happy-go-lucky. Head out with your loved one, or go in a group, whichever way, you would love this place. It's a blessing for people working till late, then looking to chill, as this place takes in the last orders, well around 11.15 to 11.30p.m; however, the closing times are just after 12a.m on any normal day. Ambience is that of a modern day pub, with the ground floor offering a pool table, a giant screen television for the sports enthusiasts and a well stocked bar. Beer fans can opt for the towers or pitchers or a good old pint, and recommended sides are Green Chilli Chicken and Chicken Nuggets.

As learnt from friends and family that this place has become a cool place to hang out and chill, and it indeed was. The bar is pretty well stocked, place comes alive during sports event they show on big screens. Good music but then again, like I find with many places in Kolkata, the services can definitely improve.

For the party lovers and the peeps, Xrong Place is definitely the right place to unwind with a beer or two, drink and dance and meet and greet. The Karaoke Nights are a steal and the guys are always putting up offers on drinks during weekdays and sports screenings. The place exudes a warm and cozy vibe of an Irish Bar, done up with wood and the music is mostly awesome. The sideys are way too less for a portion although I love the Chilli Chicken and the Caesar Salad here. One thing I hate about the place is the cramped smoking zone.¬†
Brownie points for a well stocked bar. They have never said 'not available' to me for any drink I have requested, ever! The guys are sometimes a little slack in terms of bringing the ordered food on time but overall, you are sure to have a good time.¬†

Drought beers are good here
Avoid Talli Tuesdays because the service really drops down.
A place to chill out after an hectic day .
P.s- karaoke nights are pretty popular here.
The big screen is a great crowd puller! You should come here on the match days :)

I used to be a regular at Xrong place during my college days. At that time this was an upscale bar and the only Irish pub with cozy wooden decor in the city. Prices have always been on the higher side but they make up with the good choice of music, great crowd and various offers on drinks through out the week.The food that they serve used to be better during the initial days and needs improvement. However that should not be much of a concern as mostly people come here to chill with a beer or two. The bar is well stocked and you get IMFLs as well as premium imported drinks. Probably one would enjoy it most during live match screening on their huge projector with live commentary. It gets packed during weekends and holidays so try to arrive early for a table of your choice. Also nowadays they usually dont allow stag groups and going in¬†couples might save you from disappointment

So it was my 2nd and maybe LAST visit to this place . The place was jam packed and the waiter could accomodate us on a very shabby and almost broken table.When we requested for a change , he was like this is all we have . I asked him , if eventually we could be shifted to a better table , He directly said "NO" with a lot of attitude. Totally totally hated it and i am never ever ever coming back if you have staff like these. DISAPPOINTED!

After roaming around for almost an hour near the Lake, we found ourselves in front of Xrong Place on an winter evening.. Went inside to relax for a bit and have a couple of drinks.. The cocktails were average.. Super nachos and Crispy fried sesame chicken were just ok. Nothing were worth the price. The music seemed to me absurdly loud. Overall it was not a nice experience.

We went on a Saturday evening to this place. Most of the drinks were not available. We had to have the regular ones. Coming to food, the chicken starters we tried were pretty ordinary. Basket of fries was good. Service was not impressive as well. Price was a bit on the higher side. Music was good, so was the ambiance.

Had heard a lot about this place and got the chance to visit the Xrong Place last evening. This place is situated in Southern Avenue nearby lake area. Nice place to hang out with friends. Though not a very big place decent enough. It's both ground floor & first floor. Big screen is there for any kind of live event games you can watch there. Ground floor you can do a private party also. The interiors were done in a classic bar with wood paneling which was really nice. It is a perfect getaway for a few quick drinks/Bite in South Kolkata which has limited Options. Now comes the food part. Food was good and nice blend of taste. Enjoyed it...

I liked the place. The food was good, though the presentation was ordinary. The ambiance was according to my taste - Decent people with decent music and decor.

But I'm never visiting the place again. 
Reason: I scanned the menu and ordered a beer tower pointing it to the gentleman waiting on me. The price was Rs. 700, however, when I was done and asked for the bill- the price was printed as Rs. 850. So, being a reasonable person I told the gentleman about it, and expected it to be resolved soon. Unlike my expectation, he brought the menu along and showed me that on a different page, a different beer (tower 2L - same as I had ordered) was priced at Rs. 850. Well, I tried to reason with him (I consider myself a reasonable person - Did I mention that before?), he won't budge, I requested him to get the manager. It turned out that the manager was equally stubborn and just won't accept their mistake that they might have forgotten to tell me about the Beer Tower options (It was just a matter of 150 INR, pretty sure it wasn't really a big deal to either them or me). Finally, I did pay the extra amount and let them know that they lost one customer forever.

Xrong place , which is by itself a landmark of deshpriya park area is located in the same street as the wall and opposite tolly tales. A couple of years back, this used to be our regular spot to booze, talk, listen to good music and relax, all the while, pay a decent amount for the same. I would've rated the place a 5 /5 back then.
However, over a period of time, that "worth the money" aspect has gone down a lot. The prices are high and "once upon a time" regulars like us had to shift to other places.
Another major negative point that happened over the period of time was that the music is being played unbelievably loud. Ppl go in groups there and would want to talk to each other too, which is impossible nowadays. 
Although these points are there, the fact remains that this is one f the best pubs of South Kolkata and they do have a gud collection of music, food , a snooker table, and a nice ambience. 
The crowds have increased a lot over the years and the seating capacity remains the same, forcing big groups like ours to shift to other places since we had to wait a lot on some occasions to get seats. 

Overall, the perfect place for two to 3 ppl to get together and booze and listen to good music. Add some gud offers to that list.

We went for a birth day party, its definitely a sports bar and pretty much enthusiastic during Cricket or Football matches. Food is very impressive so are the cocktails we boozed very much that day and had beer, wine,whiskey and cocktails. We stayed late till it closed. We were about 16 people and our bill was around 10K.Overall i liked the place and will be visiting more in packs during important matches.

Probably one of the best hang out place in Kolkata to booze up with your gang. The ambience, the decor, the crowd, the location and everything is so perfect that it will make you visit the place again and again. Live sports screening, the pool table and especially the foosball will attract you the most. Not a very pocket friendly place but yes there are happy hours!!! So just jump in there with your buddies.

A friend from Delhi was in town and we decided to meet up. Since Southern Avenue was the most nearest to both of us, we decided to meet up at Xrong Place, cause I had never tried it before and she well liked the name of the place. We reached the place at around 7.30 PM. The crowd was not that thick, so we got ourselves a nice little table on the 1st floor. From there we could also see the live screening of the T20I World Cup.

Since it was more of a talking aka adda session, we kept it light on the food side. We ordered the following

1. Basket of Potato Wedges
2. Fish & Chips.

And ordered a few beers. It took them ages to serve the food and replace the empty beer bottles. Sloppy I would say. Nonetheless, the food was good. The quantity was good, enough for two of us. The place played very good music, even with that we were able to continue our conversation, which ranged from one extreme to the other.¬†

When bored, we also tried our hand at the pool table and with foosball. The ambience was good. Overall, a great hang out place, if you just want to have a few beers and catch up on things.

I love how the ambience gives you the feel of an authentic Irish pub. My friends and I took a tequila sunrise and another cocktail (I don't remember the name tho) with a side of chilli baby corn and chicken, and they were pretty great. The prices are reasonable and the staff pleasant. Oh and there's a pool table if you're in the mood for it. It's okay even if you don't know how to play, there's an ace pool player there who's gonna teach you if you want. :D

Six people propelled menacingly to acquire the services of this popular Southern Avenue pub yesterday . It has beautiful wooden interiors, classy ambience that gives you an English feel and a nice bar. Xrong has a separate smoking area in the corner which is a welcome break to trigger the effect of all the booze. The giant screen right above the staircase is ideal for an exciting cricket match or an exhilarating Premier League clash. Another mode of recreation is the pool table on the ground floor. 
We ordered Green Chilli Chicken based on the recommendation of the staff and Crispy Chilli Babycorn to partner the draught tower and the shots and whisky pegs to follow. Among the cocktails, the Irish Trash Can was a disappointment while the Electric LIIT had a significant impact. I loved the presentation by the boot.
Xrong is a great place to relax and kill your stress with a group or with just your partner. With prompt service and such a wonderful set up, it could reach the pinnacle among all pubs of the city with a better availability of stuff. Surely coming back again.

This is an excellent hangout place where you can grab a bottle of beer or two and watch a football match with your buds. The interiors have been done up keeping in mind the sports bar ambience.. The staff is not very courteous and you generally find simple things like ice to be unavailable. All in all a nice place for your evening hangout.

Latest visit:
27th April 2016 (15:00-17:30)
Every time I visit this place, I'm somehow losing my urge to get back to this place. Today's visit was the most disappointing one. We took the wooden seats on the left side of the upper deck due to the unavailability of the cushioned seats on the extreme corner of the same side but very soon the seat was emptied and we asked the attendant to move us there but his prompt reply was "it's booked". But no one arrived till the time we left and while leaving we just saw another group of guys moving to that seat who were seated somewhere else for a very long time. I didn't find it reserved in any way. Maybe it's saved for their regular or known customers. Had the same issue in my previous visits as well but didn't bother much. 
The location or the seat doesn't really matter to me, but the way you host a customer, your behavior and tone does matter to me when I visit a proper place like this one. 

Previous visits:
They have got this amazing setup, the food is good and you mostly get all sorts of drinks. The happy hour is limited to a single brand of beer, couple of whiskeys and few other choices of liquor. Draught beer is listed on the menu with whole lot of variations but even after 5-6 visits of mine, I've never had the opportunity to find it available with them. 

Overall, it's a place which could've been a nice option but the service and availability of drinks really makes me give them a thumbs down.

Xrong place is a good place for chilling with friends after college or for birthday treats. The happy hour makes one go here, since beer is cheap compared to most other pubs of this category. The decor is quite pretty and has comfortable sofas where you can relax. Ladies Night is a bad time to go, since it becomes really crowded and loud.

Amongst the first few pubs of the city of joy, this place has always had a special mention in every pub-goer's heart. This place has been famous since the pre-facebook, pre-zomato days and yet has maintained the charm.
The place is a good for college crowd and has an ambience which any other place would envy. The food is okish. With the city's pub culture evolving, it is important for this pub to evolve as well as per the needs.

Pretty much mixed experience here. We were a big group of 10-11. There is variety in food, but they had very limited options for fish appetizers. Food was delicious, though it could have been served a bit faster. Happy with the drinks, but they charged us for more drinks than what we ordered and they were very adamant when we checked and told them to correct it. We didn't want to ruin the mood, so paid reluctantly but big groups beware and if possible, keep a count on your orders. Not much satisfied with the music choice for the night too. They played only Rihanna songs which was annoying for some parts. Below expectations!

When three girls had gone to a pub to celebrate a spinster party for one of them and they came out high and nothing untoward had happened there to make them feel uncomfortable, then one has to say it is a good pub. Happy hours were on and more over it was ladies' night; thus free shots and complimentary pegs flowed plenty. But I could go back there for having the devils on horseback alone, they were soo delicious.

So whereever u sit u get a view of the match. The service is equally good. There's a pool table in the middle if u want to try that out. 
Great ambience n great fun to drop in every time!

To keep it short and crisp its a very happening pub to spend an evening with my chuddy buddy Abhishek Panchali whom I am meeting after an year . The dim lit ambience, loud rock music and the wooden decor surely epitomises the feeling of how a sports bar should be . We had a lovely evening enjoying beer , whisky , some shots over a football match played on the giant screen (not properly maintained) .  The pub has two floors, the ground floor comprising of a pool table and fusball arena which is simply a mus,t for a sports pub. The service is pretty good and fast although I personally didn like attitude of some of the  waiters.  There is separate smoking room which is an added advantage.  

All in all its a nice pub to spend th e evening , will make sure to turn up again since they provide good offers and campaigns on drinks . 
Verdict : Recommended

Everytime I go to this pub, my heart lifts, not for the obvious alcohol consumption, but because it is an ideal pub to chill at with friends and even family. The food is fine, if not great - all I've ever had here are typical finger foods to go with your drink - pan fried fish, french fries and crispy chilli baby corns, which were standard but nothing out of this world. 

The d√©cor is lovely and reminds one of a typical Irish watering hole, complete with pool tables, tall bar stools and a smoking room and great music (yes, it is a big deal to me). The staff is amazing - friendly and warm. 

I suppose my favourite part about Xrong Place is that they have amazing offers going on all year round. I love their ladies night, which is a vodka lover's dream come true. And it's especially great for me because I'm not much of a vodka aficionado, I could easily stomach the drinks because they were well mixed and the vodka was not overpowering, it was just right. Their cocktails are amazing also. I will keep going back here again and again. I would however request them to keep a few options for non-vodka drinkers. 

The prices are a tad steep, but it's worth the money and I'm not complaining. 

In conclusion, good service, great drinks, brilliant ambiance. If you've not been there, know that you're missing out.

Xrong Place-After staying outside Calcutta for so many years when I asked my friend to suggest me a place for good draught beer/ambience/music-this is the place I was directed to.Now for the past 1.5 years I am a regular there everytime I visit Calcutta.
The play tables on the ground floor is a hit among the crowds,although I wished they have left some space for dance floor as the music tends to get really good and you feel like missing a space to groove.
From the cozy sofa corners to the round tables,from the draught beer and delectable food to the friendly waiters-it is a sure shot place to visit for pub hopping in Calcutta.

Oh how much I loved the interior I cannot explain with my words! The perfect place to booze and chat with your friends. The dim light ambiance and the rock band music added the perfect mood to the place. I never felt such great in any other places I visited in Kolkata.
We arrived there 15 mins to end of Happy hour, yet the staff took orders and included us to the happy hours deal. And trust me its the cheapest in such posh area of Southern avenue.
I would like to re-visit this place just for the interior, which I felt is too catchy to youngsters. However I didn't like the side dishes we ordered. They were not at all tasty and over priced compared to the quantity. Its only cheap and good for boozing, that too in happy hours. Otherwise, its a bit high prices, though I feel its worth for such a beautiful place.

An awesome place with good music and good food. If you are looking for a chill out zone with some good music, beer and friends this is the place to be. And it's easy on pocket too. Surely worth a visit!! :)

I have been here once and my experience was pretty good.
I like(not love) the decor.It is slightly cramped.
I just had beer and a chicken dish hence my rating is just based on the ambience and decor.
Also they play good music.

Decent place, Very good ambience, music is quite cheesy. 
You must expect a place like this to at least stock up on booze. No beer was available except Heineken. 
Service was quite poor given the place and the standard it tries to portray, moreover if you are running a pub you must get all the Star sports at least. 
Nice location, nice seating plan, all over expected a tad bit more given the price tag it carries.

I love this place, this is a great place to hangout with friends with a pint in your hand. As I like having beer in this kind of places, I can't say about other drinks. Beer collection is good, cost is fine, considering the environment it is totally acceptable. Music was good. and the food also.

Its a good place...  Nice ambience for some football games to watch... Only clubs they follow are in EPL..  So its a bit no-no for fans of other league's clubs..  But, 
Recently on 31st night I have been over there..  the food was not that good and bar menu wasn't perfectly organised... The dj played over there is really one of the worst dj i have ever seen even on 31st night there was no interaction or even no countdown from the dj . Its bit overpriced bar...  Not up to the mark on basis of the price....  I will prefers other lounge bars than this for the next time...

Visited this place on the 30th December 2015, the moment you step inside, it will give you the party feel ! Not that big a place, but the seating arrangement is pretty good. We were nine people in all, orderd a pitcher of beer, LIIT, Malibu, green chilli chicken, fish sticks, drums on horseback, fried rice, chilli chicken and lots of Coke. Everything tasted amazing! Plus the ambience is pretty good! A very good place :D

If I had to write a one line review I would just say that this place is really cool! It gives you a relaxed feeling. An apt place to catch up an EPL Fixture with your friends on the big screen. A little bit on the expensive side but can be indulged into once in a while. The platter of fish, chicken, prawns, egg was superb alongwith a beer tower! Will visit this place again very soon.

I've been to this about 3-4 times now. The only food items I've tried are the chicken wings and the crispy chili baby corn. Both were good, nothing extraordinary. What I really want to talk about is the alcohol. It might be one of the simplest drinks but I absolutely love their whisky sour. The LIIT is just about average. Going there on a ladies' night is a great idea. The people serving at the bar counter are an absolute delight. They are not only quick but extremely friendly even with the large crowd. Vodka based drinks including Cosmopolitans, Blue Lagoons, Screwdrivers etc are free. Please try the Blue Lagoon shots and the vodka with apple juice to kick start your night, ladies. Cheers!

Xrong Place!!!!! Such an amazing place. Went there yesterday with 3 of my friends. Yesterday being a Tuesday was Ladies Night that is free vodka cocktails, vodka shots and vodka syringes. We four wanted to start our drink with Cosmopolitan but it wasn't available so we went for Screwdriver which is basically Vodka with orange juice. Nice cocktail. But after that we had Blue Lagoon which is vodka with some juice and it was out of this world. The bartender was amazing and gave us 5-6 back to back blue lagoon shots. We also had chocolate vodka shots which was also very nice. Vodka with coke was good only nothing great. Then the bartender who is super duper awesome gave us vodka with apple juice. We told him to make the drink a little strong and he did accordingly. That cocktail was amaaaazzzing. We didn't order any food because well we went there to booze.
But regarding their food, it's a little pricey but the chicken wings are very nice. This food review is based on my 1st visit to this place.
A little not so great about this place is it's smoking zone which is really small and suffocating. You cannot even finish your smoke and your eyes will start to water. But overall it is a wonderful place to be and have drinks. The DJ was playing nice music as well.
But the bartender is the best.

Food is excellent but I was a bit disheartened with the service as it was slow sometimes. Smoking room is an excellent addition. Got to know some nice people. Overall a big thumbs up

Snacks were good, drinks were good, ambiance was quite nice, with appropriate lighting for a bar. There's seating at two levels - big screens in both, and a pool table too - so it's a complete package. We specifically chose this place as we wanted to watch a match that night. Crowd was nice as well. The person serving us was a little grumpy, and it took a lot of time processing our orders, or accommodating our requests for cleaning the table etc. - a little disappointed there. Overall, memorable experience.

One of my favourite places to hang out. Amazing ambiance , good crowd coupled with beer and a good variety of food preparations to choose from. I've been there quite a few times and would love to go back over and again. I don't clearly remember what we ordered but the preparations be it of chicken , fish or baby corn were all mouth watering. They also have a separate smoking zone and there's a DJ every evening . also they screen matches on a huge TV. One of the best places in the city to chill with your friends while enjoying beer. 

Happy eating. (And drinking) :P

I hung out with my friends here after work just once. This place is easy to find in the posh lanes of Southern Avenue. It was probably a Tuesday with free drinks for the ladies. So, a great treat of shots and cocktails are available for them on every Tuesday. ¬†The pub ,however, is too dark( Reading the menu will be a challenge ). The worst possible aspect about this restaurant is the service. There was just one guy serving the entire first floor. It took almost 30 minutes for us to get a basket of french fries. But the quantity was substantial.¬†

Most of their happy hours' offers aren't applicable on the drinks. They only apply to the pints of beer. The DJ, however, is very cordial and accepts requests very politely.¬†They have live sports screening which is definitely a plus point.¬†All in all, a very average experience. They really need to work on the ambiance and the service.

Was once regular to Xrong Place. Miss it big time. Xrong Place is The Right Place in all senses. One of the best pub in the city. Best of memories attached to this place. matches used to be fun in here. The music is lill loud but who cares wen you get good food and booze. One should try avoid sitting downstairs as otherwise you have to yell for your order. Mostly college crown in here but descent one. Are you guys planning for any live show @XP, coz I missed out onto some. Keep me updated. :)

Lastly, would conclude mentioning the amazing draught beer, which definitely owes a praise.

Wanna enjoy matchdays with booze and food alongside friends then this gotta be your place. Located at just beside the Wall Restaurant at Sarat Banerjee Road its very easy to find out. I went alongside 3 friends of mine on matchday and didnt find it difficult to find a place to sit and enjoy. The first floor has a pool facility and is being reserved for ISL screening. For BPL they are showing it on a giant screen. The quality of screening is pretty poor with very low quality of viewing on offer.Music is too loud to our liking.Management should take a look into this. Commentary is must in these cases.
Coming to food and booze we ordered for Basket of fries (‚Çπ195), konjee crispy lamb (‚Çπ375), 4 pegs of Blenders Pride (‚Çπ125),draught by glass beer (‚Çπ130), virgin mojito (‚Çπ160) and one soft drinks (‚Çπ75). Alongwith taxes the final value stood at ‚Çπ1879 for 4. The quality of the konjee lamb was very good,basket of fries comprised of poppers, finger fries and was kinda ok. The staffs are polite, courteous and prompt in service. 
Note:Hard Drinks are all served at 30 ml portions.

It's actually the wrong place at the first experience. A friend of mine suggested that this was a great place and hence we went. My friend had a waking stick as he was recovering from a leg injury. First of all they sent us to the first floor because there was no un-reserved places on the ground floor. The people on the first floor told that there are no un-reserved places on the second floor too. Therefore we again came back. For me it's no big deal running up and down, but with a person with an injury which is pretty visible, things could have been better. But okay, I am not judging with this incident, as it would be unfair.

We sat on the stools on ground floor. The problem was that we asked the menu 5 times and no one gave it. We timed it, it took 10 mins to get the menu. Sixth time after letting them know that we are waiting pretty long for the menu, they came with one. The condition of the restaurant then was almost empty with most of the seat pre-reserved, and most of the servers were running around and doing something. But okay, not judging with this incident too, this would also be unfair, some delay in giving a menu may occur due to misunderstanding.

Next we ordered some drinks and later a table became empty and we shifted to there. I have noticed small cockroaches on the tables (though I noticed them in a few other restaurants too). Next it was very difficult to place the order, I mean truly difficult. No one would listen. We somehow stopped a server and placed two starters and some more beverages. One starter came after a very long time and the portion was not that big so we finished it soon, and was waiting for another one to come. Meanwhile a lot of time passed, then the beverages came. The next starter was yet to come. The communication with the servers was difficult as it was difficult to get a person to stand and listen to what we say.

After this we decided that we should move to another place to get some food. Therefore we asked for the bill. After sometime the second starter was given we finished it quick, paid the bill and went to the Steak Factory and had some hot and good food.

The problem was overall, or that day was bad for them and us. There were plenty of servers on the floor and the floor was not at all packed. I am not sure what they were doing, but surely there was a huge mismanagement that day.

I have given a 2.0 rating because the overall experience crossed my threshold even after I tried to look at the bright side or give benefit of doubts to the restaurant.

In my opinion this is not actually a sports bar. On the other hand, the pub culture is new to Kolkata, compared to the different places in India. So, taking all the experiences together I will tell that, I will visit Xrong place again and give another chance and possibly update this rating and review. But, I am very sorry to say, that day was truly a bad one.

And please remove the foosball table, people do not play foosball as it should be played, they just rotate and push-pull all handle bars together with brute-force and randomly and make a lot of sound.

I came to Xrong place a couple of days back with some of my colleagues. Well it's not really a proper sports bar irrespective of the fact that they have jerseys of football clubs. The foosball table and pool table are enjoyable though. It felt annoying to yell for service because we were seated downstairs.  They should really recruit more staff. Food and drinks are fine otherwise.

Had heard a lot of this place and was quite impressed after entering the place for the first time seeing the available game options alongside lighting arrangements. Though was a little let down with seating arrangements for them being uncomfortable adding to a disappointing culinary experience. The only up was the prompt service, available game options like pool and foosball table and good music.

It was my first visit to this place during Puja this year. Great ambience. The music and dim lights totally set the mood just as you enter! There is also a big screen ...something all sports lovers can look forward to. There is a pool table on the ground floor. Also, there is a separate smoking room. I had ordered LIIT which was pretty good! A bit expensive during festive season(I was prepared for that though :p) . I have plans to drop in next time on a Ladies' night! :D

I went to Xrong Place yesterday. The moment we stepped in, it was quite apparent that it was a pretty classy pub. The ground floor has a pool table, and the pretty well stocked bar is on the first. There's also a giant screen television that shows football matches. The dim lighting and upbeat music totally gets you into a clubbing mood :P The crowd is pretty good. There's a separate smoking zone too. Our group had ordered a tower of draught beer. Apart from this, being a ladies' night, we got cocktails and shots on the house, which were pretty good. The seating was comfortable too. No complaints about the service either. Next time I step in I shall sample the finger food as well!

I like this place.. Been there 4-5 times.. Very neat clean & upto my expectations. Ambience is very good serving in 2 floors. Their hanging lights are made of real empty spirit bottles.. Love those.. Has a giant screen, so best on a match day! Total set up is woody and nice rock pub type music. Moderately priced but service is little sloppy.. Never mind that.. Worth going there!! Cheers!!

First the location is quite simple and easy to find. Entering this place gave me a feeling that its awesome too comfortable. Loved the ambience but the music can be too loud and annoying (atleast to me) sometimes. Its a pub so they have all kind of drinks. Im not a beer person but only take wine. So had indian wine which was 395rs a glass n imported was around 400+. They have two floors,the place had dim light which mks it more comfy. Its a great plc to chill wd frnds. They hv free wifi but for that u need the manager to b present who wasnt there that was a dissapointment üòè overall try the beer tower whoever loves beer üòä

I came here with a few of my friends for the karaoke night. Couldn't stay back much longer. All we had was a round of beer and crispy chilli babycorn. So I can't really talk about the food. 
Xrong Place is the hottest new bar in Kolkata especially among the youth. They even have an EPL combo for weekend games. Definitely a place I'd come back to.

What a place !!!! Loved everything about it .... This is by far the best pub I have visited till date. The ambience decor music everything made the place a must visit for the pub lovers including the smoking room which needs special mention. Prices are a bit on the higher range esp during pujo times but the quality of the food won't disappoint you. We had ordered grilled fish in lemon sauce , chicken steak with smashed potatoes , xrong special hot garlic mushroom n xrong special cocktail n all of them were mouth watering .I simply loved this quote inscribed on one of its walls - " the best thing about music is that if it hits u , u won't feel the pain".

I visited Xrong Place recently and was rather disappointed. 
The decor is interesting but the entire experience is ruined by the deplorable service.
I visited the place in the afternoon, probably was the first customer of the day, and hence the waiters and servers were busy doing their own thing like playing pool among themselves, instead of catering to our needs. 
The food and drinks here is nothing special and rather expensive. The portion size and quantity is also very less for the price.
Another thing which was bothering us was the extremely loud music. While music is always welcome, but at such high volume it becomes just an irritating noise. Since we were the only customers there, I don't see the point in such ear drum hurting sound levels.
I hope the management takes step towards improvement.

This is probably one place in Kolkata which gives you the true local watering hole experience. It's got great music (if you are  a fan of the classics), an amazing cocktail called Irish Trashcan which you can't get enough of and decent food. The service is sometimes a bit erratic which is the only negative. But all in all, it's a place you can frequent in Kolkata.

Situated in one of the most perfect location its a perfect place to hang out with friends and have a good time...I personally loved the wood finish the seating area which was divided into two different levels,
Live screeing, chilled beverages what else you need, so starting from the drinks they are generously priced, happy hours are the thumbs up they provide corona at the most reasonable price,
Now as am a veggie we orderd spring rolls and babycorn which wer upto the mark....staff members wer good...so its a good to go place and would be loved by college going people :)

Heard about this place a lot. So I went on last Thursday with couple of my friends. That 2.5 is for the ambience though the music was little loud at 7.30 in the evening, but managed with it...
Here comes the nightmare, we ordered 01 tower of draught beer, 01 cajun spiced chicken and 01 juicy chicken burger.
As U removed the ice container the beer wasn't 2ltr as per the measure, around 300ml of beer was less, the f&b associate replied me that when the froth will go down it will come down to the accurate measure.
Now the nightmare came, oh sorry cajun spiced chicken... was served in a side plate, 5pcs, and for sure it was chicken tikka, we complained, the associate apologized and promised to get us some complementary, though he doesn't remember till the time we left... good place with bad food and average service efficiency, will go there next time sure but they need to impove...

Perfect place to go for drinks when you are with friends. The LIIT pitcher is the main catch. Probably the only place in the city which has the three types of the evergreen cocktail (LIIT). Decent snacks. Chilly babycorn and chilli fried potatoes were good. Service is the area where the pub needs some improvement. Though that's not really a turn off. Its the best place to go for drinks in Kolkata.

Apart from the said, this place promises to disappoint you. 
Thursdays are Karaoke night, which supposedly begins at 7 PM.  We were there until 9 30 PM, and there wasn't even any set up ready for the same. To top it all, the DJ was really disappointing. 

P.S. The food is just about okay (if you're planning to order things other than finger food).

The place is suitable for regular drinkers and party goers. For a vegetarian and a not -so -regular drinkers the main attraction in happy hours of any place would be its food. So we ordered nachos and mushroom pepper salt for trial. I found the food very average. Live music and live screening adds up the glam. But not my kind of place so except for a party or live sport screening, i would not visit again. Food needs improvement.

I went to this place few days ago on a Sunday with my friends. The restaurant is situated just in the opposite lane of Marcopolo restaurant.

The decor and the ambiance of the restaurant was really great. It has got 2 floors with 
small little smoking room. there were comfortable couches and high chairs. In the ground floor, there was a pool table too.

The food and the drinks were great ,really delicious. However the prices are bit on the higher side.

Cocktails Ordered : 

1. Mijitos
2. Screw Drivers

Food Ordered :

1. Cheese cherry pineapple
2. Dry Chilli Chicken
3. Pan Fried Fish

Overall bill amount was Rs.2450/- for 3 persons.

I would highly recommend this place for a visit to have drinks with good music.

Strangely, I have mixed review about this place on a single visit!! 
The place was completely empty when we went there.. never seen a pub so empty for 2 hours.. so, that "pub-like" feeling was missing initially.. bt later gradually started loving this place.. the music slowly grew louder and perfect.. we orderd for one Irish trash can and one long island iced tea which came in awesome looking big boot-shaped glasses.. we also had one plate of fish n fries.. and then  chicken steak (since pork chops were unavailable, sadly).. food is good here. . just felt that the quantity of food is too less according to the huge prices.. both the drinks tasted heavenly though!
So, sipping the magical drink with the company of a perfect person,  loud music and dimly lit beautiful ambience.. I had a lovely time at xrong place..

Nothing can beat the combination of drinks, friends and most importantly cricket. So before reviewing Xrong Place let me tell you that the best time to visit is during a high intensity cricket match. A really very big screen put up that can be seen from any part of the place. Equally good for soccer fanatics as well during the EPL encounters.
Food and drinks wise is good, so is the service and place.
Really worth going more than once

Went there on a Monday. Only 2 tables had guests, two were empty and all other had the sign "Reserved". The happy hour is till 7pm but was useless as they have 1:1 mostly on super premium drinks like Corona Beer. The menu is big but the items available were only 15-20% of what menu displayed.

Waiters are very few and full of attitude.

Did not like it. Would not try again.

Today we realized that they billed us wrong. We ordered one Mozhito and Strong LIIT which was priced 160 and 395 on Menu. But we were billed 235 and 600 for the same without tax.

They should name this place wrong place rather... when I entered the place, I got a weird smell, the smell dat you get when stand by accident behind a someone in local train who probably use alot of hair oil and didn't had a shower for long.. then when I entered the ground floor, I asked a service guy where is the washroom, he ignored me and continued playing around with the pool, and the smell became stronger when we sat down like it was some kind of an axe from hell... it was so appalling dat thot of not ordering any food, then came the service, I ordered mojito and my Frnd ordered a burger, the service guy was acting as if we have caught him off guard, he asked him for the password of the WiFi, he he said internet balanace nahi hain, what kind of place you are running, I got unlimited internet in my home, and why can't you guy have the same. Then came the food and the drink, mojito was like Esplanade lemon soda with some rum in it, it was not mixed properley, lemon seeds were everywhere, thr whole cocktail was as good as harpic. And the burger my Frnd said if we had gone down MC D and spend the half the money he spend over hereÔºåhe would have recieved lot better burger, and thank god we left and have no plans to come down over here in future. Only good thing which made me give this place a 1.5 is the music, to be specific the choice of music and mix, and sound quality, like we were sitting right next to the speaker and still didn't bother us that much, and next best thing was the seats really comfy, and last thing that most people will like is a smoking room and that is well appreciated... and oh yeah forget to mention one last thing, I asked for a draught beer, he said draught beer is available not in happy hours but in vintage hours, if that's the case then it's better I got to the streets in park hotel, it's cheaper and it's available all the time....

1 hour after the order we get a dish of sad corn fritters that are cold and greased. Still waiting for the rest of our order. Abysmally poor service. Cherry on the cake is that there's no complementary food with the drinks. Alcohol and no food makes Jack a Bhand Boy (not in a good way)

I have visited this place many a time and always wanted to write a review so here it goes. What I love about this place is the all wood ambience from the entrance to its every corner. Perfect for a pub. The food is nice specially the bacon wrapped cheese and sausage. Although, you would probably want the food on the table quicker. The drinks are well priced. But off late I feel the up keeping of the place has taken a beating. There is a scope for improvement here.

They should name this place wrong place rather... when I entered the place, I got a weird smell, the smell dat you get when stand by accident behind a someone in local train who probably use alot of hair oil and didn't had a shower for long.. then when I entered the ground floor, I asked a service guy where is the washroom, he ignored me and continued playing around with the pool, and the smell became stronger when we sat down like it was some kind of an axe from hell... it was so appalling dat thot of not ordering any food, then came the service, I ordered mojito and my Frnd ordered a burger, the service guy was acting as if we have caught him off guard, he asked him for the password of the WiFi, he he said internet balanace nahi hain, what kind of place you are running, I got unlimited internet in my home, and why can't you guy have the same. Then came the food and the drink, mojito was like Esplanade lemon soda with some rum in it, it was not mixed properley, lemon seeds were everywhere, thr whole cocktail was as good as harpic. And the burger my Frnd said if we had gone down MC D and spend the half the money he spend over hereÔºåhe would have recieved lot better burger, and thank god we left and have no plans to come down over here in future. Only good thing which made me give this place a 1.5 is the music, to be specific the choice of music and mix, and sound quality, like we were sitting right next to the speaker and still didn't bother us that much, and next best thing was the seats really comfy, and last thing that most people will like is a smoking room and that is well appreciated... and oh yeah forget to mention one last thing, I asked for a draught beer, he said draught beer is available not in happy hours but in vintage hours, if that's the case then it's better I got to the streets in park hotel, it's cheaper and it's available all the time....

Good ambience and music but a few cons. When we went it was too crowded. A few tables were empty but dirty. We requested for them to be cleaned but no one bothered. Also, the bar table was messy. 
But the pool table and foosball tables were cool! 
Good food and drinks make this place a nice evening hangout place.

A good place to hang out with your friends. The number of times i have been there my experience was good. Averagely priced drinks & food, i liked their preparation of pan fried chilli fish. The music they play is good & the ambience is also good. Great place to visit during weekends.

1 hour after the order we get a dish of sad corn fritters that are cold and greased. Still waiting for the rest of our order. Abysmally poor service. Cherry on the cake is that there's no complementary food with the drinks. Alcohol and no food makes Jack a Bhand Boy (not in a good way)

I have visited this place many a time and always wanted to write a review so here it goes. What I love about this place is the all wood ambience from the entrance to its every corner. Perfect for a pub. The food is nice specially the bacon wrapped cheese and sausage. Although, you would probably want the food on the table quicker. The drinks are well priced. But off late I feel the up keeping of the place has taken a beating. There is a scope for improvement here.

Turned up at this place for a short span of time, around 8 in the evening. As soon as you enter you will be greeted by the pool table and the huge screens broadcasting matches LIVE. The place is nice and spacious inside. Staffs are attentive. The place though lacks that "get into the mood" vibe and energy. Crowd was boring. The playlist needs to be updated. The man at the console turned down my song request too. Breezers were not available and that was not at all acceptable. The food, actually impressed me. They serve good starters and the prices are kinda reasonable. The service is prompt as well.

It was a horrible experience for me. I'm a medical student studying in Karnataka and decided to check this place out during my vacations and boy was that a mistake. First of all the waiter told us Bacardi rum was 1 plus 1 during happy hours but after billing he said sorry and that it wasn't: so we ended up paying double. The head waiter came and misbehaved for no reason when we were perfectly nice to him. Overall the management was terrible and derogatory and condescending towards its customers. I'm not going there ever anymore. Maybe the concept of pubs is new to kolkata but I've been to one of the bests in he world and that's not how you run one.

This is a place that is very close to my residence. I went there recently with my friends for a Friday night party. Good ambience and good starters. We had ordered quite a lot of veg and non-veg starters and they were all good. The waiters and staff are courteous.
But the best part of this place for me, was the music, as it was just the kind I like, albeit a little too loud. But I don't mind it when the selection was good!!! 

A good place to visit...

After i wrote the review below... i visited again.. this time to find that the menu has been completely overhauled with lots of perfect vegetarian options.... glad these people listen.... absolutely awesome place for all!!
¬†
The earlier review:Absolutely fabulous experience! I would never have known about this but for Zomato where it is rightly rated very high. U must visit this place and u wont even believe that its right here in Kolkata! Very irish interiors in all wood... full of class.... happening place.... excellent service and the right ambience that sets the mood....it really is different from all the other night clubs in Kolkata... feel like going there every week. Just a few suggestions to the management if ur reading:
- do include some bollywood tracks in ur playlists
- you have practically nothing to eat for vegetarians! its funny...
- no mocktails at all... i know its a pub but there are non drinkers too who visit...
- u can increase the prices a little and get better crowd... dont worry.... u'll still be worth it and full of customers...

I was introduced to one hell of management in here. I would strongly recommend you all to not go to this place when they have screening of matches. When we placed an order of 3 pints, they told that please pay first then order (because of rush). Also we had ordered some starters. It was an half an hour wait before we could get them. I made a card payment, so when I asked for bill they said and I quote "Due to EPL matches opening we wont give you bill". I was shocked!!Now after hearing this, the amount that I had paid was looking ambiguous to me because they asked me some random amount of bucks and I had paid.

¬† ¬† When I asked now to show me their menu, they were unwilling. Later after like 15 mins of quarrelling I found out that they had charged for one of the starters in double quantity!! I had not expected this from a place that had a 3.9 rating in zomato!! Our evening was already ruined by that time.We got out anyhow!

Not a great pub. Have visited twice. The seating is awkward, the crowd dull and the service mediocre. They take ages to serve. The only reason the place sees so much footfall is because of lack of options in the area. Would recommend Someplace Else or The Irish house over this any day.

A good place for hang out with friends. Today I went to that place with my best buddies. Though there was a limited option for happy hours offer, but there were day wise various offers. So you may have a surprise offer there. But there should be a wifi access for the customers. It's a basic need nowadays.

situated near deshapriya park, this is a pub which fetches good crowd, serves awesome food, has a good collection of drinks and is not-so-overpriced. had been there a couple of times, the last being this thursday. had to wait for 10minutes. however, this is normal for xrong place, being situated in a busy place like deshapriya park. 
we had a couple of draught beer towers and both were served chilled. however, they ran out of stock after that and we had to settle for kingfisher tower later. the roasted lamb steak and chicken steak were perfectly cooked. 
the crowd was decent, music was at the perfect volume and the giant screen played ashes. so full marks for the ambience. the service was prompt too. there is a smoking zone also.
well definitely a thumbs up for me.

In Kolkata, you do not see too many places with good music, food and alcohol. Either they are extremely expensive or they are pretty cheap to visit, however this is one place which comes in the mid range. Decent place with decent crowd and pricing is pretty legit as well.Food is delicious, falling within the range of Rs. 200 - Rs. 300 which is pretty affordable if you are planning to visit on a Saturday night. Try the chicken sausages, very delicious :) (I intend to try pork chops the next time I turn up)The next bit is the crowd, decent set of people visits the place, and if you are a football maniac, this is one place which hosts the EPL screenings, so another reason to make a quick visitLastly, on the price, well pretty affordable, lets say 1200 for 2 on a Saturday night, is not bad eh !! :)Happy Munchin :)

It should be called the wrong place instead.
They dont have half the things listed in their menu.. Nor do they have half the liquor you expect to get in any pub. They Stop the music in between.. Ambience is okayish at best.. The games (foosball and stuff) do not have adequate infra.. Totally not worth your time.

I am rating it 1 because I can't put a lesser number.. Doesn't even deserve negatives.

Food -100/5
Ambience -7/5
Liquor -4/5
Others -300/5

Have been to Xrong Place many many times and have some pretty good memories as well. I was there yesterday to enjoy a Man Utd match and kick start the Premier League in style. The experience was not like the previous occasions. The giant screen where we have watched so many matches while relaxing on the beers was not working. This was dissapointing. You organise a sports bar where you do not have your infrastructure ready is not acceptable by any means. On ordering some beers and snacks, we were told to pay everything by cash up front then and there as it was a "busy day" according to them. Well, I understand it was a busy day as it was a matchday of Premier League and football fans were rooting for their team. But if you realise the " busy day" as well, why did you not make sure that the giant screen works. This is not a way to welcome your guests. The offers on burgers and bla bla are secondary when people want to relax with their friends and enjoy some football.
Yesterday's evening was certainly not up to the mark considering the standards you have put up.

I am taking down the rating from 4 to 1 because of the incidents which happend last time. It was a random visit. 2 of us went in there at first. Slowly as the evening passed by the few more guys joined us gradually. As a result we had to switch tables few times. The orders also kept on increasing. One of guy showed some irritation and back bitched with a lady(owner) when we switched tables which I noticed. I didn't give much to that so that we don't get our evening spoilt. Now comes the bill which was a hugely morphed one. It took barely a second to figure out what was wrong.
Same was pointed to them, which brought out their true colours. They thought we were down and out and would not notice the bill that much. We had full on argument with the staff. The amount they charged wasn't mentioned in the menu too still they kept on going with a bad tone. I have been there n nunber times but never faced such kind of stuff neither expected this. I got so frustrated that I said this is the last time i step foot here. To that they said they dont care. I had recommended this place to several people in the past. But now i will do my best to promote the opposite. So much bad happened that I cant list all out here. They dont realise the power of social media I think. They should look what happened to Backstage due to one incident.
All the best to owners. For others there are several options in the city so it wont be our concern.

An awsome place to grab a drink and spend some quality time with your friends. Went here on friendships day and my god, the ambience was worth a watch. From projecting live match, to pool, to hard core party music, everything was very lively and freshning. Baked fish in honey mustard sauce is something which you should definitely try for. Just felt that the quality of service is bit on a slower side.

If you have lots and lots of leisure time, this is surely a place to hit. The place is like a wormhole. The moment I opened the door, Nirvana hit me. The music, the ambiance of this place is something to cherish, other than its jaw dropping collection of alcohol and cocktails and pubbetizers.

The wooden floor, the green neon, the yellow light hanging from the ceiling on top of every table will make you wonder if you are still in Kolkata.

The draught beer (2ltrs tower) is hard to fathom but smooth as a criminal (Again the DJs are awesome, I loved each and every track they played). They have foosball table, a pool table (oddly placed) and some lovely couch.
After the beer session we had Long Island Iced tea, it should have been a bit punchy. And then we got down on to food. They didn't had pork, so we chose Chicken Steak, some lamb dish, Pile High Burger, Angels on horseback, demons on horseback and some French Fries.

We finished with Corona. :P

Service: Well I mentioned "if you have plenty of time" for a reason. It was slow, worse than a turtle. 7 Long Island Iced tea took nearly 30-45 minutes.

Still, a good pub. Loved the Irish feeling, and the homely ambiance.

I went there the other day with four friends and the experience was not at all good to say the least. Pub was almost full due to which we had to settle for a small table in a corner on the lower level. The chairs were very uncomfortable and had no footrest. The music was too loud due to which we literally had to shout to call the servers everytime we needed to order something. The servers were polite but seemed disinterested. The finger foods were too overpriced compared to the quantity. We noticed some guests leaving and asked a server if we could switch to their table to which he said that it was 'reserved'. I've never seen a table being reserved in a pub. Anyway, two of us went to the upper level to see if we could find an empty table. I found one and asked my friends to come up. As soon as I sat down, a server came and told me that that table was reserved as well. Another server pointed us out to another empty table in a corner. We went and sat there and the previous server came to us and said that it was reserved too. Really?! My friend told him that go and take it up with the server who let us sit here. We could see the two of them arguing over it. Finally, he came and gave us 'permission' to sit at that table. We had a few drinks and left soon after. All this in a span of 3 hours. Xrong place is the wrong place to go with friends to have a good time. I'm never going again.¬†

P.S. To the Xrong place staff - Change 'seating available' to 'seating only available upon reservation'

Technically my second visit to this trendy pub of South Kolkata, as the 1st visit was not enough for a review. Located pretty conveniently in southern aveneu, this pub has been a recommendation of quite a few fellow foodie friends. 

Ambiance - Wooden floors and walls, very cool lighting (especially the green neons) and a sparkling bar counter provides a lovely ambiance to booze. However the music is too loud and sadly I absolutely dint liked the DJ. Barring a few 70s numbers, the mixing was pretty amateurish. A bit of a mood killer.

Food - We were mostly in for booze so finger foods were the automatic choice for foods. We ordered

1. Crispy Conjee Lamb - Fantastic preparation. Pan fried lightly battered julienned lamb strips with capsicum ,onions and bell peppers with a hint of lemon grass in a mild spicy saucy base..Absolutely loved it.

2. Green Chilli Chicken - Chilli Chicken cooked in green chilli paste. I can take the hotness of chillis to a good extent , hence fared decently to me but my peeps were all looking for water after having it. 

3. Irish Trash Can - Loved the way they presented it..in a glass boot. Technically not a food, a cocktail i dint liked the taste of the over usgae of Peach Schnapps and Blue Curacao. My friend poured some extra water to reduce the sourness of it. 

They have an elaborate collection of Hard drinks, 2 of my friends settled for Draught Beer Towers , the girlfriend opted for her favorites, Heiniken while the brother got happy with Carlsberg while I made merry with 2 pegs of Ballantines Finest and JW Red Label respectively.

Service - There is area of improvement. Though the waiters are polite nd courteous, but somehow they all seemed lost whenever we tried to order anything. And also the loud music was a hindrance because they couldn't even listen to us when we were calling. They made mistake in the billing as well.

Note - Though its written in Zomato that it has wifi, they say otherwise.

Overall, though enjoyed the evening but the entire experience was not that pleasing.

Pics to be uploaded soon.

I would like to start my review with a popular song line, I guess you all  heard it atleast once - "I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell"
Well in the end it was not a hell however not as good as heaven..
Ambience was pretty good rather more than good, same goes with the hospitality from the waiters however music was too loud and not catchy like other pubs (example: Irish Pub).
We had crispy lamb and chicken along with drought beers,few pegs of whiskey amd pint beers. Taste of the food was not that good as much the price, however in terms of drinks its just got reversed. 
Conclusion is it is a one time go in a quarter and if you go with your friends, I'm sure you'll enjoy a lot like we did. :)

I liked the decor...like an English pub. The lights are pretty well done. The music went well with the ambience.
Food is really good to taste..my rating for food alone would be 4.5/5. A particular mention for the washrooms...well maintained.
But there are a few issues....many of the items in the food menu are actually not available which I think is something to be looked into. One or two items might not be available but when when a whole lot of items are not served, then what's the point of having them in the menu in the first place. Secondly...I think the service can be a little better. Even considering the fact that we were there during the early happy hours, on a rainy weekday (when reflexes might be down a bit).....yet prompt service and a warm welcoming attitude goes a long way in making a customer happy. I am not saying that the service providers were rude....but I felt a bit of reluctance, on their part, to serve.
I guess these are the two small niggles the management needs to look into..otherwise it was quite an enjoyable experience with friends and I would suggest this place to others.

Been there with friends. There were four of us at first and our other friends were supposed to come later.
We reached at around 6:40( happy hours still on).
We ordered 8 beer bottles(for the other people who were supposed to come in as well) which the waiter refused to serve.
So we settled in for four bottles.
It came as a shock when the waiter said we have to finish our bottles within 7:15 which is practically impossible. So I told him to show me the rules on paper which he failed to produce
I got into a verbal altercation with that person.
It's very disappointing that a reputed place like this has employees who lack minimum decency and the manners to treat guests.
They should recruit employees with better social and hospitality skills or else will have to settle in for further reviews like this.

Regularly visiting this place since it's opening and was never disappointed. 
I like to have few beer pints along with a game of pool which , to me, is refreshing after the week's work. The ambience is good and the in house DJ is energetic. 

They might not allow people wearing sandals or uncovered shoes as it falls under basic clubbing rule.

Ps: The potato chips that they serve with the drinks are good.

Well this review comes a week late ,as I thought of adding some depth to it. This comes from an old timer who used to be a regular till about 1.5 years ago, after which I relocated due to professional commitments.

Reading the recent reviews here in "popular" section, it seemed that all is well with this place and therefore I did not think twice before stepping in with 2 friends from a different city, as it is near to my place. Thereafter, to cut a long story short, let me just say that the place has deteriorated into a disaster.

You want details?

Firstly all the empty tables are apparently "reserved" and we were shooed off the moment we sat down in one by a lady, who seemed to be in charge of the place. After being allocated a table for 2 after being hastily converted to 3 via the addition of an uncomfortable high chair, which I used, to save face in front of friends, who after all are outsiders. Then the waiters took forever to bring the menu and after a lot of effort reappeared to take the order. NONE of the offers mentioned in Zomato or their FB page were available due to being out of stock....makes me wonder if this is merely a gimmick to attract the crowd.

Fed up, we settled for whatever was available and after a 2 rounds of drinks (punctuated by forced breaks as repeats and starters take a lot more time and effort to be refilled), we asked for the bill. A "serverdown" situation ensured a solid 20 minutes wait for the bill to appear and voila......we see a few drinks added which we did not order (were we really that drunk?).

Reasoning with the waiter resulted in nasty looks and tone which obviously meant they were (yes suddenly a bunch of waiters seemed to be free from work to attend to us) doubting our intentions and finally he went up to the lady (who was hobnobbing in the smoking zone with her buddy's) maybe to seek advice. She looked at us but did not come up to speak, which I was earnestly hoping she would, as I wanted to give a piece of my mind to someone/anyone "in charge". However the bill was edited and we promptly paid and left the place, determined never to come back.

Once outside, in the middle of a light drizzle, a huge altercation was going on; apparently a pub regular was livid after he was interrupted while going out for a smoke/walk for being accused of trying to leave without settling the bill.

Thanks WRONG. You peak at hospitality. Why does this website not offer negative ratings?

The ever changing staff is an indication of management's frequent firing,including the DJs like Samrat and Jazzleen who contributed to the soundscape explains the attitude of the management towards quality of service. Only the hostess madam strutting around highlighting her thunder thighs as if there is no tomorrow and posting on Facebook about fake offers do not help. Please have consistent towards customers on days when you go empty and literally beg for customers and the days you have some footfall.

Xrong place is an over hyped pub in South Calcutta as we do not have proper towards this side so this place is quite a buzz but in compare to any proper pubs in Calcutta this place stands no where.. The worse part is it doesn't have a place to sit on weekends after 9pm as  it gets so much crowded.. The beverages are absolutely over priced.. Only happy hours is beneficial, if you guys want to try this place otherwise I won't recommend on weekends..

Xrong place is one of the best places in southern avenue to hangout with friends. It is a very happening place, especially for Friday or Saturday night. I visited with two if my friends and of course I forgot what I had :)
Non veg platter was good, that's the only thing I remember. Apart from this, almost all sort of drinks are available in different categories. Can't tell you more than this, visit and enjoy.

I have been to many pubs across the country, but this is the place where I faced the worst service. Any item whether it be beer or food arrived at our table after reminding the waiters at least 3-4 times.

Wooden interiors resembles a pub in Dublin rather than one in Kolkata so cheers to that.
Giant screen is a big plus on sporting event days.
Well stocked bar and good food.
Cosy and spacious seating all though they can do something with the below average pool table but still i wud give it a pass√©, its nt a pool parlour afterall
In short a nice place to hangout wid frnds.
Slightly overpriced mayb but i wudnt mind spending that much xtra at a good place. Generally the crowd is good which is a big plus.
Happy Hours comes handy
Or else draught beer in a boot is also a good option.
The ambience as a whole exudes a relaxed mood ! 

In food my personal favourites are Chicken Bar B Q wings, Baked fish, Barbecued Chicken skewers, fish sticks and Devil on Horseback !

I did not visit this place for it's eateries..
Rather beer and tequilla was on my mind. With a big gang of brothers and friends alike we visited Xrong place on a sunday afternoon.
The pub is dimly lit and the music is peppy. The giant lcd screen adds to the mood. There was a pool board downstairs ( mainly people are seated on the floor above) so you can enjoy a game as well. Staff is friendly and amiable and didnt snigger when we were asking amongst ourselves how to gulp down the tequilla. :p
Will visit again sometime as this was a nice place to hangout. :)

If you wanna wanna have some drinks with friends, eat good food, basically chillax and ready to shed some good money, well this is the place to be.
Nice polished ambience, shady lighting, wooden indoors and loud music, welcomed me n my wife to this place. The place was pretty full at 5pm on Saturday. We got our seats downstairs.
Comfortably seated we ordered 2 pints of beer, 1 margarita, pan fried chilli fish and red pepper chicken.
The food was awesome...esp the fish was so soft, delicate that it melted in our mouth, it was spicy. The red pepper chicken was nice but lacked the zing which the fish had.
Saturday evening well spent....that's  how I would describe this place.
PS cost us 1340 approx. We paid 250 rs in tax.  :(

Heard a lot about this place,finally visited..ambience and interiors are very good..they offer a wide range of drinks and some variety of finger foods(no full course lunch or dinner). Pricewise, its a bit on the higher side for a more than average drinker. But the one major issue was the service..it was very poor,waiters forgot orders,at times you couldn't find any waiter to take your orders,they were not interested in even handing out the menu card..or even the bill.. I guess you have to be a regular customer to get proper attention from the waiters at this place..

Well it took time but i finally visited this place and I was totally wowed. Amazing place totally im hooked.
Ambience: The more i say is less. Dim lights,liberal use of green gives u a Irish pub experience.
Food n drink: Haven't tried much of food but pile high burger n shepherds pie are good. Need more variety in alcohol tough. They should add drought beer asap.
Service: Very prompt. The people serving are gracious n gv u good suggestion.
Cost: Really on the high side but the ambience is worth it.
Remark: Plz lower the volume and add some classic rock. 
Otherwise totally recommended. Please visit n get wowed urself.

Xrong Place has a really nice ambience. It is a great place to chill out with friends after a long tiring day. Service is pretty swift and the food too is pretty good. 
The wooden floors and the music add to the classic pub atmosphere. 
Drinks may go slightly heavy on the pockets, hence you might want to visit during happy hours. :P
The music could be slightly better but they play tracks you ask them to. 
Definitely going to frequent this place.

Kolkata's first Irish Pub as my friends like to call it, can't believe I visited this one so late. The swinging saloon doors, dim light, use of green colors, pool and the beer boot, makes it my new favorite. They have various events throughout the week including Karaoke(Thursday), offers on draught beer(Wednesday) etc. Had it not been so damn far, would have been our weekly meet spot.

Not writing a long one, as I have been only once and only tried beer and a Margarita.¬†

Interesting thing about this place is it's the only place I have been to, in both Bangalore and Kolkata, which serves towers of Budweiser. Comes at a heavier price, but still. Draught beer was not available but again, I noticed this in another place in Kolkata. Seems weird to me.

A classic pub atmosphere. Could be turned into a better place by playing classic rock. But the music they play is not bad altogether.¬†

Service is good. Waiting to visit this place once again to give a full blown review.

amazing ambience and noteworthy service from their end. the waiters there always keep themselves busy in order to satisfy us. plus their suggestions are significantly good. It will be your go to destination if you really love classic music ( Little bit loud).
Pile high burger can steal the show any day.
One of the cons I came across is that , Choices of drinks ¬†are quite less compare to their couterparts.

After reading reviews on zomato went there with friends for chilling out..being a weekend the place was completely packed and I was surprised to see so much crowd, considering the location on a by-lane..

Yes draught beer is their USP, add to it the towers being omnipresent on almost all tables..after waiting for some 15-20minutes the large pool table was covered and converted to our hangout zone... 

Here comes the bad part, when we were seated in a corner hi-rise table wherein the chair were so uncomfortable that we had to leave the place amidst...the chairs have no foot rest not the tables are equipped to rest upon...when it was unbearable we requested to be reassigned to any other better table.

There were 2-3 tables empty beside us, but they refused to allot it without any reason...

Food was good but we didn't get a chance to try out many dishes...otherwise looking at the place looked more like a sports bar...

Maybe in future if we visit it might improve...but till then my rating stays..

difficult to pen down something that is not yet written or said about Xrong place. Being a regular at this place from the days it just started till it became the hottest happening most coolest pub in calcutta, Xrong place is close to heart.A recent visit with a friend and I realised, i haven't reviewed Xrong!!! So here it is.
The place to get tower of draught beer or a boot of the same, the place to get delectable finger foods and main courses. the place to get strong cocktails as well as shots. the place to enjoy football matches or dine with wine and love. Xrong is the place to be, never to be disappointed by decor, or crowd or the hosts and waiters. It is the place to just chillax, relax, play music, sawy to some, play the pool or cheer your side. Xrong is the place you take your out-of-town friends to show Kolkata has really nice pubs!

My first visit to this place was back in the year 2011 when i was in my college days..From then only this is one of my favourite place to hang out with my friends and booze..And since i am a football fanatic, hence the live screenings of EPLs make this place more happening for me apart from the good music and decor..I usually prefer having conjee crispy lamb which is my favourite and green chilli chicken at times along with a heiniken or budweiser.. The lamb is really very soft and melts so easily inside the mouth..Its spicy and tasty..Another thing that i liked to some extent was the 2.5 litres of tower beer which i had yesterday only with two of my friends..The price was also reasonable , 680 bucks..The only thing that i did not like was the fact that they only serve kingfisher in the tower..I wish they could serve budweiser or atleast carlsberg.. But apart from this thing i love this place and love to visit it whenever possible.. :)

There always is a very different charm and a very refreshing memory of mine associated with this place. One of the "coolest" and "classiest" pubs of the city, this is probably one of the very few places where you will get a tower for beer. Have been to The Wall, The Irish House but never have had managed to get my hand on towers. The ambiance is simply classy with dim and dimmer lights, just adding all the more to the boozing mood. There is a separate DJ and a small smoking zone. Also there is a pool on the ground floor for amusement. The best part of this place is the live screening of football matches which keeps its count to one of the very few sports bar in the city. Highly recommended, especially for the rich college crowd.

Perfect Beer. Perfect food. Perfect Music. Perfect Ambiance.
I have never fallen in love with a Kolkata Pub before. I always felt there was something missing. No place felt like Leopold, Mumbai or Toit , Bangalore.
I visited this place only this Saturday and it has won my heart. And earned my respect. Although it's way too early, but this is one pub that I wish stands the test of time.
In starters, the Bacon wrapped Chicken Sausages are mouth melters. Even the roasted baby chicken is delicious.¬†
Just 1 advice, if you are planning to go on a Friday or Saturday evening, make sure you have a table by 7 pm.¬†
Definitely planning to be a regular here!

It had been in my wishlist for some time now and at last I got to visit it on Poila Boisakh. The review comes a bit late so sorry for that.¬†
Now coming to the main topic, Yes it filled my heart. Its awesome ambiance, those dim bottled lights, the sports flags nd the pool. It gives a soothing feeling once you enter and i so loved those John Denver numbers.
I was there with three more friends of mine. We stuck on to the¬†specialty of the place the Drought beer. We had 3 towers and also ordered Fish and Chips and Baked Fish in Honey Mustard Sauce. Loved the baked fish a lot.
Service was Quick and Staffs are really friendly.
Over all a good experience without making a hole in the pocket.¬†
See you guys soon again.

Visited this place with two of my friends yesterday (sunday). Initially we were the two of us and we were offered a dirty table. Eventually we were told that the table is occupied and we had to move to another table. On enquiring with the staff if we could be offered ¬†a table for four as we were expecting more friends to join us, each one looked blankly at the other. Ultimately we were offered a table for four. As we were seated for a good 15-20 mins nobody made an ¬†effort to attend us and take our order. Finally when a staff attended our table, he was exceptionally rude.The reason to all this as stated was that all the tables were reserved but all the time we were there we could barely find much people around. We were very disappointed with the services and decided to make a move right after our first drink.

Was a very happening place where u could have a few drinks and enjoy with your friends. It also screens matches during IPL and other series, so for cricket fans its an apt place to be. Reasonably  priced with very cordial staff and excellent service makes it even a step closer to visiting again. Keep up the good work...

one of the better places to be drinking with ur buddies
it has got a pub feel to it although i thought it was pretty dimly lit. i found it difficult to go through the menu card in that light.
draught beer is their specialty as i found almost every table loaded with a draught dispenser. but it was Kingfisher. I don't like that at all. food was unremarkable. just okayish i presume. besides, tandoor wasn't available . it was playing some good melodies but the genres kept changing. 
suggestions:
a. lighten up the place
b. enrich the menu, include tandoor 
c. dedicate a staff for the deejaying or serve up a preset playlist
d. get a good draught instead of KF

Went to xrong place for the first time today, with couple of my male friends to get sloshed. Have read good review about the place in t2, so had high expectations to be true. The place is continently located with typical bar type set up, screening live IPL. As soon as we saw the offer board, our eyes popped out, it was written they serving 1 bottle of Asolute vodka and 6 red bull at 3500 plus taxes. We ordered for the offer the waiter said they don't have any more Absolute vodka, but they have Citrus flavoured Absolute Vodka but it can't be punched with any offer and you have to pay regular charges for it. One of the friend was just into vodka so he ordered for 3 large pegs at regular price.

Me and other friend thought of having some beer and they had some nice offers on beer. So we ordered for a pitcher of draught beer, again was told by the waiter that it's not available but they can serve heniken beer at regular prices. 

By now we had given up hope and asked the guy to bring whatever was possible. Ordered American Corn which was too oily. Had to wait for good 15 mins or more to repeat our order and then wait again for ice. 

Basically they have lot of good offers mentioned but they  won't be served to you. Better go to some other bars who doesn't promise you such offers.

This is by far the best pub in kolkata and also one that will not burn a hole in your pocket! The superb ambience and the decor, truly befitting a proper Irish pub will win you over. Add to that an awesome background score, a pool table, a smoking room and these cool wall posters that blend perfectly with the theme of the pub and you have a winner of a bar. We visited the place during the happy hours(2 to 7pm) of course when they give out one complimentary drink with every serving of alcohol which is pretty cool. In between shots of tequilla and whisky and rum, we gorged on red pepper chicken, marilyn chicken with spicy dip, crispy chilli baby corn and salad. The finger food they serve tastes so good with the alcohol!! An amazing place to hang out with friends over drinks, can't wait for the next visit!!

Special mention to the Crispy chili babycorn and Pan fried chili fish. Both were yumm. The Sangria pitchers and beer were good options for drinks. They show live matches too which is great indeed.

Pros: Excellent ambience and crowd, not very expensive, great food and giant screen. Do try the "Devils on horseback", "angels on horseback", "fish with honey mustard sauce" etc.
Con: On weekends the place can get a bit crowded for obvious reasons and hence the service time might drop.

Perfect Place to chill with your Frnds..HV been there so many times can't count as well.The song they are playing now a days its really cool.They have a live sport screening going on during IPL days.Its Both Ground & First Floor.

They have got the superb 'Happy Hours' Drink and all.Regular a different kind of happening things arranged by them lyk Tally Tues,Vintage Wednesday and Karaoke Night on Thurs,which is superb.

Now come to the food love the chilli garlic paneer,french fries but veg items is very less need to add more.

Lastly, whenever I visit Xrong Place I feel so happy 1st reason warm welcome by our Pretty Priya Sarkar & 2nd thing our handsome Joyjeet the way he takes the snap is really cool.

What a place!!!!! Loved everything about this place. Other than beer we ordered bacon wrapped cheese and chicken wings. Both the dishes were delicious. I even tasted their fish and chips which tasted fine. If you want to have a good time do visit this happening place and do have their draught beer. I always end up in this place on weekends but I do want to experience their Tuesday ladies night and Thursday karaoke.-

What more you need of a Bar when it's Happy Hour stretches till 7 in the evening on weekdays, has Foosball & Polo table & an Irish themed decor.
This place disappoints none. What more, there's also a Go Lebanese joint at a stone's throw for all that Post Drunk Scenes.

Xrong Place for a a pub located near Southern Avenue. The ambience here is really good and they have a pool table as well.  Decor is wooden and the light is dim. I went over there during happy hours and they had IPL offers going on on beer and 100 Pipers.  It had only a couple sitting over there when we got there but it good crowded real soon. 
I found the service on a little bit stiffer side and the commentary of the match on the big screen to be a tad loud.  Apart from that it was a really nice experience overall. I did not try the food and left after having couple of beers in the afternoon.  Good place to chill and chat but the place is comparatively small.

Xrong Place is loacted close to southern avenue..loved the vibes in this place..they have a live sports screening going on during IPL days..the interiors are elegantly decorated,resembles an british pub with the wooden decors..loved the jerseys of the major football clubs on their walls..though this place is divided in two floors it seemed a bit cramped up when crowded..also found the seating a bit uncomfortable..u literally had to bend to have the food from the tables..They serve alcohols at pretty reasonable rates..loved their collection,the cocktails served are also ideally mixed..However we were heavily dissappointed with the service here,firstly the servers had to be called repeatedly to take our orders..we ordered some specific cocktails,sadly after waiting for more than 15 minutes the server comes up to say that the cocktail is not available!!such unprofessional attitude definitely not expected in a place like this!!Also the server seemed perplexed when we asked for his recommendations regarding the food..
Coming to food,they serve some pretty delicious and quality stuffs:
Baked Fish in Honey Mustard Sauce: Loved the cheese crust on top, the fish was nicely cooked..loved the combination of flavours..
Cajun Chicken with Spicy Sauce: Loved the fried chickens,but the sauce taste a bit too garlic..
Overall our total cheque for a Boot Beer,one cocktail and two starters come around 1500/- which is pretty economical for a place like this..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 2/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

This place is amazing.
The food is good too. Angels on horse back as well as the Devil's on horse back and few other chicken dishes deserves a bite. The extensive Alchohol library is cool. The service is apt. The music is too good. The smoking room is the place where anyone can spent hours. The pool table is perfect time pass and Fooseball is the just pure Fun. Happy Hours are the time where you'll love to visit xrong in. It's a place to be in. Drop in on Tuesday with a lady your lady will be pampered with free shots and cocktails and when you can chug down a tower of beer. CHEERS.

This place is situated in Southern Avenue nearby lake area. Nice place to hang out with friends. Though not a very big place decent enough. It's both ground floor & first floor. Big screen is there for any kind of live event games you can watch there. Ground floor you can do a private party also. 

Now comes the food part. Food was good and nice blend of taste. Enjoyed it !!  

Two things I would like to point out to the management. 

Please change your speakers. The voice quality of the music is not as good as the other popular lounges. Don't put too much crowd at one point as it becomes difficult to move around. Rest is ok. Will surely recommend the place to go for.

Its a Dimly lit sports cafe where You can enjoy your booze in bean bags nd couches.The best thing is their Music..as the evening progresses the volume and choice of music changes.
It would be much better if they jst add few more liquours in their Happy Hours menu .
Also the food is really awesome. Angels on Horseback nd Pile High Burger jst mesmerises the taste buds.
For those who r planning to check this pub- Jst Go,its a damn Good place to get High with your friends ...

This place is a perfect place to hangout with friends and chill over some cold beer and cocktails. It is not exactly a sports bar but it shows all the major matches both cricket and football on its big screen. They play good music has some nice basic finger foods. 
It is a pub hence I don't think anyone really care much about the food there.

This lounge bar near in deshapriya park area ( take the lane opposite Marco Polo) with its woody d√©cor and eclectic collection of drinks and cocktails is sure to entertain you and your friends through that soccer or cricket match or just a Saturday night . Food though not the best is decent. Prices are on the higher side .. and the music is too loud for my liking. However, XRONG  may just be your place if you want to get high on music ,food and drinks with your friends .

This place is a must for me whenever i am back in the city. To start with this is probably one of the best places to grab a chilled beer and hang out with your friends. Their food is too good. I would recommend the Grilled Prawns in Lemon Sauce, Chicken Steak, Chilli Fish. Beer Towers are cheap compared to places providing you the same ambiance. They have a Pool Table if you are in a mood to play. The walls are decorated with Jersey's of different football clubs which is one more reason to pull me back to this place. They have a Smoking Zone inside and hence you dont have to go out everytime you are in mood to grab a smoke. The biggest plus point is the giant screen inside. They screen almost all the big & anticipated matches of cricket & football making it all the more attractive. And luckily if you are in a day when of the local fans' club is having their screening there, then you totally get the stadium like feel with all the chants and screams.

Xrong Place is located in the southern portion of Calcutta. Not really convenient for people to come down here from central or north calcutta but guess what? The visit is worth it. The facade on the outside, normal stuff, doesnt reveal the thing that's on the inside. On getting inside, it's a different story all together. 
You feel as if you have come down to a british pub.  Really loved the ambience here. The decors are pretty cool and amazing. There's also a pool table in here. The seating capacity isnt something they can boast. One thing that really impressed me was the kind if music they played. Prices are very reasonable with almost all the brands for liquor available in here. Food menu is good and the's food delicious. Staffs are decent. Service is good.
One of the best pubs to hangout. Happy hours and special offers are like cherry on the cake. Must visit.

After reading the reviews, me and my friends decided to try this place out. We are not from Calcutta and went with what the reviews promised considering we had been to some other places already. 
Right after we stepped in I didn't like the place at all. Still we decided to give the place a try.
The staff was rude. We had to ask for water and were made to wait for a significant time to serve the bare minimum we expected. The drinks were delayed. They didn't some of the drinks which we wanted. They didn't have what we asked for from their food menu.
We had to ask for a different waiter, which we were promised but wasn't allotted. It almost felt as if we were being paid for being there. 
All of us had 2 drinks each. All of us had terrible headaches lasting an entire day. 
Overall a pathetic experience. 
We got wronged one such Saturday evening. Bad bad place.

The ambience were quite similar to the Irish house, just in addition was a snooker table. Loud music is played by live DJ. Its a nice place to chill out after a long working day or even in a lazy weekend evening. This was my first visit to this place and it was more for quenching thirst than satiating hunger, so can't talk much about the food. They give cheeselings with every drink. Just to get some tang in the tongue with whiskey we orderd crispy chilli babycorn and it was really good. Normally, veg starters donot jerk my tastebuds when its with alcohol, but the babycorns were perfectly spicy and crispy and i was left with no qualms. I would like to come here again and broaden my food experience to write a better review about this place :)

This joint has been ticking on all the right areas a guy wants for quite a time now and my experience has been more than satisfying every time I have visited this place!!! I am not very much of a glitter-person so the dimly lit wood panelled interior appeals just perfectly to me! This place has got everything a man looks for as an extension for his own cave!!! The drinks are pocket friendly with nice offers they provide and the service is also very friendly! Food is one area I believe they can improve on but rest of the departments are so good than you just can't really complain about anything!!! Honestly, Calcutta needs more places like this which for a change can offer something different from the electronica blurting nightclubs!!! Xrong Place...please,keep up the good work!!!

And the karaoke nights on thursdays, fun level = insane!!!

I was there at a time... Either Kolkata doesn't wake up for booze or I was having a bad day ;) .. Well here goes authentic review from me.
Well the first site wasn't so impressive.. Its like walking on in a galli n then all of sudden a  duplex house turned in a pub ...situated on the ground floor of a residency apartment ...yeaaas n u c residents hanging clothes on the floor above the PUB :)
n then again I was there at 3 ish... So there was very few ppl n very few choice from international beer available there kinda depressed me !!!
The waiter suggested us a lamb dish n that turned out gravy stuff :O #¬£"seriously!!! I had just asked for the best snacky out there"%¬£#
N oh... The serious demarking effect in the whole session was of Mmmusic!!! They were playing all old school hits ... I was feeling like a #¬£¬£"homecoming princess"'::: sitting down there...lol
N on request they DONT PLAY ur choice or DONT CONNECT ur special jam...so u DON DEDICATE IT DUDE!!! 
N v had ordered few other snacks which are insignificant to talk bout here I feel ..but they were all decent :/
N the waiter was polite n so sloooowwww :)  :D
Oh well I have removed 1star >"< becoz of their western loo ...with unstable lid...n kinda shabby n tissue-less :/ blahhhh

Umm..still haven't found my place place in Kolkata :(

At last made it to this much talked-about pub. A complete sports-bar with a huge LED and pool table. The crowd is young, mostly college-goers. The liquor is cheap and cheeselings is free ! Though music could have been better and a little softer on the ears. Don't miss the baked fish and the Pepper chicken.

Today was my second visit to this over hyped place thinking i was not judging properly but again i was disappointed and that's the reason i am writing to let the management know about serious issues.
Firstly when we entered there were no people to ask anything and when we were sitting in one table a girl was busy on her phone messaging and all of a sudden she says its reserved and guided us to sit on other table and 
we followed her request. And then for next 15 mins we were calling waiters to give us the menu.. Then we ordered for draught beer which was not available and in that case we ordered long island iced tea pitcher which was 70% ice cubes filled and tasted flat.
We ordered for french fries which was completely none the less street side presentation with cheap complementary chips. I don't eat non-veg but my friends ordered for chicken wings which was not at all presentable at all. Service attitude was like just as a job. No hospitality attitude. All this wrong happened but grand happening was waiting which was a cockroach on our plates. 
Yes this was not the first time but on my second visit too. And this time i am writing seriously that i am not going to this place anymore.
1) pathetic service attitude
2) pathetic cocktails
3) untidy and unhygienic
4) courtesy-less for all this happening.
Guys check your quality and standard or else you will stand nowhere in coming days.

I must say I have tasted the best ever Long Island Iced Tea over here! Few of the well known places have failed to produce the right mix of the same!
A good place for those who love to party but steer away from the usual monotony of pub culture. Service - didn't give any chance to complain.

We all have places we never get tired of visiting, and a particular food we never get bored of eating. Xrong Place is one of such places for me and my friends. Good music, good food, and drinks- this place has it all. We have visited Xrong Place for Karaoke nights, it's probably one of the very few places in Cal to organize karaokes. It is always great fun! This place has got some delicious chilli paneer. I like the decor- bottle lamps and barrels add to the ambience of this place. There's pool, and foosball too. Though the music is getting repetitive now, it would be great if they keep updating it. A friend from Bangalore visited Xrong Place during football worldcup, and totally loved watching the game there. I like the way they keep coming up with different concepts during weekdays and holiday season. It's fun, reasonable, and a great place to hangout almost everytime!

*DELAYED REVIEW ALERT*

Went to Xrong for the first time last year on the occasion of Liverpool Vs Chelsea screening which was organised by Bengal Kop. Had a bit difficulty in finding the place but still managed to find it.
The ambience is just superb & you will enjoy it specially if you visit there for cricket/football screenings.. There are couches for getting that homely feel & usually on a packed screening day you will enjoy the atmosphere a lot

Great food, good atmosphere, but the service is terrible. Along with the fact that they add items on the bill that weren't ordered. Over all, even though the food was good, the alcohol was decent, the service staff were more interested in their game of pool and overcharging the customer.

Xrong place is one of my favorite places to have a drink..the ambience is amazing and the wooden floors add to the aura..a big screen showing cricket and premier league matches are an added attraction. The food is decent, nothing overboard. The drinks are a tad expensive..They have an in house DJ too playing some wonderful music. Overall..a wonderful place to hangout..Cheers!!

Visited Xrong place for the first time and simply loved the ambience.  Dimly lit and with a feel of an old Irish pub, the place is great for chilling out with buddies over booze, food and foosball.

The staff is friendly, and the price moderate.

Definitely a place that I will revisit soon. Haven't tried the food yet, but my friends have strongly suggested to taste the food served here.

Xrong Place has been an absolute favorite for a long, long time now. Once I was introduced to the Irish Trash Can, it wa difficult to not visit regularly for the last three years. Visited it after a couple of weeks and what I could learn was that apparently the administration has fired a waiter and there are some wage related issues. Now, the waiters, despite not explicitly refusing to serve people are giving a lousy service, lying about unavailability of drinks and insulting some customers, too!

Avoid this place for some time till it goes back normal. It's a dead shithole right now. A sad state for a place which didn't have a place to sit on Friday nights.

Must visit pub located right on the Sarat Bose Road. Good music, good alcohol, good food: spaghetti pasta, cheese fritters, sandwiches and juicy burgers. Appetizers are good but there's just grub. Try out a meek looking house punch Irish Trash Can for 400 bucks - two of them inside your belly set you up for the joint back home. The DJ's sometimes hot and there's foosball and pool.

All is gud. Dim lights, cottage n pub like decor, food.

Beware: HAPPY HOURS is selective, and not on wine by the glass. Places like #Zara do give one on one free even on #Sangrias. But then, price of drinks here is ok.

Overall a nice place to chill out with NORMAL SONGS playing, which we don't find these days somewhere else.

Thnx.

DISCLAIMER: RANT MODE ON

This review is coming up a bit late. I see a lot of people rating it high in the past few weeks but when we guys visited the place on 11th Jan and it was a very forgettable experience to say the least. 

There were 4 of us who were rushing in to catch up the MANU vs SOU game and we¬† get stopped by this guy outside the restaurant. He claimed that the restaurant was booked for a party and was closed for public that night. Then another woman comes from inside and tells us that they don't usually entertain stag entries. All this after we try to call them repeatedly over the phone to know their status but no body answered. Then we were let inside after helping them understand that we were there to just watch the game.

On a Sunday night when arguably the biggest PL club was playing there were 2 other groups inside and from what I observed they did not give a rats ass about what was going on the T.V. Oh wait! The T.V. ! We were told by our friends that they telecast matches on a huge screen but all we could find was a T.V.! Such a bummer! Plus they did not play match's volume but a series of old 80s songs, great ones but not the party types. Let's just say the ambiance sucked.

¬†The food was good although we ordered little. The quantity was less for the price they charge, especially the fries.

You got to say the service was poor when the waiter, in the name of cleaning, just brushes all the food waste, tissues, etc. off the table and on the floor. The entire section was littered with tissues and food.

Bottom line: Wrong Place

Finally made it to this place with a friend yesterday.Xrong place has a good location,was easy to find.A small dimly lit place, Xrong place puts up a good ambience.It offers you the oldschool bar feeling coupled with good music.And everytime u need to get a puff, u dont need to haggle on the streets but can choose the smoking room instead. There's a pooltable too,if u plan to take a break from the table. We visited during the happy hours.Fingerfoods are good as they claim already.I tried the red pepper chicken which was quite a match to the rest of the order.The only thumbsdown was the service : which wasn't slow but a little lazy and confused.
Overall ,
Pocket pinch : friendly 
Worth visiting again : absolutely
Perfect for : a drink or two with friends on the go
Cheers :)

I went there after reading the reviews on zomato. From the outside it looks really shabby and my friend refused to enter. However, as I entered I saw it was a nice pub so I insisted that he come and see the place at least. On my request he entered and loved the pub ambience. Neither posh nor inferior, it's a decent place to enjoy a drink and watch a match with a couple of buddies.

The visit was an unplanned one. The name outside seemed quite catchy. And the feeling when the door opened to an entirely never-before-experienced ambiance, well you can very well understand what i mean to say here. This is THE place to hang out, mostly during the happy hours if your wallet seems to be a bit lighter than usual :P ¬†I haven't tasted the food yet which are a bit pricey, but the booze and the music and the giant sports sequences being projected at the wall does warrant further visits. the foosball and the pool board are the added attractions ;)

Irish pub meets sports bar at the Xrong Place, this destination is high on the popularity chart with the young and the younger. Xrong place is definitely the rightest place to be in on any given evening. I am absolutely in love with this place tucked away in one of the by lanes of sarat bose road. The seating arrangement is divided in two levels-the ground floor having the pool table and the top floor having the bar. It gets quite cramped on Tuesdays, thanks to Tallee Tuesday event for the ladies and other days as well. On my first visit i was awestruck by the innovative lights hanging from the ceilings. Its made of old liquor bottles. The staff is friendly, just they get a bit out of focus when the house is full, shuffling from one table to another. Also due to the smallness of the place, it gets a bit crammed up as the evening rolls on. But nobody seems to mind that. And the music, well it is out of the world. They play rock mostly which blends right in with the mood of the crowd. Very reasonably priced as well. The boot leg draught beer is my favorite because not only the beer is fresh, but also the boot leg looks quirky. On tallee tuesdays the serve the ladies some really mean drinks. The shooters glass is so cute, i fell in love at first sight. Though they dont serve in it anymore now, except at times. The blue shots is the best followed by the yellow. I dont like the red much. No wonder blue finishes earliest and red at the end. The quantity of alcohol in the free drinks is really generous. I TOTALLY LOVE THE MOJITO. Its so fresh. So good. The food is really cheap compared to other places with such an ambience. And delicious too. My favorite is the Xrong Mushroom. Goes down so well with the beers. Please do visit xrong place ASAP if you havent yet. You will have one hell of time. Hallelujah! Xrong place is one of the few places that makes me feel calcutta aint bad after all. Cheerie!

As by now you may know that I love to experiment with food that‚Äôs why visiting numerous restaurants, bars, dhabas is always on the card. No matter how busy I am I take out time from my schedule. This time it was the very famous Xrong place whose menu was quite exciting for me. Starting with chicken salad the whole meal was fulfilling and satisfying. Then came fired chilli fish and thai chicken saut√©. Both the dishes were simply fab. The aroma of the spices, texture of meat is excellent melting in the mouth smoothly. Whatever I eat one kebab item is must, therefore I ordered chicken garlic kebab. It was a complete meal with spicy foods. Also I tried chilli chicken which was heavenly. Later I spotted their chicken nuggets. The restaurant cum bar has whopping menu of scotch whiskey, beers, rum, tequila, gin, brandy etc therefore in this all in one restaurant you can get probably everything under single roof. Also there is various cocktails from which you can choose your favourite one.

There is pool table if you don't have much to talk about :D reminded me of 'How I met your mother' somehow. Yes I liked the place a lot maybe it came as a surprise to me that such a place is in Kolkata.

Xrong Place is the perfect pub to go on a Saturday evening or when you wanna drink socially and soberly with some damn nice music. The ambiance is commendable whether you get to sit downstairs or up. I prefer the upstairs coz you can see the bar, the smoking zone us right next to you and it's easier to approach the dj to play your fav tracks. We generally order beer towers which are like damn sufficient. On general days a couple of them plus one more suffices for a group of 4 to 5 but then in days when you wanna go wild 6 beer towers are just good enough. The smoking zone is too cozy and you can actually take your drink along with you. In regular days there are pool and fuss ball available for your recreation... the best part though is the music that they play, starting from rock, classic rock to alternative, name it and they play it. And for girls there us always the "Tally Tuesday" where you get pampered with shots and drinks on the house.

I like their wooden infrastructure. I like their dim light. Food is really good. Most of the pubs here don't play untouched, original rock music, but they do. This is why I would visit them again and again. But the service should be improved, a lot!

We asked for shots and the waiter repeatedly told us to go to the counter. I don't know what issues he had bringing the shots to our table. It was irritating.¬†
Food was good. No error. But please have salt and pepper containers on your tables. Serving them on a saucer doesn't really look good.

Service is really slow. I understand it might take some time to serve your food on a busy day but it shouldn't take much time to get you another bottle/mug of beer. My friend literally had to wait for 15 minutes for his refill. Might be our waiter wasn't feeling good that day.¬†

Good collection of alcohol. Many pubs in the city serves beer towers but beer boots was something different, like they do in beerfests ¬†in Germany. Haven't seen those in other pubs.

Add-ons: Large screen, pool table, foosball table.

Price: A bit high, but its worth it. I would keep visiting here. I am sure the service will get better by time.

Horrible place!!!! It's the only place I have been to for beers where I hAve been refused to serve the tower for no reason. I asked for the big tower among 3 guys and the guy wouldn't serve us that and asked to get just the bottles. His excuse were that the towers weren't working. And right after he served 3 more tables with those towers. And the service itself sucked ass, the guy could barely pour the beef properly into the glasses. Have nothing to mention more. The place gave me a horrible first experience and never going back to it.

This is really a nice place for hang out¬†among all the¬†expected pubs. Now, I have¬†become a frequent visitor to this place and every time I ended up having a great time. As you enter, you are pleasantly welcomed into a dimly lit Irish pub-like ambience  with old style d√©cor, the wooden floors, comfy seats, the bottles were cut to make innovative lighting in front of the bar and friendly atmosphere makes you want to sit, and have a good time. Ambience is superb, no doubt, u will surely like the ambience there...Foods taste good and  have quite extensive range of  drinks...Bartenders are very co-operative and friendly. Music is good..U will surely get to listen all time favourite tracks..All the credit goes to Priya ,¬†for playing a key role in managing and¬†making this into a popular hangout place in the heart of south Kolkata, which no one will witness in other pubs around the city. Priya, u couldn't have done it more right !! Cheers !! Cheers to the entire team of Xrong place..!!

True to its name, I certainly felt that was not the right place to go for some evening beers. The service is extremely poor, more so towards the closing of the happy hours where the waiters and the bar tenders take their own time to serve and even open beers. ¬†The beers were not chilled, we had to literally ask the server every time to refill the finger food and the starters were average at best.

Cozy place with good lights. Xrong Place situated in a corner in Sarat Bose Road is an interesting place. We were around five people in a group and the service was lousy. The drinks were served post the starters. The presentation of the food was very bad, in fact it looked as if people were least interested to serve the food. ¬†We got our drinks much late. They even need ¬†to improve the taste and flavors of the food including the presentation. Plates as well. The drinks came after 15 mins of order even though the place was not crowded.

This pub is nice regarding location and price but they need o improve with the other stuff.

An amazing sporty pub where you can go and catch the game, and have your booze too. Just off the southern avenue, Xrong place is located very conveniently and has a great ambience for a quick hang out or long lazy catching ups.
Have been there quite a few times and would definitely recommend this place.
Beer is available by the tower and is definitely worth a mention. A sports bar of sorts, this houses an a great large screen projector for all that live action with your friends. The DJ spells out classic and all time favourite tracks while the food manages to keep up with all. The focussed dim lighting, the high stools and table, wooden long bar, minimalist decor, occasional sports flags or tit bits almost makes up for the sports bar feel.
Special mention is the ground floor entrance area housing a pool board, that can be a great place to indulge in those friendly competitions over a few drinks. Also the fancy lights made out of old bottles give it a rustic feel.Overall a great place for those "Guy Nights".
Quite a large variety of alcohol 
serves you well. Fish Sticks, Roasted lamb , chilli chicken or the host of appetizers acompany them well.Prices are a bit on the higher side, taxes almost killing you. Yet, do drop by, i can assure you, it will definitely comeup on your list of hangout places.

South Calcutta had been deprived of a chic pub for sometime.  Xrong's stepped up to the plate and how ! Woody floors , amazing tracks, friendly staff and a big screen to catch IPL , Champions League et.al . Five of us had ventured in and ordered a cask of beer. We had spent nearly an hour and enjoyed the ambience thoroughly. The crowd seemed really great as well. Would like to return soon.

Situated at quite a convenient location at Sarat Bose Road, just the 2nd lane adjacent to Southern Avenue, this place has quickly grabbed eyeballs for its unique ambience and cool music it offers. The pub is duplex with cool games like pool and foosball adding up to its cool quotient. The ambience can make anyone fall in love with this place. The overall light may look a tad bit on the lesser side and dats why the place is a bit dark.

Like some other pubs, here also you can utilize the happy hours from 4-7pm where you can get free beers and drinks one on one. The snacks is also quite simple which they offer alongside drinks. The price is also very reasonable compared to other pubs in the city. So undoubtedly, this place deserves a visit for people who likes classy ambience to enjoy their drinks. 

P.S.  There's also a smoking zone on the 1st floor corner which makes it perfect for smokers also.

I am really cursing myself for discovering this heaven so late. Anyways better late than never. This joint is located in southern avenue, inside the lane located just opposite of "fire and ice la piccolo". The moment you step in front of its porche you get a feeling "its gonna be mint". From the main entrance there is a sticker board on your right to leave your feedbacks, on the left lays a lavish pool table and ahead of that other games as well as sitting arrangements.
Now after climbing upstairs through the wooden chique stairs, you get to discover the holy grail "the bar"- it is elegantly stocked with classic spirits, you name it and you will get it served, the bartender is more than efficient and knows his stuffs. Cozy couches, chairs etc; are spread over for the sitting arrangements. A giant projector screen is installed, so that you don't miss out the excitement on field, yes this whole place roots in the name of soccer.
Now coming to the music, I am really out of words to describe their euphorically compiled playlists, it has got all the necessary tracks to make you go gaga.
Along with a wide variety of liquors, cocktails, beers, wine, etc; which they serve with perfection; they also sets an incredible statement with their varieties of succumbing savories to pair along with your drink. My personal favorites- the steaks, marilyn chicken etc; all are complete culinary delights. The staffs are very courteous and efficient and really enjoy their job which makes it very satisfying while being served.
The whole interior is wrapped with mahagony wood, the dim lights, those sarcastic posters everything compliments each other. The decors has a rich Irish accent and gives you a feeling of being somewhere in downtown Dublin. The complete ambience of this place embroils you into a majestic fiesta.

Unbelievably loud trippy EDM music, an incredible group of friends and an unlimited reserve of booze. All served to you as a surprise? That‚Äôs how Xrong happened to me.

On an absolutely boring clich√© Tuesday, just in search for a pint of beer, to end the day over a few gossip chats, me and a few friends walked down the rather eerie streets of Sarat Bose Road. Located in the interiors of S.B. Road, Xrong stands pretty intriguing and it won‚Äôt be long until you decide to go on in. And then boom, an air of completely mood changing ambience takes over you. The lights, the chattering, that blow of bass from the woofer, those drops in the music, cocktail shakers flying in the air and an endless number of happy faces will definitely make you go-Whoa. This happened to me more because; this was the first time I was here, having heard of this place several times, however not knowing that this place could be this unpredictable ;)

Xrong is pretty cramped, maybe more because of the number of people. Interiors look vintage, old English classic bars. A pool table sits right at the center with a small bar counter adjoining it. Its basically two floors and you do not want to grab a seat near the speakers because you are sure to turn deaf. The smoking room is excessively small so in case you‚Äôre claustrophobic, walking outside for a smoke would be a better option. 

You‚Äôre treated well as soon as you enter. Since it‚Äôs more like a disco, you really don‚Äôt have to find a place to sit, because sooner or later you‚Äôre gonna be up on your feet again, be it cos of the booze or their irresistible music. Now why did I say unlimited reserve of booze, though it was just a pint that I was looking out for? Well, that‚Äôs because it was a Tuesday, or rather a ‚ÄòTalle Tuesday‚Äô, like the way they like calling it. Some really great man decided to come up with this rather generous offer to promote and encourage female drinkers, by providing cocktails and shooters on the house, every Tuesday, GOD Bless him :P. Though this ladies night out has been quiet a popular affair around, I‚Äôm glad I at least happen to be on one such occasion, unintentionally. Best days, come as a surprise I guess ^_^

The rest of the things are predictable. The shooters are good. If the bartenders like you, you are in for some bartender show time and some really classy demonstration of their shooters ;) The cocktail ensemble is different each week I suppose. But I love my Cosmopolitan, few things never change. Their syringe shot is something to look out for! The food is good too, they are quick on their feet, and your food is served before you know it. I particularly like their bacon wrapped sausages. It‚Äôs crunchy on the outside and the sausage later simply melts into your mouth. Their offers on food and beverage and their comber offers are great too. There‚Äôs not much of food that I could have, so I‚Äôd like to come back one day for more of that. This place is quiet happening, be it the days Xrong feels like a sports bar screening premier leagues or musical karaoke nights. There is always something new and interesting to look out for! All in all, a great, cherish-able and a lill drunk experience :D

So yeah, let your hair down, go have some fun, party hard, get high on life at the Xrong Place :) Cheers!

Firstly love their decor and ambience...it gives out a feel of an outback steakhouse or that of an irish pub...their food is good but the events done and managed are better...all credits go to priya sarkar for making xrong place such a happening place to hangout.a request to zomato team to feature this place in the hangout category of zomato coz this according to me is one of the best place to hangout in kolkata...

One of the best places to chill out. Being cheaper than other pubs(in hotels), the pocket pinch is reasonable. The food is also great if you really want solid food to go with your beverage. Otherwise, they provide cheeselings anyway.
On one such occasion, we ordered chicken steak and sandwiches to go with our beer (in a boot). The chicken was salty though.¬†
I highly recommend this place for a fun evening out!

Saturday night is when you let your hair down and just relax. So me and my friends ended up at Xrong Place for drinks. The ambiance is really nice. The place is small but that gives it a cozy and homely feel. The music they play is really good and you would definitely have a good time. The seating is comfortable.

We ordered for a couple of starters. Chilli baby corn and chilli chicken. I felt that both  the quality and quantity must improve.

We had quite a few cocktails. But i always felt that the drinks were really light with not enough alcohol in it. Even after complaining they did not bother. We ended the night with kamakazi shots. There is huge scope for improvement in the quality of the drinks. They should probably hire a new and better bartender.

When the bill came we were shocked to see that they charged us 800 plus taxes for each shot which is way more than any shot price given on their menu. They did not have the kamakazi shots on the menu either for us to verify the amount.

Now to the most appalling part of our visit. The place was not full when we reached yet the level of service was nowhere close to what it should be. They took too long to take orders. Once the order was placed they took too long to get the food and even longer to get the drinks which really pissed us off.

So the final word for this place is you can visit it once to try it out but there are much better options available in town. Cheers !

Very few sports bars in Kolkata, but Xrong Place is one of them. The place is a little small compared to other pubs in different cities, but it is a start. There is a giant screen where they show popular matches and another TV below where you can sit or stand and watch a game. when there are no sports there is good music playing. There is also a pool table that you can play if you are interested. Though on a crowded night, there will be a difficulty to find seats. But overall you can get a boot (pitcher) or a tower of beer( if you are lucky) and enjoy with your buddies. Food is also good but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side as compared to other places in kolkata. But if you like pubbing and you are in kolkata, this place is a must go.

Xrong place has become a recent favourite among my friends. The reasons being firstly the deals on alcohol they offer everyday and the ambience and the music that they play.  Probably the only place in Kolkata which allows you to have fun and get drunk while not using your credit cards extravagantly. One of my favourite places to chill in every day of the week.

Everything about this bar is just about perfect. The interior is kind of old school with absolutely proper lighting. Even the songs which they were playing was going perfectly. The food was nice and price reasonable. Although I was a little disappointed with the cocktails. there seemed to be something not right with Long island iced tea. Probably they got the proportions wrong. But the tower of beer and tequila made up for it. And also the service was pretty good. One of my best pub experiences in Kolkata.

Place is amazing, u will have privacy, good music.¬†
The wooden walls n floors are unique in its way.. We were sitting downstairs. Another thing that was different were the Posters and cushions of football clubs.

Ok. This is by far the best pub experience I have been to. The ambience is that of a modern english pub. It has snookers too
We went there during the happy hours , got 1:1 offer . The bartender is an expert in making cocktails and shots. Do definitely try the tequila shots!
The pocket pinch is a bit high. But its reasonable, at par with the decor.
Ddnt try the food there though,but judging by evrything else, it should be good too. 
Happy drinkng ppl!

If it wasn't for 'pour some sugar on me' played at the right time, the rating would have been much lesser thanks to the impolite server. Coming from a first time visitor, its a better than expected pub, old style d√©cor, innovative lighting and fairly comfy furniture makes enjoying the outing better. Loved the earthen wear for serving biting's, prices are fair for the location. Not a fair mix of all age's but a fairly decent young crowd, one of the best thing is the lady DJ, which attracts the¬†guys lining up to request songs. I was there with guys who had been frequenting the place for more than a¬†decade, so¬†I am sure the place work¬†really well and managed to have a loyal following. The place seemed a bit less crowded for a sun night but good for us,¬†as we didn't have to wait. I should appreciate the¬†very young¬†DJ to be fun enough to play 80 rock with 'over my hear' new bands. Shall plan to come again, well this time would try some food as well.

Was thinking of a Pub when this place came to my mind. I wanted to visit this place. Ambience is superb, no doubt, u will surely like the ambience there. The wooden floors and the lights...the bottle were cut half to make diff colours of lights...and i must say that this is a perfect place for football lovers!!!...superb place ..i would give a 4.5/5 for the amience and decoration...they also had a projector whre a match(IND vs WI) was goin on which was mute. They were playing loud music...
we ordered beers and jim beam along with red peeper chicken along with a coke(was not chilled). The prices listed in the menu are for 30 ml..and the beers price is for 650ml. I asked for tuborg. They had fosters and kingfisher. I chose fosters. had 2 fosters with red peepr chkn which was very good..they had a seperate place for smoking...
loved this place very much..a must visit to this place..total was 1290/- which was ok according to me according to the environment and the place...will surely visit soon...

Long story short, Xrong Place happens to be one of the best and afforable wateringholes in Kolkata. I had a 2 month internship in the city and was pretty much going around dining using Zomato. When one of my old friends asked to rendezvous, we exhausted the list of places where we could grab a drink and Xrong seemed like one of the few places in Kolkata that actually served Beer Tower. Walking in, the pub reminds you of the old western outlaw movies with the wooden finish all over. They have a huge LCD TV smartly postioned so that you do not only stare at the screen but also have conversations. One appreciative thing about the pub is that they have a designated smokers lounge so the pub actually doesn't reek of smoke. The ambience is very cosy and can get bit dark but we didnt experience any difficulties. The service is good and swift. We had a beer tower and food later, both of which was fantastic - nothing overpriced and worth every buck shelled out. I recommend Xrong for a good pub experience.

Heard a lot about this place from my friends lately so decided to give it a visit. As we entered, the dimly lit pub instantly won me over. Add to that an amazing collection of music playing in the background compromising of metallica,pink floyd,bruno mars,etc.. and the three hours spent there seemed like being in emotional roller coaster that left me wanting for more.
Coming to the food, quite a few items were unavailable at that time. We ordered vodka, chicken nuggets and chicken paprika with mexican rice. Prices were a bit steep but food was good, though not extraordinary.
Overall loved the ambience and the quaint little space.. and if you are looking for a pub to chill out with your friends then this place is definately worth a try.

Finally I got my lucky shamrock, and the pot o' gold at the end of the rainbow. After a long wait, I finally hit this popular south Calcutta pub with a friend, and it was sure worth the wait.
As you enter, you are pleasantly welcomed into a dimly lit Irish pub-like ambience. A pool table stands in the middle of the hallway, and a stairway leads to the mezzanine bar. A huge LED screen plays seasonal games, which kind of passes it off as a sports lounge too. The crowd is okay, and the DJ is okay too. On the musical front, they can surely do better, maybe play more of EDM and country.
I always opt to sit at the bar counter if there is one. They have a small and cozy one. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri which was decent, and the bartender was happy to customize it per my taste. My friend had rum and coke. I also ordered a white russian which was pretty good, again not on the menu, but made to order for me. The bartender is young but accommodating.
They are also generous with the cheeselings on the side. The pub also boasts of very nice finger food to go with your drinks. We ordered a plate of angels on horseback which was done perfectly. Also the shamrock burger and pork chops are worth every penny. 
Pocket pinch is very reasonable. And they have an in-house smoking zone. A must-try for every pub-goer and non-pub-goer :)

Okay, this review was due long back. But better late than never. :D A few of us friends hit the Xrong Place during the Friday Happy Hours. I must say, we had some trouble finding it. Even after asking people and switching on our GPS it took us more than half an hour to just locate the place. 
So let's come down to the first thing, the ambiance. Just like a typical sports bar, there was a giant screen showing cricket matches. The music set the mood properly. After settling down on comfy couches with cushions, we ordered Marilyn Chicken with Spicy Dip, Fish Sticks, Crispy Chilli Baby Corns and Fish n' Chips. Oh and of course chilled Carlsberg. Lots and lots of chilled Carlsberg. :D Coming down to the food, the winner was definitely the baby corns. We loved it so much that we kinda kept on ordering it till we were almost full. The Marilyn Chicken, Fish Sticks and Fish n' Chips were all okayish. However, what we loved the most was the Tartar dip we got served with the Fish Sticks and Fish n' Chips. The sweet mayonnaise sauce was nothing short of heavenly. 
One complaint would be the service. It was a little slow. But we did love the food and the ambiance so that's excused. :)

Great ambience. Good music. Good food. Costly beer. The place serves normal bottled beer in a tower which supposedly serves draught beer, thus paying 1k for 3, 650 ml budweiser is just ridiculous. Plz dont go by what mang says that it serves 2.5l of draught beer, the ice case just fills up da 500ml. 
Nyway service was good. Liked the place in general.

This place is a mix of an Irish pub and a Mexican hangout..but its a hardcore pub located in Lansdowne. It offers drinks at a reasonable price . It has a wide range of events throughout the week. There are always good offers on the drinks and recently over the the past year they have also started screening sports like EPL and cricket...so young n old all fill up the place during weekend games. Its a decent hangout but its not very big...that's why sometimes it gets overcrowded ....its best experienced on lazy afternoons or early evenings....cheers

Had an extra sandwich in my bill!!.. Overall a nice place if you like football and good music .. Can be a shining star if they are willing to improve :)

This is the ultimate place for music lovers and those looking for a seriously good time with close friends. Starting with the ambience, I felt like I was in a cozy local pub in texas with all the rock music going on and I must add the (super cute) barrels here and there just added a rustic touch. It has this billiard table and fussball which you can play after a deposit of 100 bucks ( not bad). Food out there: a must try o  the 'angel on horseback' and 'crispy chilly baby corn',
For two approx (including alcohol) 2000 rupee including tax..All in all a good experience.
P.s. loved the cute little smoking room :-)

3 words.. Ambience.. Ambience.. Ambience.!!  If you ever wondered what might Wild Wild West feels like? Enter this place & you might get a fair idea. Even the waiters are dressed in a typical boots & cowboy hats. Although it has been around 3-4 years since I last visited this place, so I'm guessing a lot must have been changed since then. I am writing this review from the memories I had from those times. It used to be my favorite hang out spot..  The food here is not all that great, but I do remember that the fish finger here was a great dish. I ordered it every time I went. Upstairs it hosts a big ass screen & is an ideal place for anyone who is a sports fan. All in all, this is one place in kolkata you gotta try.  Xrong place is actually the Xright place to be.  :)

This place was in my wishlist for a long time and finally on a Sunday evening I gave it a visit with a friend. In my opinion, this place is a pleasant change from the usual. Highly recommended to those looking for a trendy/casual evening of Beers/cocktails and light bites.

Personally, I loved the d√©cor, especially the wooden touch. They have an attached smoking zone, a pool table and a giant screen to enjoy live matches. This place is not that huge but the whole set up done by the owner is really admirable. Coming to ambience, in my opinion- thumbs up!! Good crowd, comfortable seating arrangements, good music (classic rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll, alternative).

We had Carlsberg and American corn butter salt & fish finger. American corn butter salt was good but the fish finger was a big let down. They have a really diverse and interesting menu and I would love to go back to try out more of their dishes and drinks. The prices are on the higher side.

This is my first time visit. And I was happy that such a place has bud up atlast in Kolkata. With such places all over cities like Pune and Mumbai it was a refreshing change to have such a place in Kolkata. The Ambience is very good. The crowd was okayish at time and we have ourselves to blame for our odd timing.¬†
But even after all the prices are one a higher side comparing with pubs like Crazy Frog,Pune or Little Door,Mumbai. We entered the place expecting happy hours and the first shocker came as 1:1 was avaialble only on a Kingfisher beer pints. Bars like Crazy Frog,Pune serve 1:1 on even cocktails and shots.¬†
Anyways being the only this kind of pub in Kolkata this place is a sure visit. I would love to visit again and expect you extend your happy hour offers to some more drinks too.

I have visited this place from the time it started. I really admired the decor and enjoyed going there. I generally used to visit the place in afternoons and would prefer to sit on the ground floor and would always get it open when I visited.¬†
All of a sudden I found its ground floor was not functional in the afternoons. I requested the guys over there. they said they will open for me and allow me. But then they opened once only. After which they said that ground floor section is closed in the afternoons.¬†
inspite of me be a regular visiter of that place, stoped visiting wrong place.One should be allowed to sit where one prefers, and not as per managers choice. I dont know but a few others might have also objections to this type of behaviour.
I stronly feel that improvement is a must.

It‚Äôs quite a refreshing experience to visit a pub in the city which is not located in Park Street and full of people on a Thursday night. The place is a decent option to spend an evening with a group of friends with some nice food, loud music, foosball and of course a Tower of beer. The staff is quite friendly and high chance you will find a lot of likeminded people here with whom you can sing, drink and dance. Did not get a chance to try out food but next time I am in the city will make sure I visit this place once.

Xrong place is a personal favourite! I am amazed to find I have actually missed reviewing this! I have been a frequent visitor to Xrong place for quite a while now and most times I have ended up having a great time.

Located on Sarat Bose road near Deshapriya Park,Kolkata and even more so South Kolkata badly needed a place like this.Xrong place with its sports bar theme,wooden decor,large pool table,giant screen,comfortable seating arrangements and good classy background music has a wonderfully appealing overall ambience.

The drinks menu is quite extensive ranging from beer towers to jagger bomb and Irish trash can.The only two negatives that I have found are that some of the drinks are not available at certain times and the Long Island Iced tea could be a little better.I have had better Long Island iced teas at many other places.The prices are a little high but then that is rather understandable and expected from such a place and at such a location.

Coming to the food,I have mainly had the snacks here.Among the items I have had,the Angels on Horseback is absolutely brilliant.The sausage wrapped in generous amounts of cheese and good quality bacon is simply a delight but then again I have found it to be unavailable on quite a few occasions.The red pepper chicken is pretty decent too.

The service is a little slow specially when it comes to the food.But I for one do not complain.I simply enjoy the place and its ambience with some drinks.The place is more about spending time and enjoying with your best buddies.As I have already mentioned I love the ambience.The choice of music is very good too and it has improved drastically after the renovation.There is also a separate smoking zone.

Overall if you are looking for a good place to hang out with friends over drinks in South Kolkata there are very few better options than Xrong Place.For me Xrong Place can never be the wrong place in spite of the few short comings.
Enjoy! Cheers! :D

The 1st time I entered though the heavy wooden door of the Xrong place, i was left open-mouthed for sometime. The decor does that you. And everytime i take someone to that place for the first time, i keep checking their faces for that expression. and yes, its present, every single time!Not to lengthen this review, the decor is awesome, the music is very good, the food tastes good, the booze price is a bit on the high side and the happy hours are the best thing ever! They serve JagerBomb! Do i need say more? And there is even an attached smoking zone.¬†
Kolkata needed a place like this. South Kolkata absolutely did. It a welcome break from night clubs. its a welcome break from any other popular pub in the city. Its the place to be at when u want some thorough adda, good booze, great music and yet feel totally at home! And i totally love this place! ^_^

I love the place solely for its ambience.A perfect example and so far the only place to set itself as an example of an Irish Pub.
The choice of music played is also nice but if you look at the menu card,its a bit over priced.

Ok this one of the best pubs I have been to. Ambience wise as well as food wise. The variety of the drinks available are more than satisfactory.  The quality of food is awesome. We had the spicy cocktail as well as the chicken sausage and fish and chips. Fish and chips though ok  the sausages were super tasty. Goes perfectly wiyh the beer. The ambience is a 10 out of 10. It has the old rustic feeling that so many pubs lack. Definitely one of my favourite!

An evening with whiskey on the rocks and a sports bar to have in the heart of the city, Xrong place definitely ranks the first. At the interval of their happy hour and their Karaoke night which bags you a 60 ml drink is worth a try, The ambiance and the Coldplay music made me mesmerized and made it a visit to remember, Don't forget to the try the snacks they serve you. They are best partners while you have a drink in your hand,

Went with friends on a sunday evening, the service was bad, many drinks were not available even the person didn't know what was available for snacks, had ordered an Irish burger n after waiting for 40 mins, when I asked again, the guy said that its not available..
The ambience was the only nice part..

Have been on a prowl for a sports bar for a while now.. Xrong is just what I had in mind...its the place if u are looking for a good drinking session, brilliant ambience and music. . the food were all up to the mark..its a proper irish pub which cal desperately needed..i am definitely going to be a regular here.. The only problem is on weekends its quite crowded and seats are limited..plus the waiters inexplicably forgets your order..

This place is like a secret vault of sorts! You enter and voila! You're in a pub in the American countryside! I'll put reasons why and you can decide for yourself. For starters, it has got a pool table around a dimly lit corner. Wooden furnishing, dim lights, high chairs, a big screen, loud music, incessant buzz - check, check, check. Finger food - check! I had come here on a Thursday evening which was incidentally 'ladies night' of sorts. Never have I seen people going around offering free beverages to you. Here, I accepted cosmopolitans from random people! Yes, you are not in India! And who can forget the beer tower! 

Every thing about this place will transport you to a relaxed environment, the likes of which you will not witness in other pubs around the city. Calcutta needs more places like this.

Xrong place - you couldn't have done it more right! Cheers!
I'll be here soon again!

P.S. - True blood fans, you should definitely check this place out!

Dim lights and everything wooden makes you feel like you've entered a tavern in Ireland. Designed like an irish pub and also trying to pose as a sports bar, this place is definitely not bad. Watch games on the screen or listen to music, or just have a chat with your partner in one cozy corner or grab a bar stool and get drunk with a buddy by the bar counter. It is moderately priced and the crowd is usually good. The location is convenient. You can order finger food with your drinks and you are set to spend an entire evening. The service is a little laid-back but it's not a big deal.

The pub is conveniently located in South Kolkata and the atmosphere is quite good. The snacks are priced well and they have quite a variety of drinks to choose from. I had heard quite a lot of positive stuff about the 'Green Chilli Chicken' served here and I did try it. It was alright but nothing extraordinary. The same can be said about the 'Crispy Konjee Lamb'. 

The big screen is quite impressive for watching sports and the music is pleasantly loud, thanks to some good speakers. However, the service is quite poor and one has to wait a long time to be served. This does mar the experience to a great extent. I was in the pub for around 3 hours and they did starting repeating the music which was quite surprising. 

Overall, I think this is a place worth going to and it's great to see such a pub in South Kolkata. If they improve upon their service, then this can be a great place but at the moment I would not rate it any more than 3.5. Oh and this is the first pub that claims to be 'Irish' but doesn't serve Guinness !
Edit: I am editing this review because the quality of Xrong has dropped to a great extent in the last few months. Most of the items in the menu are not available, service is too lousy and the ambiance has deteriorated as well. I hardly visit Xrong any more due to these reasons. The management needs to improve the quality of their staff and to revise their menu and eliminate drinks that have not been available for over 2-3 months !

My brother introduced us to this place. It is not the kind of place where you should go if you want to experience fine dining. But you should not expect it either, since it is a Sports Pub. In fact we had gone down to watch a match in their giant screen. The seating is very cozy for the place isn't a huge one. The waiters would not rush you once you have settled down to watch the match. This again may be disturbing to some people who want fast refills to their table. There should not be any complain about the food though. In other words, this is a place for you to watch a game or have a cozy chat, both at a leisurely place, in the company of good food.

Xrong Place is definitely the right destination if you are looking out for a decent evening with friends amidst good music and a very energetic ambience. I had heard several stories that originated here, but I finally made it there in the 2014 summers, and despite it being sparsely crowded that day, the buzz was quite enjoyable. To top it all, they come up with good combos and offers, which again is another reason to hang out with your friends here!

Probably among the few places in Kolkata to give off that Irish Pub feel! Inviting and at the same time has a dash of the old world charm, thank to their playlist of English classics! Food is average, though but the ambience makes up for it, all the time! The perfect place to chill and grab a couple to beers too!

XRONG is so WRONG !! 

Ambiance : The first thing you notice on entering this place is the Ambiance ! Dimly lit and extensive use of Wooden furnitures gives it an old world look. The Ground floor is more of a "Buffet" type area and the main action happens on the first floor going up the marvellously crafted stairs. Only then do you realize why it's a "Sports Bar" . There are different booths for different fans, from Germany at one corner to Real Madrid and Arsenal at the other. Just opposite to the stairs there's a huge viewing screen where live/ highlights of the World cup matches were being shown. 

Service : Waiters will yellow Polo shirts roam around. But once you order it takes about 30 minutes for the food to reach your table !! 

Food : Ordered the Pork Chops then found out it was unavailable !! At least the Garlic Roasted Lamb was available.  The side dishes of veggies and mashed potatoes were nice but the amount wasn't . There were only a few pieces of lamb on the plate. The only thing that worked in their favour was the taste of the dish. No complaints there , it tasted quite well. Then ordered the Carlsberg Beer which was fine and cold. 

Cost for 2 : 1000 + (Full stomach estimate) 

Final Conclusion : Although the taste of the food was worth the wait , the service time was lacking
and the price is certainly " Not value for money" . Measly pieces and astronomical prices !!

I love the place solely for the ambiance!! This bar definitely has a character....like a gentleman's saloon from old western movies.
It plays country western music and has 2 large screen tv to watch sports with your beer. 
It's an expensive place so the crowd is pretty distinctive. 
Food is nothing special but good sssortment of finger food. 
I keep going back for the ambiance.

Xrong place is the right place to be and by far the best in Kolkata. The place resembles an English / Bar and with the world cup fever on they have done great with the interiors and the decor. A nice Dj booth, smoking zone, and great television set completments the excellant acoustics. The menu is well designed and the food they serve is very very good. Theres a green chilly chiken which you must try. The bar is well stocked with great drinks and cocktails. Probably the best sports bar in Kolkata. Must visit even if you dont like sports and just want to chill. Have a look at the posters and wall art inside and the one liners on the coasters and menu.

I've been here twice or thrice and have never been really high. However, I quite like the place and it is okay to join a few friends for a quick drink. What I do not enjoy is the excessively loud music and the fact that you have to shout for your voice to be heard. The cocktails are good and the food is also quite nice. I ordered a cosmopolitan the last time I went there (The fact that Slash of Guns n' Roses was a regular drinker of this cocktail should kill all the stupid impressions that this fantastic concoction has). It is a pretty nice bar and good for you if you are with a few friends in Southern Avenue/Lansdowne. I suggest have some money with you though :D :D

Can it get better than this, definitely not, a total Friends sitcom sort of set up and a perfect place to chill with friends and have a stress free evening. In this case we were celebrating a birthday and it was definitely a common poll to head there.

The food is not that much in terms of quantity but the taste and everything is ok, we had lamb and mashed potatoes with a bunch of greens and chilly chicken. For drinks there was Absolute, White Wine, Cosmopolitian, Breezer and of course the classic Tequila silver shots...If you just want to let your hair down, listen to some great music and have an entertaining evening with close pals, this is the place to hit straight away.The ambience is definitely a boost and the pool table is fun when your in a group and no one cares about winning or loosing. The wall with all the post its make it a fun place to leave your comments and thoughts and leave an imprint...Definitely will visit it again.

So a long long time ago....  when this place got its bar licence... this was our weekly place to be... the prices were cheap and the place was good... then in the middle they increased their prices to a level which cannot be paid for if you in for heavy drinking so we stopped going to this place and found other options...

then on one fine sunday, my friends told me to catch up for a beer and i suggested xrong place as one beer cant hurt anyone and this place is very close to my house.... 

well i was surely shocked in all.... Firstly instead of Munni badnaam hui type music there was led zep and floud and dylan playing... secondly the place looked a little more better... and then the menus came in... was surprised to see the beer Boot or Das Boot as it is called and the beer towers... 

that too at the price which it was given was fantastic... 

this place will be my one of the frequent going to places now as the beer was super good and fresh and the biting were pretty good...

only problem with this place is 
a. the smoking room does not have Air conditioning...
b. the waiters are tough to catch.... they are in their own zone...
c. Price on Zomato and actual price in the menu are different... the beer boot cost me 550 and the beer towere of bud cost me 1000 Plus taxes

the pluses were the decor is very good.. the music was excellent and the price was not so steep....

all in all a great place to be and i had a great time for 6 45 PM to 11 30 PM :D

cheers and keep rocking...

Not a great experience. Music is too loud and songs are often incongruous with the ambience it tries to project. I mean, it tries to be a sports bar and plays bhangra in the background while football is being played on the screen. Also the owner orders to remain silent when a goal is scored saying "this is a pub, not a stadium", and quite rudely. The music though is loud, that doesn't seem to matter. All in all, a very ordinary experience. Trying to be a sports bar without any understanding of how a sports bar should be.

I revisited this place after almost a year only to be pleasantly surprised that it has turned into a sports bar! Kolkata really needed a fun place like this. The best part about this place? The food and drinks are absolutely reasonably priced. The staff are extremely courteous and kept refilling our bowl of chips and kept adding ice whenever I asked for it. We ordered beer and vodka. The vodka was garnished with a slice of lemon. For the food, we ordered chilly babycorn, chilly chicken green and chilly garlic chicken. Although the babycorn arrived a little late, it was worth the wait. There are amazing offers for match lovers and a huge screen showcasing the match. For people like me, there is a dj who plays great music. All in all, it is a great place to hang out and does not burn a hole in your pocket at all. A must visit when you are in the city.

If you think this is a dedicated sports pub in Calcutta, then you're "xrong". We were watching a game live there and all of a sudden 15 mins before time they shut off the TV and didn't give any explanation. I agree we were shouting but that's expected when your team scores a goal. But they think that's not right. LOL. They should see sports bar around the country and will see the difference easily. I had earlier rated this place 4.5 now want to rate negative but can't so giving it a 1 only.

One of the few sports lounges in kolkata  may be officially the only one.Visited this place couple of times.But last sunday went there to watch T20 world cup final.I really love the ambience.Wooden decor,dim lights and comfy seats.sprts flags.
 We were just in time and managed a proper seat before the match started.It was packed for the match and they wre nt being able to accomodate properly.
They have variety of coctails,shooters and shots besides beer and regular drinks.Prices are more than average.
The food was not that good.I dont know may beacuse of the day and crowd or not the service was really slow.We waited for ages to get our drinks.

I hd a great evening there with friends though we lost the match :( :(

P.S:There is pool table in the ground floor.Music can be bit loud at times.

One of the few lounges in kolkata where they do not charge cover fees even when there is a T20 final going on and we get to watch it on a big screen. They did.not have towers or pitchers but the budwieser boota were totally worth it. Noisy and comfy, one of the lesser known places in the city has very delayed service but their behavior is good. They also have a pool board to keep you busy. Overall, I kind of liked the place!

Xrong Place, the first time I heard of it, I was like what kind of name is that? Then when I actually went to this place I was like def not a xrong place for me.  Our Bengal Kop screenings are held in this place. Amazing sport bar where u can come and cheer your team over a chilled beer & also have a great time with your friends. Drinks are more or less cheap. Ambience is good, love one of  the DJ the other one is a sad soul playing all the possible break up songs. Overall a great place to be over the weekends with your friends.

Used to be my usual hangout for a chilled beer, on weekend afternoons. Then I became a member of a nearby club with a lake view and reduced visiting this place. 

The only decent pub in south kolkata, where one can enjoy football/ cricket matches on their giant screen, over a drink. The place also is ideal to host informal small gatherings for a party of 20 - 30 people. 

Quite reasonably priced and cheerful staff. 

Ideal for day rendezvous with friends, as then the place is relatively quiet. Not a place for teetotallers, cos as stated, the food on offer is basic finger food.

It's been a year I have visited this place and this place deserves a review(check my DP), growing up in a city of pub culture (Read: Delhi) Xrong Place was an amazing discovery for us (Thanks Zomato). Anyhow,

Things I just loved about the place:
1. Side snacks with beer
2. Beer Tower (chilled till the last drop)
3. Pool Table and Beer (awesome)
4. Music (nice playlist)
5. Smoke Room (Delhi pubs - you need this)
6. Food Good (better then many smaller pubs in the City)
7. Good Ambience (nice thought)
8. Proper placement of LEDs
9. Zero level gave a feeling of Hitchcock Movie

Things I feel they could work on:
1. Lights - it's an essential part of a pub that it should be dimly lit and little cosy, it was bright.

2. Sitting - If you have sitting place then make sure they are comfortably far from the other table as people get high so do their voice, I could hear love twats of the couple next.

3. Washroom - It needs to be clean and well maintained.

At the end - It was an amazing experience with my friends (again Delhite) to get the feel of Delhi in Kolkatta

Have been to this places numerous times. 
Revamped Xrong place is no doubt better ! 

Slow service. 

One says Xrong place is the only sports bar in kolkata ?
Which has only 1 Pool Table ( occupied most times by bartenders or Guests )
Pitchers are always unavailable. Too loud music. Otherwise ambience is well maintained also the smoking section and pool table section is well located. 

They need to carefully look at the pitchers availability and music volume !

this place adds to the fact that pubs in calcutta need a whole new direction.Sports bar?? whats a sports bar without a pitcher/tower of beer!! and to add to that they dont even have draught beer! they expect you to buy by the pint,which is not at all cheap as per their service or the place. waiters are ill informed and mostly not polite. seating is horrible,as if only couples are meant to sit there.
no couches or comfortable seating for a group. so definitely not the place to watch a game with your friends.
poor cocktails,i mean the mojito was just bad!!
i dunno bout the food,but the drinks menu was just not impressive.
to top it off the in house dj has the knowledge of a 15 year old boy. all i heard was bryan adams,lionel richie,3 doors down.
i mean it was so mushy and pathetic i literally had to drink 2 times more than usual just to drown the music.

I stopped by here recently to meet friends for a drink and had an OK sort of experience .  Primarily a Sports Bar with a pool table and a separate smoking section. We ordered an American Corn which was average , Chilly Chicken and Hot Garlic Prawns were not bad and went down well with the beers we had ordered. Pricing is not cheap but not through the roof either. The down side lousy washrooms and music that beyond a point makes it impossible to make conversation.

I dont know if the reviews before me have been solicited from friends and family of the Management...but they SEEM too good to be true..!

YES! Xrong has a brilliant location... Yes it has more than a decent decor (if only I could see my way around)... but their music is LOUD..very very LOUD.. for that small a space... the volume is too high, for any one to have a decent conversation...(I AM CERTAINLY NOT talking of candle light dinner conversation...)or talk across the recently installed billiards table.  When asked if they could do something about it.. all they do is NOD their heads and disappear. TWO groups took a hike in front of me, irritated with the music. I literally had a HEADACHE..in 20 mins.
Also, their service is not that good..(read: the servers arent that amiable enough). The recent food menu change is for the Worse. Ordered a variety..but nothing was that appetizing.
AND THE DRINKS!!! well I just have one point to make.. if you sell yourselves as a PUB/sports bar.. atleast store more BEER than PINT sized bottles of the light kind. I dont mind the PINT really...but not have the STRONG variety seemed sacrilegious to me..for a SPORTS BAR. Also the PROMISED PITCHERS aren't available...
I read it in the newspaper that Xrong had been revamped again...All I can say is its one hell of a REVAMP.

I recently been to this place which was very conveniently placed in south Kolkata. The food was very tasty and it was a pleasant experience to visit this place. The place was cosy for a long chit chat with friends and the music is great. The drinks served were really quick and the waiters know their job well.

A re-vamped Xrong Place was all Kolkata could ask for!  :)
There's this drum right outside the pub with flags and mascots..a typical sports pub you see!

Went there with friends to chill and discuss work and was glad with the necessary changes that have been made.
Its a sports pub which gives it an extra edge over others!

Cheer for ManUtd over beer maybe? :D
Or Arsenal or Chelsea. :p

Anyway, so this not so big pub has a very comfy feel to it. The waiters are too non-chalant to even bother you and you can happily live over pitchers of beer or whatever your poison be.

We had some beer and I ordered some crispy chilli babycorn which were decent. The sizes and the helping was small and less respectively.

Else everything was just fine.
Go out with friends and hit Xrong Place if you do not want to get hit by some bold and wild party people.

Happy eating and drinking guys,
Cheers! :D

Xrong Place,however way you pronounce it,is the ONLY sports bar/pub in Kolkata.Sad but true for the city which is crazy about sports!The entry has been done up well now,with the flags of various football clubs like Everton,Liverpool,United adorning it.You enter and there are 2 floors.ground has a pool table,ahead of which a 20-25 seater area with a flat screen,and if you climb the staircase,it again has a 30 seater area,with a smoking zone,and the DJ's area.

They have a big screen on which they play sports,which is the main reason for me to come here.:) Food is decent..the chicken lollipops,sausages are nice,and so is the crispy chill baby corn.Beer is Pints and also serve a tower..i felt the beer and other hard drinks are priced bit too high..the music,is loud,and at times you cannot chat with your friend/s who maybe be sitting 3 feet away!the other day they were playing songs of mostly Hip hop and Rap,which are good for foot tapping,but doesnt exactly set the mood for a evening..maybe a bit of jazz or soft music to start and then take it up will be better.

The waiters are friendly,keep smiling,and service is fairly fast enough..on weekends when its crowded,its slows down a bit.. they have this offer of 3 beers with a starter for 500 bucks,which is neat! The menu needs to be increased,and maybe they can add happy hours as well..turn the music down on weekdays,and it makes a nice place to come hang out with your friends or relax after office.

This place is not about the food.... This place is about its peripherals and I am drooling over these peripherals.... I Just love the cocktails and  the big screen combo... and they serve my fav. cheese-cherry-pineapple (my guy friends seems to like this combo a lot)... The sitting area-downstairs is suitable for the sports lover.....the pool table makes me go crazy (all the time).... The ambiance is great and the wooden look gives u a 16th century feel.... I like the crowd too but the security checking at the main door is kinda odd.... The food is decent in taste & quantity but as i told you, this place is not about the food so i am not going to judge this place on on the basis of the food .... Of course, there are some cons of this place. The music is loud and it might  annoy you sometimes. The servers take too much of time to serve you and the washroom is not very clean (as it should be)...

Xrong place tries to be something more than it has to offer, and that is where things go wrong - bad washroom, weird crowd at times (mind you a guard is there to scan and allow entry!!) and expensive drinks. The wooden duplex flooring, couches, pool table, a separate smoking zone is definitely noteworthy and I am so glad they exist with an ambience like this. But the problem is the rarity of wanting to visit it. 
The beer towers are exorbitant or so I think after having visited Goa (they are actually unnecessarily expensive trying to make the towers the uber cool factor), the cocktails are well made, strong but again illogically expensive. I love the fact that they serve complementary chilled cheese and pineapple sticks, though that has just been once among the few times I visited this place. The food is tasty with a decent quantity and fine price, but a lounge is a place where along with food, everyone appreciates the alcohol. And oops, it hurts to have a great evening out here! But yes, once in a bluemoon, it is actually worth it. I loved watching the fifa worldcup here and would suggest one to make plan with friends on such spirited ocassions.

Xrong Place has always been the "RIGHT PLACE" for me. Although parking has been an issue every time i visited this place, everything else has been great.  I love the interiors, the stairs appeal to me somehow. They served the drinks very promptly, and had some good snacks. The Lollipop, nuggets and kebabs were always very tasty. Unlike one of its neighboring bar cum restaurants, the AC was never a problem. The sitting arrangement is great as you may choose to sit in different zones ( differently lit). The smoking room gives smokers the convenience of not having to go outdoors for a smoke as is the case with its neighboring joints. Some of the Cocktails were quite good, as my partners would say. The large screen is definitely an advantage during matches. I have spent some good times here with friends one of whom kept requesting the DJ for songs, who obliged with a smile . Great interior, Great service, good snacks. 
Happy its there in my part of town. 
My score - 4/5

Once this place used to be the joint to hit after work, but over the last few years, I have slowly lost the taste for the place. There are a few reasons for that, although there are a few good points as well. Good points include the fact that they have a nice cocktail called Long Island Iced Tea, which is bound to give me a buzz after only one. Well mixed with the right dash of coke on top. The other thing is, the place has a nice seating arrangement, and you can be as inconspicuous or seen as you can. There is a smoking room which is convenient for the smokers for a puff in need. 

That said, the downside is possibly the music volume. Its too loud and if you are going there after work to chill, well, sorry, but that won't happen. Telling a wait staff to turn it down slightly does not work, and an evening here is bound to give you a sore throat the next day, thanks to all the screaming and shouting. The wait staff must be very good at reading lips because they do take the right orders. The second issue is probably the parking - hell, this is a place where parking can be a pain, especially after 8.30 p.m. so people who are driving, make sure you park close or hit this place early on.

I am not a very big fan of their food - I like the cheese thing they sometimes serve when you are at the bar - a stick of pineapple, cherries and cheese, to go with the cocktails. For that, i would definitely give a thumbs up to the bartender.

Xrong place could never have been the wrong place for me...Been here many times since it started which again was some 6 years atleast maybe more...Conveniently located especially very close from my place so I often visit this place....Some people who come from far may find a little bit of a parking problem. If you have a driver(which I believe is a must if you plan to drink a little more than little) then you can ask him to park it in the opposite lane which goes adjacent to the newly opened fire and ice piccolo...Lots of place to park there and you can ask him to drive it till near the place when you decide to leave.

Now coming to the fact that why can Xrong Place not be the wrong place for me. Firstly the pool table presence in a bar, secondly the classy wooden d√©cor, thirdly the nice large screen which helps during a match if you want to see it over some drinks, fourthly the attitude of the staff which is very helpful. Though they might seem a bit pushy but then they don't keep pestering you and are always there with a smile, fifthly the quality of the food there, Sixthly the super comfy and relaxed seating, seventhly the advantage of a smoking area and finally the music which keeps on plying in the background.

So eight major points why I like it. However I had given up drinking except on social occasions like parties or something so I somehow stopped visiting Xrong Place until I paid two repeated visits once each month to this place again.

Their choice of music has dropped significantly and the music was blasting so much that I could not put my views across to the person sitting on the other side of the table. I requested the people there to please look into it that the volume can be reduced or some jazz or pop can be started but I was told that it is not possible as the guests want it this way...I mean who wants to sit in a lounge with a few drinks and listen to the music blasting away while enjoying with friends...They could have reduced it and if someone objected they could have thought of it but the blank refusal is something new here. I also felt the choice of music was bad because you should not start off with rock or hip hop and the music had just started...I believe in building up the mood and taste of people which this place used to till the disc turner used to be good. 

The same thing was repeated again after which I requested for a suggestion book which I was not provided with...I mean what happened to good old days of suggestion books??? Am a bit hurt at their approach and the taste of music but then I guess maybe they have this change due to a definite change in taste of music of people of Kolkata...

I was a bit hurt.,...Anyways I normally go for beer here as the prices are a tad bit high and am still a student who gets average pocket money. With friends thus I order a tower...

As for the food I stick to my opinion of pan fried chilli fish or spring chicken.. The kebabs are average but you can also try their chicken sausage and lollipop.

You can also try out the sandwiches like the egg mayo sandwich.
Two further things that need a mention are firstly it has a ply look on the background of the menu card and secondly they serve chips instead of some "chanachur" or "bhujiya" along with the drinks so that is an advantage and a move from the expected ordinary.

Had it not been for repeated bad experiences this could have got a 4.5 and had they served good dinner after drinks could have reached the perfect 5 but for now I will rate it a 4 due to my past experiences..,....

The place is really nicely decorated and music is great and ambience is pretty amazing for  a Calcutta pub. I think the place would be perfect if they had happy hours. Otherwise it's kinda steep for casual hanging out during athe afternoon or evening. Also it would be much better if they had all  beer items which are on the menu.

South Kolkata surely needed something like this. This place is definitely a must try !!! The wooden floors and the wooden layered walls remind you of the victorian era pubs. The dim lights add to the feel. The seating is plush and very comfortable. I visited the place many times and every time I came out with a smile. This place is prefect for that quitessential bengali 'adda' over a beer. Service is pretty decent and the good collection of music just adds to the experience. The Drums of Heaven are a must try and the bar is well stocked. The prices are a bit on the steeper side though. Overall, a good place .

However the problem with the place is that the ground floor at times hosts private parties. Thus the noises downstairs can be midly irritating. In my case, it was enough for me to finish the drink and walk away!!!!

It's a 2 storey pub with a pool table in the ground floor and seating arrangement in the firstfloor. 
The ambience is pretty cool with  soft lighting and cosy seating arrangements though it felt a bit clustered. Good place if you want some privacy amidst the maddening crowd. Good soft music though one of the speakers didnt seem to work. The big screen showing cricket was a good add on. Coming to the drinks, me and my friend went for beer but most of the beer in the menu were unavailable. Come on!! leaving out a Carslberg and a Tuborg Strong are a crime these days. We had no option apart from bud, heineken or corona. Though the new Bud (Magna) was pretty good. Another point is that you get only pints (avg. cost Rs 200). The service was pretty good and the staff friendly the kept on refilling the wafers bowl without asking. Overall a nice soothing experience could have been better in terms of variety and price. Overall I would rate it as 3.5.

A nice cosy pub to grab a drink or two. Good ambience, good service, reasonably priced drinks and good food is how I would sum up writing about this place. I've been a regular ever since I've visited this place for the first time. You get a peg of scotch for 300 bucks which is not bad. The food is also good. You get good kebabs and tandoori items at reasonable prices. 
The USP of this place: Each time you enter this place and order for a drink, they serve you a free complimentary bowl of chilled mix of cheese, pineapple and cherry to all the customers. Also, for beer lovers, you may order the beer tower which is a long tower like container fitted with a tap at the bottom filled with 6 pints of your favorite brand of beer. 
Also, I like the huge tv screen (much bigger than other places) while watching your live cricket matches. And you can also play billiards for Rs. 100/- at this place. Like other places, you will also find a DJ counter and a separate smoking zone at this place. All in all, a wonderful place.

Xrong place is a tough one to review, because different people want different things out of lounges/bars.

I love hanging out here from time to time, but without expecting too much. It's not a truly 'high class' lounge-bar or anything of the sort. But what it is, is the only English pub-style place in Kolkata, where you could sit for long and catch up with friends over a couple of drinks, and also watch a cricket or football game on a big screen.

There are not enough options if you're looking for top-of-the-line alcohol and cocktails, but it covers pretty much everything one would usually have. Snacks are decent, with Chinese starters being the safer bet. Also try the momos here - I don't think many people are aware of it and they're very well made!

It's a great place to meet a friend and talk over a few drinks. The wooden interiors give it that pub feel, which can't be found in Kolkata elsewhere. If you're looking for a place to dance or looking for absolutely top-class lounge bar, this isn't a great option. 

Have to say though, that they should consider bringing the prices slightly down, or at least introduce more offers on a daily basis, otherwise they'll lose out on their customers (many of whom already find it a bit too expensive now).

A quirky name, some foot-tapping music and a good selection of liquor is what Xrong Place brings to the name. Located near the Lake on Southern Avenue, Xrong Place has become a popular place for the yuppie, young crowd to frequent. The music is good, and its fun to hang out. A special mention to the DJ who accedes to user requests, knows the groove of the crowd and changes his playlist accordingly.

The Drums of Heaven and the Pan Fried Chilly Fish are a safe bet to order with the drinks. Xrong Place is a great place to be to watch a match or to just let your hair down and party!

Cons:
1. Too expensive for the service provided. Eg. 1 pint of Budweiser beer is served at 250 INR + 42 INR tax.
2. No soap in either of the washrooms. Funny thing is that, they couldn't provide it even after being requested several times.
3. Food is below average.
4. Each and every item has got some hidden tax.

Xrong place is a wine and dine lounge located at 25 Sarat Banerjee Road, Rash Behari Avenue, Kolkata. Though the space is small and may seem a bit crowded especially in the evenings and during any event, Xrong Place is a great spot to hang out with your friends during the weekend. 


Xrong Place is comparatively new when compared to the many lounges and pubs scattered around the city. However, the ambience and the service is what make the difference. Some might say the booze is costly. Well, definitely it is and I do not argue about that. However, the overall experience plus the excellent food makes it worth the money spent.


I visited Xrong Place a few times, sometimes with my friends and sometimes alone. Yes, stag entry is allowed! And every time I went, I was amazed by the wonderful hospitality and service dished out by the staff.


The last time I visited Xrong Place was a couple of weeks back with a friend of mine. This was his first time at Xrong Place and after we left, he was amazed at the professionalism and the service. Xrong Place has a very casual seating arrangement with sofas well spaced by tables and chairs. The basement or the ground floor has sofas only while the top floor has both chairs and tables and also sofas. I love the Drums of Heaven chicken preparation there and this time there was no exception. So we ordered two beers, Drums of Heaven and Pan Fried Chilly Fish for starters. As usual, the beer was served chilled and the food was excellent. The place had live DJ music and we were blessed to have a DJ that day who actually knew to up the tempo and knew what he was playing. 


After having a couple of beers, we planned to have whiskey. The liquor was served in clean and beautiful glasses and unlike in other pubs and bars, the cold drink was served in a separate glass jar! Classy, one must say! The waiters were not the usual robotic types and my friend was surprised to find the waiters to be so casual and friendly. They never seemed agitated and were more than happy to answer our questions. The DJ was happy to oblige to our requests and even joined us for a couple of drinks. 


Overall, I enjoy myself to the fullest every time I visit Xrong Place. I will have to mention two occasions where I had a blast. The first one was the day India won the Cricket World Cup in 2011 and the other time was the New Year's Eve in the same year. To me, it's the best place to be at is your intention is to just chill!

again too expensive .....same story as  HOPS - the slounge bar  , all alcohol prices  are  measured  in  30  ml  , they  too  charge  around  27-30 percent Tax ,  food is below average  ,  not all drinks are available  ,  only go if  you have enough  money to waste  or if you are a millionaire  ....  ambience  is kinda ok  but nothing great to write home  about ....  overall  a  thumbs down  from my side .... just 1 example a  peg  of Jack Daniels  60 ml will cost you 600 bucks  per  60 ml peg  plus extra taxes... i.e around 750 Rs / Large peg ¬†( all inclusive ) ...... Which means ... if you have 2 pegs ( LARGE i.e ) ¬†of JD with coke ¬†& ¬† maybe a ¬†side-dish to munch ... while you watch a soccer match or IPL ..... the cost will be around ¬†Rs 1700 ¬†for ONE ...........¬†

Therefore ......... cost for TWO ¬†??? ....... Rs 1700 X 2 = ¬†3400 Rs ( approx ) ..... tolerable enough ... but still expensive ¬†in my opinion ....

Ensure you have Credit card .... before you enter .... Debit-card may just Not be enough !!!
