Been coming here since I was a kid. Gariahat meant "Nawab er Roll". They serve the best rolls I've ever had. The crust is not sandpapery but soft and the chicken pieces are great. Should definitely visit.

Apart from several other street food joints this is one of the best roll joints in Gariahat area. Tried their Chicken roll several times and it tasted pretty good. The price is quite reasonable according to the quantity and quality they serve. Best for a short budget tummy filled meal when you are hungry after the tiring shopping.

The rolls are the best you will get in the entire gariahat area. They don't give tomato or chilli sauce in their chicken / mutton rolls yet their taste remain unique. Another pros is, the rolls are really non oily and chicken pieces well cooked.

Back in the days, a shopping trip to Gariahat seemed incomplete, without grabbing a chicken roll from Nawab. And even after so many years the place has remained consistent both in terms of food and service, which is highly commendable.

The tiny shop is located near the Gariahat crossing while taking walking towards Ballygunge phari. Chicken n Mutton rolls are the hot sellers. The parathas made light n crisp, not like the conventional lachha. The filling comes with succulent pieces of meat cut in the exact right sizes, properly spiced n seasoned along with thin slices of freshly sliced onions, green chillies and a generous squeeze of lime. Addition of ketchup or chilli sauce (especially in Chicken or Mutton rolls) is a big NO for me because it totally dampens the experience. Glad they don't use it.

Evenings on most days attract a sizable crowd. The service is seamlessly prompt and the staff, as always patient enough to serve the hungry bunch of people impatiently thronging the place. Pocket friendly prices get a big thumps up from me. My picks - the Chicken roll, Chicken Boti kebab roll n Mutton tikiya rolls.

Quite surprised to find so few Zomato ratings for this place ðŸ˜‘ but regardless, for all those roll enthusiasts out there, a visit is much recommended if you're in the vicinity!! ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ

I have been visiting this roll center with my mom since my childhood - one of the best roll joints in the area near Gariahat crossing on the right if you go towards Ballygunj Phari. The sheekh kebabs are too tasty - one of the best part they keep it very simple without messing the filling with sauces and shredded cucumber.

The famous Kolkata roll we grew up with is still served here. Why I say this is that all the old roll specialists nowadays serve substandard rolls. Be it Bedouin, Campari, Zeeshan and others. They are an oily, chewy, mishmash at best a faint shadow of what they used to be. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that the rolls in Nawab, the same little hole in the wall in Gariahat, is just as it used to be 20 years ago. The mutton roll is a slim, tight, less fried affair stuffed with the kebab, onion and the in-house masala. Just like it's meant to be. It reminded me of the taste of the legendary Nizam's roll, another Kolkata gem back in the day. Also must try the mutton rashmi kebab roll, the fish diamond (Thursdays only) and mutton samosa. 
After eating rolls at multiple places recently, I had given up on the roll. I was mourning its death, in fact. Now after Nawab, Im back in love again.

If you wanna taste the best rolls available at Calcutta, you have to visit this tiny joint. They don't serve sauce in their rolls & the paratha of the roll is prepared with the lease quantity of oil. A 'can't afford to miss' place!

The best Roll shop in South Kolkata!! I know, I know, before I even draw another breath, people are getting ready to pounce on me and try to impose their other choices from other South Kolkata joints (e.g. Campari / Bawarchhi / Zeeshan etc Badshah in New Market / The Kathi joint at park Street beside Moulin Rouge etc...). But I firmly maintain my highest rating for this ubiquitous item -- "The KOLKATA Kathi Roll" -- to the artistic creations "lovingly brought to life" at Nawab. The shop is a very small one, boxed in from all sides just before Gariahat crossing, located a few steps ahead of the new Big Bazaar on this side of the pavement. You can instantly see that even in this small space where at least 4 people are working, the interiors, including the cooking platforms, the Electric Chimney, the clothes and personal hygiene visible -- are all impeccable.

The first warning posted (by the owner) is "No Sauce". Yes, this puritanical roll must never, ever, be smothered with the nameless / tasteless chilli / tomato sauces used by lesser joints to mask the insipid taste of their offerings. The only items used are fresh Onion Rings, Fresh lime Juice & Chopped Green Chilly. If you have a problem with Green Chillies instruct them to leave it out of your rolls - (I don't know how he does it but his chillies are always fiery ~ compared to the tasteless varieties I usually pick up from the Bazaar)!

The Parathas are not the "large crackling" varieties that are usually offered by Arsalan / Dhaba / Zeeshan /Shiraz (those are usually the Lachha Paratha mounds) etc.. But they are really "soft & pliable". You can also ask for the "hard fried - ("Korha bhaajaa") variety where the parathas are fried a little more in oil as compared to the normal low oil fried avatar. I prefer the latter.Â 

The Seekhs are NEVER FRIED MEAT; they are always only "CHARCOAL GRILLED MEAT". That makes the major difference - you get to savour the true taste of the fillings. I usually go for the normal "Chicken Roll". i hate to mix up the Egg with Chicken roll where the taste of each is smothered by the other. I mean if you want to taste meat go for a Double Chicken Roll but don't murder the taste by pairing it as "Egg Chicken Roll". When I really want to gorge, it has to be the "CHICKEN BOTI KABAB ROLL" or the "MUTTON TIKIYA ROLL". Another exotic item is the MUTTON SINGARA which is rarely available. Grab a couple the moment you see one.

One of the better roll joints in this city. The first time I had the rolls here, which was a couple of years back, I was awestruck with the flavors and simplicity of their rolls. Their Reshmi Tikka Roll is a sheer delight. The paratha is thin and simply melts in your mouth with the Kebabs inside. They do not put any sauce, so you do not have any unnecessary addition of flavors hinting the true taste of the paratha and the kebabs. Do try this, if you are around!

If you are at Gariahat you can't afford to miss the rolls of this little tidy joint.

Nawab offers you specialised rolls. The menu appears to be ordinary but when you steal a bite the taste is an absolute innovation. They are all stuffed and are not seasoned with ketchup and that is the USP.

I have visited it a couple of times and have tried their chicken roll, egg roll and mutton tikiya roll and none have made me upset but rather offered me delight.

The service is quick and price is reasonable.

Recommended to roll lovers.

This place offers the most succulent and oil free rolls that I have ever tasted.The paratha is very soft and doesn't drip with oil and is never over fried.

The chicken pieces are even in size and marinated really well which is why one will get a melt in the mouth experience each and every time.They also don't use any variety of sauces to garnish the rolls which makes it manageable to eat one and tastes great with just lime and chillies.

The Mutton Singhara that they sell is great too and fairly priced.

The negative aspects are the sizes of the rolls which can be better considering the price.This point becomes all the more relevant since it's very challenging to give a good customer experience of one orders a double roll (e.g.Egg Chicken Roll).Also,they exhaust their supply very quickly on a daily basis.So,they should plan and prepare accordingly so that customers don't return empty handed.

Sadly, during my long stay in Kolkata, I had never been to this place. Finally heard friends raving about it on social media, and perplexed by my ignorance, made it a must-visit when I was in the city next time.

So I asked around and reached the place, it's onthe opposite footpath from Bedwin, another iconic roll shop of Kolkata. The place looks very simple and menu is very small. I ordered a Mutton Fry Roll.

I observed their entire compiling process, and I could already see that they used very less oil and thin parathas, unlike any roll shop I had been to before. When I received the finished product and bit into it, it was like a new roll chapter had opened for me.

It was delicious! The lack of oil and sauces allowed the meat to create its magic, and the thin parathas made sure there was a great balance between the starch and protein. It was very light on the stomach, and in one visit, you can surely sample 2-3 types of rolls.

This has become my must-visit place and I am going to keep going back until I have sampled all the rolls on their menu multiple times. Crazy.

The culture of rolls started from the Nizam of esplanade and gradually spread to each and every nooks and corners of the city.
Located in the footpath opposite its yet another iconic competitors,the Nizam is a true gem and to me,it serves rolls best.The basic difference I found in the rolls here was that the chicken pieces were not just only pieces of chicken rather were made in a fine kabab which subsequently added to its taste.
Being such an immensely popular food joint u are surely to find crowded in most times of the day.

An all time favorite of not only mine but my parents as well!!
It has been about 15 years or more since we are a regular at Nawab. A visit to, or even a passing-by at Gariahat calls for a Roll from Nawab without a miss. 
A very unique thing about their Rolls is that they use sheek kebab as the filling and add only Onions and Green Chillies. They do add some masala but not any kind of sauce. It is not only yummy but also a very light eat. Saves you the loud burps that come from Rolls made of thick paranthas and heavy spicy filling!!
Like it or not is secondary! The first thing is to go and have a good eat.

NAWAB  used to be a legendary place when it's comes to roll. The place used to give though competition to bedwin on the opposite foot path, but the 1976 establishment has lost its shine and quality in recent times. The items are strictly various types of rolls. 
I was introduced to nawab when I was school. But the last visit crushed all my memories and future hope from this place. 
1st August 2015 it rained heavily all day in Kolkata, We were 3 and went to the place to have some rolls, but other than mutton roll nothing was available. 
So we ordered 3 mutton roll cost 90 rupees, the Paratha was not lucccha paratha and was wafer thin. There was roughly 3 mutton pieces, the mutton pieces were not fried with extra onion and and veggies. And as per the business policy they provide no sauce on their roll. 

The quality was pathetic, the roll was paper thin and super small I finished it in 4 bites. 
I would say don't go to this place, rather go to bedwin on the opposite footpath. This place has lost its shine and love of serving the customer. 
I will never visit again.

A long time ago, when the roll concept was budding, then Nawab started its business. I have been having its rolls since my childhood. At that time, Nawab was the only roll corner in Gariahat. The chicken rolls are delicious. Even now, if I think of having a roll,I go straight to Nawab. The kitchen is clean, the rolls a bit different from the others in the sense that no extra sauce is put in it, the parathas soft and small and thin and crispy  and not big and fat like the rolls of other stalls. The meat is never stale. The fish items are not smelly. Besides chicken roll We have taken mutton samosas too and they are equally tasty and crispy.

3 is enough for this joint.
Rolls are quite delicious, especially chicken rolls but service is slow, due to location, its tough to wait for your order. Gariahat's crowd is famous.
Chicken Chowmein is okay
They don't provide change above Rs.20 even if you buy foods above Rs 500.

Small take away joint, they don't give sauce and close down very fast due to their foods which get OUT of Stock, but they never improve the quantity of their stock.
Not so well behaved staff but its okay.
If you have plans to come to Gariahat and try out rolls, this joint is for you.

DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEWS AND I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT. BUT DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS BEFORE COMING UP TO A CONCLUSION.

The history of 'Rolls' or Kathi rolls in Kolkata started with the legendary Nizam's restaurant in Esplanade.Gradually it proliferated in the form of small stalls in every nook and corner of the city and was a great source of earning for enterprising unemployed youth everywhere in the city.
In South Kolkata the good rolls are generally associated with joints like badshah and Bedouin.But many roll places have this tendency to smother the insides with tomato and chilli sauce and raw onion and while they are tasty as well,they are not what classic rolls are made of.
Here comes Nawab,incidentally located bang opposite their famous competitor Bedouins in Gariahat,but to connoisseurs they serve the best rolls this side of town.
Today I asked for special chicken rolls which have two lines of the chicken inside and mutton rolls as well,and packed them so they can be had in the airconditioned comfort of the car in the sweltering heat.They had a gem called fish diamond as well but the owner said that its discontinued as of now because of the poor supply of fish.The basic difference of nawab rolls is that the meat here is in the form of kababs which impart their own flavour and tenderness to the rolls and with finely chopped onion and masala is a roll connoisseurs delight.And they even display a sign saying that there is no sauce inside the roll.
Pure delight and a question?Why are all rolls not made this way?Then I do not have to drive all the way to Gariahat,fight for parking,jostle with shoppers to partake of the authentic,original,classic Calcutta Roll.

Very Dry and with an accompaniment of simply a twist of Lemon, onion frills & green chilies which are served on the side - these are serious No Nonsense, Delicious Rolls  made with a soft melt in your mouth Kabab only inside & a great thin & crisp Paratha which are a must eat !

Going to gariahat for shoping or roaming around is directly linked with having roll from nawab. Its been 25yrs now i am doing the same practice. My parents taught me the practice. 
Few best thing about this roll corner is the paratha is less oily nd so soft that u dont need to chew it will melt in your mouth. The chicken is also not spicy at all,even a kid can also have it and neone can have it who is suffering from stomach upset. The onion chillis nd lemons served is also very fresh compared to other rolls corners.

And the best tag line i can give is "No one can have just one" If you r damm hungry u ll definetly want a second one.. :p

Well surprised to find that not many people have given review about this outlet.
I had roll several times form here and would like to mention few good things I like about this place.
The roll here will be just a plain parantha, less oily not laccha paratha provided by other roll corners.
So there is a bit guarantee that you would not suffer from stomach upset.
Since the parantha is small the pieces of mutton/chicken stuffins will be visible enough and whenever you have it you would not have the feeling of chewing just a parantha.
The onions povided are very fresh and the chillies and lemon too, overall a bit hygenic compared to other roll corners where you are not sure what stuffs will be provided to you.
Perfect place for having light snacks.

Walking through the crowded footpath of Gariahat, I came across this tiny counter with a handful of people standing and munching on rolls.
The name, 'Nawab Snacks Bar' rang a bell, and Zomato happily reminded me that it was in my wishlist.

I took a chicken roll and a chicken fried roll.
I was surprised, for the rolls were served hot in the flick of an eye! I really liked the fact that they had a really light paratha and absolutely no sauces in it - just chicken and onion with a dash of lemon juice.
My tastebuds instantly developed a soft corner for the very lightness of the rolls.
The chicken and chicken fry rolls were more or less the same thing, though.

Although nothing out of the world, they tasted pretty good, and one can easily gobble up a couple of them to satisfy his/her hunger pangs.

Prices are extremely on the lower side, and service is superfast.
The friendliness of the man at the counter added to the joy.

Heard a lot of their mutton rolls. Will definitely give them a spin soon!

As many people mentioned, my most of the roll experiences in childhood are at this place. So, to me, it is a bit legendary. But seeing through an unbiased eye, I remember the last time I took a roll from this place in recent time, it was not upto that mark. Competition is increased and I feel they need to improve further to cope up and exist with pride.

It is difficult to miss out on this tiny roll outlet at the shopping hot spot of Gariahat. This outlet has been around for ages now.Remains always crowded when it opens its shutters around noon.No seating arrangement so be prepared to be shoved around and screamed at for blocking the footpath(?). Ordering here amongst the crowd is always pretty challenging Â and you get priority if you are a past winner of a screaming/shouting contest.
Now coming on to the food.All you get here is rolls of various variants-both veg and non-veg and kebabs which is basically the stuffing inside the rolls being sold separately.The non-veg variants comprises of chicken,mutton,fish and egg rolls.In veg one can try out the paneer and the pure veg-mostly aloo stuffing roll.The rolls are pretty light having light non-oily maida parathas. Drastically different from the thick and heavy laccha parathas used in most Mughlai roll outlets in the city. Stuffing inside is of decent quality meat but inadequate.Saving grace- no cheap sauces used for the stuffing, only basic onions,dash of lemon and green chillies depending on your preferences.If one is really hungry then two rolls would be just right to satiate one's hunger.
Give it a try if you haven't already during your next Gariahat shopping sojourn.

Nawab rolls is one of the oldest roll shop in south Kolkata. The best thing about its roll is it uses much less oil than other roll shops and its paratha is also comparitively thinner than others for which u can enjoy as light snacks only.

Excellently light and fantastically spiced rolls. Unlike most other roll shops (what else to call them?), they are not dripping in oil and won't stick around in your stomach for the next 48 hours.

I have been eating good old traditional rolls from this shop ever since I can remember anything.
As far as I understand this is the only shop in the entire city from where you can eat a couple of chicken rolls and then easily after an hour get into a restaurant for a plate of biryani without feeling stuffed at all. Trust me!!!! Have done it
A little expensive if you compare with other shops nearby considering the size. But its the quality that will change your perception. You will surely comeback for one more the very next day.
The paratha is extremely light, cooked in good oil, well cooked chicken, no sauce(better than those coloured sauce that other shops give).
Location- Walking from Gariahat crossing towards Park Circus on the opposite footpath of Pantaloons. 2 mins from Gariahat crossing. Very small shop. Keep your eyes wide open if don't want to miss it amongst all the vendors.

The only place I can have roll from. The speciality of their rolls is the paratha wrap. Its not the laccha paratha you get everywhere. Its thin, light and much less oily. And it doesn't make you feel you need to skip your dinner if you have one in the evening. 

I like their fillings too. Mostly I get the Mutton Roll. If you want to make it heavier, you can have a Special Mutton Roll with two sticks. They keep things simple. Chili, onion and lemon juice. The mutton kebab inside has a crumbly texture which I like and tastes really good.

Service is fast, easy on the pocket. And for me the most important part is it's light on my tummy.

The rolls are yummy.. but to fill your tummy you need to have the special rolls as the normal ones are not of great size. Whenever I am in Gariahat for shopping,I stop by here to have some amazing rolls.. Hope they retain their quality always :)

Nawab snacks bar is the nawab of rolls in Kolkata.  Situated just next o 2-3 stores after Bazaar Kolkata, Gariahat this is a wonderful store of rolls and snacks.  I have been having their rolls from my very childhood and I really love this place.
 They serve their rolls with the appropriate filling of chicken / mutton with onions and lemon juice , they do not provide sauces which I find the best thing .The size of the roll they serve here is a bit small compared to other roll joints but they also charge less. But the quality !! superb, there is yet to open any roll joint that could beat Nawab, till then it will remain the  "Nawab".

Nawab pushes the adage, " Sweet rewards await at the end of a hard journey" to it's extreme end. And man !! The journey is hard !! 
Special mention of the location : This small fast food counter is situated a few stores down from where the Bazaar Kolkata used to be situated earlier at Gariahat. The establishment is barely a slit in the wall with nil standing space let alone sitting arrangements. This may not have been a problem if the pavement just in front had not been one of the most crowded in the city. The pavement is barely a feet wide with jostling shoppers at all time of the day; especially those sampling the junk jewellery at the stall bang opposite. The situation is one of excrutiating chaos and frustration. 

Now the food.. For some reason, the taste of their food stays with you. Maybe it's the harrowing experience altogether or the joy at ultimately getting the food in your hand but it makes you happy in the end. They essentially make rolls although for a brief time they had started to stock up on chops and pakoras. The rolls are divine. The paratthas are always fresh, non sticky and devoid of extra oil. The dough is always well kneaded and it can actually be felt. All of the rolls are are well proportioned.  The Chicken Sheek Kebab is a must try. Also try the Chicken Fry Roll. 
The last time I was here, had a Chicken Roll. The chicken pieces were extremely gratifying as juicy and spicy as they were.

No matter how tough it gets, I've been ordering something from here everytime we go shopping as a family. They've been here as long as I can remember. There's always only a precious few minutes of wait time. The man taking the orders is courteous and they never mess up the orders. That's more than one can expect of a humble roll shop.

Chakraborty Tips : Remember the adage.

If I wrote an Ode To Rolls, I would dedicate it to Nawab. The one place in Kolkata where the parathas are light and slightly crisp, with no dripping oil, and the chicken filling is perfectly cooked and spicy with NO sauce (sauce-filled rolls somehow put me off). My family has been consuming rolls solely from Nawab for years, and we're likely to go on doing so forever. The quality is simply unbeatable. 
Roll-lovers, this one's the king of them all.

Nawab is a childhood favourite - I have literally grown up having their rolls. Coincidentally,  it started off in 1976, the year of my birth. The quality of their rolls never deteriorated, maybe because the cooks never changed - they grew old in front of my eyes.

This is one of the few joints which strictly don't mix tomato/chilli sauce in the rolls - in any case you are not supposed to have sauce with rolls! The parathas for their rolls are like the Bengali home made parathas - not lachha parathas. I rate their chicken rolls in the top 5 in Calcutta. The mutton rolls used to be fantastic too but somewhere down the line the quality of mutton became a little poorer. What they could never improve is their Mutton tikia rolls - for that, you have to try other places.

Nabab roll centre is a must visit if you truly wish to have authentic kathi rolls Bengali style.

Waiting for your roll here means braving the rush of the Gariahat footpath. Nawab's is a standard roll joint with the parathas made thin and crisp, less on oil, the chicken stuffing properly seasoned and the onions fresh. Easy on the pocket, prompt delivery and nothing to complain about.

What is different with this restuarant that offers the quintessential bengali fastfood item roll?
For one the rolls are encased in parathas which are non greasy but best of all the chiken or meat tikka /kabeb are not fried !
The eatery (does not qualify as restuarant) opens at around 3pm and by 7pm finish their stocks - hence fresh food is guaranteed.
Going strong since the 80's , but the portions have shrunk and the prices have zoomed, nonetheless still a favourite.

*drum rolls*
Tucked away in between Bazaar Kolkata on one side and junk jewelry shops facing it on the other, this small joint is located at a very busy spot of Gariahat where, if you stand for a minute you're bound to get shoved and pushed and yelled at every 10 seconds. But what makes all this trouble worthwhile is a guilt-free bite into their delicately seasoned kebabs, julienned onions, green chillies and a dash of lemon rolled within a thin, soft and slightly crunchy and non-oily paratha! Heaven! The prices are very reasonable as well. 
Do give it a try!
