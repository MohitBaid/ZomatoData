This place is synonymous with awesome sweets for me. I think the kalakand and rasmalai offered here is among the best I have eaten in my entire life. The gulab jamun however leaves a lot to be desired. Apart from the sweets, a lot of fresh juice is also available here. The sweets are all pure veg and the place is hygienic.

Located inside the Everest House near the Jawaharlal Nehru Road & Shakespeare Sarani crossing this is an outlet of the popular Ganguram brand . Visit here for morning or afternoon snacks as the place is near my office. Quality is good & price is affordable too . Today had Doi Bora here which was fresh & tasty.

I had recently visited Gangurams to buy some sweets to take to someone's home. Decided to stop and eat a few of the lovely Sandesh. The Bengali sweets are really wonderful, especially Mishti Dahi and Sandesh. ¬†No need to describe the taste of these items .Visit, taste and say WOW.

We were there late in the afternoon to realise it was an award winning chain restaurant it has many outlets in Kolkata with some really great sweets as Bengali Sweets are very well known this one had a slight variation to it 
the best was the chocolate sondesh 
the chowmenin samosas were quite good but could be a real hit if improved on the filling 
The veg cutlet was average as not expected a lot from it 
but the ras malai cannot be left behind without mentioning this one was the best of what I've had till date 
And the pricing was quite reasonable not too expensive considering the fame it has. 
All in all it's a good place to have light snacks and a the chocolate sondesh.

Another well known sweet shop in the city of joy. Always love to visit this place. My personal favorite is the lassi of ganguram. Thick, creamy and delicious. Also the kaju barfi and khirer chop is really really good. Its a must try sweet shop. They have many branches across the city. Price reasonable.

Review No 317:

This review is based on the box of assorted sweets picked up by a loved one travelling from Kolkata recently. I gather from the feedback that Gangurams has been around since decades and have spread to various parts of the City.

The box had the following beautiful sweets (one sweet of each type):

a. Kasturi (B): Rs 30/-

b. Jafrani Talsas: Rs 30/-

c. Golap Chap: Rs 30/-

d. Bati Cup: Rs 30/-

e. Sankh: Rs 30/-

f. Mix Chocolate: Rs 30/-

g. Colabury D: Rs 30/-

h. Khir Cham Cham: Rs 30/-

i. Lord Cham Cham: Rs 30/-

j. Rasmadhuri: Rs 40/-

k. Cream Chop: Rs 30/-

l. Kesar Bati: Rs 40/-

m. Orange Sandesh: Rs 35/-

n. Mango Sandesh: Rs 35/-

Each one of these delicate sweet brought out a unique taste and texture...something I have been unaware of all this time.

I'm not an authoritative voice on what is an actual true blue Bengali sweet but this sweet box definitely introduced me to what beautiful tastes the city has to offer.

Ratings on basis the experience:

Food: 3.5/5
Price: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5 (I've been informed the service was prompt)
Ambience: 3/5 (Going neutral on this one).
*****************
Overall: 3.5/5 (more inclined towards the taste and price of the sweets).

This is the best among all the outlets in the city in terms of quality. Deep fried kachori and the bhujias in ghee tastes brilliant. Lastly, the mist doi and indrani is too yummy.

One of the very old branch of  pioneer sweetmeat chain "Gangurams", known for its genuinely delicious sweets and snacks. And off course, the chocolate misti too is an alluring option for any dessert aficionado to fall for. Specially the "Chocolate Mousse" is a must try.
A very nice place to fulfill sweet cravings or some quick bites on the go.

Got a simple lunch box at my office from this particular outlet of Ganguram a few days back, and I was pretty impressed by it. The food tasted fresh and good, and the sealed packaging of the Chhole ensured no spillage. The Baturas were nice, fluffy and not too greasy. So in all, i liked the place.

One of the oldest outlets of Ganguram this is. Located inside the Everest Building in Chrowringee, I have happened to drop here once or twice. Have tried their Samosas, Mishti Doi, Roshogolla and Masala Dosa. Also tried one of their Chaats. The quality is good here and is worth the price. Pocket pinch was moderate.

I went there today. There is ample sitting arrangement there so no problem. I went there chiefly to have chat, because there is hardly any joint in my area which makes decent chats.
The staff were good but lacked polish and kept on bustling around and shouting.
Anyway I ordered for a masala cola and a mixed chat. The menu card is stuck to each table so no problem.
The masala cola came first. Again, no tissue paper. I think some day I will have to start "tissue paper do" andolan just for this.
Anyway, the tissue paper was handed over as soon as I asked for one.
Masala cola was moderate to taste.
Then came the mixed chat. It was ample with enough of ingredients and curd, but I missed the sweet chutney. They should have given it, I feel.
After food, I went out and from the confectioner' counter, ordered a nolen Gur sweet for my mother. I also ordered Aabar khabo Sandesh just for the sake of its name. After going home I tried it. It somehow felt a bit sour, but the other sweets are ok. Price is a bit steep.

This Gangaram sweets outlet was much better from it's rest outlets. Place was beautiful, clean and big as well. You see here restaurant like proper sitting arrangement. It was fully AC. Hospitality was good but restaurant service little slow and also some staff were rude. Service of sweets counter staff was quick and also their behavior was friendly. Their sweets were very delicious and they also made special cadbury sweets which were also very delicious and their all the sweets were fresh and pure. Their snacks were very spicy and tasty. They also made fresh fruits juice of pineapple, orange, pomegranate etc. In restaurant they have Chinese, south indian and desi snacks which were above average. Must visit place for their sweets.

This outlet is one of the oldest franchise of the Ganguram chain. Have been visiting this place since my college days as I loved the dhoklas and dosas available here. Best part was the freshness of the food quality available here. The inside has a seating area where you can sit and grub some vegetarian quick snacks. The sweets as usual have an authenticity of their own. Best part is they accept Sodexo meal passes which makes it easier for office goers  to avail the offer.

Ganguram is one of the oldest sweet shop in the city of joy. At present there are several franchise in the city, ganguram is not just a sweet shop there are several refreshing food items are available which will refresh you at the moment you take your first sip or byte. The flavored lassie is my favorite over here.  The last time when i had one, i order another one after taking the last drop. 
For all the sweet tooth out there don't forget to visit this one at least twice a month. 
The food and everything is quite fresh. 
The place is clean. 
The behavior is good. 
They have several items for you to get refreshed. 
Well not so much to tell the bongs about a sweet shop named Ganguram. 
Stay tuned.

Located below Everest house in chowringhee, this outlet of ganguram sweets also serves some excellent thali besides the routine sweets . The stuff is always fresh and delicious. I love their Indian thali along with some fresh fruit juices. The sitting area is very average but food is pretty good and priced very reasonable.

My favorite items to order would be radha ballavi, thali, mishti doi, sandesh, indrani rasmalai.

What do you do when guests announce their arrival an hour before they come in?You rush to the nearest ganguram sweets to get sweets and snacks packed.Today guests were gonna arrive so i rushed to the chowringee outlet.On arrival i found the place revamped into a neat confectiionary.The interiors made it look like haldirams food city.The new look makes this place look so good! :) I got gulabjamuns,chenna toast,samosas and paneer pakodas packed.While my order was getting packed i couldnt help but try a mango misthi doi from here.It was good,but nothing can beat Ballaram Mullick.
Ganguram has forever been serving fresh sweets and snacks and the chowringhee outlet has some really good variety.
My favourite sweets are gulab jamun,sweet parwal,cadbury mishti sweets,classic mishti doi,chenna toast.For snacks i like their  dosas,paneer pakodas,samosas,paneer bread roll,vegetable cutlet.They also make eggless pastries in flavours of chocolate,but the slices are pretty small,though priced at 12 bucks only! 
Overall Ganguram is a wonderful confectionary to go to,especially for breakfast.

Ganguram ... a name every foodie in Kolkata has heard of and have tried at some point. This particular shop has lots of associated memories for me because it was a stones throw from my dad's office and I would love their Singhara with the delicious Sweet Tamarind Chutney and their Radha Ballavi with Aloo ka Subzi which were both hot favorites. Whenever it was a special day or I had done well in school Dad would get both home both the above and I would gobble it all down and it made for a very happy young foodie. It was also an occasional sinful Sunday breakfast for us and I can still picture sitting with my parents on our dining table and polishing my share off. Till date their Mishti Doi is a fixture at my parents house and if a relative comes down or we are going on a trip my dad will only pick up the Mishti Doi and Sandesh from this particular shop. The Rasmalai is also excellent and highly recommended.

We used to stay around this area few years back so all our sweet cravings were fulfilled from this joint. I am  a die hard fan of their rasgullas, indranis, chom chom and mishti doi. All their items are perfect with the amount of sugar they put in them. I also used to freak out on their chats and chowmein samosa.. Though personally I never quite liked their samosa as it was very heavy on garam masala but my family pretty much loved that too.. For me whenever it came to having rasgullas it meant: Ganguram.
