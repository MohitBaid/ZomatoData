This place is very close to my heart.. Iv grown up having food from here.. sundays of my childhood was all about this place.. I can bet a 100 on this chinese restaurant.. Cit cafe serves the best chinese food in this locality and nearby area.. Its in par with big chinese serving brands .. this place has grown its popularity  over the years n its not easy to get a table in here especially  on sundays.. This place is worth giving a try.. 
Must haves are :
Crispy fish in lemon and coriander sauce 
Caribean drumstick 
Thai chicken 
Garlic butter prawns 
Mixed hakka chow 
Chinese chopsey 
Caramel custard
I know the list is long but cant help it.. I simply love evrythn from here..

"Cit cafe" a Chinese cuisine restaurant specially popular for their dishes. Most of the time it's crowded & why not they provide value for money.
I have been there for couple of times but this time I opted for home delivery.
I ordered one mixed Hakka chowmen & Hunan chicken as side dish.
Quantity of noodles was enough for 2 to 3 people as regarding their pricing it is really economical. Taste was absolutely good , I may rather say a quality Hakka noodle as well as the Hunan chicken was tender & delicious. A perfect place to order and enjoy the food. üëç

It is not a cafe as the name suggests but a budget restaurant for good Chinese. Very convenient location. I've been here a couple of times and also ordered food. Tried the following items:
Veg Fried Rice
Veg noodles
Sweet n sour chicken
Chilli chicken
Schezwan chicken
Chilli babycorn
Pan fried chilli fish

Every dish was amazing both taste and quantity wise. The sweet and sour chicken was one of the best I've had anywhere. If you are looking for something non-spicy this should be pick. It had pineapple pieces which pleasantly surprised me. The pan fried chilli fish is worth mentioning too. The  Service was superb. It's a place I'll always keep going to whenever I'm in and around CIT road.

One of the best place to satisfy your Chinese carvings if you are around Park circus or CIT Road. Located near Ananda Pali Bus stop. Don't go with its name as it sounds like a cafeteria but it is a proper Chinese Cousine restaurant. 
We ordered Chicken Tortilla Soup (recommended), Drums of Heaven, Hakka Noodles, Veg manchurian,Sezwaan Rice and Crispy Fish in lemon coriander sauce. Fish was awesome. Crispy Fish tossed in tangy coriander sauce. If you love tangy flavour, this item is a must try. Disappointed with drums of Heaven as it was dry and we were expecting chicken drums to be tossed in some barbecue or other spicy sauces. Overall great experience. Quantity is good. Price is reasonable.

The rating is based on the Food and not at all on the behaviour of the staff ... Otherwise I would have given a zero 0 ...

This is a good place to have amazing food ... I went there today for lunch with a friend ... We ordered Bang Bang Prawns and Saute Chicken with Peanut Dipping Sauce ( which is basically Chicken Satay ) .... I have had Bang Bang Prawns before and I love it ... The prawns are fried and crispy prepared in mayonnaise based sauce ... I have tried the other appetizer first time and it tasted delicious (must have) .... For the main course we ordered Chilli Garlic Noodles and Chicken with Celery And Pepper .... The noodles where spicy and had the perfect garlic taste while the chicken was mild and prepared in white gravy ... Both tasted amazing together ... All in all the food of CIT CAFE never disappoints you with their food ... :)
But there is one thing which is not good about this restaurant and that is the behaviour of the staff and servers ... I mean they are kind of rude and I have realized it Everytime I have visited there ... They literally bang the plates on tables and serves you the dish rudely .... Their attitude conveys as if they don't want to take orders and serve ... As if they are being forced to work ... So yes that is not good for a place which is in this business ... As in this business you need to be hospitable and courteous ...

This restaurant is so overrated and don't serve delicious food, they have very few things which are good but overall it's ok-ish. I have tried plenty of their cuisines but was quite disappointed specially by hakka noodles but drumstick, soups are good at least. They can improve if they at least follow reviews on zomato or any food blogging sites but they are not active on the internet

For the first time I had been there today.This place is just near to Ananda Palit Bus stop.
It is 2 storeyed chinese restau . Prefered 1st floor because of the romantic and bluish ambience üòÑ
Now coming to the food. Food is really awesome here ! We orderd
1) Chicken Chilli Garlic noodles (Rs 175)- though it was a bad choice for me as I am not fond of spicy food and I had no idea that it will consist of dry red chilli rather than green chillies,otherwise the taste is really good !) . To me,the quantity was more than enough for 2 people ..
2) Hunan chicken (Rs 190) - It's really awesome,Less spicy and full of veggies like baby corn,bell pepper .. Love this item.Quantity is Enough for 2
3) Crispy fish with lemon and corriender sauce (Rs 220) - indeed a lipsmacking item. Awesome combo of cruchiness with a sour taste . Consists of 5 big pieces.Truely The taste is heavenly üíó
4) Tutty Frutty (Rs 160)- If I will visit this place again,then it will be 90% for this 1 üòçüòçüòç this item does not need any description, it is a must try item !
Staffs are really polite and helpfull.
Overall a very good experience .

A cozy restaurant which serves one of the best Chinese in Kolkata. Their Caribbean Drumstick is a must try. I also tried Singapore rice and schezwan chicken. Singapore rice was nice. For dessert opted for chocolate sundae which was awesome. The pocket pinch is reasonable and the price quantity ratio is very good.

Had a family lunch in CIT Cafe in Park Circus on Sunday 5th November,2017.Though it was quite far off from our place in Behala,still the restaurant being a favourite of my daughter & her college friends and also based on favourable reviews in Zomato,we decided to give it a try.
We reached CIT Cafe at 12.45 PM.Parking place was available for the customers in front of the restaurant.But the parking area may prove to be inadequate during busy hours.
The restaurant dining area covers two floors,the first floor is more organised & preferable choice for diners .
We ordered the following:
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup
Honey Glazed Chicken Wings
Vegetable Meifoon
Chicken/Prawn Meifoon
Shanghai Chicken
The dishes were served quickly.The waiter was efficient and courteous.The quantity of the dishes was more than sufficient.
The food quality was excellent.Sweet Corn Soup was light with sufficient chicken pieces.As starter,Honey Glazed Chicken stole the limelight.It was excellently cooked and was unique in taste.The item was quite new to us and we simply loved it.My daughter also confirmed that it is a hit among her friends.
Meifoons - both vegetable & chicken/prawn (Rice noodles) are excellent and little different from the noodles served in other chinese restaurants.Shanghai Chicken was suggested by the waiter and it passed the test as quite good.
The service was prompt and we finished our lunch in exactly 65 minutes.
I am told that the restaurant is a big hit among the students of nearby colleges.After visiting it today,I feel that it is rightly so.

It's already declared that I am not a Chinese food lover. But there are few places in Kolkata which I love to visit and every time I experience something new. CIT Cafe is one of them. It's not that I am a regular visiter there. Neither I knew them long back. But from the time I had been there, never ever lost interest in their food.
Today I went there to have a late lunch with my girlfriend. We ordered chicken meat ball soup, egg wrapped mixed rice, hunan fish. Though the rice was a bit dry and lac of usual moist texture, it was a pleasure to watch the dish served. Yes serving is also an art. The stewards mastered it. Soup was fresh and refreshing. Hunan fish was awesome. Subtle taste of hunan fish worth mentioning. Mixed rice was as usual nice.
Quantity is very good. 750/- for two! Worth spending.

This is a pretty good family Chinese Restaurant in the Park Circus Area. I have not been to eat in the restaurant in a long time, but usually I take-away the food to have at home. The food here is very moderately priced , with huge quantities and but that does not compromise on the food quality . The fried rice or noodles is easily sufficient for 2. Some of the great dishes here are -¬†

Kung Pao Chicken¬†
Hunan Chicken

Thai Chicken

Chicken with Vegetable

Crispy Fish in Lemon Coriander Sauce

This is one my favorite places and hope to have more in the future.

CIT Cafe always turns out to be the best option for family outings. One of my most favorite restaurants of the city, this place caters mouthwatering Chinese food even for the fussiest eater. Ambience is not so cool but the seating is quite well. The tastes of food were top notch.

We ordered Carribean Drumsticks, Butter Prawns, Singapore Fried Rice, Hong Kong Noodles, Thai Chicken, Chicken with Cashew Nut, Hunan Prawn.

The Hong Kong Noodles was awesome and it was served with egg poach and salad. The Hunan Prawn tasted great.

Service is not fast. But prices are reasonable.

I am a big time foodie anyday and my friends and family are aware of that. Yesterday on the Eve of Diwali we visited a Chinese restaurant named #CIT_Cafe, which I think provides the best Chinese cuisine in the park Circus area without burning your pocket. 

We ordered 2 chicken meifoon, 1 manchow soup, 1 Hunan chicken, 1 general TSO's chicken (this item is very unique and I haven't tried it before in any other Chinese restaurant). The taste of every food item was awesome and that demands a great food review. 

The best part is we paid only 1050 including GST, which is very much less for 4 people. Even the quantity of the food is great. You need of having large appetite while visiting thereüòãüòâ.

Address: CIT road, entally, near Philips more.

Teenage memories, this restaurant reminds me of them. They hosted quiet a few events(including my birthday) i have been part of. Thus as i sit down to pen a review for them the cashew chicken tickles me.

Honey glazed chicken wings. This is maybe your sole reason to visit the place its like a dish to treasure. So coming to the food everything is top notch but you cannot tag them as authentic chinese cuisine. But what you get to eat is of authentic quality and taste. I recommend,well the honey glazed,eggwraps, schezwan, three alarm firecracker. What they need to do better is the gravy's the gravy chowmein & chopsuey. The menu card is lenghty and intresting they also offer decent mocktails.

Service- They have got one of the best service in the town very friendly, polite and equaly efficient servers they have got the knowledge and command to make you feel comfortable..

Decent is the word to be used and this is the part where they can make big improvements the decor. The place is divided in three parts the ground floor the 1st floor and the private area. If you are handsomely tall the ground floor is not where u would like to seat you may get a bump on your head.

To sum up things you can just visit this place for a hearty meal and they desrevely is a students fave. They are damn cheap w.r.t the food served.

The food here is great and I willingly would give a rating of 4.5, but considering the ambiance and the service, I can‚Äôt give more than 4. The interesting orders here would be their Hong Kong Rice. Apart from this you will be pleased with everything you order. Definitely try out this place. Though prices might look a little high, but the quantity they provide makes up for it.

We Ordered:-
1. CHICKEN GRAVY NOODLES
2. THAI CHICKEN
Both the dishes were enough for two people and goes perfectly with each other,the Thai chicken being dry and a bit spicy (not jhal though :p)

Best Chinese outlet in Kolkata, I think...though they serve Indo-chinese dishes...but you'll definitely love the dishes...must try Caribbean Drum Stick, Honey-glazed Chicken Wings, Pan-fried Fish, Sanghai Chicken, Tootyfrooty etc. But the place is small, not too spacious. It's a place if you visit once, you'll visit again.

Well well well !!!
I've had Chineessee in all the famous restaurants in Kolkata but by far this one is my favourite..
The place is a bit small but the ambience is cozy.
The Staffs are really well behaved, but the only problem that bugs me every time is that the food takes so much time to come to your table..
The crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce is a must have .
The chicken Thai soup is delicious. 
You can choose any rice and noodles and you wont be disappointed . Just an advice if you want some extra spice ask for the momo sauce.

Well, I went to this cafe yesterday with my friends, Chinese here is good, for starters we ordered Drums of Heaven, it was just perfect and in the main course we took Mixed Noodles,Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken, the chicken could have been could better , rest everything was good.

The Restaurant is not that big, but the ambiance is good and so is the hospitality,the pocket pinch is not way too much, all in all Liked it.

A very very favourite place of mine..serves awesome authentic chinese with a different flavour in every dish. A must try for chinese lovers. Extremely pocket friendly with average ambiance.
Their crispy fried chicken with cashew nuts and curry leaves is my favourite..my craving for the unique tangy flavour of this particular dish brings me to this place again and again.

A really nice place to go where you can eat your fill and within a reasonable price.
The interiors have been renovated and looks polished.
The common chinese dishes are lovely and live up to their reputation. Highly recommended if you are looking for simple and no nonsensical food.

Located near CIT Road on the main road. This place serves a variety of Chinese cuisine. It basically specialises in Chinese cuisine. Great ambience.
The food is pretty good.
Service is fast.
Pocket friendly.
Home Delivery service is also good.
I had ordered chicken hakka noodles, chilli chicken, vegetable fried rice and Prawn Arabian Salt & Pepper. And to my surprise, the Prawn Arabian Salt & Pepper was really sinful. It was really delicious. Other foods were also good. But i will suggest if anyone evers wants to have prawn, try it at CIT cafe, its worth it.

Probably one of the restaurants in the town I love to visit. the food here is awesome. The serve the tangra Chinese food. It's really good. The restaurant is very busy even in the weekdays and for weekends u will probably hav to wait for a minimum of 45-60 mins.
But the wait is worth it. The mix rice with szechwan chicken is exceptional.
I would hav probably rated 5 but the reason I rated 4 was becoz my last visit which was about 2 weeks back was a disaster.
I was there with my friends and had ordered for the drums of heaven and two soups. We waited for an hour but the food was not served. When we enquired it with the server his reply stuck me. He said that cit cafe is a very busy restaurant and it takes time to prepare the food. When I wanted to see the manager, the manager was missing. After waiting for disgusting half an hour we stepped out and the manager didn't even bother to address us.
A bit of changes is required in the attitudes of the server.

I went there with my friends. We had heard about its quality food at reasonable price. For starters, we ordered the chicken drums of heaven. It was crispy & tasted good. In soup, the chicken sweet corn with veggies soup was delicious. For the main course, we ordered egg-wrapped fried rice and Shanghai chicken and it was yummy. So if you want a filling meal at reasonable prices, this is definitely a pick.

I went here for lunch today with my mother and was surprised to see it's striking resemblence with Calcutta Bistro, Jadavpur. When we asked them if there was any connection between the two, they confirmed that it was under the same owner and like brother sister outlets. The difference I noticed regarding the menu was that this place only serves Chinese.
We sat upstairs where the lights were in a combination which made the place look a little too dim. But the place is neat and homely just like the other restaurant. The staff was extremely polite as well.
We ordered the Chicken sweet corn soup and divided one plate into two and it tasted great, may be more because it had been a long time since I had soup. I am not much fascinated with Chinese cuisine. In main course we ordered Singapore chow mein which was loaded with chicken, egg, prawn along with a poach on top and Fish Hunan as side dish. I loved the Fish Hunan as it was not very spicy or blunt and the fish was fresh. The food quality is good and the quantity here is huge. For deserts we settled for pineapple sundae. The sundae could be called a tutti fruity as it had pieces of mango, apple, pineapple with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and one scoop of strawberry ice cream and two different type of syrups. But I liked it.
This place is good for a casual dinning experience.

This restaurant is quite old located in between park circus padmapukur and anandapally. Firstly location wise the restaurant is located in a good place and also parking available on the main road itself but have to adjust yourself. Next comes the interior and space of the restaaurant, it has got many sections here and there but neat and clean n nice; little bit of clumpsy as the ceiling is bit low. Now coming on the food part, the main part. We orderd for Honey glazed chicken and fried fish with french fries for starter and CIT special MeiFoon for main course. Honey glazed chicken was crispy and juicy but the outer coating was too sweet and after having two u will just like to have a whole green chilli to change ur taste bud  sensation. Any ways quantity wise it was good for two. Now the second starter fried fish with chips/french fries was nothing other than our famous bengali fish fry. The fish was good in taste and seemed it was bombay bhekti. Again quantity two pieces big and slice was good. Now the mei foon/rice noodles was awesome in taste. Perfectly cooked and we enjoyed the food. But quantity oh my god one bowl can be consumed by three person easily with these starters. 
After all these best part comes the worst part that is service. The serivce of the restayrant is very poor, not that the waiters are ill mannered but they serve food after waiting for an hour post placing order. We orderd for starter at 7:45pm and we were served with the first starter exactly at 8:50pm then 9:30pm the next starter then 9:50pm the main course. 
Most amazing part was we orderd for mocktail some mango pulp thing, they forgot about the order and at the last when we aksed them to cancel the order if not prepared, then they are saying No Sir, Its ready now you have to take it. I was disappointed, first of all did nt get the mocktail at rght time and also the other service while the food quality n quantity was so good.
Food  - 4.5
Service - 2

Pleas improve ur service n customer management, your restaurant will become popular.

Will try to visit again when I will have the whole day time for eating at restaurant.

Since I had no clue about good food in Kolkata, my relatives took me to CIT cafe. I was wondering what did CIT mean? And here my sister told me it meant Calcutta Improvement Trust. Quite a unique name I must say. Well, When I entered, I absolutely Cherished the Ambience since it was calm and cool inside. There were stairs that led us to the sitting area. And finally we had our menu in front of us. 

 My visit to Kolkata was amazingly satisfied and accomplished after having food here. They serve the most Authentic Chinese food and since Chinese is my favourite food, I loved it. It was lip smacking, delicious, yummy and up to the mark. ‚ù§‚ù§

What we ordered - 
üîπChicken Hot N Sour Soup - Absolutely amazing. I almost looked over again to see even if a sip was left. Haha but it got over soon. The quantity was amazing. The chicken was well diced and the veggies were blended with the chicken perfectly. It was hot, sour and spicy. Loved it. üçΩ‚ù§

üîπHoney Chilly Babycorn - These crispy babycorns were yummilicious.üçΩ‚ù§ I have never had such authentic chinese my entire life. It had all the typical chinese flavors with right amount of honey and spice. 

üîπ For the main course, we ordered Gravy Chow - Well, this was the show stopper. Lip smacking, Drooling and Delicious. üòçüòç Served in a bowl, the noodles were mixed with gravy containing eggs, chicken, fish and prawns in small amount. The gravy was amazing and this fusion was just perfect. 

Goodluck üòá

We ordered nonveg fried wantons for starter and chicken noodles, chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken and hunan chicken for main course. The quantity was huge. Quality wise okay. Not very delectable though. Staff were very helpful. Service was bit slow. An okayish experience.

Chicken sweet corn soup was too bad, thick without any traces of chicken in it. Please don't go for that.
Crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce was awesome.
Drumstick was also good.
Egg wrapped f rice and chicken meifoons were tooooo good!!
Loved it
They serves main course better than starters.
Also the quantity is too good, one plate serves 3.

This place is located at Anandapalit beside Executive Tower. 
I've been here a number of times.  This place remains crowded maximum times.  
Staffs are a bit disappointing,  sometimes they serve wrong dishes to wrong table.  Fortunately I haven't face this. 

Some foods are must try. We ordered Crispy babycorn,  crispy  chicken as starters which were tasty.
 For main course we ordered Egg wrapped fried rice which was served uniquely.  Singapore Rice tastes good too . Ordered Sesame Chicken with Chillies and Honey, which was good. I loved Thai chicken.
Fish lovers should try crispy fish in lemon and coriander sauce. 
I can visit this place again and again avoiding the rush hours.

The pepper chicken was cooked well , although I found the Chinese elements to be lacking in it. The Hong Kong noodles were really good , and was served with a fried egg and salad. The noodles seemed to be fried and tasted amazing. 
The staff is helpful and the prices are good enough. The ambience is not that great and has limited seating.

Visited this place today in search of Chinese food.
First of all the cafe looks shit and the staff out there are very arrogant.
Next comes food, so we ordered a starter of chicken which was not good at all and the it seems like the chicken was just fried and served and then I ordered Thai basil rice which tasted like it has been made 3-4 days back and the chicken in it smells so bad and with that was Hunan chicken which was also very less in quantity and didn't tasted well.
So,I have decided this was my last visit to this so called cit cafe.

This place is located on CIT road. Location is prime and the restaurant looked good so i visited this place. But i was highly DISAPPOINTED with the services. It was a total mess. Orders were not delivered on time. Someone else's order was served to someone else. This was not just with me but with others people of the restaurant too. No co-ordination between the managers, waiters and chefs.
Food was bad. There was no chicken in chicken fried rice. Although it was added when we complained to the manager. Chicken was good.
Please improve your management services.
Highly Disappointing!

I've been in this restaurant twice. The food is delicious. I love their pan fried chilli fish. But the staff were too cold. They need to cooperate with the customers a bit more. The ambience is also average. Nothing special to mention. The restaurant is worth a choice for quick bites. But wouldn't recommend the place for someone who is looking to spend some quality time.

.5 deducted for extremely slow service.Coming to the food its extremely zesty and the flavours are distinct to attract the saliva..The soup and chicken drumsticks are awesome..Fish mandarin is very crispy and the gravy is appetizing..but the most disappointing part was butter noodles..very yucky..

After a lot of coaxing from my GenX cousin and hype, stepped inside only to find defiance to welcome and hospitality in arrogant staff - Waiting while we decided on menu appeared to be an obligation on the guest...

Never experienced sweet Chinese cuisine and hence intrigued to dwell further continued to explore hell - guess this was another innovation of Chinese food blended in Bengali way of cooking (purely my opinion) - having been presented to by several famed Chinese restaurants in the country...

Culminating in the defiant response of the waiter"  This is how we make Chinese food and an unsaid exhibit of how many Chinese variety would you know..?"

But if you have hard earned money and value quality explore the city for better - you will find plenty and leave this place to Gen X to pass away time...

It's a second home for me! Located at my locality hardly 5 minutes from my house!  Staff's behavior are good! I have it's food twice to thrice a week!  Food is great here,  all the dishes  are good except some chicken side dishes which are not up-to the mark!  Deserts are equally good!  Mixed egg wrapped  rice is a must taste one.  Shanghai chicken  is excellent!   Quantity is more than enough !  Keep up the taste of the food.

My mother is an arthritis patient. They made her sit for more than an hour for giving the dishes (bill pic) attached.
I am allergic to prawn. Inspite of telling them not to add prawn to the dishes they added prawn.
I had to manage eating this by removing prawn at home but felt a bit sick. Discovered that there were prawns after opening‚Äã the package. FYI. This could have been fatal for me.
Requesting a refund in 24 hrs before i escalate the case in the press officially. 
All proofs are present.

This place is located near Park Circus.
Quick service, staffs are very active and they would offer to serve you everytime you are serving. Appreciated the gesture. 
Coming to the food they have their very own chinese taste of food.
Ordered pan fried noodles and honey glazed chicken wings.
The noodles were over fried and they should consider thicker noodles at least for the pan fried one than the thinner one.
And honey glazed chicken wasn't a showstopper either.
It was a bit sticky and it tasted just average.

This was one of the first restaurants to open on C.i.t. rd that serves good Chinese food. Believe it or not there is a long wait outside sometimes. Small and cozy, it has a decent decor and large portions of Food. I've been there a couple of times but mostly do home delivery. Try different things, ask for the description before ordering, it always helps to get an idea of the dish before hand.

Well this has been one place which I have been visiting frequently for almost the past two years. This restaurant is underrated but serves delicious meals .The ambience has levelled up especially after the renovation. The only low point they had was the amount of time they took to serve, but now the issue has been resolved. Chinese foods here are a delight along with the mocktails. Will be visiting again.

Went there with 3 of my friends. Resturant was quite comfy. But nothing special in decor.

Coming to orders, they really take hell lot of time to serve you. Staff members were cordial & friendly.

We ordered 1. Crispy Fish in Lemon & Coriander Sauce 2. Kung Pao Chicken 3. Chicken Mongolian Rice 4. Mixed gravy noodles 5. Chicken Peanut Butter Noodles. 6. Tempura Prawn

Fish was really tasty. üòç The best of the six dishes.
The Prawn was also delicious. Liked the Mongolian Rice Also. 

Kung Pao Chicken & Mixed gravy noodles were pretty below average actually.
Didn't like Peanut Butter Noodles. Chicken pieces could hardly be discovered in it üòí
Portions were really huge. Thumbs up for that.
Dishes seemed little overpriced but quality of items and portions can make up for that.

Overall nice experience. Recommended for Chinese lovers. Don't miss the Fish & Prawn items. I feel they should improve the noodle items. üòë

You will find the best chinese food in town as far as budget is concerned. This is at the CIT Road slightly ahead from the Chittaranjan Hospital. Food here is too good and cheap. The Restraunt is small in size. The only cons to speak about is its service management. You need to sit back and wait for atleast 1 hr for your ordered food.

One of the best food joints in Park Circus area apart from the famous Mughlai restaurants.¬†

Overall, 4.5/5 and about food, its finger-licking good here, so 4.5/5.

And the quantity is huge... 1 plate of fried rice would be more than enough for two people...¬†
Food offered here is just awesomeee and their Chinese stuffs are the best... Don't at all forget to try them and do visit the restaurant at least once and you would keep visiting.

Ambiance- 4/5
Not very good but decent enough for kitty parties, friend meetups and small celebrations.

Service-4.5/5
Service is good and the staffs are courteous too. Highly recommended.

This is one of my favorite chinese restaurants. We used to visit this place frequently in school days since it's just a few step away from my high school. We still go there for reunions, birthday treats or dinner during puja. However the place is very crowded and you'll have to wait for hours to get a table if you go there during puja days or holidays. But the food is really good and the prices are pocket friendly. Singpore Rice is the best dish in their menu. It's a must try. The starters are also good and sufficient in quantity. However, I don't like the behaviour of the staffs. The last time I went there with my friends for a school reunion, the waiter started giving details of every dish even after we said we know about it. He also asked personal questions and was a lil over friendly. 
But overall it's worth a try. :)

But the dessert part , to be honest the ice cream was not at all good in taste, if u are a dessert people like us u will be disappointed. To sum it up in short words , in budget good food well portion.

As the name suggests, located on CIT road near Park Circus. Has a noticeable entrance. The seating area is clean and well maintained. They have kept it simple yet soothing. The staff attended us courteously. Coming to the food, it is value for money,ample in quantity and great in taste. We ordered crispy chilly babycorn and drums of heaven for starters. Babycorn was perfectly cooked ,spicy and crispy. Chicken pieces in drums of heaven were well cooked. Then they fetched us our entr√©e which consisted of vegetable meifoon , chicken meifoon, paneer in hot garlic sauce , fish hunan and chicken fried rice. Each and every dish was good. Especially the meifoon are a must try here. The garlic sauce was well cooked with the right amount of flavours. Fish hunan was fresh . Fried rice was tasty as well. This place is worth a try. Good ambience and perfect place to dine in with family or friends.

The pricing is also very moderate compared to the quantity and quality. One plate of noodles or rice is more than enough for 2 people, even 3. You might have to wait a tad bit for your dishes, but boy are they worth it. Definitely give this place a visit

We ordered crispy chicken for starters, Hongkong Fried rice and one more chicken main course dish, the food was really tasty, good quantity, awesome service and most important, pocket friendly. You may not get the exact Chinese food taste as you will get in restaurants in Chinatown but you wont regret ¬†to have this little bit Indian version of Chinese dishes over here. Overall we all enjoyed a lot.

Cit cafe is a comfy and neat dining place. Good food and good ambience. The service was good as well....the food was served soon.....menu has lot of varieties and most of the items are delicious.... Plus the advantage is that the place is very pocket friendly.... I won't feel a pinch paying the bill. A good place to have some Chinese without burning a hole in your pocket. Cheers!!

Awesome food and cool ambience. People are cordial. Food tastes good cleanliness is also good. Only gripe is if they can improve more in crowd management during peak hours it would 5/5. Seats can be reserved for larger crowd on the basis of early info and little token amount. Service is noticeably good with larger crowd also.

Cit cafe is a comfortable and well maintained dining place although they take a lot of time to serve the food. 
I really like the red pepper garlic fish here. Its really delicious. Cit cafe used to prepare better quality food earlier, the standard has gone down a bit.

Living in CIT Road, this place has been our food hub ever since I can remember. Quality is superb, one of the best Chinese I have had, to be honest.
Quantity, quality and taste is superb. Everything is neat and clean, the ambience is good as well.
Staff is cooperative as well. Only downside is, the food takes sometime to be served after you order, and that can be annoying. But, they make the food as you order, and it's fresh, so it sums it up for me. Will always be my top priority, anywhere and anytime.

Ambience , quality and quantity, all three parameters were extremely well maintained by their staff. Staff were really friendly and they even suggested us what to try, given that the menu was a bit rattling to us. Food was served without much delay, and the food was totally a bang for your buck. To all those students and people on a tight budget, the food will surely not disappoint you, and a big thumbs up for the service that they are providing at this particular restraunt. Cheers.

Located at a decent place on CIT Road at Anandapalit. I have visited there several times with my girlfriend, my students and also with my family. The quality of food they serve is actually of very good standards without hurting your pocket to much. The restaurant is nicely decorated but little bit crowded. The service is slow because they have a home delivery section. So it takes almost one and half to two hours to finish a full course meal.

Recommended by my mom,  having transitioned from a cafe mostly inhabited by students to a proper restaurant. 
Went on panchami, greeted with a packed restaurant where we had to wait 15 mins for a seat and another half an hour for the food to arrive. 
However,  both the veg fried rice and the kungpao chicken tasted excellent. 
Pocket pinch was decent, totalling 390 including tax.. Ambience was also okayish. 
But the plates seemed dirty and we had to use paper napkins to wipe them clean ourselves. 
Overall, would recommend a visit,  if you got time on your hands.

The way the waiters were behaving was simply disgusting, they were throwing spoons and forks on the table..as if we are sitting in a langar. The food was good but the service was not up to the mark. The waiters should learn how to tackle Puja crowds. They were taking too much of time to get the food on the table ( which is seen in normal days as well) Overall I was unsatisfied.

Yesterday after a watching a movie and roaming about in the milan mela felt literally hungry. As this restaurant is in my area so thot of going back to home and have a quick-bite there. The waiter suggested us spicy stir fried chicken with cashew nuts and dry schezuan fish. Both were aawesome. It was lip-smacking. Been here innumerable times and must say both their veg and non veg dishes are very tasty.

This is a very common place for me as this is close to.my aunt's place. First point.. food is served very fresh and hot. My favs are any fish dishes, try the Thai Fish in red sauce. Taste is great, I could have given 4.5 only for the taste of the dishes but here comes the pain.. go there with good amount of time in hand, they keep you waiting really long. I have waited more than 30 mins after ordering. It's very crowded on weekends for dinner so have a time window of 3 hrs minimum. I just wished the management could have done something about it. Else it's a great taste for that price. Again.. please order any fish side dish they are really fresh.  Burp burp.....üòâ

Me and my friends went to this place for lunch. It was pretty easy to locate. For a 'Cafe' its enormity was quite overwhelming! 

Now on to the real deal...
First off, this is a Chinese restaurant.
We had ordered Mixed Hakka Chowmein, Hong Kong Chowmein, Pineapple chicken and Mongolian Chicken.

QUALITY - This was the best part about the food here. Starting from the quality of the noodles to the garnishing of the Chowmein everything was good!
The pineapple chicken was a bit too sweet for my taste but even I couldnt resist it!

QUANTITY - One plate of chowmein was adequate for two persons just as the waiter had suggested. The quantity was really commendable. The chicken side dishes had 8 pieces each.

AMBIENCE - It was a bit dark in my opinion. But overall the place was clean, spacious with proper seating arrangements. No congestion whatsoever.

SERVICE - There was a bit of a delay in arrival of the dishes but were served promptly. The quality of the food made me forget all that in a jiffy! :P

PRICE - In my opinion the price is a bit high. Considering the quality and quantity of the good it can be easily overlooked.

Overall, my first experience was a great one!
Looking forward to coming here to try new dishes.

I will strongly recommend others to give this place a try!

We a group of 5 went here for the lunch. Easily located, two storied....we seated upstairs. The environment was calming with minimalist decor. The serving was okay too. The waiter suggested and informed us about the quantity. Since we went for the lunch we did not order for any starters. We decided to go for main course directly..... we ordered 2 plates of mixed hakka chowmin, 1 plate of hong kong chicken, 1 plate of chicken and pineapple , 1 plate of mongolian chicken. Since we had time in our hands we did not bother about the time they took to serve the food. The chowmins were cooked well. Hong kong chowmin had veggies, corn, chicken and shrimps.. its a bit on the spicy side. So to counter that chicken and pineapple was ordered. This dish is a sweet one, for the ones who likes to avoid sweet food don't try this. The chickens were improperly cooked and tasted like leather. Apart from this mongolian chicken was tossed well and was soft. The quantity is enough for two and chicken pieces were 8 in each of the items. Price is a bit on the high side, but thats you need to pay when you have no other good restaurants nearby. Overall a moderate experience.

The AMBIENCE and the FOOD stands a GOOD BARGAIN compared to the PRICE. The interior is brightly lit and helps in spotting hair on your dish, just kidding, I would anyday prefer dim lighting.


I ordered  a VEG GRAVY NOODLE and FISH with GINGER and VEGGIES. The noodle had a STANDARD TASTE and an IMPRESSIVE QUANTITY. The fish was preety SOFT and tasted GOOD but the gravy with ginger and veggies was a little DISAPPOINTING for it tasted too SALTY.

The square DINNING TABLES are SMALL and managing a couple of plates may be a little challenging.

When you are SHORT ON YOUR BUDGET or wanna GET MORE FOR THE BUCK, I would BLINDLY RECOMMEND CIT for its Rs 500 for 2.

Sorry I forgot to take the pics.

Try to mention it to the waiter not to use it..so that it doesn't affect your brain..anyways this place is just toooo emotional for me. Hats off to such a great restro :)

I ordered for food and after waiting for 1hr45mins I got the delivery. There was a drastic mistake they have made with the orders that I placed. They missed 3 food items and instead of non veg they gave me some veg items. When I tried to talk to the manager they refused to accept and behaved rudely. Worst service and worst food. I would never order from here ever again.

Being a resident of Ballygunge, CIT Cafe has been in my wishlist for quite a long time. Finally I managed to visit it last week on a weekday. It is located on the main road and we had no difficulty in finding the restaurant. It was around 3 PM in the afternoon, and me and my friend had to wait for around 15 minutes to get a table. The restaurant is very popular with students, young professionals, families, because it serves awesomely delicious food at affordable prices. 

We ordered the following:
1. Pan Fried Chilli Fish: The preparation and taste were wonderful. The crispiness was right. However to our shock, the first piece of fish was too tough to be a fish, and was in fact chicken. When we complained, our server refused to believe and was adamant that it could not happen. He then used a spoon to cut another piece and showed us that it was fish, which was later proved to be chicken when I showed them the fibrous chicken meat. If the staff of a restaurant cannot differentiate between fish and chicken, it shows how ignorant they are. Out of six pieces, half were chicken. Sorry CIT Cafe, first impression's the last one.

2. Egg Hakka Noodles: Fine. Huge quantity. More than enough for two.

3. The Alarm Firecracker Chicken: Nicely made with lots of bell peppers in a mild spicy sauce.

This is a casual restaurant: lack of decoration, cramped chairs and dim lights. If you're around the area go there when you're hungry. The quantity and price will surely delight you. However, they need to be careful about the orders. Casual restaurant shouldn't mean casual and negligent service.

My orders mostly consist of mixed gravy noodles
Hunan chicken, Thai chicken, sechezwan chicken, shanghai chicken, three alarm firecracker chicken, mixed fried rice or Singapore fried rice or honk Kong fried rice or sechezwan fried rice. That's it. Everything is super tasty. Keep up the good work. The only thing is the place is a bit small.

Before I actually start to review this place I would rather add some of my thoughts.

This is a 'para,(bengali for locality, if I'm correct) restaurant. This is " MY para" restaurant. (Lets call it a P-restaurant, shortens it up, eh). 
Yeah,so.. According to me a P restaurant is somewhere people flock to when they do not want to cook their lunch, but still crave for amazing food without burning a hole in their pockets. 
A place where people can enter in their boxers, have a hearty lunch and return back to their homes for some sound sleep. (If u see me there, dont hesitate to say hi :P; anyways) 

CIT Cafe for me is this kind of place. 

I've been to it a lot, my parents have been to it a lot and over the years the food has been consistent. 
The ambience is great, and as a matter of fact it has skyrocketed since its start. 

The food is great. The pricing is precise, the quantity ample. Yeah, overall its an amazing experience. 
My star dishes :- 
THE CLASSIC CHILLI CHICKEN( they call me Vaibhav, Vaibhav Oldschool. ) 
FRIED RICE( my basis of ranking Chinese restaurant) 
PAN FRIED NOODLES( my newly discovered love ‚ù§Ô∏è).
The best way to combine them, EXECUTIVE LUNCH. 
Unlike other combos, this has ample quantity for a person, at the right price. 
Do try this place out. I highly recommend it. 
Anything with which you are not satisfied. Feel free to comment below. 
Happy dining.

We settled for crispy fish with lemon corriender sauce..mongolian drumstick and butter noodles..every item were so high standard that we can easily compare this restro wid other chinese big giants.. no harm in doing that I can assure .and one more thing one dish can be easily shared with 2 people also pocket pinch is quite affordable.. .one thing they need to improve is the service..the time they take to serve the dish is quite annoying ...otherwise cool place to hang out..

The long queue of the people and the cars outside this restaurant, almost every evening, gives a clear picture of how popular this place is. No idea about the decor and the service, as I have had their food via home delivery only, during small parties and gatherings. The packaging is good and the quantity is sufficient. The entire menu is pretty cheap in comparison to the quality and the quantity.

Coming to the food. Have tried the dishes including shanghai chicken, fried wantons, butter prawns, Hunan prawns, schezwan chicken, mixed hakka noodles, special rice noodles and chicken basil fried rice, and honestly, liked them all. The flavour is subtle and authentic. Nothing over the top, but pretty decent. The prawns served aren't jumbo prawns, but are good in size. Overall, a good food experience.

Its a place where I have visited multiple times during my college days with my loved ones till the initial phase of my professional life. But gradually this place somehow had faded away from my culinary map without any specific reason.Finally last week I visited after a gap of more than 5years.

Their Indo Chinese preparations have always delighted me. Drums of heaven, pepper fish, thai chicken have been my favourites. The same old savour made me nostalgic.

They have undoubtedly maintained their standard. It is still extremely pocket friendly as it used to be .The ambience is simple yet comfortable. Extravaganza is not always required if the food is really good. I realized that this restaurant does not deserve to sink into oblivion just because I have been wowed by numerous posh restaurants over the years.

Another go to place. Its just serving some fantastic classic calcutta Chinese and acing the comfort food angle of it.

If I ever want a lazy evening at home, I know I'm calling CIT, its a personal and family favourite.

Almost didn't want to write a review so that they don't get more famous, because their wait time for delivery and place is already too long!!!

Excellent restaurant for dining out near ladies park . They serve only Chinese cuisine . They have combo lunch and dinner . Their Manchurian is very delicious so are the pan fried noodles .crispy chilly  Babycorn is just average . They don't have a bar . Seating is divided in 2 sections . They should serve come cans instead of pouring in glasses as most of the fizz of my cold drink was gone and they refused to replace it . Overall a good place

I have been to this place a few times, but this is the first time I'm writing a review.
the ambience and the service is just spot on
now for the food.
we ordered:
honey glazed chicken- it was the perfect balance of hot and sweet chicken wings with toasted nuts. (4/5)
pepper chicken: 8 boneless strips of chicken. i found it to be quite dry and also it was served without any kind of sauce or dip which was disappointing.(2.5/5)
american chopsuey: it was a sheer classic. a sensation for the taste buds.(4.5/5)
cafe special meinfoin(rice noodles): the noodles was really thin and light. also the dish was a little light on spices which was to my liking.(4/5)

I have been here several times but this is the 1st time i am writing a review for it. Well i will skip the location and ambience bcoz when it comes to good food ambience hardly matters. 
Well were two people and had gone for dinner and were really hungry.
For starters we ordered Drums of heaven and pan fried momo. Now coming to drums of heaven .. its quiet a common dish in every chinese restaurant bt m sure for the foodies very few of them can satisfy you with the actual taste i wont name other restaurants but yes this one hits the list among the satisfiers, and Pan fried momos wallah they were nicely cooked, juicy and delicious. 
For the main course we ordered One mixed hakka chow and one schezwan chow. so one was a normal one and another one was little more spicy. so to go with it nd maintain the balance of normal nd spicy we ordered one Stir fried chicken and brocolli in oyester sauce and THREE ALARM FIRE CRACKER CHICKEN. 
I must admit as i like my food a bit more spicy schezwan is my thing nd these guyz r really good in schezwan dishes be it main course noodles or a simple schezwan chicken its just fabulous. chicken in oyster sauce was okayish and gentle to our taste buds. Now the main attraction was the dish i mentioned in bold letters.. yes that one is not fr the faint hearted. let me tell u first i love my food to be hot nd spicy nd it was just the opposite fr my friend so i ordered the dish just bcoz the name was very attractive and ofcourse fr experimentation. 
As the name suggests THREE ALARM FIRE CRACKER CHICKEN (again in bold)¬† the dish actually that HOT and the name itself rings the bells. When I took the 1st bite it seemed quiet okay and felt a lot of flavours immediately rolling over my tongue nd a pinge of hotness u can easily handle (that was the 1st alarm) on my 2nd bite the hotness increased and then u can actually feel the chillies nd sauces used fr this one (this was the 2nd alarm) i had to order a lime soda to reduce the flames.. on my 3rd bite i got burst out nd the chillies were just popping in my mouth nd there goes the 3rd bell nd i felt hot fumes coming out frm my ears. I mean yes it was damn hot but i really loved it it was just amazing a dish which act¬† as very few restaurants do dare to make a dish this Hot . i wld love to have it again bt yes wld order the lime soda before. 
Nd yes the staffs were too frndly and prompt at their services.

Favourite of all the restaurants close to my area. Really good chinese. I prefer it more than China Town.
Not very spacious but good decor and humble staffs. Only drawback, it takes too long for the food to arrive after placing the order.¬†

I LIKE THEIR: Chicken Thai Soup. That very fresh and soothing flavour of lemon.. I just love it! Chicken hot & sour soup is also good. For starters, Carribean Drumsticks, Pepper chicken. Drums of heaven too. For main course, my favourite is Crispy Fish in Lemon Coriander Sauce. I absolutely love it (in spite of the fact that I'm not, at all, a fish person)! Shanghai Chicken. Shaoxiang Chicken with Cashew Nuts and Chilies. For rice, Mongolian Fried Rice and Chili Garlic Fried Rice (both chicken). For noodles, both Mixed Hakka and Gravy Chow mein (the quantity is very good, one bowl of rice/noodles can very well serve 2 people).

I DON'T LIKE THEIR: There are very few dishes in C.I.T. Cafe that I have not liked! Although, I found some dishes "ok-ok". To name some, Chicken Steamed or Pan Fried Momo. Fried Chicken. Singapore Chow mein is the only one dish I can remember not liking.

Located on CIT Road. You'll find this on the roadside making it convenient to locate.

The decor is simple and pleasant. The ambience is good. Seating arrangements are comfortable.

Fresh Lime Soda was properly done.
Caribbean Drum Stick was good. So was the Prawn Arabian Salt and Pepper. Both were really good.

Staffs are quick and efficient. At the same time, this place is pocket friendly.

However, a good place to have Chinese with no holes being made in your pockets. Good to visit. :)

Located off CIT Road. A prominent place on the main road.

A very decent place with simple interiors. Nothing great to fancy about.

The food is also pretty simple, more like some home food taste.
With the quality, lots of praise to the amazing quantity served. A bowl of Noodles can serve 3 people full.¬†
No qualms regarding the taste of items.

Being a typical place, the service gives a bit of negative opinion. At rush times there is a long long delay and a bit of rude behaviour.¬†

Overall worth the pocket pinch. Absolutely.

This place has been revamped and if you pass by anandapalit road you will always see a line outside in the evening. So that is definitely a good sign for any restaurant. 
The restaurant has a first floor and a ground floor section. 
The food they serve is really good and huge in quantity. The dry chili fish is a must try for everyone. The rice and noodles and the mains are made well with proper seasoning.

Had just returned from a getaway to a beach in Mandarmani, and since it was a long drive off to the place, we all were super tired and hungry. I took to Zomato to search for nearby restaurants which delivers to my address, and this Chinese restaurant, I found, to be good by reviews in Zomato, so happened to place an order with them. 
I ordered one plate of Pan Fried Momos, one plate Shrimps in Garlic and butter, one Veg sweet Corn soup and one Chicken Sweet Corn Soup. 
The ordered was supposed to be delivered within 45 minutes, but it took an hour and a half for the order to get delivered to my address. It was a long waiting time and thats what disappointed me in the first place.
Secondly, they had a criteria that the minimum order value has to be ‚Çπ500, and moreover they charged VAT and other service charges to make the bill to be priced higher. 
The food was delivered warm. The chicken sweet corn soup tasted well, with all ingredients in perfect proportion and taste. 
The Veg sweet corn soup disappointed me big time. Total waste! There were chopped vegetables but the quantity was less, and the soup was too thin and watery. Tasted pale and worst!
The Garlic Shrimps I loved! It tasted decent enough. The shrimps were in good quantity and the gravy was thick and tasty.
The Pan Fried momos were way too spicy. Too oily. And tasted okay-ish. Another disappointment!

Had been here for the 1st time when I used to be in school. Our principal took a few of our council members to celebrate a TTIS win.
Close to Entally Market, in anandapalit. And now after 5 years, I still go back to this place whenever I'm close by.

Well Chinese happens to be my weakness. I have this habit of visiting every Chinese joint be it small or big that I come across. CIT Cafe serves good Chinese food if not the best. Their signature dish the Three alarm fire cracker chicken is pleasing to the taste buds. I have had one of the best Fried Momos here. The chicken lollipop however was not a favorite. The quality of food is good although service is a little slow. The ambience is pretty chilled out and quite a nice place to dine at with friends or family.

Considering my love for Chinese food, I have this uncanny desire of visiting every food joint in my city that offers Chinese. So I hopped, skipped and jumped with my friends one fine afternoon to this place. The seating arrangements were good enough but dimly lit which was fine with us. We went about ordering dishes such as Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Pan Fried Chicken, Fish Mandarin, Thai Chicken Basil FriedRice, Mixed meifoon as well as Mixed Hakka Chowmein. To our surprise all our excitement died down when we had to wait for long before the food arrived. Moreover, the starters were cold which irritated us to the core. Coming to the main course, the taste was just not upto the mark. Chinese in other food joints serves far better food than the one I had here. The meifoon tasted good but the fish and chicken just did not tempt me. Its garnishing wasn't appealing. Overall, it did fill us to the brim and is quite economical considering their prices. But sadly, I didn't like what they served. Hope to visit again and try out some other dishes hoping for something magical this time round.

My cousins from mumbai  were in kolkata for sometime and i was supposed to take them to a good -in -taste as well as good -on -pocket chinese restaurant.. so you understand it was a matter of responsibilty üòåüòâ so after rummaging through the reviews on zomato i decided on this one.. 
AMBIENCE- A comparatively small and neatly decorated place with seating arrangement  both downstairs and upstairs consisting of sofa and wooden chairs.. 
SERVICE: Waiting staff though busy( place was crowded even at late hours) were responsive and patiently helped us with the menu.. Food was served within 20 mins of order.. 
FOOD: We ordered- 
PAN FRIED CHICKEN- Flat pieces of boneless chicken perfectly fried not to lose its juice and was quite delicious..must eat starter
DRUMS OF HEAVEN- I couldnt try their carribean version of drums but this was good too , a bit oily though..
CHILLI PRAWN- bit disappointed with this one.. it seemed prawns were not fresh letting out a characterstic odour and taste from it.. 
CHILLI GARLIC NOODLES
HUNAN CHICKEN
Noodles was spicy and perfect in taste but again on the oily side.. But the taste  was very good so it didnt bother me much.. Hunan chicken with its sauce not so heavy on the palette went well with the noodles.. 
DRINK- For me drinks  are very important part of any meal.. so ( aadat se majboor) i ordered FROZEN MANGO, SUMMER COOL and POLAR BEAR.. i wont even go into details because all of them were disaster.. Toooo sweet.. injured my sweet side of the toungueüòÖ i even had to add more soda to one of them.. a big letdown there.. 
PRICE- ‚Çπ1800 including tax.. for 5 of us.. so this was the best part.. ( and my cousins were happy.. yay! )

What should i say about this place. Every time i have availed their service, they have always found ways to rekindle the memory in me that has stuck with me from the day a chubby little kid of about 4 years stepped into this restaurant. Utterly excited about his maiden dinner outing (my parents used to be a resident of pottery road area and cit cafe was our only decent chinese stop within a km back then). One might say nostalgia has affected my verdict but i would assure them it has not. Last evening when we decided to drop by there it was a calling of an old habit. As we entered the place i re-admired how the small mezzanine seater eatery has expanded to its base and the next floor. Until a few years back the manager used to smile on seeing us. sadly he is no more ( i mean he has been replaced). We seated ourselves and as we were pondering over the menu an inviting man stepped up and offered his suggestions. He was quite at ease and fluently described the dishes piping in recommendations. We settled for the drunken noodles, hong kong fried rice, shanghai chicken and the star dish of the evening crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce. (my mother was somewhat wary of the coriander going with spices but she was assured of the contrary and my she was satisfied). Having eaten our fill and greatly praising the food, the attention and the service we left with huge grins on our face and a handsome tip for the waiter. 

P.S. - having been a regular to china town too i will place cit cafe among the top flight of chinese eateries in the city. 

Cit cafe, I owe you my allegiance.

I have read so many good reviews about this place. Being an avid fan of Chinese, how could I not try this? I dropped in with my wife on a weekday evening. The place is located exactly at bus stop called anandapalit, which is around 5-6 stops from park circus. The outside is decorated with lights, and the interior is divided into an upper and lower section. Being a weekday also the place was quite full, and we sat downstairs. I ordered for minimal menu as I have read that portions are quite large here. So, the order was fish mofato, cafe special meifoon, and shaoxiang chicken. The d√©cor inside the place is neat, nothing fancy. The waiter was polite and helpful. Our order came after 10 mins. The mofato was soft, delicate and good in taste. Meifoon was good too and enough for 2 hungry souls. It was full of chicken, egg, mushroom, prawn and babycorn. The shaoxiang chicken was little salty in taste when tastes alone. But it was pairing up well with the meifoon. The waiter said the much salty taste was due to oyester sauce. After this, we were quite full and had city of joy mocktail and a lime soda. That made us fuller, and I felt of sleeping for sometime after a full stomach and tiring weekday. The bill came higher than expectations, around 20% tax addition was there.
The menu seemed so similar to Calcutta Bistro in Jadavpur area, and tastewise also they are near. I wonder if this is featured in Great Chinese, then why not Bistro. And then, talking of pocket friendliness, this is not so cheap or low priced. Or gone are our days of pocket friendliness?
You can always try this place. Good one and recommended.

This restaurant was in, my wish list for a long time,so I managed to go there on 08.04.2016.
We sat downstairs ambiance is simple and attractive especially the vase with a rose...
The staff was very good he recommended us to have lemon coriander crispy fried fish in starters.. 
Trust me it was the best starter I ever had before especially the coriander sauce üëå and the fish was fresh and crispy.. 
Then we ordered main course:
*Egg wrapped rice( egg wrapped rice tossed with egg,shredded chicken and prawns)- enough for 2people.
*General T'Os chicken(chicken crispy balls tossed with sauce and served with sesame seeds)- 8 pieces and less gravy..
          I didn't like to eat the egg wrapped rice because it was wrapped so beautifully that I kept on asking the staff "how did you make this?" Anyways it was very tasty the quality and quantity was enough for us..
Chicken balls was crispy fried however I didn't like the sauce because of the dark soya sauce..
Noted:
The staff was very caring he served us in a very good way I'm pleased with their customer service...
Love to visit again CIT CAFE üëç

This is inevitably one of the best Chinese food places that I have ever visited. CIT cafe was suggested by a friend who had promised to take us there for more than six months now but work kept us so busy that we just couldn't squeeze out any time. Finally we did and went in today for lunch. And yes, it was worth the wait.

The ambiance is quite comfortable with a combination of sofas and high-backed chairs. There are seating arrangements both downstairs and upstairs. Since we were six people we were asked to sit towards the inside part of the upstairs arrangement which suited us fine as we were also quite a loud group.

Coming to the food. We had ordered chicken spring rolls for starters while the main course consisted of chicken butter noodles, thai chicken basil fried rice, mixed pan fried noodles, shaoxiang chicken with cashew nuts and mongolian chicken along with sweet lime soda. Although there was an assortment of dishes, each of them had a distinct taste and was very different from the various other (indian) chinese restaurants that we had visited. My personal favourite was the butter noodles. Lightly-tossed noodles with parsley both smelt and tasted heavenly. The shaoxiang chicken complemented the dish pretty well although I am told that it tastes quite well even with the mongolian chicken.

Overall, I am in love with this place and cannot thank my friend enough for introducing me to it. The pocket-pinch is not that much and suited well with the always half-empty pockets of us students. Another plus point, which I find is a very important thing for me, is that the washroom is really clean. Laugh all you may but you cannot deny its importance especially for women.

I am surely going back to CIT cafe for more.

I visited cit cafe on 4th september 2015..
We had to wait approx 15 mins as it was very crowded..
Decoration was very nice and ambiance was very bad as a group college students were sitting next to us and they were so noisy and annoying.. we were feeling like sitting in an ac room in middle of a fish market and having our lunch.. soooo disgusting..
We ordered Caribian drumsticks which came minimum 40 minutes later and that also after asking them so many times.. Drumstick contained 6 pieces.. it was good in taste but a little bit salty.. Then again we had to wait for main course.. We ordered fried rice and sanghai chicken.. fried rice was good and sanghai chicken was also very good with full of cashew nuts which I liked most..
So I will suggest if any one wants to go cit cafe be prepare u vl need to have enough time in ur hand.. Otherwise food is good.. I vl like to visit this place again..

Fish Moffato is the dish ladies and gentlemen.
Ambrosia it is.
Other starters are good as well.
Schezwan chicken is not very good.
Price is standard.
But they take huge time to present your food, really huge.

An old fan of this place, I have been visiting this place for almost a decade..and like always it still serves you excellent Chinese food. Okay the place to be if you like Chinese food..It really is.. The interiors and decor have been refurbished in the recent past..
My favorites here are
Tom Yum Soup
Chicken Canton Soup
Singapore Chow
Lemon Chicken
Hong Kong Chicken
Chinese Chop suey
Prawn Trestina
Schezwan Chicken
Tutti Fruity
The quantity is also pretty good. The staff have always been very friendly and courteous here.. The only downside which has been a perennial problem of CIT Caf√© is speed of service which is still pretty damn slow.. Barring this small hiccup, I have absolutely no complaints about my perennial favorite :-D

I can safely say that I had the best Chinese food ever today at CIT CAFE. This restuarant near entally had been on my list for quite some time now. And, I finally got to check it off. The restuarant though a bit cramped has a soothing atmosphere with absolutely super comfortable chairs and sofas to sit on. The staff were courteous and very helpful. With their help, we placed a rather huge order which we couldn't finish. The sole reason because, even being food hoggers, we couldn't compete with the huge amount they served us with. We had :
1. drunken noodles; pasta noodles cooked in a spicy way with great chunks of chicken.
2. buttered chicken noodles.
3. chilli garlic noodles.
4. Chef's special meifoon.
5. Mixed meifoon.
6. Three alarm fire cracker chicken.
7.Mongolian Chicken.
8. Sweet and sour chicken.
9. kung pao chicken.
10. Carrebian drumstick.
11. Stir chicken with cashew nut.
The starters were impeccable. And, ALL the main courses were absolutely delicious. We had mocktails and icecream sundae for desserts which also were fantastic.
The ONLY reason I gave a 4.5 instead of a full score was the TREMENDOUSLY slow service. Other than that, CIT CAFE is definitely THE place to enjoy awesome Chinese food. :)

This is one of those places where they serve you delicious lip smacking Chinese food. Their Singapore rice is to die for. This time when I visited the place I had ordered caf√©'s special meifoon, caf√©'s special prawn and shanghai chicken. I had also ordered a summer cooler mocktail which was bad! I would never recommend this drink to anyone! Coming to the food now, all the items were just wow, my personal favourite being the prawn. They tasted amazing. Honestly speaking there are very few places which serve such delicious prawns. This restaurant definitely should definitely be a destination for all Chinese food lovers.

This is nice place for Chinese food. It is conveniently located on CIT road and there is almost always waiting line outside. The food is good and the range is pretty pocket friendly. One can easily hogg without worrying much about the bill. Their Kung Pao chicken is worth trying. Have been visiting this place for quite a long time and it never disappoints.

Uncle used to bring food from CIT,and all dishes were too good. Recently, we went to CIT cafe. Space is not that big,larger areas would be better for gangs.
We ordered drunken noodles,Thai chicken,lemon chicken and one rice.
Thai chicken,I tasted earlier few times, and this time it didn't fail to surprise me with amazing taste. Friends also loved it. Other items were equally good. Some of my friends ordered starters, pan fried chicken. All items were nicely prepared except that pan fried chicken.
Lastly, we all felt happy for good quality of food, and decided to come here again!

Family restaurant with nice interior and huge quantity of indo-Chinese food. This place is an old eatery which however, is neat, clean and well maintained. Situated near anandapalit bus stop, 'CIT Cafe' serves spicy indo-Chinese food. We ordered Hong Kong fried rice and cashewnut chicken. Huge quantity of spicy fried rice was served with a poached egg. The rice was cooked well and tossed in some kind of spicy sauce. Cashewnut chicken was also rich with spices and roasted cashew nuts. The combination was good at the beginning, but the food was too spicy for my palate. Quantity was very large as we literally struggled to finish it up. Service was good. Pricing was moderate. More suitable for larger groups. Recommended for indo-Chinese food lovers.

This is an all time hit for the nearby college goers. The maincourse quantities are humongous at very affordable rates. We ordered
PAN FRIED CHICKEN and MUSHROOM 65 in starters and both were fabulous.
EGG WRAPPED FRIED RICE, DRUNKEN NOODLES (flat noodles with red curry paste) and STIR FRIED FISH WITH GREEN BEANS IN OYESTER SAUCE and three of us overfilled ourselves and had to pack some food too. One portion of noodle is good for 3-4 adult with average appetite.I love the indo chinese cooking here but the food seems to be tad too oily.

Second visit :
Had CARIBBEAN DRUMSTICKS , BUTTER PRAWNS , CHICKEN PEANUT BUTTER NOODLES and

the must try - CRISPY FISH WITH LEMON CORIANDER SAUCE (amazing)
Caramel custard needs improvement.
Overal great place for budget eating üòä

Quite popular a place on CIT Road...this restaurant has carved a niche for itself in recent years. Undoubtedly they serve standard food here. The ambience is up to the mark. The service has improved over the years. We were a group of five....and everyone was highly satisfied to say the least. 
Our order consisted of 
1) Starters:
a) Caribbean Drumstick
b) Fish in Chilly Honey Sauce 
2) Main Course
a) Chicken Schezwan Noodles
b) Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles
c) Cafe Special Fried Rice
d) Hunan Chicken
e) Shaoxiang Chicken with cashew nut and chillies
They serve the noodles and rice in generous amounts...one bowl being sufficient for two voracious eaters or three small eaters. Each item was uniquely done....but there was one which stood out amongst the others and it was the Fish in Chilly Honey Sauce. My suggestion to all foodies will be that if you are at CIT Cafe do try it out. 
Overall a good experience....üëçüëç to CIT Cafe.

Going by the reviews I had read, Schezuan Fried Rice was something I was really looking forward to, and we ordered Chill Pepper Fish. The quantity was very very good, since we were just the 2 of us, we had to give away some fried rice for packing, and the food was excellent! I would love to visit again :)

This place has become one of my favorite caf√©s. Perfectly clean ambiance, well maintained and properly decorated, sofas are so comfortable you won't wish to get up. Coming to food, we just had shezwan fried rice with hunan chicken and we loved it. The food arrived within 15 mins and it was delicious. Definitely coming again to try all the dishes one by one. :)

On my second visit I had Meifoon noodles with hunan chicken again.. It is worth trying. Amazing!

Again, I just planned to visit CIT cafe after so many months and we ordered Mixed Pan Fried Noodles.. At first we had to wait for approx. 30 mins and I had to wait for food. But when the food arrived, my first bite made me forget all the anger and I enjoyed completely.. Quantity was enough for 2 people but 3 can also manage if you are not much hungry..
Also tried their famous Tuti Fruti Ice cream, "Perfect" would be my comment on that..

There comes a time when fine dining gets the better of you and the only criteria revolves around food .Simply enjoying a happy meal with family. So ditching the so called 'Brand' names searched Zomato frantically for a place which obliged my mood. CIT Cafe at first sounded like a place for fish fry and kabirajis but with a deep dive found that it satiates the palate with good old Kolkata Chinese.So be it. A little more than usual longer drive past the extreme hyped quest mall n over frenzy 7 Point Crossing I reached my destination. Oh yes the culture of 'Waiting' clinged on with us. Luckily ,we were seated in another 10 minutes. Ordered Carribean Drumsticks, Chicken steamed momo & Butter Prawn. Soups we selected Thai & Chicken Sweet Corn. The momo arrived first. Decently stuffed 6 pieces with tender meat. Next was the Carribean Drumsticks. .it's excellently seasoned drumsticks tossed in sauce served with some chicken mince in the same sauce. Twisted & delightful. The hands down winner was the Prawn.Butter fried big prawns tossed in coconut milk garnished with curry leaves. SUPERB. The subtle buttery prawn gets the zing added from the curry leaves. Truly gourmet. Soups were good enough to combat the array of appetizers. Mains had an Egg wrapped mixed fried rice, Butter Parsley Shrimps & Chicken Shoaxiang...that's the best I remember of the spelling. The rice was smoothly tossed and enveloped in a fluffy omelette.The shrimps ...an unique hybrid of Thai & Malaysian with a crossbreed of butter n parsley from European cuisine. Extremely pleasurable to the palate. Now the chicken was a mildly spiced dish with roasted cashewnuts. Again a crossbreed of Kungpao chicken and pan fried chilli chicken. A lot of flavours entwined with good end result. The 'Out of the World Experience ' was the check which was 1500plus.Unbelievable. .....this food in a south Kolkata Chinese eatery would cross 3k. Recommended to all foodies. Enjoy food without damage control. Yes we all love to eat but it's more enjoyable if it's pocket friendly. Definitely going back ,a lot of experimentation is pending.

Been aiming this restaurant for quite a while, however didn't get the opportunity to visit until yesterday. Now we are lamenting why we didn't visit sooner.

The food - right from the soups to the entrees - was spot on in taste & quality. We had ordered a sweet corn chicken soup, a thai chicken soup, caribbean drumstick (based on zomato reviews), butter prawn and chicken steamed momos as starters; egg wrapped fried rice, shaoxiang chicken and garlic butter shrimps as entree.

The dishes were delicately seasoned with the right quantity of spice and flavors.

The only regret is that we cudnt try the caramel custard we were so full. So, that needs to wait till we visit the joint again.

Verdict: Absolutely MUST TRY.

Well what do I say about CIT cafe...I have seen this place grow from a 4 table restaurant to this mammoth of an institution...I've been coming here from my childhood for around 15 years at least if not more...they serve some wonderful Chinese and has been ruling the roost since there is no other competition in the area. Earlier prices used to be really low but it isn't as cheap as it was once upon a time, which is okay I guess if one maintains their standard and food quality which they have done. The decor has changed massively with time and its quite nice for a casual lunch/dinner.But I was really disappointed to see them charge tax additionally as one of their usp earlier was inclusive tax prices. Some of their dishes are top notch though and since I've grown up on their Chinese fare it feels like home to me sometimes! Do try chilli chicken dry,shezwan chicken, Thai chicken,pepper chicken/fish,crispy chicken...soups,rice and noodles are all good. If you're in CIT road area its a must visit!Keep up the good work.

During my 2.5 yrs of stay at NRSMCH  I have been here for more than 10 times n ordered food like another 15 times. Over this 20-25 times my rating will 4.0 which says all about the quality of food they serve.
The restaurant itself is small, crampy but well furnished. U hav to stand in queue for around 15-20 mins on weekends. Delivery times are standard. Staff are ok.
Coming to food itself they specialize in Chinese. The butter prawns , the drumstick chicken or the fish starters all will fetch a good score. The garlic capsicum rice (veg version) , the mixed meifun and the gravy noodles r my all time fav. Hunan chicken , pineapple chicken and fish in lemon coriander sauce are a treat. Amount of each of them will leave u wandering how's dat possible. A rice serving definitely meets two z demand if not more. They make nice sweet lime soda. 
Cons. Don't try to experiment. Stick to dishes u like. I don't feel they excel in d out of d usual recipes. Home delivery time is around 1 hr.

This place being in the vicinity of my resident , gets a lot of visits paid by me.. When on some lousy afternoon , i'm unenthusiastic to revise my culinary skills , i just walk by and drop in there..
Mixed cantonese noodles are my regulars there.. They are served warm , soupy and nice! This completely feeds two people , and makes a complete meal when coupled with some nice chicken gravy ! They have a lot of starters to offer ! Though i suggest not order some completely random fancy name on the menu , because the dish you assume ¬†to be a surprise, can be more of a shock !! On occasions i find their hakka noodles and staple chinese rice kind of bland to taste ,with tongue-disturbing textures!¬†
To sum it up this place is nice place to hangout with your buddies , when you plan some "low on pocket" outings . it's a nice place for students to hang out! Just don't get in there with a lot of expectations for your taste buds . Order wisely and enjoy !

I had a kind of friend rice I don't remember....I love spicy food it was a bit spicy but  I didn't find it that great....however I won't say bad...just not as wonderful as the coriander fish...
every dish was value for money.....

This place is a bit underrated. The food portions and quality is surprisingly brilliant. Never been to a Chinese restaurant with such filling portions. The service is a bit slow but on the whole, a good place if you are not in the mood to spend big but you have a big appetite.

This is one of your run off the mill typical Chinese restaurants which you'll find at every para in the city but wait that's not all about it. It's a proper restaurant with three different seating segments and a nice jazzy ambience thanks to the recent renovation. It used to resemble an old English caf√© before that. It's a moderately priced Chinese only restro. The waiting time on weekends is quite long so better to make a reservation though never done that personally. The food also takes sometime to come up once you've ordered so that can be a downside to it. Try their gravy noodles, schezwann noodles, honey chicken, garlic chicken, drums of heaven, pan fried momo, fried rice, etc. The rest all tastes good and is value for money as quantity is huge and serves three with each bowl ordered. The AC's a bit chilly so better visit in your full clothes. Really nice place to go out with family and friends and its CIT roads well hidden paradise but not now thanks to zomato. It's grown in its patronage among clients and is an old favorite memory to me. Is well located on cit road at anandapalit and itself is a landmark. Do visit and find me hopefully üòä

This place has established a reputation of its own and it stands true to it till today. Pretty close to my house, I have been visiting this place for a number of years. They serve one of the most brilliant Chinese dishes in the city. I have tasted almost all their fantabulous dishes : chicken momo, drums of heaven, chicken with cashew, sweet corn soup, noodles etc

This place is NEVER a disappointment!

Despite being a n.r.s medico ,it had taken a long time to be here...after I have heard about good food and environment from my college friends and zomato . I decided to celebrate my 5 th anniversary there.... But at first I have to wait for 10 minutes at the front gate.... Then have to wait for 15 minutes at the waiting room... After that we had a table...but the main story was starting now...the waiter took our order ...crabian drumstick, veg fried rice and Shanghai chicken...drum sticks come after 40 minutes.... It contains only 6 PCs...not so good..it was salty....not so Chinese type... After we completed the drumsticks.... There was also a duration of wait of 10 more minutes....but the fried rice and Shanghai chicken was good....now coming to ambience... There were a bunch of college people who were very annoying.... But the authority do northing....so in my view ..OK type Chinese restaurant

CIT Cafe is quite literally your average everyday Chinese Restaurant. The food here ranges from decent to okay and I failed to notice anything special about the place anyway. However, on a random night when you just want to go out and eat something, CIT Cafe can turn out to be a bit dreamy. Because let's be honest here, all most of us visiting a mid range eatery want is value for money, and CIT Cafe delivers on that splendidly.

I did do a little asking around before visiting the place and quite a few people did tell me that they tend to overuse salt. Which was pretty evident when I was there, even though the food wasn't bad by any means. Their Soups aren't good -- I've had much better, and I've had much worse. They're still edible if you absolutely must have soup in your meal. Their chow is good -- very good! Lovely amounts of vegetable and meat to accompany really well made noodles. Their sides are also pretty good.

Their service is inefficient and irregular. I would expect more from any restaurant, let alone one which is pretty decently rated on Zomato. Service is so important to a good dining experience, but put that aside and you have a good place to visit.

Thinking about visiting? Go for it. Inexpensive and good quantities more than make up for their deficient service. They also use a lot of blue lighting I will add. Unnecessary, but not a problem.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made. :)

Nice place, a typical kolkata restaurant, the place where you might not plan to go, probably go there cause your hungry or like me as I wanted a place to sit and talk with a Frnd. But don't get confused as it is named cafe, it is not a cafe... the service was good, the service time was quick probably cause there were not too many people there, the price of ala-carte was really well sorted , which might make you doubt the quality of the food, but make no mistake the food is good, nothing fancy but liked it. Just ordered two sweet lime and Thai fish, all of them were well servered and the tasted good. This is a place where you might bring your family or friends for a nice quite evening, and not burn ur pocket...

I ordered a very standard menu at CIT cafe using Zomato's new online ordering facility. The order came in 90 minutes despite zomato saying it would come in 60 minutes. I had called the restaurant in parallel and right from the start they claimed they had told Zomato staff the order would take 90 minutes. Unexpectedly poor service from Zomato.

Coming to the food itself. It is by far the worst Indian Chinese food I have ever eaten. Chicken and veg gravy dish were both submerged in oil. I had ordered a mushroom gravy dish which didn't have a single piece of mushroom - only onions and carrots, again in bright red oil.

The noodles and rice were mass produced and lacked flavour and again, way too much oil.

Only passable item was the Hot and Sour soup... but if you are a true Chinese lover, then even this would disappoint.

All in all ... DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. And since Zomato's backend is not equipped to deal with smaller restuarants like this one, it is best you use the phone facility to place your home delivery order.

looking for a budget restaurant which serves quality food? Answer is cit cafe.i hav been to this place innumerable times since childhood when it used to be a very small outlet wd 4 tables only.over the years it has increased its seating capacity but both the quality n quantity of food is same as it used to be 15 years back.only thing that has changed is the decor and the menu which has lot more items to offer now.although i have tried almost everything bt my personal favourites are thai soup,thai chicken,hunan chicken, carribean drumstick n fire cracker chicken.

This place is so very good when it comes down to affordable Chinese in this area! The Rice Noodles (Meifoon) is par excellence! The dishes are elaborately prepared and indeed very appetising. The entire place smells delicious. The Schezwan Noodles are very good too! And yes you do have to pay additional tax as it is AC. But then again having to pay a little more for good food never hurts! You could try the spicy General Tso's Chicken or go for the slightly milder Kung Pao. For fish lovers they have the lovely Fish Mandarin.

CIT Cafe is the my local favourite option when it comes to authentic Chinese food. They make some great preparations of chicken. Their hakka noodles is something to boast about. Overall you will get the value for the money spent but they do take a lot of time to serve the after ordering. Sometimes they take upto 1 hour to serve the food.

Just the waiting time was a bit high than expected as it was a sunday night and we hd to wait for a bit outside for a table to get emptied bt our wait was worth. Thanks CIT Cafe

CIT Cafe had been part of my neighbourhood while I loved there. We've eaten there a few times. However, I went there recently in a group and we decided to call ahead of time so that we get place to sit (knowing that it always gets crowded). We arrived around 8 pm, and we ordered the food. The place lives up to its name and the newcomers loved it. Having done our homework, we selected the crispy lemon coriander fish, and it we were not disappointed! It was simply yum! The only problem was that when we ordered for some more food, it took very long to arrive, hence the 4 points. I guess with the large number of orders, which includes home deliveries, the cooks/chefs are always full. Not advised if you are in a hurry. Where the quality of the food is concerned, you'll be 100% satisfied!

CIT Cafe is a second home to all residents of NRS Medical College. It's just a kilometer away from here. Over the years they have maintained their reputation. Chinese cuisines are their speciality. Honey glazed chicken wings is my favourite. Tender soft chicken wings fried with honey and topped with sesame seeds. Mmmm.... delicious. Prawn Tempura is another dish to taste. A bit spicy though. Quantity wise, a plate of fried rice can serve 2-3 heads perfectly depending upon your apetite. Overall a good budget restaurant worth a try.

Once you taste CIT Cafe, I bet you will visit them on numerous occasions. This is a place with moderate AC and two storeyed seating arrangements. It is quite compact seating but once you take a seat, it is cozy. The lights are soothing and the decor is quite simple wood finish.
Must Have: Spicy Hunan Prawn, Honey Glazed Chicken Wings.
Food is awesome here. A lil Indian touch to their Chinese flavour. The quantity is quite enough for two foodies with one plate. Price is nominal. The service is a bit time taking, but the food taste is wonderful.

Now the food ... trust me... this is one of the tastiest chinese .. i hv tasted... on starter we ordered for... mushroom 65 and crispy corn.... in main course we ordered thai basil fried rice... and schezwan rice... and hunan fish and firecracker chicken...  the amount of each plate is enough for 4 people... so according to me... if u had low budget party ... then must go to this place :)

Is the only restaurant in the area serving decent chinese cuisine. Ordered caribbean drumsticks, crispy chilly babycorn, mixed fried rice, hakka noodles and chilly chicken. Great tasting food, decent quantity and reasonable rates. Caribbean drumsticks and crispy chilly babycorn were really good. Service was quite slow. Food arrived after 45 mins. Considering the price i would say this place is definitely worth a try.

Okay so this place is really close to where i reside, i have three words for this place, Quality Family Restaurant, I've been to this place many times with friends as well as family. The food here is good and service is descent. They have really good crispy chilly baby corn and i really like their Hakka noodles which is cooked just right and the noodles are just perfectly thin enough. The keep the place neat and clean and the ambiance they provide is also good enough for family. On weekends its very difficult to get a seat here because of its popularity with the many families that visit here frequently. The only draw back this place has is that food service is slow, and i mean slow slow. It literally takes 30-35 mins just to get your first order. Apart from this i dont think this place has any other draw backs.

Had been there almost after 3yrs..at first was not very happy with the staff relations quite unlike my previous visits.they weren't that receptive.service was also very slow..it was  empty bt still they took 20 mins to serve!!!!however I liked the preparations we had ordered.Singaporean rice was well cooked and Hunan chicken was satisfactory.wish to experience a better staff relation the next time I be there...

Having located in an area where there is hardly any good Chinese restaurant, this place altogether enjoys a sole monopoly of serving delectable chinese cuisine. ¬†I personally used to think this place is actually an underdog when it comes to Chinese cuisine but visiting this place quite a number of times (as it is in front of ¬†one of my Uncle's house) has changed my views regarding this restaurant. I believe this place gives good competition to some popular leading Chinese restaurants when it comes to the quality and quantity of food they serve. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†My last visit to this place was November. As it was my birthday we decided to dine out and came to kind of celebrate it here. Me along with my parent came and we were being taken to our table (booked it early) . ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Now let me tell you about the ambience. This place is not that big and spacey which counts as a negative but the crowd is decent and you can have your food quite comfortably amidst the blue lights. :P ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Coming to the food. We ordered - ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Starters - Caribbean Drumstick ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Main course - 1 Cafe's Special Fried rice, 1 Chicken Peanut Butter Noodles with Sauteed Chicken with Celery and Pepper (a cantonese item). ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†All the food starting from starter to main course is appetizing. Two main course items is sufficient enough for 3 people. One coming to CIT cafe should try their Cafe's Special Fried rice. The rice is very well cooked and tossed with butter and good amount of chicken, prawn, babycorn and mushroom is given along with a poached egg on top which increases the level of toothsome. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† My personal favourite noodle over here is Chicken Peanut Butter Noodles and believe me when i say its very very tasty. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†The staff are very polite and they dont bug your head for extra tips. Its a pocket friendly restaurant and as far as i remember our bill came something around 700 which is all very good for three people. But one thing which the management should look after is the time duration at which they serve food. They actually take a hell lot of time to serve. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†All in all, this place is gaining popularity and if you want to want to have ¬†decent Chinese food in reasonable price, this is the place you should visit. And trust me you will not leave disappointed.

Found this place, this Saturday when it was late evening, and we 7 were hungry after tuition.. The ambience is very warm, we tried noodles, meifoon, and 3 chicken side dishes of which Thai chicken was best, but rest two were too sour, and gravy tasted similar.. Noodle was a bit soggy.. Service was quite late, but meifoon tasted good.

Being the only restaurant in the area serving decent chinese cuisine.
Could not compare with the mainline chinese restaurants and this place is more pf a 'me too' than being authentic. 
CHICKEN CHOWMEIN GRAVY: the gravy was primarily made of cabbage and carrots, just about ok,
THAI BASIL CHICKEN FRIEDRICE: dont try to order this dish as I learnt that thai people had so much of hot chilly powder...hooooo..

This place is not at all for a special dinner/lunch with special ones. 

This is just good to fill up the stomach at very fair prices.

This is a a great chinese restaurant with really delicious food at great prices. Ambiance is decent. But the dishes are really lipsmacking specially the lemon coriander fish and Caribbean drumsticks. My favourites are Caribbean drumsticks , lemon coriander fish, sanghai chicken, pan fried chili fish.

good Chinese restaurant right on CIT road, good amenities and a very busy restaurant, the fried rice and schezwan chicken was good, but the quantity they give is unexpected, couldn't finish there had to take parcel for the same.. But the normal orders takes so much time to reach your table then i wonder we would have ordered something different then how much more they would have made us wait... need the restaurant to be little more spacious i feel..

Although i had been waiting for a long time to try this place,this time i only got the opportunity to take a takeaway.It was while i was returning from my JEE advanced exam and i was hungry as hell.So decided to take a simple take away.Ordered the most simple thing you can find in any chinese menu.- the mixed fried rice , their mixed hakka noodles, and a chicken dish..i guess chilly chicken it was. Well the first thing i would say is the quantity really impressed me..i mean who gives that amount of fried rice for that price...unbelievable...i had that 3 times before it finished...same goes for the quantity of noodle..but the quantity of the side dish was as we generally find at any place.Now coming to the taste..the fried was what i liked the best..maybe they could improve on the size of the prawns but taste wise..it was pretty decent.Im not too sure about the noodles though.. felt that mayb the oil content was a little too much. And the side dish was pretty decent...the coating of cornflour on the chicken pieces wern't too thick and the gravy was nice.So considering the price i would say this place is definitely worth a try.Simple chinese food at a humble price.(The service was very quick)

I have been going to this restaurant for the 15 years and to my surprise this place has just got better over the years.
In terms if value for money this place is right up at the top if my list. Great tasting food, decent quantity and reasonable rates. Quality has remained same over all these years and the waiters are very alert and polite.
The menu is quite standard and you can get all the regular Chinese dishes here. For people who go alone, try the executive meal which is half plate rice/noodles with half place chicken/paneer/manchurian. This comes for ‚Çπ193( taxes inclusive). Definitely worth the money.
An excellent restaurant in my opinion, certainly worth more than one visit.

Well, I have been eating at this place since I was a child (well I am still a child - only 20 years old). It has undergone a remarkable transformation both in terms of food and decor. I know its not authentic ¬†Chinese food but who cares ! This is the Chinese food I know and this is the Chinese food I love. So much so that I do not enjoy authentic Chinese food. On ambience - well I am from a middle class family, so have not been to expensive restaurants. This is the place which made me realise that there can be other reasons to visit a restaurant other than food - dim light, classy interior, romantic music all this at a fair price. I would recommend this place to everybody.

My personal favourite- Carribean Drumsticks

It is my favourite chinese restaurant. I went there several times and each time i got full satisfaction. Not so big but arranged the dinning quite beautifully. Servicemen keep themselves well dressed and the thing i like most that they are well mannered people, just like a friend. Crispy chicken, Chicken mangolian, mixed friend rice are my favourites. But once i ordered a huge parcel for around 12 people which included varieties of items. We liked and enjoyed each item. It maintains good ambience too. Ingredients used in preparing the meal are of good quality. Should try once.

Wid two floors one on the ground level and the other on the first floor.. The food is good.. We had ordered for hot chilly babycorn which was a nice change to the regular crispy chilli babycorn.. It was cooked with perfection.. Later we orderd schewan paneer with fried rice which was also the perfect combination with the exact amount of spice.. Really loved the food out here and would surely like to visit again..

Wether Ur dining in or a home delivery the food takes a lot of time to be served or delivered. We waited for almost 30mins to receive our lunch and for home delivery it took about an hour.the momos r too expensive n not that good.

Bingo We ordered Tom yam soup very good, Mix fried rice which was tasty and the quantity is very good. Then Chicken Drumsticks and Prawn with Arabian salt also very good and the quantity is really fair with the price they charge.
Only problem they took 1 hr and 30 mins to deliver to park circus near Quest mall.
I would recommend this place very much!!

Cit cafe is a Chinese restaurant located at ananda palit. It has two different seating sections..one downstairs the other one upstairs. It is an ac restaurant. My friend and I ordered spicy stir fried chicken with cashew nuts and chillies as a starter. It was gud and it was served with a dash of lime juice which heightened the tanginess. Then for the main course we ordered veg Hakka noodles accompanied with shaoxing chicken with nuts and chillies. The veg noodles was really yummy.

Service was quite slow..food arrived after 30mins. The behaviour of the waiters are fine. Ambience is good though it remains crowded.

A tip-one plate of noodles/rice with a side dish is sufficient for two ppl. As we had a starter we found it difficult to finish our food.

Also tried their chicken schezwan noodles and Caribbean drumsticks. Its mindblowing. The mixed hong kong noodles is one of the tastiest yummiest noodles i ever had. The pan fried chicken was quite  too though carribean drumsticks are clearly much better. The Shanghai chicken is another excellent dish..d pineapple sundae was huge and tasty..but d main prblm is it didn't HV much pineapple in it..

Also tried their veg chopsuey..brilliant!!..also had the fish in lemon coriander sauce..SUPERB. Its d best dish of the restaurant. The tutti fruity in d desert is also a must try.

The veg mongolian rice was good..though not brilliant..it was full of vegetables like carrot beans onion, bellpeppers,cucumber and babycorn..however i certainly didnt find any paneer cubes as was mentioned in the menu..it was quite flavourful and definitely not dry. We had thai fish as a side dish..it was really tasty..mildly spiced..however it was a dry dish(as it was a side dish we expected it to have gravy in it). however as the rice was not dry it went really well with it.

Overall it is a very good restaurant and serves gud food without burning a hole in d pocket.

Food is average , all kinds of chinese food is available here . It use to be good in old time its near my house and have gone their many times, now its too many customer compare to chef and waiters , food quantity and service has gone down. And you may have to wait for 2 hrs to get your food it happened to me one time and when i asked them what happened they said they has accidently given our food to someone else. So be prepare before going in you may lose your appetite and get frustrated before you get you food.

Dropped in one day after a bit of work in the nearby area.
Nice generic decor,though the staircase is really beautiful.A bit longer service time than usual.
We ordered a chicken thai soup which was good,and a fish moffato which was exceptional in taste. The fish moffato has a very nice texture to it.We had also ordered a three alarm firecracker chicken with some noodles which was unremarkable.
The prices were inclusive of taxes,though nowadays they have started levying taxes on their fare.
A pleasant experience, altogether.

I have been visited this place since 5 years consistently. They serve good quality of foods. The staffs are very courteous. If you have time in your hand just visit this place. Try lemon chicken which i liked most. They don't serve alcohol. The ambiance of the restaurant is quite good, they should play some soft music. I would recommend this place.

The exclusive interior of C.I.T Cafe welcomed us as the four of us entered for the long awaited birthday treat. The foodies that we are it took us no time to order chicken drumsticks and pan fried fish for starters, chicken noodles, Hong Kong Rice and Lemon Chicken for the main course and side dish. Both the starters were awesome hunger-inspiring choices, but the fish was a real tongue-turner. Noodles, as usual, an all time favourite, and the restaurant does its best to keep it that way, the rice was really different. Not at all dry, it had a different taste which tasted really good. The lemon chicken was such that I wished we had ordered that a plate more. A wee li'l bit pricey, it is a place that deserves a second visit. And then another.

The Restaurant is a third class one. Even a fast food junction is better than this extremely disappointing place. The staffs are rude and don't have the basic courtesy. From the manager to the waiter. Dominoes gives faster home delivery than this pathetic excuse for a restaurant. Not even worth 0.5 rating.

This was the first time I visited CIT Cafe.A friend had recommended it ,therefore I decided to give a try.First things first,the place has a very elegant decor.Coming to the food I had 3 dishes,
The chilly babycorn was very good.It was really crispy and the dish also had capsicum,red & yellow bellpepper in it
The chilli garlic fried rice had lots of vegetables (even mushroom and babycorn)and a pretty light flavour.Normally you would expect it to be hitting hard on the tongue but that wasnt the case.It was decent.
And the Chilli Paneer was very nice.I say that because the paneer was very soft and the gravy was thick.The paneer caught the flavour well.

Overall,I just desired stronger flavours in ny rice,other than that I loved the food.The prices are pretty low compared to the quality and the quantity is also amazing.
The place deserves a 4/5.

Especially do try the famous Caribbean Drumsticks along with the HONG KONG noodles... you will be blown away with the quantity and quality of the food they offer at such a reasonable price.... Although the service is a bit slow but trust me the wait is worth.... :)

This is one of those place with nothing but good food to brag about. And not to worry about the price tag at all. Sumptuous quantity and of course the great taste of the food they serve. 
One can have a comfortable lunch for two within ‚Çπ700, including a starter and two soft drinks. So yea that's a cracker of a deal when it comes to good food in a good restaurant. 
Highly recommended if you dig Chinese.

As I am working in SBI CIT Road branch so CIT Cafe is the only choice for us..... Though we often visit chaina town but I strongly believe that Cit cafe's dishes can give a healthy competition with Tangra...... Their Chicken Manchurian is very tasty.... Chicken with cashew nut is their signature dish...... Chicken fried rice is also very good.... Very Good quantity and Quality which they maintained is fabulous ..... I wish them all success for their future.......

Went there first on my cousin brothers birthday n thereafter a number of times. Must say one of the finest Chinese restaurants with great food ,value for money and pleasant ambience. Have tried Thai soup, chicken sweet corn soup, crispy baby corn, crispy chicken, lemon chicken , sweet sour chicken, veg noodles,... Chicken sweet corn soup, crispy chicken and lemon chicken are my favourite.

On a sudden date with my babe, we ended up at this restaurant which spells AWESOME in capitals. Both of us wanted to try out a new place for chinese and after travelling quite some distance from our homes, we reached cit cafe. Its located right near the anandapalit bus stop on cit road. On entering we were led to the upper level seating area. The ambience and decoration caught my attention. It was so peaceful. Not a big place. Just medium. The waiters were patient and nice. They didnt rush us into our orders. Even suggested us a dish which turned out to be a lipsmacking starter. Now coming to the food, we called for:
Chicken clear soup- like usual, it wasnt listed on the menu. But we were served. It was just perfect, unlike most others which turn out to be bland. We didnt have to add any salt, or pepper if you want.
Finger cut flakes- this starter turned out yummilicious, suggested by the man waiting at our table. It was normal fish finger with a twist. It tasted different and oh-so-soft! As the name suggests, it was flaky and perfectly made. The star dish of our lunch.
Lime soda- we told them to make it neither too sweet, nor too salty. And they made it perfect.
Chicken meifoon- i have never seen so many chicken pieces before in any noodle or meifoon or rice whatsoever! And the taste was so good, you didnt need a side dish to go with it.
Shaoxiang Chicken in Wine with Cashew Nuts and Chillies- one of the best side dishes i have ever had. The chicken was cut in fillets and cooked to perfection. I could actually taste the wine in the dish. It went all too good with the meifoon and filled our stomach to bliss!
So much and our bill came to just 701rs. We couldnt finish the entire food and packed it away. At such price, i actually had both lunch and dinner. Haha! Im all too happy with this place and highly recommend it to one and all. Cheerie!

I have never actually visited this place, it has always been home delivery fir me, so I have no idea about the ambience. The food, however, is really good. This place serves perfect wantons, crisp on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, no sogginess at all. It comes garnished with spring onions and a wedge of lime. The pan fried chilli fish and chicken is lip-smackingly good, made to perfection with exactly the right amount of spice. On my last order, I had ordered the schezwam chowmein, and to be honest, it let me down. It was supposed to be spicy not sweet, but maybe, that's how they make it. 
The prices are quite reasonable, and the quantity is not too bad. 
Overall, good for those days when you have intense Chinese food cravings.

Whenever I want to have Chinese food near my hostel , I go for this Restaurant. The food always has been utterly satisfying for me and have been here or ordered from here for innumerable times. Whether post exam times , or feeling sick , or for giving treat , CIT has been my favorite . The DRUMS OF HEAVEN and CARRIBEAN DRUMSTICKS are excellent starters . The SINGAPORE RICE and HONGKONG RICE goes perfectly well with SCHEZWAN CHICKEN, SANGHAI CHICKEN and KUNG PAO CHICKEN . Would never get enough from eating here.

This is one of a few restaurants tht i hv bn visitng since childhood and hv really admired it but the latest visit have finally spoiled my mood.. Not happy by the visit at all.. First of all thy mk u wait fr approximately an hour to gt the food into your table which is really v dissapointng.. The waiters are also sum wht rude.. Wen u re- order and tl thm to gt the food a ltl fast thy bluntly say tht it wl tk tym.. Hw cnu eat fried-rice without the chickn??? I jst cnt imagine...its really dissapointing to c the waiters bhvng in tht manner.. Wen we entered we had to wait fr the table for approx half an hour and we gt the table only wen we had to argue tht the table was empty n stl we wrnt gvn one.. The waiters definitely need to learn hw to cater to the needs of the ppl.. The quality of the food is also ok tym.. It has deteriorated wid tym i guess.. Over all a bad exprnc i had tdy!!! Not on my wishlist anymore !!!

My review is based on my visit to this place almost a year ago. It was a friend's birthday treat. We were almost 12 people. Ambience was good. They were kind enough to join tables for us. I exactly do not remember all the food ordered but i took mixed gravy chow and i liked it a lot. The egg wrapped rice is also good. American Chop suey was also nice. Price is pocket friendly. Definitely in my revisiting list.

Its a cafe very near to my place and so I am a frequent customer here. First of all, the outer looks never appeal that its so good but don't go by looks go by food.
The renovated version in which they tried to make maximum space out of the same place has made it quite a choc-bloc and suffocated place. You end up hearing everybody's talks and people tend to look at people beside them as they are so near.
The food is really awesome. Had manchow soup and it was superb and comparable to any good place's soup. We ordered crispy vegetables which I thought was more of vegetable pakoda so I would recommend to take crispy chilly babycorn.
We then had panir schezwan rice which was truly amazing. I was not really having that much hunger but the heavenly taste made me to eat every grain of it. With it we ordered schezwan panir, which I felt was good but a bit more garlic in it. Had it been a bit moderated it would have been amazing.
Being a veggie not too many options here but for other people, honkong rice which is on a spicy side andSingapore rice is a must try here.
Noodles are good but in Kolkata Chinese food is in abundance so its very difficult to rate and even compare with others.
The best part pocket friendly and worst part, very very slow service. Slow service is tolerable in a nice ambient place with privacy but in such a congested place where one can't even talk properly its just unacceptable.
Waiters are also a disappointment. Those 3.5* is just because of this issue.
Management please read it and improve it.

This place is ¬†just 5 min ¬†walking distance from my home.I have being their ¬†regular customers since they have started their restaurant.I remember when Cit cafe started ¬†around in the year ¬†2006 ,and ¬†people in the city slowly ¬†shifted their taste ¬† for Chinese food from regular ¬†street food junction to ¬†cafe based food junctions.As per my knowledge Cit cafe is ruling in Ananda Palit Road Area (Central Kolkata ).Recently i visited Cit cafe in the month of August .Ambiance wise they have ¬†created something ¬†great.The Food ¬†is well cooked and taste delicious.The price is very reasonable to suit the pockets of ¬†everyone.The waiters are well mannered,disciplined and ¬†knowledgeable in sense what are the ingredients used, how the food is¬† prepared etc.Home delivery service is up to the mark.One advice to all ¬†the food lovers ¬†i would give just go ¬†and visit the food of cit cafe ¬†more often and enjoy their yummy food.

Yes if we are talking about the  food quality, then I'll say that its not the best but at the end the food here is tasty. More over its having a well balanced & elaborate Oriental menu which is both tongue & pock-friendly also. This can be termed as a budget family restaurant & well being a professional foodie I enjoyed my food down here.

The new interor is far better than what it used to be...they also have takeaway facilities!
But, the main turn down is the queue at the gate!!!! Its perpetual and long!
And be sure for an hour of waiting before finally getting ur sip at the soup!

An outstanding Chinese restaurant, CIT Cafe is a place to visit again and again. The restaurant has gone through a new makeover which makes it even more welcoming. Their food is exquisite & excellent with General Tso's Chicken &Crispy Fried Fish In Lemon And Coriander Sauce being my personal favorites. For dessert, their Tutti-Fruity is a must have and for refreshments, one can always order the Summer Cooler. Their service needs to boost up a little. Overall it is excellent.

It is one of the famous chinese restaurants in Central Kolkata region. It offers you with mouth watering chinese delicacies without burning your pockets deep. Warm and friendly environment. Prices are reasonable and both the quality and quantity is justified. The only drawback is its serving time. If you are expecting a quick service, you are at a wrong place. They take a minimum of 30 min. to serve you and this might kill your hunger and mood if you are expecting a quick service and its really annoying at times ! Nevertheless, quite a decent place to drop in if you are willing to have tasty chinese dishes within an economic budget.

So, here goes my first review, inspired by the delicious write ups of many foodies out here ! I'm starting with this place since this is the restaurant visited by me most frequently due to it being in the locality of my college. It really does satisfy the hunger pangs we get in between the classes both in terms of quantity and quality.
You wouldn't find another decent chinese restaurant like this nearby. The food really enlightens your taste buds with its spicy flavours. I've tasted a lot of items here starting from starters like PAN FRIED FISH and DRUMS OF HEAVEN to almost all the types of the main course side dishes. And all of the items did make my tongue quite happy. My personal favourites are SCHEZWAN CHICKEN FRIED RICE and CHICKEN GREEN AND RED HOT PEPPER. The schezwan rice is infact so good and juicy, that you wouldn't require a side dish to finish it off within minutes. The HONG KONG RICE is also quite good. The fish preparations are similar in taste to the chicken ones. The noodles seem more like rice noodles here, the strands being thin and light.¬†The prices are extremely moderate, considering the huge amount they serve. Two plates would easily serve 3 hungry people. It's just a perfect place to hang out with friends if you're a non-earning person like me !¬†Another good thing about the place is that it gives home delivery till 10 at night !


But this place has some real short-comings. The ambience is not quite good. It's over-crowded most of the times and you'd have to wait for atleast 15 minutes outside. The inside is neat, but a little cramped. One real drawback is that they serve the food quite late. It takes them almost 40 minutes to serve even the most popular dishes out there ! Also, the variety of items is quite poor. They only serve chicken prawn and fish. And that also, the same dishes for each type of the 3 non-vegs.
The behaviour of the waiters is really unacceptable and rude at times. They won't let you talk freely and will try to hurry you out of the place as soon as possible. ¬†We've experienced the bill being placed at our table many times when we were about to order something else.

Still, this place remains to be one of my top priority chinese restaurants because of its though limited, but delicious dishes...So, try it out guys ! Cheers ! :-)

It is one of the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. Well decorated quite environment and tasty food makes it my favourite. But if you r in a hurry then surely it will not be your choice. They take minimum 40min to serve after you place the order. Among the dishes crispy fish in coriander sauce is my favourite..

Cit cafe is one of the best known chinese and thai joints of central kolkata located at anadapalit. Have been there couple of times. I go whenever good chinese is what I want.as for starters . You can simply look for usual drums of heaven or you can go in for a better version- Caribbean drumsticks. The secret sauce adds to the taste and you kind of feel salvific. If you want to opt for prawn it has to be arabian salt and pepper prawn. you can also shuffle in with a soup. try having chicken meatball soup. The broth that they prepare is amazing and addictive. As for main course we wanted to have pineapple thai fried rice and buttered chicken noodles, due to unavailability we ordered chilli garlic fried rice, or the special fried rice or pan fried noodles instead. It is mind blowing. The side dish was hot chilli garlic chicken. Also a much recommended dish is the sichuxang chicken with cashew nuts. Its amazing a thai dish and out-of-the-world. But i will surely run back to taste the fish in chilli wine sauce and saut√© chicken with celery and pepper.

best reastaurant, chinese and otherwise on cit road, ny most visited and frequented restaurant of all time that's cause i live nearby, great food, reasonable price, downside is the waiting time, the  noodles, meifoons, momos and fried rice are all great, both veg. and non. options available here, tastes out of the world, located in ananda palit area, near executiv tower and a police kiosk as the landmark, mak prior reservations especially, on weekends as waiting time can run upto 2 hours on an unlucky sunday, menus limited and the plus being everythings always availabe, have yet to try the executives lunch and dinner packs, the new renovated and snazzy interiors are uptown and give the feeling of a cafe which, i dislike, the old restro was warmer and looked like an english bar which was better looking and ambient still, the place's only got better if not more in terms of food, service and reasonability of price, waiters are courteous and i have grown used to seeing the same faces over the years, hope this face of central calcutta doesn't change withh everything that does, cit cafe a tummy saviour for cit' ians

Location: CIT Road, Near Anandapalit Bus Stop.

This place has been visited a couple of times and now I can easily put a foot down and say that it does manage to dish up quite a few good dishes. Authenticity isn't much of a mantra here since it dishes up a mixed bundle of authentic as well as Indianized Chinese cuisine.
This place has been one the most visited by the residents out there since this is the only restaurant in and around that area which manages to serve quality fooding.
The ambiance has been taken a level up, the interiors have changed since the restaurant has been renovated. Nothing great, but yet it's quite simple.

Talking about the food, dishes that I have tried until now:

Hot and Sour Soup
One of it's own kind!
Is delicious.

Crispy chilli babycorn
The dish has always been a disappointment. It's always sweet and the corns aren't crispy at all.

Hakka Noodles (Veg)
Was perfect in every aspect. May it be the perfectly boiled noodles or the fresh and juicy saut√©d vegetables. Good to taste.
Only downside here is the oil content which is a bit towards the higher side.

Shezwan Fried Rice
The rice was cooked properly and the flavors were spot on. Good to taste.

Vegetable Manchurian
The dumplings are good to taste and the gravy has the right balance of flavor to kick up the dish. :)

Chilli paneer
The Paneer cubes aren't chewy, are succulent and was flavourful. Good to taste. But, the vegggies were tossed in high heat, resulting in a visual disappointment.

Chilli garlic noodles
Disappointed. I guess they couldn't make out the difference between Hakka Noodles and this. Tasted just the same. :\
-May be a bad day for me. Would update on it soon.

The staff is prompt, friendly & have knowledge about the menu.
The service is improving with time; used to be quite slow, but now, the serving time seems to decrease.
Prices are pocket friendly with respect to the portion sizes (read: generous).

Overall has been an above-average experience.
-Would visit again and update on the current status soon. :)

I discovered this restaurant lately. Parking is major problem. Huge queue. Finally when ur turn comes you have to adjust in a super cramped seat. You place ur order. When u almost faint in hunger (after 30-40mins) ur starter is served. N now comes the wow factor.
Average price of each plate is Rs 130-150. Portions are REALLY WHOLESOME. We had ordered-
1. Thai Soup
2. Pepper Fish
3. Mixed Chowmein
4. Mixed Fried Rice
5. Thai Chicken
6. Fresh Lime Soda

The Soup was great
The Pepper Fish was a pure mess
The Mixed Chowmein was appreciable
The  Mixed F Rice was again a mess- rixe wasnt cooked properly- not acceptable from a veteran restaurants like this.
The Thai Chicken was awesome.

Overall food scores 3/5. Marks deducted for Pepper Fish and Mixed F Rice. It would have been 4/5 otherwise. However, value for money scores a whooping 4.5/5.
If u looking for drop dead gorgous chinese cuisine, its not your place. But the price- quality- quantity component is a really Wow factor.

I must b one of their oldest customers and this review has been a loong time in the coming..from a tiny outlet iv watched it expand and revamp itself..still at heart it remains the quintessential 'parar dokan' that every cit road resident swears by...
Its main draw is tasty,more or less good quality chinese food at decent prices...they have expanded the menu a lot but my personal favorites still remain gravy chicken chowmein  [drool], garlic chicken, swt. corn soup,momos,lemon chkn..etc..actually u can go ahead and try ne of their dishes...theyv recently introduced a mocktail counter and it serves sum pretty good coolers..
Ambience,while not top notch,is sober.. overal, with its strategic location and home delivery services, cit cafe continues to be the top draw in this locality, despite the new crop of resraurants in the para.. do visit.

good food and nothing else should be there motto.... simple indian Chinese fare and they are pretty good at it... their service sucks and thats the worst part.. waiting time of more than 20 min outside the restaurant on weekends.. 10  minutes 9 on  week days.... the waiters can be more well behaved actually

PROS:
good food
value for many

CONS:
service time
mock tails
interiors could be better. 

Must have item:
Pan fried noodles (absolute heaven)
Thai chicken (for those who like it really spicy)
Sesame chicken with chilly and honey
pan fried fish
egg wrapped fried rice
hongkong noodles
crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce

AVOID:
CITY OF JOY (mocktail)

I was very little when i went to that restuarant with my elder sisters and brothers. In starter we ordered Crispy Chicken that was really crunchy. In the main coures my favourite dish was Egg raped fried rice!!! The fried rice was rapped with a big omlet. That was really attractive. The atmosphere was very nice. Even now i can remember that day.
Each and every dish was delucious. Serving was very good. Very nice place. Must try.

This is my favourite restaurant amongst the ones close to my home. We have been eating here since I can remember and food has always been amazingly good. Price is reasonable and amount per serving is very generous. Food is delightfully tasty. They have renovated the place last year to give it a sparkling look, which is nice.
Downsides are the service time and the delivery time. It is out of the question to eat over there during weekends or holidays, there's atleast a ten person queue outside. Home delivery/takeaway is also a pain as it takes over an hour to get the food prepared.  This is not a place to go when hungry. But if u have some time at hand, this place is a great choice for chinese food.

I appreciate the ambience and the food quality. I mean I love the food quality...the restaurant may appear a bit expensive but taste and quantity wise one will have their money's worth. But there is another negative point in this place, which is the fact that it takes a lot of time to serve. Rest of the service, attitude of the attendants is nice, but they really do take a lot of time. If you are ordering home delivery, I believe it's best if you keep 1 or 2 hours in hand. Same if you are taking packages home.

The only decent place to have chinese in CIT road.This place is functioning from the time since i was a little kid and they have renovated it and expanded it ever since :) They serve good chinese(their american chopsuey is the best i have had anywhere).Other items like chilli paneer,fried rice and veg hong kong noodles are all yum.

The ambience is neat and the staff are well versed with the menu.The renovated CIT cafe looks good infact. 
However they have revised the menu many times and the latest makes it a little expensive,which is justified,because this place is the only good dining experience you can have in CIT road

This restaurant makes me nostalgic as I have been born and brought up in this area but now I stay far away from this place. Well, starting off I must say very few Chinese restaurants are there in Kol which serves food of this quality at such a cheap price. 

Pros:
1. Food is tasty.
2. Cheap. No VAT.
3. Enough quantity.
4. Decent ambience.

Cons:
1. Slow service.
2. Not spacious.

Notable dishes to try out:
1. Drums of Heaven
2. Hongkong Rice
3. Thai Chicken
4. Chilli Garlic Rice
5. Cafes Special Prawn

Discovered this place late, but I am glad this place exists. :)
PROS :
1. good food
2. the price is very less compared to the quality and the quantity they serve
3. ambience is great. dim lights and some good oldies music. :)

CONS :
1. a little more space would have been better. even on weekdays the place looks cramped so if the place is full the ambience goes down to drains.
2. the waiters looked like zombies. they don't talk or communicate. they come, take orders and serve the food like robots.
3. the service is slow.

Ignore the negative aspects if you wanna have good food at a very reasonable price.

I am going there again for sure :)

This is my all time favourite chinese restaurant in kolkata, the food served here is very good to taste and see. One of the main reason is there is no VAT, so the bill will be surely fit ones pocket. Environment is very good and although the service is quite late but it's really worthy.
Best dishes :
1. Special mixed fried rice.
2. Hongkong rice.
3. Singapore rice.
4. Pan fried momo.
5. Chicken thai soup.
6. Chilli Chicken
7. Sanghai Chicken
8. Chicken Shezwan
9. Hongkong chicken
10. hoonun chicken.

I will recommend this restaurant to all chinese lovers.

Now...I have been going to this place since I was in the 3 rd standard . I have seen this place grow from a small shabby restaurant to what it stands today !!! And ... why do I still go back there again and again ??? Coz ... they offer such awesome Chinese platters and maintain great quality !! 
Over so many years .. I got to taste most of their dishes ..but there are quite a few which I would like to recommend . So..shuru se shuru karte hai ...i.e. Starters !! Without a thought ....if one visits the place .. Pan fried prawn ...Prawn trestina..and  crispy chicken.... is a must have !!!!!! All of them are spicy and tastes heaven to the tongue !!!! 

Coming to the Main course .. I have been a fan of their Schezwan chicken for a really longgg time !!! Other mouth -watering offerings are Hunan chicken(a must have )...and if you are looking for something too spicy...go for .. Spicy chicken with cashew nut and chillies !!!! The Prawn offerings are good tooo ... !!! And in the fish section ... Crispy fish with Lemon corian sauce (Again...a must have ) !! The rice section too has decent offerings...specially the egg wrapped rice ...And in case you are looking for something different..Pineapple thai fried rice ..is the one to go for !!!

In all ...they maintain a basic standard in everything they serve !!!! Coming to the pricing ... its absolutely pocket friendly !! the staff are all amicable and the decor is fine !!!I Its a great place for college students to treat their friends !!

So ...I am giving this place 4 stars...coz...they have a lot of potential to do even better !!!!

This may not be a fine dining place or may not serve great authentic dishes but the food is delish. You keep going for the memories if not anything else. All those birthday treats were so much more enjoyable because we had a place that we could afford on our college allowance. The stomachs were full, our tastebuds happy and we felt like grownups being able to afford a restaurant meal!! The place has continued to serve consistently great chinese food at very reasonable price. The space is a bit cramped but service is really good. The best Chilli Garlic Fried Rice ever!!!

Certain self proclaimed Chinese  restaurants appall you. And then there  are certain ones that instantly make you fall in love and keeps you craving for more. CIT Cafe has been one such experience.. A friend of mine took me there as we both share the sheer love for food. And then the rest is history.
As the name suggests it is situated in CIT road near Anadapalit. The view of the entrance is eye catching (due to the recent renovation). The inside d√©cor was what one may call sleek and stylish. Now the best part of the restaurant, the food. We were particularly out for trying out some of the delicious starters that the place has to offer. My friend being the religious follower of the place quickly suggested the best of what the place offers.
We had Chicken Salad, Crispy Chilly Baby Corn, Fish Mofato and Drums of Heaven for starter. Then moved on to the main course with mixed fried rice, Thai chicken and Szechwan chicken. The portions sufficed five of us. The starters were what one would call quality food, my personal favorite being Fish Mofato and Crispy Chilly Baby Corn. Perfectly cooked and keeping it simple and authentic that‚Äôs their motto. The food shouted it, out loud. The main course was delicious with perfect balance of each ingredient. The service though was a bit slow but one can totally overlook it given the quality food they serve. And whosoever said ‚ÄòGood things come to the one who waits‚Äô, was damn right. The price is quite affordable and pocket friendly given the quality they serve. 
My friend describes the place as ‚Äòan old, loyal horse which never puts her down in front of other food fanatics‚Äô and so do I agree now. If you love  food, visit this place and indulge your taste buds with the delicacies they offer. 
My rating
Ambience: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5
Service: slow but it‚Äôs worth it. 
P.s do try out the dessert section. They serve some visually perfect desserts.

When I have Chinese in mind there is no other place I rather look other than this. Low on cash no problem. Super duper hungry no problemo. This place doesn't fail to deliver. Though quite short on space if u have a huge family, you won't come out of this place half full. This place provides generous amount of serving which is more than enough for two people alone. Usually, since my family is getting bigger day by day its getting more logical to get the food delivered to our home rather than taking ourselves there n trying to fit in. However it big enough for a college gang to go n have fun without burning a hole on the pocket. Home delivery on the other hand takes a little time n patience if you are a new customer. But never the less the food will be fresh n hot when it reaches you and prepare to have some leftovers coz the food is plentiful. Make sure u tip the boy generously.... ;)

Yesterday,on the day of kali pujo my friend and I were having duty at NRS hospital when we felt like having some good quality food to somewhat celebrate the occasion.Like on quite a few instances in the past,the home delivery service of Cit Cafe came to our rescue.The food was in one word excellent.It made me realise that I have been a bit too harsh in my last review for this place.

As the name suggests Cit Cafe is loacted in Cit road near Anandapalit bus stop.But it is not like a cafe by any means.It is a small restaurant serving good quality Chinese food.This is a very popular place among the students of nearby colleges like us and the local people mainly because of the following reasons-
1.There is hardly any good quality Chinese restaurants in and around the area apart from this one.
2.The quality of the food is good.
3.The prices are quite moderate.
The fact that you will find the place to be crowded whenever you visit is testimony to the popularity and also the quality of the place.

Coming to the food,the quality of the food on offer is quite good.It may not be the most authentic but it is very tasty nonetheless.The quantity of the food is also very good.One main course item is generally sufficient for two people.The soups and starters are all very tasty and satisfying.Among the main course items,the hong kong rice is by far my favourite.It is not only very very tasty but it contains liberal amounts of chicken,prawn and babycorn and the poached egg on top goes perfectly.This is one item you must have if you visit this place.Among the side dish items,the sanghai chicken is my favourite here and it goes perfectly with the HongKong rice.
As I have mentioned before,the prices are very reasonable.The staff are well trained.But the one area this place must improve is the speed of their service.It invariably takes quite a while for them to serve the food no matter what you order and whenever you visit.

Coming to the ambience and decor,it is not the best to be honest.The space inside is very much on the lesser side.The tables are quite cramped and since the place is crowded at most times,it adds to the cramped feel.The decor is very simple and nothing exceptional.The air conditioning is very good though.Another drawback of the place is that they do not have a proper washroom.

In short,among the relatively smaller restaurants that serve good quality tasty food at reasonable prices Cit cafe ranks quite high.If you are looking for a decent restaurant in and around the Park circus to moulali area for having something other than Biryani or Mughlai cuisine,look no further than Cit Cafe.



----- 18 Jul, 2013 -----

Cit cafe is one of mine most frequently visited restaurants being located very near to my college.This place has the distinct advantage of being probably the only good Chinese restaurant in and around the area.
The food is quite good and tasty.The quantity is also nice.The prices are also quite affordable.The Hong kong fried rice is one of my favourites.
The ambience is okay but the seating arrangement is a bit cramped.Sometimes they take quite a while to serve the food.
Whenever you visit the place you will find it crowded which I feel is because of its location,decent food and decent prices all taken together.

We are all familiar with the famous quote, "Don't judge a book by its cover". After visiting CIT Cafe, I had to coin a similar phrase; "DO NOT judge a restaurant by its outlook and entrance". I've passed this place many times in the last two years without bothering to give it a second glance as the doctor's chamber-like entrance never much appealed to me. Then one fine day my friends and I decided to drop in for a quick lunch as it was the closest one from college and a welcome break from the Mughlai houses in the bustling Park Circus junction.

 
What greeted us at the main entrance of the restaurant was appalling. The main entrance door had been pulled down to a pile of debris due to the renovation work, so we took a side door to get inside. The interiors took us all by surprise! This place was stark white, squeaky clean and done in good taste. We were led upstairs by a polite staff member and the decor on the first floor was even better. Comfy couches, ample space, subtle blue and yellow lighting and some soft music completed the whole ambiance-deal. 
 
We ordered for the Chicken Clear Soup, Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Vegetable Hakka Noodles (yes blame the "strictly-veg-day" ritual our friend was following). 
As expected, the soup was completely healing. The broth was thin, light and filled with chopped spring onions and shredded chicken. Next, the crispy chilli babycorn was absolutely "plate licking good"! The babycorns were crisp, flavoursome and adorned with some crunchy bell peppers and spring onions. Lastly, the noodles, fried in the least amount of oil and accompanied with lots of veggies were equally scrumptious.
The enormous serving for each of the items was worth being happy about.  
 
The service was a small letdown as it took them almost 40 minutes to get the food on the table. Thankfully, that day it wasn't a problem as we were fully engrossed in chatting and time passed by quickly. Other than that, all was fine and the easy-on-the-pocket bill made that even finer!
Overall, I would highly recommend this place to everyone unknown to it till now. Their delicious Chinese fare won't fall short of your expectations.

Best Chinese rest in its area.. Pepper fish .. Fish mofato exceptionally good... only problem is if u opt for home delivery.. they take ages to deliver... chicken thai soup and fish in lemon sauce are its specialties along with crispy chicken.. The veg side dish items are limited.. hot n sour soup is very spicy.. but all over i love the place.

I stay nearby this restaurant so I have literally seen it expand from a tiny room to a ground floor and top floor. It fact, it is still expanding and getting refurbished as I write this review. The current renovation includes a mini bar for quick serving of the mocktails and ice creams. As for the food, I would say the preparations are awesome. My personal favourites are the Gravy chowmein and Hong Kong Rice. The quantity is more than enough for two persons. Even inclusive of all taxes, the prices are cheap. The staff is efficient. However, I would like them to serve faster. Overall, I recommend this place strongly.

I have been having at this place since my childhood...It is located very near to my place....And it is the only Chinese restaurant in this area and also a good one....Though it enjoys monopoly in this local area but still it never compromises with its quality of food....You would definitely not get any stale items in this place...Excess are all disposed off....
The ambiance is typical to that of a restaurant in and around Central Kolkata and waiters are quite polite and would always guide you to have their best possible combinations....Quantity is quite good and thus it helps in average pricing...You would not feel a high pocket pinch....Mixed fried rice, Lemon fish are my personal favorites....

I was very surprised that I hadn't known about this place till today. I guess it had something to do with my restaurant visits being limited to South Kolkata. We went on a weekday so we didn't confront a line but my uncle who visits regularly said that on weekends, waiting time in the line can be upto an hour. The place is a typical Calcutta restaurant. Snug with its low roofs, closely fitted tables and pleasant hushed voices and clinkering cutlery. This is all that Kolkata means to an original Calcuttan.

The food doesn't disappoint either. Very moderately priced, it is delicious. I strongly recommend the fish in lemon coriander sauce. It was simply amazing. THe garlic chicken was pretty good. One plate of rice or noodles is well sufficient for two people. 

Overall it was a wonderful experience, with the ambiance of the restaurant making me feel very nostalgic.

This is the best Chinese in Kolkata and also cheaper than the big names. I go there often with my friends. The dining is good, clean n comfortable environment. I like to recommend 
 Caribbean drumsticks , Crispy Chicken , crispy prawn , momo as starter
Lung Fung soup, Thai soup , mushroom with chicken meat ball
Hong Kong fried rice, chilly garlic rice, Songhai fried rice 
Songhai Chicken
Cafe special dishes 
Last but not least an ice cream of your choice 


I bet you will never regret to pay for your food.

you've got low budget and you're asking for some great chinese dishes...CIT Cafe is the best option. I have been through many restaurants across offering chinese food, but trust me, they are just best in some dishes. It has been 5 years I'm a regular foodie at this restaurant, and have never found the quality going down!

Must try:
Sanghai Chicken (the best in the city I have tasted)...
Prawn Trestina (well, simply awesome starter you'd never regret!)
Pan fried chicken momo (put it in your mouth, n find yourself lost in a great taste)
Pan fried chicken
Chicken Carribean Drumsticks
Fish in lemon oleander sauce (just give it a try, n you start loving it!)
Sechzwan prawn
Mixed fried rice (again the best across city)
Hongkong rice
Singapore rice
(rice are too much in amount! unless you eat a hell lot like me, you'll have to pack them for your home!)
soups are great, best one being Chicken Hot n Sour soup (some are bogus though!)
noodles are not that great! nor the meifoons...or chopseuy!
desserts are good enough! most people love the Tutti Frutti! My favourite is Pineapple Sundae.

Ambience: a little congested, and almost always you'll found crowd! The music they play is kinda retro, old hindi instrumentals. AC is chilling cool!

Service: waiters are well behaved and good to talk to! but the only problem is that they take too much time to serve the food at your table! you might have to wait for as long as 40mins!

Overall, damn good budget restaurant, and probably best in the city!

This place is a favourite hangout for a lot of people of my college, being located very near. I have been here once and I am not going back there again. The seating arrangements are cramped and the ambience, well, what ambience ? The food quality is bad and I remember very distinctly of being expectant and getting badly disappointed. The noodles emitted a weird smell, not good, not bad, but certainly one I could have done without. The chicken side dish was decent. The only plus are the prices, but what use is cheap food if it doesn't taste good. 
Not recommended. Ever.

Location: Cit cafe - one of my favourite Chinese restaurants located in cit road. It has a lot of dishes but my favourite over here is chicken hot and sour soup. 

Pros and cons

Pros:- 1)  ambience is good
2) always crowded
3) proper AC restaurant(very chilling AC)  with a decent dining place
4) food quality is moderate 
5) service is decently quick 
6) ambience is okay

Cons:-
1) staffs needs improvement
2) ambience needs more changes 

Rest all is well. :)

I had visited CIT CAFE with a long time buddy of mine an ex member of the famous Bhoomi folk band. Well we guys were doing a recording and went to have a bite at cit cafe since it was close the studio. When i went there i found that that place was packed to capacity therefore it was evident that the food would definitely be good and yes it was. I ordered some mixed chowmein and fried rice and lemon chicken and the quantity was so good that the two of us could not complete the food and had to have it packed for home. Well i only thought that the production time period is too long and the service staff is rather lousy they do not know how to serve the guest. The moment a waiter serves the guest using only a spoon it is clear he does not know how to serve, ideally speaking as a foodie i would like to inform others that keep in mind when the waiter serves food he needs to serve food using the spoon and the fork together and that too in one hand, if he does not serve it like that it means the servicing of the restaurant is lousy. 

Well although the food was not bad but i thought that i have eaten Chinese food in the best restaurants in the city but this is far from the best that i have eaten. Foodies should be careful that achinimoto should not be added in the chowmein and this item is not good for health. Therefore one advice to you who are planning to visit this restaurant please ask the chef to go a little easier on the achinomoto in the dishes.

Straight from school days till now about 8 years later still like this place.
Although this place being tiny and cramped up, packs in good food to meet the taste-buds.
My palette tastes same thing over and over at Tangra joints (dunno exactly why), except a couple of em.

Would surely visit again, with friends and family.

One con - (tiny, tiny floor space)

I used to come to this place when my dad worked as a resident at Nrs Medical College in Sealdah. A tiny room with hardly 8 tables was all there was, but the quality of the food was never a let down. 10 years down the line, I still come here. Now as a student of Nrs med college and with my classmates. I've seen this place grow from that tiny room to what it is now. The quality of food here still hasn't gone down. Its frequented by Interns, Residents of NRS and Calcutta National Medical College. Lots of our birthday treats, exam ending celebrations and random eating out happens here.
Absolutely love this place.

The reason why CIT Cafe is so popular is possibly because there isn't a good restaurant as its competition in sight. What I like is that this place serves up basic Kolkata Chinese food, cooked fresh, and they make a nice chicken Thai soup as well as the Spring Chicken, which are two things I generally use to evaluate the starter/soup section of a good Kolkata-Chinese restaurant. 

The last visit had us waiting for about 20 minutes outside before we got a table. It was a weeknight, and very crowded. Once in, we decided to order the soup, starter, and a Chicken Hakka noodles with Szechuan fish. Our food came in quite early, and we were surprised to see the quantity in each plate. Apart from the fact that everything tasted great, I liked their brisk and very attentive service. 

My only complaint is that they should have a waiting section where one can wait for their food to arrive.

CIT CAF√â IS UNLIKE ANY CAF√â!

The Chinese food served at this food joint is (beyond doubt) authentic and delicious. The decor is simple with comfortable sitting arrangements. It is a very small and clean food joint. Since the food is very pocket friendly, the joint is no doubt, very popular among students.
Their starters are the perfect way to start your tryst with Chinese food at the restaurant. 

Some of their very popular starters are Fish Mofato, Prawn Trestina and Chicken Drumsticks, even their Chicken Momos whether pan-fried, steamed or fried are scrumptious. This can be followed by side dishes like the Crispy Fish in lemon coriander sauce or Kung Pao Chicken. The side dishes can be had with their egg, prawn and chicken noodle preparation called Chingchong Noodle. Alternatively, they can also be had with either Hong Kong or Singapore fried rice. At the same time, their egg wrapped mixed rice does not have any competitors. Among the vegetable items their crispy chilli baby corn is tasty as well as not so spicy.

There is no denying the fact that the taste of the food is always the same here. The food portions are generous and each plate can feed two people. The quantity is overpowering at times. Their chicken preparations are many and delicious and whether Mongolian or Hunan or Sichuan, they are all full of flavor. Some of the popular chicken items that they serve are Lemon chicken, Hunan chicken and sauteed chicken with celery. Likewise, their noodles and Mei foon items are thin and full of flavor. For people who are sensitive to spicy dishes it is best to let the servers know beforehand about your spice limits. 

The biggest negative of this eatery is the time they take to serve or deliver your food - service is downright appalling sometimes. Nevertheless, the place is popular for its good food, convenient location and moderate prices.

CIT CAFE! the name says it all. just opposite to where i stay and have been going there since ages. its this place which is the first option when my cousins and myself are too lazy to go out somewhere far enough . the quantity is its speciality with the taste ofcourse. in between it went on to an anti-climax situation but now have regained its momentum of serving good tasty food. its only problem is the time management. it takes too much of time to serve the food after the order has been placed. 

one situation i would like to reiterate , on my birthday since i had no option but to go here as had exam the next day - the restaurant kept us waiting for an hour before it served our ordered food. otherwise its been a rockstar for all of us. with so much memories linked to this particular restaurant. best wishes always no matter what. cheers!

with the renovated upstairs,cit cafe has finally given its long blend of customers a reason to feel attached to modern dining ambience.i've been to this place since last 6 years and everytime,i felt the chinese dishes here are unparallaled in taste if not in authenticity.try crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce,chingchong noodles,fish mofato,prawn trestina,kung pao chicken,tutty frutty.the taste is always superb.if you stay close,they can deliver food at a minimum order of 200 or so.even the food is not so costly.the big minus is the time it takes to serve or deliver the food.the ambience not being so ornate,its not ideal for dating i suppose,but if you are in for the food only,just go for it! u will be amazed.caution-the portion is sumptuos.2 portion enuf for 3.order likewise

This place is closed to my in-laws resident & they used to visit this restaurant in any of their occassion. My first visit was a kind of that. 

CIT Cafe was proved to be an unexpectedly good place . The ambience is average. It is a neat and clean small joint.

The price is  very reasonable, making it an instant favourite to call in for a home delivery at a short notice.

Their Egg wrapped mixed rice, Maifoons are awesome...

try their Lemon chicken, Hunan Chicken, sauteed chicken with celery, prawn tossed with ginger & scallions.

This place will become your favourite sooner than later...

They have a very good home delivery facility.

They offer discounts to Club Solitaire mambers as well...

CIT Cafe is an unexpectedly good place where I've been dining for years. Whether you are taking food home or eating out, you can always depend on CIT Cafe. Located right on the CIT Road (as the name obviously suggests), the ambience is also fine. It is a neat and clean small joint.
The food quality is fantastic and the quantity is overwhelming at times. The drumsticks and the dry chilli chicken items are very tasty as appetizers. The fried rice is also a treat. The noodles are paper thin, well-cooked and something your taste buds will absolutely love. The Manchurian, chilli and Schezwan preparations of chicken are some of my favourites here but in case you are sensitive to a lot of spices, please ask the waiter, for some of them might just scald your tongue, metaphorically speaking.
The price is also very reasonable, making it an instant favourite to call in for a home delivery at a short notice.
Verdict: Good food, good location, and value-for-money. Thumbs up from my side!

Stick to the regular dishes like crispy chicken, chicken in garlic sauce, pan fried fish, butter noodles and u won be disappointed. Not a place to experiment too much. The staff is not v friendly n they ages to get ur order ready. GO only if u have ample time at hand...definitely not for a quick meal!

CIT Cafe....located very near to Park Circus...The place is comfortable and decorations are well. Most of the time in the afternoon, the restaurant is filled up with moderate numbers of people, most of them are fan following. It has varied number of seating arrangements....from accommodating group of a couple to a group of 8 people.

I have been there twice and ordered Chilly Chicken with Fried Rice which was okay and standard at both the occasion. But , it surprised me with its Crispy Fish served with Lemon Coriander Sauce....prepared with awesome splendor....It just made my eating memorable.

The people here are warm and behaved. Price goes alongside with its average standard. It doesn't get enough customers because of the odd location of this place. But , Please, if you are around, Please, give them your visit!!!

The price though has taken a higher slope around two years.. yet it is one of the best Chinese Resturants if you want a complete family Dinner... And about those times when you think Mainland China or even Hakka is a constraint on your wallet.. Try out CIT cafe....

It offers unexpectedly good Chinese. Hunan fish, garlic chicken, garlic hakka noodles, chicken in hot pepper is recommend. The quantity is also quite impressive.It gets very crowded at times, which delays the service. They also give home delivery, although restricted to a radius. 

A special pick for the pocket savers is the Lunch/Dinner Pack, which comes for Rs.110. You can chose one half portion of chicken fried rice or chicken hakka/gravy noodles and another half portion (four pieces) of Chicken in Chilly, Giner, Garlic or Manchurian sauce. Very very filling.
