Very impressed with the service and the attention paid to patrons and with a few of the dishes on the buffet spread at this lovely open style of restaurant as soon as you enter the Taj Bengal. Overall though the buffet was a tad disappointing but more than made up for by the wonderful staff.

Would not mention all the dishes on the spread but like to point out the ones that were par excellence. These included the different types of teriyaki, the cooked bacon, the superbly succulent pieces of tenderloin, the paneer tikka, the pasta and specially prepared thin crust pepperoni pizza and the kala jamun on the sweet side.

The downer being the non availability of Corona Beer. That apart a lovely afternoon at one of my old favourites.

Cheers,

The weekday lunch is 1550+ taxes.

The lunch comprises of all sort of continental, Mughal and Bengali dishes with desserts. They have a good portion of salad but I really don't know why the salads are not really palate pleaser.
The dessert section is full of desserts but when it comes to the taste only Indian malpoya and baked sweets were good. The cakes and fruits were not that good.
I think they need to figure out that customer looks for the quality than quantity. Please stick to that Taj!

Located inside one of the most posh hotels in the city, pretty classy with very convenient and helpful staff, a little on the pricey edge, wouldn't blame inorder to maintain the standards. Good fresh beer brewed, with live performance which is indeed entertaining. Great place to relax after a tiring day in luxury. Convenience of other facility within the hotel is A1.

What an amazing ambience - reminds me the about the British pubs with cozt sofas and wooden structures all around. Perfect plac to sit and relax. Visites on my bday to enoy and chill out with their mocktail - chocolate senations and cocktail - bell pepper martini - superb in taste.

How can i complaint about anything here.
Be it the food, the drink the service or ambience. Had been there one fine evening when a young group of comedians hit the stay. It was an amazing experience.

Visited a few weeks back after many years frankly. Subdued lights with candles lighting up the faces over an Aberfeldy 12 Years on the ice paired with Paprika Calamari melts were all that I remember of this nicely done up place. The round tables on your right as you enter are however placed too close to each other and hence conversations from the table next to you often freely flows into your world. Peanuts came complimentary :)

Oh what an interior!. Different class. Blues and jazz on the speakers. This place definitely makes your night very special. Price is an obvious let down but the ambience is freaking A.

You like drinking in a place which is dim? Then this is the right place to visit. Nice music playing behind. The entire environment gives a tipsy feeling. A feeling of inebriation.
