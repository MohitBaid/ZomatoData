Located just near the phoolbagan crossing, this is a new bakery shop in the area. Food is ok ok types. Nothing great to talk about. Had walnut brownies which were pretty ok. But the cakes and other items did not impressed us. AC is not available. And the place only accepts cash. However, offers are available and that's the only plus.

We ordered two brownies, one black forest cake and two truffle pastries. I must say I was pretty happy with the desserts. The truffle pastry was nice and dense and the brownie was falling apart. Overall it was pretty nice. I would definitely order again.

Tried a few items here over a period of time. They surely have some nice products. Their almond fudge brownies, and choco truffle pastries are really good. They sell one mini veg pizza BTW, which is literally awful, and I regret wasting my Rs.30 on it. I also ordered a red velvet cake, and it was decent as well. I donno why it turned sour after a few hours though, but nevertheless it tasted good when it was just bought from the outlet.

"We Bake" this bakery shop located in kakurgachi near phool bagan bus stop. We ordered "chocolate pudding" , it was fresh and the taste of the chocolate pudding was good with cherry on top.

Well, another upcoming bakery in the Kankurgachi neighbourhood ………

This outlet has opened up in the space where Sugar & Spice used to operate earlier – bang on the Phoolbagan more, near Bata. They ran a very attractive inaugural discount of FLAT 50% OFF on everything they offer for a week or so since their inception! Nice to see that they are a 100% veg bakery, which provides some respite to we – the herbivores!

We carried out a trial of the below items:-

(i)	Veg hot dog

(ii)	Paneer hot dog

(iii)	Chocolate tart

(iv)	Chocolate boat

(v)	Choco Muffins

(vi)	Veg Patties

(vii)	Paneer puff

(viii)	Regular sandwich bread

(ix)	Veg burger

(x)	Black forest pastry

(xi)	Chocolate truffle cake

(xii)	Chocolate pudding

Whereas, their muffins and tarts are heavenly, rest of the desserts and bakes don’t really live up to the expectations! Their stuff is definitely fresh, but falls somewhat short on taste!

As for their savouries, they warrant immediate improvement, as other than the paneer hot dogs, rest all are pretty mediocre!

Discounted prices are obviously very pocket friendly, but MRP is somewhat high! Serving size is fine, so is the service. They are more of a takeaway outlet – as space is pretty small.

They even bake pound cakes!

Overall, a decent experience, but they also need to work on their development areas – to survive in the cut-throat competition market of Kankurgachi!

PS:- Their chocolate pudding is to die for!
