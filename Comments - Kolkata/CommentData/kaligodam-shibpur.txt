Heard a lot about the name and the place in Howrah Maidan region and was really very curious to visit this place. With the type of crowd they had and wide range of available sweets any one can have an idea what they are capable of making.Â 
When you visit a heritage place like this it has to be more than one sweet always, So bought some quality sweets as per my liking and each and every sweet was just about awesome. Specially i liked the Kalakand the Most.. Need more of these shops in entire Kolkata region too .

The breakfast place for quality snacks at reasonable prices, best 'matar ke kachodi' served round the year, its famous for ''bundiya'' but other sweets are reasonably priced too with good hygiene and taste.

Kaligodam is a heritage sweet shop that has been in operation from before I was even born! It is known for its high quality hygienic sweets and snacks! From the taste I could make out that they use pure ghee in almost everything. Today I had a samosa and an imarti. The samosa was pretty average, but the imarti made up for it. It was like a blast of pure ghee and sugar in the mouth when I took the first bite. It was so well made, and so beautifully coated with sugar syrup. It was a bliss to taste that.
If you are a fan of desi ghee sweets, head for kaligodam and you'll keep going there till your doctor asks you to stop. Forget about calories for once and gorge onto the sweet delicacies without any guilt and you will not regret it. Do try their bundiya, they are sweet little balls of joy in the truest sense. Easy on the pocket for the quality they serve. Not very happy with their savouries but more than satisfied with the sweets. Tried the dhokla today as well, soft, overtly sweet, lacked the traditional tempering on top that we are used to in dhoklas. Did not quite like the taste of dhoklas.    However, the fafda, or what we call gaanthiya served with a papaya salad was pretty good. Loved the salad.

Kaligodam is a very old sweet shop located in howrah.For me kaligodam means pure ghee "boondiyas" and amazing jalebis.They are probably the best i have ever had.It is a sweet shop running since i was a kid and even before.I remember my father getting lots of boxes of sweets from this place and it would get over in a day. 
Only last week i had a craving for their boondiya and got it home.Its prepared so fresh, with wonderful flavours.The laddoos here are also very good,worth mention are motichoor and my most favourite pansdhari laddoo which is prepared from 5 lentils.The snacks here are also good,namely chole bhature and rajkachori. 
Prices are reasonable and their quality is unmatched. 
If youre fond of desi ghee sweets,then head here and im sure you ll come back for more.
