Mocktails - Not a burden in your pocket!
It's still in it's developing stage!
There is room for improvement !
You guys seriously need to work harder in the pastries department!
Pasta is thik thaak!

Good place for an evening guppshupp!

A cheap and cosy cafe. Good place to get together and chat as it's rarely crowded. Food is decent considering the price. Nothing extraordinary. Sandwiches are good. The sausages were coated with too much sweet sauce. Coffee options are good. Staff is helpful and pleasant. Worth visiting if you are looking for an affordable place to get together with friends.

This was the first cafe other than CCD that opened in Behala. So of course this has set the benchmark for the other cafes coming up in Behala now. My first visit to this place was almost 4 years back when this cafe had much less to offer. Well it was just startup then. Now coming to the food part what catches my attention is their mocktails, they are really good on taste buds and low on pocket. But the pastries could have been way better because most of the time I find the pastries here quite dry and bland which means they have been there for a long time. Pasta is okayish and fish and chicken dishes are lipsmacking too. 
This place is good for an evening adda among friends having a seating capacity of 20 people. You guys still have enough room for improvement on the beverages and pastry department. 
Thank you.

I have visited this cafe many times..but recently I had ordered french fries and hot chocolate both of which were not good..the hot chocolate was like Bournvita and the French fries didn't seem to be made from good oil.The ambience is good but they need to improve on their quality of food.

A small food joint situated in between sakher bazar and chowrasta jameslong sarani.The interior is very calm and ears hit by soothing music which makes a perfect place to chat with frnds over a cup of coffee.
Tried Cappuccino and chicken steamed momo.Cappuccino tasted well while the momo was mediocre in taste.
Service was fast and good.
One thing to mention it is not that pocket friendly.

A lovely cute cafe at Behala Janakalyan on James Long Sarani. Had their "Death by Chocolate" which was awfully awsome. Totally loved it. Few scoops of chocolate icecreams topped with choco chips & chocolate sauce comes in a bowl. Just heaven in a bowl. And we also had "Tutty fruity" which is extremely loveable. Chunks of fruit gel pieces infused within whipped cream & chilled ice cream. It comes in a long glass with few cherries on top. It just taste as beautiful as it looks. Both the items were agressively priced 150(death by chocolate) & 180(tutty fruity) & they dont charge any sort of gst or tax!! Just wow!! Also I must mention about the ambience too. Graphic print with attractive patterns were on the wall. A huge glaas portion is in the roadside front which allows natural light to enter which makes the attire much more attractive. Overall highly recomended for those ice-cream & cafe peoplesüòçüòò

Visited coffee den today with my colleague. It was my fifth visit. Ordered chicken pasta in white sauce, chicken salad cheese sandwich and fresh lime soda(salt). The pasta tasted really good as usual. But the sandwich was not upto the mark. The size of the bread was not that of the regular sandwich bread size. The filling inside didn't have considerable quantity of chicken.
And the fresh lime soda was awful. We were disgusted to find that the first glass served to us didn't contain anything more than ice water with 2-3 drops of lemon in it.. and without salt. They were professional enough to serve us another glass after noticing our complaint. The second was slightly better but thats not definitely fit to be called fresh lime soda.

N.B. coffee den does not accept cards. 
Paytm and cash only.

A decently sized coffee place near Chowrasta, this cafe offers a quite an extensive range on its menu. The ambience is okay enough, with some good songs playing, a book corner with some decent titles on sale. The AC needs to be pumped up though, 28 degrees is definitely hot for a monsoon evening in Kolkata!¬†
They have an all day breakfast option on their menu, not sure about the quality but the mention itself is a step in the right direction.¬†
We tried an Irish coffee, Cappuccino, Fish & Chips and a plate of steamed Chicken Achari momos. The food was decent, nothing to write home about. The Fish & Chips were mainly two pieces of fish fry with a handful of potato fries, not very impressive. Price wise it is okay - 4 items cost us 480/- bucks, no GST added yet. This cafe is okay to visit if you need a place to sit down and chat.

Located in James Long Sarani, it's a small coffee shop where you can hang out with your friends or family and have a good time. The menu consists of pastas, sandwiches and beverages of all sorts and there is a different section for breakfast. The staffs are polite and the ambience is nice as well. Plus you have free wifi to make use of your time. So overall a decent cafe where you can munch on some snacks and chill out.

We were planning to visit this place for a long time and finally we did! This place a decently decorated Cafe and the staff over here is well behaved. However, the place doesn't have a large space to accommodate too many guests. We ordered for Hawaiian magic and death by chocolate. Both of the ice creams tasted awesome and Hawaiian magic had some mango flavoured sauce which made it even more tasty. Will surely visit again.

She took a death by chocolate and me a Hawaiian magic in mango since I don't like the end flavour of pineapple. The staffs were good. The desserts were too good but the price was way cheap than most other cafes in n case of a good ice cream dessert. 
I would recommend this to every ice cream lovers in behala

We had ordered: 
1. Chicken Salami Sandwich, which was served with French fries and ketchup. The sandwiches were really cheesy and left a good aftertaste. 
2. Chicken Penne Pasta, with chicken sausage toppings, which had a bit too much cheese but was not bad at all. 
3. Cold Devil, which is basically your normal coffee topped with ice-cream and chocolate sauce. 
It's a tax free place and a pretty decent one at that for breakfast or evening snacks.

A shabby cafe in behala. That is all i can sum this place upto. As i went in i found the display counters were all empty. The front seats were taken but me and my friends got a seat at the back. But thankfully the place is not cluttered but cleanly lit. I ordered a hazelnut cappuchino based on their recomendation and my friends ordered veg burgers. The coffee was a murky mess served as if in a hurry(pic in my profile). A bit of foam floating on coffee scented whitish hot water. I could not taste the bitterness i expected nor did i get a good flavour of the hazelnut. But may be that is the way it is and i am being too finicky. My friends said the veg burher was ok. Sinc ei did not taste it i cannot write a review on that. I did try the french fries on the sides and i think its was ok. 
P.s. i think instead of offering free wifi if they served better food they could run a better business.

I went there with my college mate on the Christmas time. Ordered chicken salami sandwich which was good , chicken popcorn was really good. Both the item was served with tomato ketchup and potato finger chips. We ordered mint mojito and green apple mojito. Both were okish type. At last the show stopper came, it was death by chocolate. It was yummy!! Chocolate ice cream with waffy and chocolate sauce. It was the best. Pocket pinch is ok for the college goers. Overall a memorable sitting.

It was a treat from one of my friends. Wanted to hangout somewhere rather that cafe coffee day,as we do that a lot. So visited this place at behala..one fine evening.. The stuffs were courteous and welcomed us. They have a simple decor,with nice sitting arrangements and cool posters hanging on the wall. We ordered chicken cheese sandwich,cold coffee with ice cream and one more dessert item.. The food was served soon. The sandwich was loaded with cheese,and it was melting out with decent amount of chicken in it.. It tasted good..The cold coffee was yummy,and I loved that chocolatey dessert item.. can't remember the name though. The pricing was pretty decent,and overall a good experience. üëç

This is actually one of the best coffee places around the behala area, inspite of the fact that the competition is tough , since the number of such places in this particular area is increasing day by day. But i should say, the quality of food is great, the waiters are polite and friendly. i have been there atleast 12-15 times (yes, 12-15 times...!!!). if you are absolutely tired of having the same old coffee and sandwich in the CCDs strewn across town, please, by all means, come here once. The cold chicken and egg salad is to DIE FOR. The coffee is pretty good as well, atleast better than CCD, for sure. And on top of it, ¬†this is a pocket friendly place. I mean, where else are you going to get a regular cappu, chicken sausages, baked beans, a cheese/chicken/masala omelette (which is generously proportioned since it will cover about half of a 12-inch china plate) and fries, for INR 299. so yes, if you are a resident of behala or if you're passing through the area, do drop by. Cheers...!!!

coming to food-nothing seemed great its very ordinary but yes the sundaes are yumm you can try it if you wanna have sundaes and that too at an affordable price¬†
the ambiance is good, the service is slow and the seating arrangement is ok¬†
we ordered penne pasta in white sauce which was too much sweet for my taste buds, i din't like it
hot chocolate which was ordinary,nothing great
chicken popcorn was good¬†
blind love it was yummy ¬†and it was the shown stealer
So,if you want to go out and have some cool sundaes this a place i would recommend

Another Cafe in the addition of the recent opening of food joints in Behala and specially James Long Sarani. A large number of restaurants has come up in recent times and there is huge competition in this area now. Went to this place for a quick bite in an afternoon. I liked the overall decor and the ambience. The place is comfortable with not so loud music and a nice place to sit and have a good conversation. I even loved the location of the place. Its on the main road of James Long Sarani, just opposite to Janakalyan and can be easily located.
The service is overall satisfactory. The staffs doing their job well. But they take a lil more time then usual.
I ordered a Egg & Chicken Sandwich and a Masala Lemonade. The egg chicken sandwich really impressed me with its taste and quality but the lemonade was not as good as the sandwich.
Overall a decent place till now. Will come back to try some more stuffs.
Till then a 3.5/5 .

This is an awesome coffee shop located on james long road. The ambience is nice, restaurant is decorated nicely with music playimg in the background... A perfect blend required to start meaningful conversations or a place to have your first date ;)
I had the brownie with chocolate ice cream, and cucumber mojita. Both were awesome. Have to say, its better than CCD.

My day started on a terrible note and the heat was adding to my misery. I decided to bunk the plans I had for the day and decided to lighten up my mood with some refreshing juice. As my stars were not in the right places today the place where I decided to have my breakfast was closed so we decided to settle down for some cold coffee at COFFEE DEN.

It was early in the morning and they were not completely ready to serve the customers but invited us inside anyway(Thank you). Decoration was simple but they had some cool posters hanged which added some quirkiness to the place. We ordered one COLD COFFEE WITH ICE CREAM and EGG CHEESY BURGER. Didn't have much expectations from the Burger, but was proved wrong as it was one of the best burgers I ever had. The cost rounded to Rs 300, which is slightly on the higher side to be honest, but I ain't complaining.

Overall, had a good time. :)

With parking space the location is undoubtedly very much favourable for anyone to visit. The calm ambience is very much soothing for any friendly chat. Chicken cheese all day sandwich is my favourite. A bit overpriced though, the cafe is the second decent cafe in the area after CCD.

My friend and I went to this place on Ponchomi'15.
It's located on James Long Sarani and is very easy to locate.
It was not really crowded and the interior kinda appealed us.
The staff too are friendly.
Now coming to the food part.
I don't remember the food we had but it wasn't anything great.
The blue lagoon they serve is disgusting.This place is close to my place but I'm never going there again.

Located on James Long Sarani near Chowrasta, this cafe is not necessarily one of the best places I've been. Although the food is pleasant and service is good, the prices are comparatively higher than the quality and quantity of the dishes served. Given the location, the ambience itself could have been nicer.

A stand alone cafe at a suitable location. Service is good. Ambience is relaxing. Good behaviour of the staff. Should add to the menu and ensure all items in n the menu be available. Good place for a casual cup of coffee and tor bits. It also comes with occasional delightful presence of the owner keeping an eye on the service level...

Nice place with a well to do decor...
Then again as the place is new rather the waiters were they didn't know how to serve properly i.e. they gave us the kebab platters but they forgot to give us they dishes on which we would be having them. Now for the quality of food to b true the platter and the green apple mojito was good but most of the kebabs were the frozen ones which we buy from Spencer's and all. Now comes the part which I didn't like atall i.e. the Irish coffee and the hot chocolate, pls do improve it, it's not at all upto the mark even. About the price is really cheap to be to a cool place for college goer's to hang around.

@Management there are plenty of areas in which you should improve, pls hav a look I kind a like the place would like to visit again.

Hi,
Me nd my frnds r regular in The Coffee Den. Previously when they were new the behaviour of the staffs were gud, bt nw its getting worst day by day. They started thinking dat nw they have started doing good business nd they dont care about customers, moreover they are charging more than MRP on every items.
2ndly I had a burger last eve, the burger bread was approx 2 days old, when said to the staff, they replied they r changing it, dat meant dat it was stale. So plz frnds do think twice before going to this place.
Thank u.

I went on a winter evening to catch up with an old friend and we chose to check out this place. Tucked away in James Long Sarani this place has opened up some time back and this was my first visit. The ambience was nice and cozy. with just a few tables laid out nicely. We ordered for a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. The service was quick and the quality - decent for the prices they charge. Overall it was time well spent.

In short - Good place, nice ambience, quick service, decent prices, definitely recommended for a visit.

went there with my sis on Friday 29th Jan 2016 :D ^_^ <3

we went there at 7.30pm approx.. ( PS thanks to google map ) :P 

my sister had 1 pasta cheese / arabiata sauce with add on chicken and i had 1 chicken n egg burger with add on cheese :D ^_^ <3

review... my sis gave 3.75 and i gave 4 out of 5 !!

my review chicken n egg burger with add on cheese is 5 out 5 just awesome!!! the burger was big appetite and yummilicious!! ^_^ there was plateful of melted cheese with a big fried chicken ^_^ and the chips was just cherry on the cake! :D

the pasta i didn't have much but with one or two spoons that i tasted it was yum too!! ^_^ i don't like pasta that much but i really liked the white sauce :D ^_^

cons they take quite a time to give food :/ secondly public WiFi was not available :(

so in total we will give the coffee den 4 out of 5stars ^___^ will surely come or place order through home delivery :)))))))))))))))))

This caf√© being very close to my home, I have hit this place a number of times. Definitely serves better quality stuff and at considerably cheaper rates. The interior is satisfactory. I find the seating arrangement and the counter to be oddly planned out. Service is extremely good. The espresso was spot on and so was the cappuccino. This place serves a bit stronger coffee which I totally love unlike the extremely milky and subtle flavours in the other cafes. I even had ordered an ice cream once which was also pretty good and the quantity was also satisfactory. The book shelf catches your attention, a new improvisation which really impressed me. With free wifi and decent music this caf√© is not such a bad choice for hanging out with friends or for a coffee date with your special person.

Worst food quality and service aswell!! I ordered Chicken Ham Burger and Non Veg Club sandwich from them and It was an awful experience altogether. I asked them whether they include french fries (like they used to) or potato chips along with Burger/Sandwich and they promised me that they will provide french fries not potato chips. But, they fooled me with those cheap potato chips instead of french fries. So, they don't even respect their own commitment!
Don't believe me? Then, you better try it and I'm sure that you will repent!

I paid Rs 370 for foods that don't even deserve Rs 100.

"CHICKEN KING" is far better and cheaper that beats "The coffee den" in every aspects. 

"STAY AWAY FROM IT" is all I wanna say!

Decent enough to catch a quick bite or a cup of joe. Priced slightly on the higher side, considering the quality. Somehow couldn't feel the decor and furniture going with the mood of the place.

All coomon varieties of coffee are served along with a wide array of tit-bits. Offer a better variety of snacks n coffee than ccd at a much lesser price.

Have been here for a number of times since its inception and to be honest the place has lost much of its initial quality. The ambience is well enough for an evening hangout with friends and family but when it comes to food its a bluff. I say this Coz I have experienced the same over my last three visits. 

1.Ordered for fresh lime soda and was served with a plain nimbu pani.
2. The burger bun was oily and soggy.
3. The mayo used in them has a weird smell that spoils one's palate.
4. The prices do appear apparently fair enough for a decent cafe but the poor quality of food does not justify the rate chart.
5. Even the chicken bits in the coleslaw sandwich tastes funny and is a great turn off.
6. However the thumbs up point of this place is their tutty-fruity . It's a must try out for everyone who choose to visit this place. It's served in a generous quantity and the garnishing is a feast to the eyes. 

In all, this cafe is worth a visit for their dessert if you have no other place to chill out near at hand.

Felt cheated, we have ordered cold chicken and egg salad and coffee den special breakfast but what we received instead of the later item was coffee den normal breakfast. To clarify, when we called back, one of the restaurant staff told us, that the items mentioned in the special breakfast dish were optional and while taking order somehow they didn't understand, but the fact is they have changed the entire dish. The price I've paid was for the special one.

We are a regular customer at Coffee Den. At least 4/5 times a month we visit the place. The first thing comes to the mind for this place is Great food. try their chicken egg s/w (my fav) ,their newly launched fish and chips, ¬†fried prawn ...you will love them. the kids will love their french fries, also because they serve almost double in quantity. honestly, we go there for calmness, homely atmosphere and great food. the waiters are very cordial and always smiling. the beverage part can get improved. the coffee has right temperature and less priced compared to other places. the cocktails are okay type. i wish if ¬†they ¬† could add some fresh fruit slices in them! ¬†This place has free wifi. i wish all the best to coffee den.

Went to this place not once but twice on the same day. This place is located on the james long sarani near jana kalyan. The ambiance is nice you can also take the road side view and have your coffee and snacks.¬†

I ordered Cheese chicken sandwich, one sundaye cooler and and egg sandwich. The sandwich was nice, but the only issue being that they did not remove the bread side crust and it was getting difficult to have that part. The cooler was nice. But I think it will take time for this joint to get things perfect.

Awesome place to chill out...walk able distance and most important very decent staffs. One thing is a concern if there can be a parking as on both side there are no parking signs and every time need to look outside if the car is not been dragged by the crane

Decorations are good.waiting time is just too much.we ordered 1 irish coffee 1 cappuchino along with spaghetti. The coffee was delivered after 45 minutes though the cafe was nearly empty.sphagetti was good but the sugar provided with the coffee was caramel flavoured and disrupted the original flavour of coffee.

I have visited like 5-6 times, really good food. The best thing about them is that they freshly prepare the food, which takes a bit time but that can be adjusted with talks and chat...I have almost tasted everything on their menu...loved the cheese and chicken omelette that was something new...Really a great place for adda, snacks and coffee...

The place looks cool and casual. There is something friendly about the decor and the atmosphere here. Food is well priced and tastes good.
Drinks are not bad either. Go with your gang and sit for hours here.
It wont hurt your pocket and the places promises to give you a good time.

This sort of modern coffee joint is a rare sight in the behala area (except the ccd franchise ofcorse!) thus i was quite delighted to find one just near my house. The location is a bit tricky but once u enter u would find ample awesomeness in its food and service, tht i cn assure u of. The decor of the place is sober, cool and up to the mark. I really liked the presence of the aquarium and the library at the corner. Moreover, this place had this ubercool feel abt it. Nw lets mv on to the food. The items that i had ordered were sausages in onion sauce and tutty fruity. The former dish was quite good if not mindblowing. The sausages were really soft and full of taste. The onion sauce, i found it to be sharp for my palate. I found this dish to b a bit overpriced. Next came the tutty fruity. Now this one i really liked. It was creamy, fresh, full of fruits and a bit too sweet :P. It was one of the best tutty fruities tht i ever had! The service was quick and nyc. Its a great place to hang out with friends but even if ur alone, dont hesitate to visit. Afterall, this place comes with its own free wifi!!

Been there. Was looking for an alternative to the nearby CCD. Decor is nothing exceptional to be mentioned as such. Food price is standard. But the breakfast thing we ordered with sausage was nothing special. I doubt whether I'll visit again.

Edit: 13.11.15 Well we did visit again, this time for some cold refreshments. Coffee devil (their variant of Devil's own) was not available so had to be content with cold coffee with ice cream which was nice. Also ordered melon cooler, hoped it was fresh watermelon but found melon syrup instead, anyway that was good too. increasing the rating by .5 for the free wi fi :D

After reading the brilliant reviews on zomato I decided to check out the place for myself. First of all, the ambience is really good. There are posters on the wall, music playing in the background, a shelf with books in it. The decor  is really beautiful. Overall the place is easy on the eyes. It's a nice change from the same old Cafe Coffee Day. 
Now coming to the food. I did not like their food that much. The snacks are not good at all! I had ordered a Ham and Cheese burger. It was very salty. My friend had ordered a chicken salami. It wasn't that good either. But it was better than that awful burger at least! Their dessert section is really good. The drinks and sundaes tasted amazing. I tried the Tutty Fruity one and it was brilliant! My friend had a Blue Lagoon. Brilliant! 
To be honest their desserts are really good but the snacks are horrible. I only liked the salad that they had served with that burger! They don't charge any extra taxes or VAT though. But the food is a bit pricey. Its a good place to hang out with friends. But only if you are in mood for desserts or drinks or coffee! My favourite thing about this coffee shop is probably that book shelf! Its very unique and keeps you busy and entertained. Lastly the staff is really polite and well mannered. They take a lot of time to serve the orders though.
I think I might visit again to try one of their drinks sometime. No snacks for me though! But I still prefer Cafe Coffee Day's food to theirs! I think CCD's standard and quality of food and desserts and  is a lot better than Coffee Den's.

I ordered with a lot of expectations because the menu is really impressive and finding Bacon and Ham in Behala is not easy.So last evening I ordered a home delivery. I ordered the special all day breakfast and spaghetti with cheese sauce and bacon.
I first thing was the order came after 1 hr 15 min.,where they promised half an hour.
Secondly the order was wrong. I got the normal all day breakfast(toast,omlette,French fries,baked beans,sausages) where I was expecting bacon rashers and ham with it as I ordered the special.
Thirdly the pasta was a little floury.Though I have to say the pasta tasted alright otherwise. 
But the marks they get is for the baked beans and omelette.....but that's not what I exactly ordered was it??

The newest caf√© in town (read behala) and one of my favorite places to spend a nice evening with family or friends over yummy food.  The staff is great and they always take your feedback of the food. Their Tutti Fruity is a must have ice cream dessert which is loaded with nuts, wafers, dollops of ice cream, and syrups of different flavours. 

¬†I have tasted : The all day breakfast which is decent but a bit over priced, The chicken sandwiches which are fresh delicious and beautifully presented on a pristine white dish with a portion of French fries, and a few tablespoons of delicious mayo coleslaw on a lettuce leaf, The potato wedges, Tutty Fruity(MUST HAVE), Cappuccino, Cold Coffee with ice cream (needs improvement with the thickness), The Chicken Maggi, and the white and red sauce pasta which I personally did not like (I am not at all a pasta fan but my friends ordered it so I tasted) The pasta tasted a bit too authentic (or in my language, bland) which is good but not for me. So if you like authentic pasta you should give this place a shot. 

I like the minimalistic but very coffee shoppy d√©cor of the place. They have a refrigerated display counter to store patties, pastries, cake slices, etc and everything looks really inviting though I am not sure if I have at all ordered from there. Next to the counter are a few books on a shelf which you can read with your cuppa. The best part is that they offer free Wifi!! Also, things are reasonably priced so for me this place is a sure hit!

Food : 4/5

Service: 4.5/5

Ambience: 3.5/5

Value for Money: 3.5/5

It's surprising how much people expect out of a joint which is situated in a locality where people aren't big money spenders to be honest so hopefully the place will have longevity. As per the reviews one major issue was the limited choices in the menu, I mean it's not a restaurant therefore I appreciated the range of menu it offered. The burger was good and the dressing offered with has room for improving, I liked the sides that was offered and the shake was excellent. I feel the place can put some smooth background music to improve the ambience other than that all is good. Check out the place and keep your expectations in check, when in Rome do as the Romans do, you can't compare this place to places which are situated in posh localities. It has good value for money.

Situated in James Long Sarani before Chowrasta, this is a newbie that promises plenty. It was a sudden discovery last evening and owing to my ever-experimental nature, I along with my friend decided to try it out.
It's a small cafe with only a few tables and with the menu providing very limited choices, we decided against experimentation. We ordered a Penne (Chicken) in red sauce and Chicken Sausage in onion sauce, both of which were made justice to and served in right proportions. The summer cooler and a ginger rock (I don't exactly remember the names) were also pretty good. 
Verdict : Behala needs more of such places to establish and this place, with a little more variety in the menu and an increase in personnel could regularly attract customers in days to come.

Its a nice place to spend time with friends. The food here are of very good quality but are quite expensive. The only problem here is that they takes quite along time to serve the foods. The another most attractive thing of this place is the availability of high speed WiFi which makes this place more attractive for the teenagers.

I was looking for this hangout place in behala ,becuase it's really difficult to come up with one in here. And I don't really like CCD so much and voila! Coffee Den :D
We had hamburger, blue lagoon and Monte Carlo. The burger was pretty good, with mayo and coleslaw and mustard sauce and French fries and tomato sauce and extra coleslaw. The lagoon was OKAY.. not as good as I had expected and I expect sheer mouthgasms ofcourse. The Monte Carlo was nice too... I am looking forward to try their pasta next time. And the next time is going to come very soon.

so since zomato wouldn't let me write another review , here it goes again.
This place is going to give serious competition to CCD!! We had pasta with cheese sauce and chicken topping, cold coffee with ice-cream, something something devil (oops don't remember the exact¬† name :p) , rainbow sundae and some other chocolate sundae, and chicken tikka sandwiches. EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE SO GOOD.... try all my dear friends.. try all. I personally loved the pasta, so i would request you people to definitely try it :)

Another lovely addition to my neighbourhood!
This was our 1st visit, but would definitely not be the last!

On Good Friday, 5 of us headed to place.Initially we faced lil troubl in finding a table to accomodate 5.. But management was prompt enough to arrange for 1..

We had tried the following items. My recommendation is the Tandoori Chicken Sandwich shouldnt b missed, a any cost!!

Ginger Lemon Rock(Marvellous),Blue Lagoon(Lovely, not watery like CCD), Fresh Lime Soda(we ordered for sweet, found found it to be tad sour),Farfalle pasta in white sauce(Good),Tandoori Chicken Sandwich(Awesome is the word!)Tandori Chicken Salami Sandwich(Okayish) and lastly a Monte Carlo(Good)

Definitely gonna visit the place soon!

You get free WiFi which is like a must in every cafe nowadays. I ¬†personally love their Chicken & Egg Sandwiches, its so Mayonishy that you will have Mayorgasm in your mouth.

I have seen this place quite a few times on my way and back and remember making a mental note to visit this place. Only until recently I got an oppurtunity to do so. 
Directions: Located on James Long Sarani in between Janakalyan and Chowrasta (though it is closer from J).
My Order: All Day Breakfast(Mushroom Omlette, Toast, French Fries & Sausage) and Cappuchino.
Pocket Pinch: 300
Pros: 
1. Cheaper than CCD. 
2. Free Wi-fi. You need to ask them the password, though.
3. Friendly staff. 
4. You can laze around with your food for as long as you want. No hurries. 
5. Tax free.
6. Tasty food. I had a good omlette after ages. 
Cons: Superlatively bad taste in music. First of all, they don't play music always but, when they do, its bad.

A much awaited cafe in Sakherbajar Behala area. it's nicely located on James long sarani. just on the opposite side of a park. people can park their cars easily in front of it. 

The menu consist of hot and different new types of¬† cold beverages. any one will find the right one for them. the food is also vivid. the sandwiches are fantastic. the chicken egg s/w is just out of the world. before ordering just mention them to put the egg whites inside...they will always try to put some extra love into the sandwiches. pastas are very¬† tasty, a must try. but the bakery products are not as good as the cooked stuff.

only one minus point of this cafe is a small sitting area. only 20-23 people can seat at a time. the place is gaining popularity so one might have to wait for a seat during the evenings. the place has free wifi.

as a regular visitor of cafes, i keep Coffee Den above other branded cafes nearby foe their variety of food ,right temperature of the coffee and warmness of the staff.

read some good reviews and saw good ratings in Zomato, so had to visit this place...i have seen this place come up at the same place where it was initially a restaurant called GARDEN RESTAURANT and then in few months, changed to CUP OF JOY....and finally it has changed to where i went in today, THE COFFEE DEN..

i gave a rating of 3.5 which means i liked this place on first visit but, there are definite scopes of improvement....good things first...bright and vibrant interiors...nice colors used to give it a cool look...framed pictures of coffee and related quotes which gives a feeling of a cafe...nice printed graphics of coffee on the tables.....WiFi available for free...free parking available in front of the cafe...

we ordered 2 chicken salami sandwich...a cold coffee with ice cream and a choco chip muffin...the cold coffee was good...the sandwiches were tasty but very basic....they grilled a sandwich with pre-cooked chicken salami pieces and mayo...i expected some xtra stuffing like some tomatoes or onions...they came accompanied with coleslaw which was fresh...i liked that coz in many places u will get stale coleslaw which is a put off....but a little dissapointed with the french fry portions....they tasted nice but were very little and small bits and pieces size as if they were the left overs from the packet...the biggest disappointment was the muffin which they heated with a little chocolate sauce on top....absolutely dry and i can bet that its a few days old....no chocolate chips inside....they missed a trick...its ok to serve a little old muffin like 3-4 days old but then they should be sprayed with water and then heated so get the moisture back in the muffin....

we didnt eat the muffin after a bite and when the staff asked for feedback, they saw it...i obviously told them what was the issue and i liked the fact that they immediately offered to replace it which i said not to coz they are going to give another one from the same lot :)) but i liked their promptness to give that extra which many other place wud just ignore and argue that their food is all fine....when i asked for bills, they removed the muffin price but again i insisted to put it back in and then reluctantly they did...little things but i liked it...

my overall impression is that they can utilize this space a little better...also what was largely missing was some music that wud have taken the ambience to a different level....they should introduce some more snacks on the menu which gives more option and reason to come back as some of the food is too basic....a nice place to hangout with friends...not a big pinch in ur pocket and their prices are inclusive of taxes which is a good thing....taxes do burn the pocket these days :))) but i think they have got that added to the final price anyways...

to the owners and management...this joint has great potential and got a good start....please see if you can be a bit more creative and bridge some of the gaps...behala crowd craved for such an outlet and they will come if you give them a reason to come....all the best

Finally a good place for hanging out with friends in behala. Better than CCD in all respects, the place has a lovely ambience,beautiful decor and friendly staff. I went there with a friend nd had hot chocolate and chocolate ice cream. The ice cream was delicious and substantial. The hot chocolate was good though a little bland but overall it was a good experience. I hope to try out their other stuff sometime as its quite close to my home. Its good stuff for reasonable prices. Give it a try sometime.

Amazing place , beats all CCD's and barista's any day single handedly. The staff is fantastic and very Cordial and very helpful. We accidentally landed up here and was shocked. Firstly they have a car parking right in from of their place which is awesome. If Then the coffee is amazing. We literally customized our coffee with he help of the staff and it was over the top awesome excellent. We had under estimated the strength of the cafe and ordered 2 sandwiches and we were shocked to see its size and the quantity per plate. The taste was just lip-smacking, yummy, awesome, etc..... Not at all pricy, still cozy, comforty and a gala place to hangout.

A great place to catch up with friends or family over coffee and light snacks. The cafe is very prettily decorated and has a quaint and lovely ambience.
The staff is warm and courteous and the service is pretty fast.
I had tried the Chicken Sandwich and the Cappuccino, both of which were very good. The prices are quite pocket friendly, so all in all, this place is definitely worth a visit.
