Moori(puffed rice) and Telebhaja is a like a match made in heaven and any true bengali will die for it. And here they serve the best Telebhaja in town. Anytime you visit this place you will find it crowded with people each asking for their favorite Telebhaja. Must try is the alur chop, beguni and piyaji. Also there is kashmiri chop, dhoka, capsicum chop etc.

This place is a legendary one if North Kolkata. Calcuttans love to have Telebhaja as snacks always no matter how many pizza and burger shops open in the town. Netaji Subhash Chandra Basu used to come here to have their Peyanji. Always crowded be in morning or Night they serve the best Telebhaja according to me. Tried each of their items and I cannot specify any one item as my favourite. Price is cheap. They don't have any seating facility.

Lakshmi Narayan Shau and Sons has conferred sophistication to the essentially Bengali delicacy named 'telebhaja' and established a legacy of its own. At the heart of the old city of Kolkata, this outlet has catered to generations. From the basics such as Aloor Chop and Peyaji to the more ambitious Soyabean er Chop or Aamer Chop for that matter, each item bears a trademark of its own here.

Its a truly oh Calcutta !! thing...Laxmi Narayan Shaw typically famous for their Telebhajas.Serves a wide variety of Telebhajas. The shop has a historical background which says that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose used to come to to eat telebhajas and keeping that in mind on every 23rd January they offer free telebhajas. Had Dhokar bora , Panner Cutlet and they were mind blowing. Therefore if you want to get a touch of history and nostalgia do drop here !! Highly recommended 😊😊

Bengali and telebhaja  its the combination of bread and butter. 

As I know from north Kolkata and lucky to stay near by to this joint. 


Have lots of memories with this shop. 
While coming from hedua after my swimming  classes we used have snack most often. 
Best days of my childhood evening snacks. 

Very famous and very old telebhaja(fried cutlets) shop in North Kolkata. Their Paneer chop is very good. But Piyaji(fried onions with besan batter) is to die for. Also they offer free cutlets on 23rd January- Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's Anniversary.

This is a legendary vegetable " telebhaja" outlet in North Kolkata renowned for Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's fondness for their products. The various types of chop are really mouthwatering . Aloor chop , piyaji , kashmiri chop , aam chop , dhoka barfi all taste brilliant . The oil they use for  telebhaja is must be of high quality as I have never faced any problem with indigestion after having them. They also have some chirebhaja , bhujiya which combine very well with telebhaja . Seating is unavailable but that's hardly any hindrance as people queue up in front of the shop for their turn to gulp down the chops . Highly recommended .

This is the famous snacks shop, which took an active role in our independence. Our legend, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is one of the famous personalities who was a big fan of snacks of this shop. Even today also neither the glory nor the quality has been compromised, rather they have come up with different new items. Then best thing is, on each birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose(23rd January) they distribute snacks to everyone free of cost, just to pay tribute to the legendary hero.

They have a huge daily turnover and even serve free cutlets on the Netaji's birthday.

The place is a hit to the people of North Kolkata as well as trending among the South Kolkata residents who flock to the northern part of the city in search of unique traditional dishes.

Its a soul relation between north Kolkata and Lakshmi Narayan Shaw's telebhaja. Inspired by none other than Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Lakshmi Narayan was a true Indian. And so the telebhaja s of this shop are so true in taste and patriotism. Heard so many times about this shop and visited here couple of days ago. Wanted to eat all the cutlets and chops but finally calm down. Tasted paneer cutlet and soyabean chop which are so authentic in taste.

If u kept aside the history of the shop then the one of the best menu is kashmirichop, amerchop, beguni. Monsoon without the televaja of lakshmi narayan is incomplete. And thn a walking beside tge tram lone surely make you nostalgic n u will find a hidden kolkata. One time must experience.

'Telebhaja' is an indispensable part of Bengali cuisine. In almost every lane of Kolkata you can find telebhaja shops. This one is one of the best among them, serving for decades. It is popularly known as ' Netajir choper dokan' since Netaji himself was a fan of their 'peyaji'. I heard that they serve telebhaja for free on 23 rd January.
They made a wide array of telebhaja including panner chop, narkel er chop, soyabean chop etc ( no non vegetarian items).
At least one visit is deserved even from those who are not fond of telebhaja.

This is one of the oldest in the area and was previously known as 'Netajir chop er dokan' since it was Subhas Chandra Bose's favourite. The fritters include only vegetaraian options where my favourites are peyaji and the ones with soyabean and paneer. The pricing is probably the cheapest in the whole city. Do give this a try !

It is located on Bidhan Sarani near Hatibagan. They serve fresh and clean plus great fried pakoras. পেঁয়াজী, চপ are the specialties here. Capsicum, paneer, soya chunk etc etc all type of pakoras are available. They actually carry a heritage with them. I have heard that they even distribute free pakoras on Netaji's Birthday. This is a perfect snack station worth 3.5.

"Telebhaja"(fried snacks) is a word, very closely associated with the bong gastronomy, specially when it comes to traditional bong snacks. A stroll through the lanes of  Kolkata will surely give you a vibe of how popular and indispensable a part is "Telebhaja", if the bong food habits are taken into note.

And while discussing about the same, a few minutes walk on Cornwallis Street, from Shyambajar 5 point crossing, towards Hatibagan will lead you to a popular "Telebhaja" shop called "Lakshmi Narayan Shaw & Sons", popularly known as "Netaji Telebhajar Dokan"(the reason being Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, used to crave for their snacks during his time, and even today on his birthday, free snacks are distributed from this shop).

So if you want to be a part of a historical legacy along with some tasty bites of traditional bong snacks, don't think twice to walk in here.
An amazing variety of snacks, specially the 'chops'(a kind of Telebhaja), are something that is sure to make you fall for this place anyday with its taste, if you prefer to give it a try.

Note- If you are not used to with the taste of 'telebhaja', then either you need to develop a taste for the same, or you may give it a miss.

Heard a lot about this place from my school days. Even i use to pass this place thousand times for my ofc but never had a chance to come here. Very popular and renowned in the entire city because Netaji use to have fries from this very shop in his days.
Tried few fries in forms of Kashmiri, vegetable and papad too. After having all of them i found all the stuffs to be very average. As said above from one of my friend its just the name hype.
But still believes that there are few more to be tasted here which i heard of later from others.

Heritage, Nostalgia, a place of pride; I believe the above phrases aptly describes the elegance and importance of this outlet. Located between Hatibagan and Hedua, close to a gift outlet named 'The Shop', this is one store, you may have heard your parents speaking about in their leisure time. Zomato did not exist in the pre-independence area, else people would have had been spectator to some of the historical check-ins, this place has ever seen.

Famed and visited by the famous Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, this place is famous for serving delicious and lipsmacking 'Chop's'. Aam, Soyaben, Narkel, Mango, Paneer, Capsicum, this place has a variety of chops in their offerings. Each of them has an unique taste and is different from the other. The hyped dish of this place is the famous Peyaji, which was supposedly what brought Netaji to this place countless number of times. The owners here have successfully managed to hold on to their tradition and fame, and has not compromised with their quality. To honor the legend, they even serve free Chops on the eve of Netaji's Birthday. The prices here are dirt cheap. But hey, do not get baffled. The pricing really does not justify the quality and aura this place has to offer.

Since 1918 the small 'telebheja' corner has been the love of the locals.... To indulge in the history of it,, the small shop was called Netajir chop-er dokan,,,, since it was Subhas Chandra Bose's favourite little shop nd he celebrated his birthday twice at this shop.... Perhaps it's time for you to get a taste of history....

Heard a lot about this place from my school days. Even i use to pass this place thousand times for my ofc but never had a chance to come here. Very popular and renowned in the entire city because Netaji use to have fries from this very shop in his days.
Tried few fries in forms of Kashmiri, vegetable and papad too. After having all of them i found all the stuffs to be very average. As said above from one of my friend its just the name hype.
But still believes that there are few more to be tasted here which i heard of later from others.

Well known as Netaji's teleybhajar dokan...a heritage shop...near Hatibagan famous for selling variants of Bong's so called "Teleybhaja". Starting from piyaji, aloor chop, kashmiri chop, capsicum chop, to paneer chop and paneer cutlet....all are really delicious and perfect companion for bangali's chai break in the evening.

They sell very tasty Bong street food like aloor chop, mochar chop, aam-adar chop etc.  which I've tasted. Fried in fresh oil, their snacks uphold the art of Bengali 'telebhaja.'

This is almost a heritage eatery with the name of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose associated with it. Its said that Netaji used to visit this place and loved the peyaji here (from where the other name of the shop - Netajir peyaji - came). 

Today the shop is known for the variety telebhajas they serve. My personal experience says the quality have dropped in the last couple of decades, but still they are not bad. 

Apart from the peyaji, I love their soyabean, aam and narkel chops. 

If you are nearby do stop for a telebhaja or two.

One of the oldest shop in North Kolkata. They serves a free piyaji to all customers every year on Netaji subhas Chandra Bose's birthday. This was his favourite shop. 
If you visit must try their piyaji and vegetables cutlet.

2 or 3 times I have been here. normally I took tram rides from Dharmatala towards Shyambajar..stoppage is Hedua. It is situated just beside the main road.. varieties of Chops are available here..Mochar chop, piyaji, Plain Chop are the best.. its a fact that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose used to have a bite in this very shop..

Great place to catch up with a heritage snack of Calcutta, which has transcendented into Kolkata. Great atmosphere, with the beautiful bust of Netaji Shubhash Chandra Bose outside,which lends the ship the misnomer, "Netaji's Cutlet Shop". Had been a hub for exchanging of information during the Freedom Struggle of India.

Great place to partake a little of history along with small delicious snacks.

This place looks like the typical end-of-the-lane Telebhaja shop, except this one reminds you with bold signs that its not to be treated trivially , as several people of high repute have been here , tasted chop , and felt conquered by the the army of chop that they display everyday in a huge brass plate . The chop is fried at around 4 pm , so if you want them fresh and crispy with your chai , go visit them during that time . The shop also has packaged snacks like chanachur bhujia etc . The chops here are surprisingly cheap , so don't be fooled by the price tag , because they taste heavenly ! The piyaji somehow seems to be popular here , but I personally liked the beguni better . The soyabean chop is a must try ! It is an achievement that deserves special mention . The paneer chop is innovative and different and tasted good. Try the kashmir chop , narkel chop and veg cutlet too . They also have dhoka , capsicum chop , and aamer chop ( mango , that's available even in winter! ) .  If you pass by hatibagan during the evenings , don't forget to give this place a visit !

From the time of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose till 21st century this vegetable chop shop is there. So you want or not this place already get attention because of its really long presence over in the same business. Its in words that Mr. Bose himself used to eat from here & its still famous for that reason. You can see Subhas Chandra Bose's statue in front of the shop & his pictures on the title banner of the shop to identify its authenticity.

Chops : The chops are fresh every time. With lots of vegetable chop options available from Kasmiri Chop, Alu Chop, Piyaji, Beguni, Soyabin Chop, Fulkopir Chop, Dhoka etc etc, its hard to remember all their variety where they have too many & also makes different once according to season. What I realized about the chops are they are not just well fried, but they doesn't contain extra oiliness that most of the people hates. The chops are ideal in its position because of its authentic taste. Yes all the chops do taste different than other chop shops. Their different chops tasted good but unfortunately not the best chop out there. Personally I like their Piyaji the most.

Conclusion : If you love Bengali foods & chops, & you are near to the Hatibagan then this place is a must try to taste their really long experience in making chops. There is another chop shop just opposite to this shop on crossing road (Its not present on Zomato), is the main rival of this shop & they do compete well with this.

This is a very famous 'telebhaja' shop in the north. Almost always crowded,they serve a variety of vegetarian chops which sell out rapidly. The chops are always fresh and taste very good,indeed.
My personal favourites are the soyabean and the kashmiri chop.
Its a nice place to order some chops to munch on during my frequent walks at Bidhan Sarani.

Non descriptive telebhaja seller in hatibagan.  Worth mentioning: They give away free telebhaja [fritters] on every 23rd Jan in memory of Netaji.
