Located near andul bus stand opposite to haldiram outlet. Me And my friends visited this place last night.  The restaurant is on the first floor with a decent decor. I think this the best looking restaurant in this locality.(except food) Decor and environment was nice. 
We ordered tandoori chicken, egg fried rice, garlic chicken, tandoori roti, chicken tikka masala and sezwan chicken.
Tandoori chicken was good quite average nothing special in it. Egg fried rice was also average i found it little bit oily. Tandoori roti was the worst i had ever. It's was like had papod. They changed it but next time it was less hard than the first time but it was hard i can't find any tender and soft part like a tandoori roti. Garlic chiken surprised me with its color in past when I had garlic chicken it was always red in color but here it came as white with very flat taste. Chicken tikka masala and the sezwan chicken good in taste with nice flavour. I will recommend these 2 items as side dish.
Stuff behavior was good. But they must put more attention to the customer rather than chatting between themselves.
You may find this place as a pocket friendly restaurant according to the menu but the quantity they serve was not up to the mark. They can put higher price with good quantity. In my opinion if you have to eat side dish then you order 2 of them because one plate quantity would not be enough to finish the main course so practically this place was not pocket friendly but overall not expensive.
Price-4/5
Quantity-2/5
Decoration-4/5
