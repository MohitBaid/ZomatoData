Yesterday ordered Chicken Biriyani (with egg) from this Hazra outlet of Tandoori Darbar to kick-start 2018!!

It was actually my first online order with Zomato Order ( as Swiggy does not serve in my location üòû)

So!! The order came before time; precisely 15 mins earlier --- which is really commendable because being 1st Jan I was expecting the order to arrive much late, so I am really thankful for this.

Now, thanx to Zomato as I got 150/- off for my #Firstorder

Now coming to the food part..
THE #CHICKENBIRIYANI
Yuuuuummmmmmyyyyyyyy üòáüòáüòá
The biriyani rice was just too good, really long grains!! Taste is little bit on the spicier side, so I'll definitely not recommend this Biriyani for those who love less-spicy food, but yes, for the #Biriyanilovers, they must try this Biriyani, I think they will love it..
Aloo of the Biriyani was amazingly soft, chicken pieces were quite big, cooked well too. Quantity was good enough for one, and the Achaar came along with it was like a solid pinch in your taste buds, which is good!

So, overall it was a very good experience indeed & am definitely going to try their other Tandoori dishes in future & ofcourse The Biriyani ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

Food was okayish. Staffs were not polite and courteous. 
Ordered their Manchow soup which was good,but their Reshmi Kebab didn't tasted that good.
The tables were quite higher than the sofa,so had a hard time having food.

The tandoori chicken is an delicacy here. Everytime I come to eat here I never go disappointed. A must for tandoori and kebab lovers. The fish is also quite tasty and extremely good value for money. The chicken Reshmi butter masala and butter chicken are my favorites. The behaviour of the management and stewards are nice.

Nearly empty when we arrived..we ordered fish cheese kebab which was mouth watering..though they said it would take 30 mins to prepare they did it within 20 mins and it was mouth watering..
Next we ordered veg fried rice and salsa fish which they recommended..the fried rice was excess in quantity and that fish was also a lot though the fish didn't taste that good..it had this sweet and sour taste from tomato sauce or such other sauces..lastly we had an ice cream with fruits..which was basically a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and frozen papaya and strawberriy maximum 10 pieces all together..which costed 100 bucks..
I would suggest go on and have the Kebabs specially this one..but the rest I can't guarantee

A very good restaurant located in the heart of the City. Located near Jatin Das Park, this restaurant offers some great cuisines one can enjoy. Staff are well mannered, the order you place gets on your table in around 15-20mins, the taste is good too. If you are visiting for the first time, try Chicken Biriyani along with Chicken Rezzalla, in case you are a vegetarian then go for Butter Naan with Shaahi Paneer.

I had placed an order at 8.30 pm.... at 10.55pm i contact zomato that i haven‚Äôt yet recieved the order. They told me to wait while they contact the restaurant. I called up the restaurant and they say that the order has been taken out. I have already made the payments. But the money is not the issue. Its about how irresponsible these restaurants are it proves. Never really had this bad experience till date, have been ordering food online a lot since the apps have appeared on app store, but this was the first resiculous experience i had. Very upset with this restaurant and their irresponsible staffs. And the most upsetting fact is that even after 3hours, i didnot recieve the order. üò°

Well you'll not get the foods in desired order, they will bring the starter, main course and desserts all at a time and yeah like I am supposed to eat biriyani, nuns and kababs all at a time in the same plate üòë , slow claps üôè
And the behaviour of the waiter, even behaviour of auto drivers of south kolkata will be sweet for you once you visit this place.

A glass of water comes after 50 mins of waiting and there isn‚Äôt any water in the tap in restroom. The food was so oily and had no taste. Seemed like it was made in utter haste. 
Hadn‚Äôt a co-colleague made us come here, we would have never entered the place. This isn‚Äôt acceptable.

The restaurant is located at Hazra more, Beside Jatin das park.
The restaurant offers a huge and versatile no. Of kebabs which are without any doubt delicious.
The Achari kebab and hariyali kebab stood outstanding if one really wants to have a bit spicy food.
The Biriyani over here is absolutely fine without any extra smell, which actually adds to its quality.
Even the services provided by the people are really impressive.
Most importantly, 
If one try to have some mughlai food in a prominent place of Kolkata like Hazra within a reasonable range, this place is a must!

When we called them and asked for our order then one of them took it down and served us in the next 15 min. The interior is extremely ordinary but the food is really good.. We had a kebab platter and biryani. The biryani was very good and the staff was well trained.

Being the only "proper" kebab serving restaurant around Hazra region, this was our choice for the evening; a disastrous choice I would reckon. The moment we stepped into restaurant, I picked up a whiff of pesticides/insecticides, apparently they either got a pest control done not too long back, or tried their own anti bug sprays; we overlooked it just to satisfy the kebab pang we had. We tried:

1. Chicken cheese kebab - 2.5‚≠êÔ∏è

2. Chicken tikka kebab - 2.5‚≠êÔ∏è

The kebabs were salty AF; both of them. The meat was tender, the cheese ample & the spices almost perfect...but the salt!! Drenching it with lemon didn't quite help either.

A dismal experience. Nothing more than a 2.5‚≠êÔ∏è. Not returning.

An average experience with this particular restaurant. Although I get really nostalgic when I enter here (as so many college memories are associated). Food is average. Don't try their Biriyani. The meat piece of the biriyani doesn't taste like biriyani meat but rather meat piece of regular curry. You can try their tandoori chicken. That is good. Ambience average.

All the items were excellent. Prices are slightly on the higher side. But taste and quality were very nice. The kabab plate had four types of kabab (chicken, mutton, fish and prawn). In Hazra locality I tried many mughlai restaurants; I feel Tandoori Darbar is the best.

But what really stuck with me is when we went during the pujas, even with the huge waiting line and a hectic service the place didnt disappoint. The service even during this rush hour was really impressive and the food quality was on point.

Stumbled upon this joint while searching for a decent biriyani lunch on normal working day around Hazra area along with a colligue. Ordered Mutton Biriyani and salad. Quanity of the biriyani was good enough and taste was decent. Service was a courteous but a bit slow. Overall a decent experience.

Been there for multiple times. Tandoori was great. But the quality of Biriyani is not good. Waiters are well behaved and they do not take much time to serve.

I have been a regular here for about 8 years now. Unfortunately, the prices of the food have skyrocketed, and that has robbed the place of its well-renowned pocket-friendly badge. Nevertheless, it's one of the handful of places which provide quality Chinese as well as Indian food. There are only a few items on the menu I haven't tried, and they are all upto the mark. The Chicken Biriyani, paired with the Cucumber Raita, is absolutely delicious. The Chicken Tikka Butter Masala or Chatpata Butter Masala goes well with the Naan. I prefer the Chatpata Masala to the Tikka Masala, because the former has a tangy aftertaste which I love. For starters, don't miss the Red Hot Pepper Chicken. Its spicy sauce is fabulous. Among the kebabs, I love their Hariyali, Tikka and Achari kebabs. Their Chicken Tandoori are good too, but their spice palate is Punjabi (obviously, duh!) which lends to a faintly bitter aftertaste to the chicken. I think it's distinct from the Mughlai Tandoori which are more spice-rich but lack that Kasuri-methi-like bitter relief. From the Chinese cuisine, their Fried rice and Chowmein pair well with Schezwan, Manuchurian or Chilli Chicken. They also season their Schezwan Fried Rice or Chowmein quite nicely, so that you don't need a main course to be paired with it. A word of advice, stay away from their mutton items. They use lean mutton which have a distinct goat-ish smell to it.

Am a regular at this place as its near my house. I mainly love its Biriyani (2 muttons/chicken they give in a normal plate). Tandoori chicken is also nice.
What I feel is they make their chicken side dishes like kadhai chicken chicken handi & few more a bit tangy. 
Overall its a really nice restaurant. A value for money. They never compromise with the quantity & quality also.

Ordered Normal Chinese food...It was one of the days when Kolkata recorded one of the heaviest rainfalls this year. Me along with my girlfriend went there after walking for almost 5-8 kms drenched in the rains... We ordered for a Starter, & two main course items & the order came up for only two items and in the final bill it was charged for all the items. Then suddenly I noticed & it was sorted out later. Food was also so so.. Service was not upto the mark. Expected some better treatment.

Visited here last pujo with a group of 10 people. 
I realise it was amidst all the hustle bustle of Kolkata pujo, so we didn't mind waiting for sometime. 
The service was very very slow. 
The chicken tandoori platter consisted of few dry and hard chicken pieces. Disappointed by then.
On top of that, the biryani too was bad. Now honestly I prefer softer potato pieces in the biryani atleast the ones to cut through. But this potato piece would take eternity. 

All I could give them was the points for their decor. No good reason to visit, otherwise.

We had Tandoori Darbar Chicken Special, Tandoori Roti, Chicken Hyderabadi, Butter Chicken(Shredded). The food was fresh, cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious (specially Tandoori Darbar Chicken Special and Chicken Hyderabadi). Even now, a week on, we are still talking about how much we enjoyed it. A word of praise must go to the staff that made us feel welcome and served us attentively It won't be our last visit for sure.

Visiting this place was the biggest mistake during the pujas. The food served was horrible. It is not a good place to sit and dine. Take aways might be better as we have always ordered for home delivery. But cannot be to foul mouthed about this place as it was open at 3 am in the morning and came as a survivor when none other place was open and we were hungry. Cannot really recommend as the food was really bad.

A minute's walk from Hazra intersection, this was another place I often visited during my 3 year stay at Bhawanipore. Not very spacious, the restaurant is a little place upstairs, with may be 8-10 tables. Mostly visited by families, this place is what you call the typical outlet frequented by middle class families on the weekend.

The food is okay, nothing extraordinary, and the price too is likewise. The biriyani is good. So is the chicken tandoori. I remember ordering the kashmiri aloo dum once, and it wasn't great. But apart from that, I dont remember having a bad experience. Good place to dine if you don't have a huge budget, like us during our college days :)

Went to hazra for some work...and visited this place while returning. The ambiance and decor is decent.. nothing fancy to mention. We ordered nan,peas polao,one veg item that I recall it's name and chicken tandoori. The food was served soon. The nan and polao was good. Didn't like the veg dish though..it was too much oily and less in flavours. The chicken pieces were decent,and okayish. The real taste aroma of a chicken tandoori was missing according to me. The staffs were unprofessional...and not courteous at all. So it's good for one time visit I think...if u have no other options.

Probably one of the better options in hazra,this one. Located on the corner which connects jatin Das park n leads to alipore road.
The restaurant has decent interiors and ample seating. Had lunch here once. Ordered for the Paneer tikka for starters which was good. But they didn't serve any chutney with it.
For mains there was dum aloo and dal makhni accompanied by nan.
Food was good, not the best.
Service was surprisingly fast!
Overall, one of the better places in the vicinity.

Around 2mins walk from Hazra towards Kalighat fire station will make you reach here, a fine AC eye pleasing restaurant with stunning decor.. Dining place is mainly on the mezzanine floor with soothing ambience.
Yes, looks can be deceptive is true for this place, food and service both are bad.
We ordered fish tikka kebab : though the spices used were in right proportion but still, as some portions were spice less and chewy...it didn't score well for me.
Another dish we tried is Korean fried rice : as the Indian menu didn't impress that much we went for Chinese, but pity, it was salty and we asked the waiter to change that, he simply said sorry...and nothing else...
Although while serving, he spilled some portion here and there, which was very unusual for this type of a restro!
But one good thing was the portions... 
So, 
RATINGS : :
FOOD : 2.5/5
AMBIENCE : 4/5
SERVICE : 2/5
VFM : 3/5

If you're hungry and you're  near Hazra and u gotta eat something...well with risk you can go here! üò°

it is not just an ordinary roadside restro selling limited items. They serve some delicious chinese dishes. they prepare their chinese dishes so well that it became a rival of nearby chinise restaurants.¬†
their biryani, definitely not comparable to arsalan oudh or haji shaheb, but way better than the typical restros serving mughlai cuisine.¬†
we tried something different to examine how they work on. thought taste will be off guard. we were completely wrong realizing they prepare their avoided dishes with the same effort and care they put while preparing their famous signature dishes.

masala rice - rice with perfect blend of the spices . quantity suffices two people. ¬†comes with two pieces of chicken/ mutton. carries the scent of hydrabadi biryani.¬†

chicken tandoori butter masala - flavor of tandoori fused with aroma of butter. creamy gravy. tender pieces cooked at its best. ¬†full plate contains 8 pieces. half plate you know!

american chopseuy - great quantity. ¬† gravy was finger licking delicious .¬†

desert was complementary.¬†
verdict : those who think the restro is expensive.
ignore all the extremities of life and manage 1 hour to visit tandoori darbar. ¬†you can safely spend your pocket money without being distressed.

Although it has been there for some time, I started ordering food from here only recently. It is a crisp place. Have ordered home delivery a few times now. Crisp delivery time, service, food. The Biriyani is really good. The lachha parathas are non-oily and have thinner crusts but larger diameter. One thing about the kebab butter masala dishes here, they scrape off the charred part on kebabs, so for some that might be good and for some that might be bad, depending on your preference. The tikka butter masala did not impress me much because it was a bit on the sweeter side. ¬†The price is quite reasonable too and no inexplicable rise in end cost.

I have been ordering from " Tandoori Darbar" since before leaving for Pune, and every time I am in town, I blindly order from here.

Price per say, its a little on the high, but well, the quality compensates for it.¬†

Some dishes and my opinion on them -
1. Tandoori Chicken - Really tender, fresh chicken well tandoored.¬†
2. Chicken Bharta - Slightly greasy but none the less extremely tasty.
3. Prawn - Amazing. Maybe frozen, slightly rubbery, but the curry is brilliant.
4. Mutton - I did not really like their mutton dishes, honestly!
5. Fried rice and noodles - High in price, but really good in quality and quantity.
6. ¬†Chinese Chop suey - Not good.
7. American Chop sury - Really nice.

Overall - Need some good food? Go have a bite at Tandoori Darbar

The chicken tikka kebab, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken is great here. Plus it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket(Yay for college peeps!) Really reasonable. The staff could do a better job perhaps. Also, probably a little more attention could be paid on the hygiene factor.

The staff is friendly but service was a bit slow :(

I Went there with friends and we tried assorted dishes .¬†
1) Veg sweet corn soup - served nice and hot with enough veggies .
2) Paneer tikka - It was yummy and quantity was enough for two hungry people !
3) Schezwan fried rice - It was served piping hot , and was really spicy with lots of black pepper in it . not sure if it really was black pepper but tasted like it . Nice crunchy veggies and long grain rice tasted very nice! ¬†
4) Hot garlic paneer - It was amazing . Nice and creamy paneer with lots of garlic , yet the garlic was not overpowering . This dish is absolutely recommended for spice lovers .¬†

will surely go back to try new dishes . maybe indian dishes next time :)

Food was good but they don't serve Salad with Biryani which is little wierd... As a whole the ambience was nice. We had a friends birthday party hosted here and was quite satisfied..

I had given a treat here to my friends. A very old establishment. Service is decent.
Food quantity is a lot. The items we took were chicken clear soup which lived upto its name. The starters are decent. Crispy chicken should be tried. The rice and noodles are more than sufficient for 2 people. Manchurian chicken was yummy.

ONE OF THE BEST TANDOOR ITEMS . AMBIENCE ALSO VERY GOOD. REASONABLY PRICED. ¬†Went to celebrate birthday of my son with family and friends on 12.06.16. Really enjoyed INDAN CUISINE along with mouth watering snacks. CHICKEN RARA being unique amongst all with gravy of mutton keema.

This is situated at a prime location and almost everyone in and around bhowanipore have been to this place. It is cosy and the decor is good. The reshmi kebabs were tasty though not really the jai hind dhaba standard. Try the indian dishes here as the chinese weren't really outstanding. 
Pocket pinch is moderate to high.

It is located very near to the Jatin Das Park Metro Station. The one who sits on the bill counter is extremely rude and doesn't deserve to be in such a responsible position. The Management must take care of this. After finishing up we requested the waiter to pack the leftover food for us but he said that it's not allowed. We told them that we cannot leave food go waste like this way but they said that's their policy only if someone avail the running offers. Nowhere was this mentioned in the tent card or they informed to us beforehand. We went to the one sitting on the bill counter asking where will the left over good go? He too said that's the rule. Maybe you have a policy but please mention it to your customers beforehand and do not give lame excuses to back your lies. I simply cannot stand such disrespect for food. Decor is okay and so is the ambiance but we even sat a rat running by in the mezzanine floor of the restaurant where we took a seat initially. So they must also take care of the cleanliness as well. This much low rating is mainly because of all these behavior and cleanliness thing. Food is again of okay-type, nothing great. Chicken Manchow Soup was good and had ample chicken bit in it.

What we ordered - Fresh Lime, Chicken Clear Soup, Chicken Manchow Soup, Crispy Chicken, Pan Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Manchurian Chicken Gravy

Tandoori Darbar is situated at a rather convenient location and that is why I always prefer to go there when I am at Hazra. If you are confused about what to try out, I suggest you opt for the tandoori food, since that is what the restaurant is famous for. The Chinese food isn't bad, but it's just odd to come to a restaurant named Tandoori Darbar and opt for Chinese food. The waiters are ever sensitive to the needs of the diners and the prices are a little on the step side, yet not so much as to burn a hole through your pocket.
The picture I have attached is rather disappointing, yet it's an image of the chicken bharta and half a butter naan which I ordered. The pickle and onions dipped in vinegar. (Personal fav) is complimentary !

I frequently visit Hazra and hence I've hanged around at this restaurant quite a no of times. My earliest memory was of ordering a soup and it was delightful.
But what will really steal your heart is their north Indian. I recently had their@ Chicken Bharta and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala along with rotis and hands down, they were top notch. Especially the chicken tikka butter masala, the thick spread of butter with the right amount of spices was an absolute delight to my taste buds. I could visit this place again and again for it and I'm planning to soon.
Their Biriyani doesn't taste as great as other North Indian joints but the quantity makes up for it especially if you are hungry.
Highly recommended

In another visit we had egg curry with tandoori roti and also mixed hakka chowmin both of which were good on the palate!

We had ordered in from this place using swiggy delivery.. It came pretty quick...
The food was hot and fresh... We ordered chicken hariyali kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, masala kulcha, mutton biriyani, paneer tikka butter masala,chicken tikka butter masala, Kali dal...masala kulcha was soft and really good... The quality of the biriyani rice wasn't so great, taste too was average... I accidentally got a small chicken piece in the mutton biriyani which should not have happened... Chicken tikka butter masala was good but rich... The chicken could have been cooked longer... The vegetarian dishes or paneer and Kali dal both were really good... No complaints...
Chicken hariyali kebab was good and soft but the reshmi kebab was hard,overcooked and needed seasoning...
Overall the experience was good but not a consistently good one since some of their dishes failed to impress me...

we went there after a hectic day at our hospital clinic. to celebrate the birthday of one of our fiends. all 11 of us. so its natural when 11 people gather together to celebrate over a meal then nobody is going to silently gulp down their food and leave. we found the waiters over there very annoying as they repeatedly came and told us to stay silent. anyway the food they served was quite good and of ample quantity. this rating is entirely for the food. the ambiance and the serving is a dud. they took a lot of time just to serve the starters. won't recommend unless you're in a desperation.

We had a office party and wanted to have some mughlai food. So we opted for the easy one bowl meal. The almighty mutton Biryani . The rice was very well cooked, balanced species with wonderful aroma. The potato was also nicely boiled. And the mutton was also chunky and well cooked. Overall deserve a second chance.
The second chance came on 15th Sept. Just the day before I had Biryani from Arsalan Taratala. The mutton was pathetic, the chicken chaap had too much curd.
Tandoori darbar wins over Arsalan in case of both Biryani and Chaap.
The best place to have Biryani , if you have choose between Arsalan and this place.

Meefoon and chicken - huge quantity. Tasty.
Soup- REALLY TASTY !
ice cream - cutely decorated with chocolate sticks but a little less in quantity for ice cre lovers
Overall bill was around 750

Experience was not pleasant enough. 
We ordered Afgani Chicken and Chicken Biriyani. 
Afgani chicken was good and tasty. 
On recommendation of Waiter we ordered Biriyani (according to him it was their specialty)
It was bland. I was not at all satisfied with Biriyani.

Tried vegetarian appetizers and the staple makke-di-roti-te-sarson-da-saag and was pleasantly surprised. Just wish this place could invest more into the frills to match the high standards set by the food!

Location and accessibility wise its 4.5 out of 5. 
Surrounding wise 3.5 out of 5 .
Atmosphere was good but lack of privacy so will give it again a 3.5 out of 5 .
Cost wise , i would say it falls under the budget segment thus a rating of 4 out of 5 will be enough .
Behaviour of staffs and waiters its 3 out of 5 , I didn't like the way they treat you .
Pros:
-Quality food
-Affordable price
-Decent atmosphere 
Cons :
-lack of parking area near the restaurant 
-lack of privacy areas in the restaurant 
-Behaviour of staff is not flexible

This restaurant is near to my working place and I have often passed by it. But I avoided it for the reason that there is no parking facility near it. Situated on the main road, there is no scope of parking the car near it. Of course there is a narrow lane beside it where cars can be kept - if you are lucky to have an empty space there.
Some five or six years ago I had gone there in the company of newly acquainted friends for the first time after having parked the car in a precarious position in the lane already spoken of. We had then ordered a huge amount of food. The boisterousness of the friends, the large quantity and variety of food - all these made me dizzy and I don't really remember how was it.
Recently, I was passing by it being carless and hungry, both the qualities being suitable enough to try it out.
The decoration was nice. It seems to be a popular restaurant as the tables hardly remained empty for long. In the ground floor was the parcel corner where there is a sitting arrangement. I liked this hospitable attitude of the management. 
So I went upstairs. I was promptly served with the menu card. Just at the right time, the maitre de table came in order to take orders.
I must say that the staff is very alert and prompt, and they are ready to serve. It was  highly appreciable.
I had at first wanted to try kebabs, but seeing that they are offering seasonal makki di  roti and sarson da saag, I fell for it. I also ordered for lassi.
First lassi arrived in a tall steel glass, it is sweet and salty. Not thick enough, but quite good to taste. Then came the main food. The rotis came in a basket and cut into small pieces and steeped of ghee/oil. They may not suit a Bengali stomach. I fought on, yet had to leave two pieces behind. The mustard plant gravy was delicious. It was rich and spicy, but I loved it that way.
The price is reasonable.
I shall try going there once again and sample its other food if I again pass by it carless.

Located about 5min walkingdistance from jatin das park, this place is an excellent choice for kebabs and tandoori delicacies. I have visited quite a few times here. Good range of kebabs in affordable  prices. Paneer haryali, chicken pasinda, chicken tikka kebab and tandoor darbar special are lip smacking mouth-watering. Also the chicken tandoori is well cooked and succulent. Chinese delicacies are a strict no in this place barring a few. Noodles are totally not worth it. If you happen to visit this place opt for kebabs, tandoori chicken, chicken pasinda with combination of lancha paranthas or tandoori rotis. It would be worth it.

Had I not been hungry i would have thrown up! Was utterly disappointed!
The tandoor section is nice but the Chinese food is just horrible!
The rice was under cooked, The prawns were burnt and without any taste! The gravy too thin and too less in quantity!
Don't know if they compromised on the quality and quantity of food due to the durga puja crowd or just that....it's always that horrible.
And did i mention that we were made to wait for one hour at our tables for the food!! Overall it was a BAD experience.

Heard a lot about this place at zomato, so finally it was time to give it a try. I tried their home delivery as I didn't had enough time to visit the restaurant and give it a try. Placed the order using the zomato online order service. The restaurant called me within 5 mins to confirm the order.The best part I liked about them was they didn't took the order for food which might degrade if packed and home delivered, so I was unable to place the order for dessert. I was promised that the food will be delivered within 30 mins and they managed to nail it. Undoubtedly the food was well packed and the tandoori roti I ordered was hot. But here comes the bitterness into my experience, the moment I opened the foil I found the tandoori roti to be made of whole wheat flour(atta) which was quite shocking as I have never tried a tandoori roti like that before. There was a huge box of green salad which I ordered which was again surprising coz all I found was a lot of onion slices with a slice of lime and 2 pieces of chilly for which I paid around 45rs. I also ordered a plate of shahi paneer which no doubt I found the only thing to worth my money because of the size of paneer cubes and the quantity served by it.
To sum up and rate this place here is how I felt about it.
Taste - 2.5 off 5
Ambiance - since I got it home delivered so I would rate in on its packing so it's 4 off 5.
Value for money - 2.5 off 5 
Service - The delivery was prompt and efficient so 4.5 off 5

So to sum up it gets a 3 off 5 to my rating.

The only thing that was missing was some music.We ordered mutton biriyani, chicken pasinda, mixed friedrice and garlic chicken. Food quantity was quite good and the quality was good too. The special mention was chicken pasinda. The taste was really awesome and i truly enjoyed it. The service was prompt. They took only 15mins to serve which was commendable. Overall a good experience.

1. The place as awfully, horribly dirty.people were eating and the place was like a garbage.I'll upload a pic to show you all. 
2. We ordered food like noodles,schewzwan chicken, garlic chicken and reshmi kebab.
Noodles were dry. Period. *"Uneatable"*
Chickens - *Facepalm
That was like chickens mixed with Knorr soups.

Found this place on zomato. Very easy to locate,  jst a few steps away from Jatin Das Park, on Hazra road. It is a small, cosy restaurant serving both North Indian and Chinese dishes. Chicken Pasinda tasted great along with hotbutter tandoori rotis. The Paneer Chatpata masala was okayish with six huge pieces of paneer. Amongst the mocktails, Virgin Pinacolada tasted like cough syrup. The rest were fine...rose shake (as sweet as it needs to be) , virgin mojito and cold coffee. A bright but soothing ambience adds to the warmth of the place. However, service wasn't as slow as mentioned in the other reviews. Would like to go for their kebabs, the next time I visit.

It is a very good restaurant with delicious dishes and with good quality & quantity. ...
Situated in a very popular location with many customers ordering various dishes.... 
Coming to the dishes, every dishes according to our choice (from Groupon menue) were very good.... It was Chinese meal and we loved it....

Location: Easy to locate the place if you follow the Zomato directions properly. 

Ambiance: Nice. Nothing to go gaga over, still they've managed to keep it simple and cozy. I personally quite liked the character.

Service: Exceptionally slow, in spite of having a good number of service persons waiting. I guess the preparation time and strategies need some serious thought.

Food: This is the only reason I've given a 4-star rating. Really liked the taste of what they served after those long waiting periods. We ordered the following:

1. Tandoori Chicken: Served with green chutney and pickled salad, soft and juicy just how it should be.

(We went with a Groupon coupon, so the next items are from that menu)

2. Chicken Manchow Soup, 3. Chicken Hot & Sour Soup: I generally avoid ordering soup at a restaurant, but my experience here was very different. Liked both the items, specially the hot and sour one.

4. Socket Chicken in red wine sauce: This one was an absolute delight. Taste was different than any Chinese starter I've tried. Came with saut√©ed vegetables.5. Fried Rice and Noodles: Just decent, nothing extraordinary.¬†

6. Chicken in 8-and-8 sauce: Tasty, one of my friends liked this the best.¬†

7. Fresh Lime Soda: A bit too sweet according to my friends, no complains from my side as that's exactly how I prefer my lime soda.

Their food in just one word is AWESOME!! The Chinese as well as the Mughlai food tastes delicious. I had been here with my friend and we ordered chicken fried rice, schezwan chicken and chilli chicken. Every dish tasted delicious. The other day we went, we had the mutton special biriyani in which they give 4pcs of mutton, a potato, an egg and rice, along with that we ordered a chicken biriyani and chicken reshmi butter masala all of which tasted like heaven, specially the chicken reshmi butter masala. The food here is done to perfection. :)

The food is moderate with one or two¬†items that stand out.
Like the biriyani which is light and the taste is good too.¬†
Chinese is nothing worth mentioning but again it's not bad,do-able.The hot garlic chicken went well with the mixed fried rice : a combination very common but tasted nice since I had chinese after quite some time.
Kebabs are not recommended,kebabs aren't soft as they should be.We had the reshmi kebab which was okay. The chicken hariyali kebab didnt live up to our expectations.¬†
Quantity is very good and the price very reasonable. The decor is nice,so is the ambience.Service is warm. :)

It's a good restaurant known for its tandoori dishes. I had tried Chicken reshmi Kabab and Paneer hariyali Kabab both are delicious. Pan fried momos is also very good. Ambiance is good. There is a need to upgrade to comfortable seating arrangements. Fast service is required too.

Located near Hazra crossing,this outlet is mainly famous for the tandoori cuisine as the name suggests.¬†

However,they also serve Chinese and Indian. It is a restaurant,but there are take-away and online ordering options.
I went for the take away option with Indian cuisine and it seemed fair enough quality wise.

Located in Hazra Road, Tandoori Darbar serves an array of Indian and Chinese cuisines. This little restaurant is popular for inexpensive food.

It was again a rainy afternoon when five of us meet at Tandoori Darbar for lunch. We love to spend time with each others discussing about food, and food only. I even wondered sometime how five different people from different background mix up so well for their common obsession ‚ÄòFOOD‚Äô.

Upon entering we were greeted properly and we took a narrow stair to reach first floor. This restaurant have serious space management issue, I think they should reduce one or two table and create some space between two tables. Please don‚Äôt expect any privacy here; everyone can listen to what others were discussing in different tables as they were very close to each other.

After lots of yes and no, we finally agreed on what to order. For appetizers we picked ‚ÄòSweet Corn Soup‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Manchow Soup‚Äô and ‚ÄòChicken Hot & Sour Soup‚Äô soups, in starters ‚ÄòChicken with Capsicum & Red Chilli‚Äô, ‚ÄòPan Fried Chilli Fish‚Äô and ‚ÄòPaneer Hariyali Kebab‚Äô accompanied with ‚ÄòFresh Lime Soda‚Äô, sweeten or salted as per our choice.

In main course we love to have ‚ÄòMix Veg in Hot Garlic Sauce‚Äô, ‚ÄòVeg Pan Fried Noodles‚Äô, ‚ÄòHot Garlic Chicken‚Äô, ‚ÄòHunan Fish‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Chowmein‚Äô, ‚ÄòEgg Chicken Chowmein‚Äô, ‚ÄòSzechun Chicken Fried Rice‚Äô, and ‚ÄòSpl. Chicken Fried Rice‚Äô.

To start with Chicken Hot & Sour Soup was nice, appetizing and had good fillings. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup also had nice fillings but taste very average. Back to back they serve Paneer Hariyali Kebab, Chicken with Capsicum & Red Chilli, Pan Fried Chilli Fish and Fresh Lime Soda.

One sip in Fresh Lime soda and I found it was simply horrible, as I asked for a sweeter one they made it too sweet and it‚Äôs lost the punch and basic reason for ordering a fresh lime soda.

Paneer Hariyali Kebab looks great and smells nice but it was not as tasty as it looks. Chicken with Capsicum & Red Chilli again looks good but tastes average. Pan Fried Chilli Fish was mixed with hot and sweet sauce; I loved the taste and spiciness, really enjoyable. Do not miss their Pan Fried Chilli Fish, a dish of fork-tender fish pieces doused in red curry sauce, was one of their best starters. Succulent stir-fried vetki pieces in flavourful sauce with hints of sweet and chilly, too good to resists.

While eating we also discuss and write down many things; i.e. new restaurants coming up in the city, picking out best dishes what we had tried in last few weeks, individual preference of food, latest food trends, chefs, service and ambiance, our future meet up plans and many more.

In main course Mix Veg in Hot Garlic Sauce was aromatic and pleasantly lighter, so you can easily pair it with Pan Fried Veg Noodles without disturbing the steadiness of flavour. Sliced Fish in Hunan Sauce was very pleasing to the palate ‚Äìextremely flavourful, juicy, tender and beautifully cooked, this one's recommended for fish lovers. But it did not fit well with Chicken Chowmein or Egg Chicken Chowmein. May be next time we should try it with fired rice.

Do not miss the Hot Garlic Chicken, a dish of fork-tender chicken pieces mixed in hot garlic sauce. The Hot Garlic Chicken was a crowd pleaser as well- spicy and packed with boneless chicken pieces. Chicken in hot garlic sauce and Szechun Chicken Fried Rice; the combination went surprisingly well. Spl. Chicken Fried Rice tastes just above average.

When all's said and done, it‚Äôs a mixed experience for me and food here needs lots of improvement. This restaurant is pocket friendly, which is great for students and the working crowd also their location is very convenient.

It was a good place, owned by a sardar. Food was very delicious. I had dal punjabi tadka, mix veg, fish tikka kebab and fish platter. Everything was very fresh and yumm but they took almost half an hour to serve :( 
Dal was too oily for me, even though the taste was good. I would recommend to visit once a while when u r looking for true punjabi taste.

Usually I prefer having the particular cuisine from a restaurant in which it is specialized.... As in I have Chinese from a Chinese restaurant nd never try out their biriyani nd vice versa bcoz of having few bad experiences for such exploration. 

So as the name suggests TANDOOR DARBAR I wld save this one is on the safer side bcoz u can actually have nd go fr the Chinese dishes if u want bt the tandoor nd mughlai dishes r really good. 
We ordered pan fried chilli chicken fr starters nd truly it was lip smacking. 
For the main course it was chicken tandoor butter masala nd roti .... I must say this dish was rich nd tasty üòã.....  It is highly recommended. 
We also ordered biriyani, it was ok nothing special about it. 
The service is little slow during lunch hours.

This restaurant very near from hazra 2-3 min walking distance.they serve both Chinese n North Indian dishes.dine-in section enough space for 40-45 at a time.
========================================
We started our eating session with fresh lime sodas.which was quite normal in taste.

Started with veg n non-veg soups I had non-veg soup it's chicken hot n sour soup taste a bit different but good small amount of veg n chicken there.but I lyked it.

Starters ->>>>>>>>
1. Chicken malai kabab - I just love it enough amount of spices n comes with good quantity.little bit spicy but good.

2.Paneer hariyali kabab - this is another dish which I had enjoyed in don't lyk paneer too much but the crunchiness coating over it n the pouring green thik gravy taste very good.

Main Course ->>>>>>>>

1. Veg fried rice-again the quantity it's good enough for 2 person.taste good the herbs n vegetables mixed with spices flavour popping up from the bowl...

2. Mixed chowmin - this is good to have mixed dishes well cooked flavoured.

3. Achari mix veg - typical dish yet good taste I don't lyk veg too much sometimes ok but this is one of the good one I had.capsicum tomato n other vegetables too well as a veg dish I think it's ok

4.fish tikka butter masala - excellent just this word goes for it.superb taste fishes soft n the masala totally Inside of it n gravy mixed with some good masala tasty enough n quantity good.thumps up for dish dish.

5. Shanghai chicken - well this is one of the different dish which I tris first time good in taste a very good flavour coming out from it but the main thing is cooked well everything you want in a good dish it's there...another good dish from my side.

Foods - 4/5
Service-3.5/5
Ambience-3.5/5

The best thing is in the cash section the man was sitting there wet polite and asked everyone how was the foods you enjoyed or not visit again...that's a good thing.will visit again for there biriyani n for the dishes.

I discovered Tandoori Darbar while we we're in Hazra and going through Zomato. The first thing i saw the  hoarding fallen upside down, I decided the ambience inside but thank s to our hunger,  as we know first impression is the last impression but our stomach didn't give a damn to it nevertheless ‚ò∫
We wanted to have something Indian so we ordered for Biryani but the staff said twas over ( think Biryani is awesome over here eh ) now we we're in what-to-order moment.  but thanks to the staff for he gave us another substitute option,  it's calked Masala Chicken Rice... Trust me the moment I took the first mouth, I felt like omnomnonom... Twas fabulous, ii wnt feel bad if I have to say it's better than Biryani, it was as tasty as it was looking... Was so full as well. And den we we're happy and our dinner followed by some more dishes and we were very smart not to go with the look... Our appetite got the best of us and we experienced the saying "do not judge a book by it's cover "üòâ

A home away home. Probably one of the best places I have been to in recent times. And I am a regular here. Its near my residence and its one heck if an awesome place to dine. The Chicken Sweet Corn soup or the Chicken Manchow soup is a delight. The kebabs, all of them, on the menu are extraordinary. The Biriyani is sumptuous and don't forget their pineapple raita. It is one combination you will remember for the rest of your life. And for good reason. Tandoori Darbar is tucked away within  Khirode Ghosh Market, facing Hazra Road. But its not hard to find. 
A word for the service. Its at par with the best in the business. 
Highly recommended. Very highly.

To begin with no ambience its looks perhaps very old types and certainly needs a make up.
Attendants didnt impress me much either they have learn plenty more things about serving dishes and looking after customers.
Located in a ok location, easy parking.
Sitting arrangements are less and not good i found it clumsy the tables and chairs were not located properly waiters passing by chairs not a good experience to be honest.
Well anyways that is not the reason for giving it a 2.5 star, the main thing is i didnt find food that much interesting and mouth watering. It was simple and basic in a city like kolkata where basic we even get on roadsides.
Improvements are must .
I would not recommend this with family and not with girlfriend obviously.
Prices are ok of dishes its not much expensive but the quantity of food is little to so it goes with this.
It offers indian and chinese.
Food is just ok nothing so great about it.

Second experience -
Had Egg biryani, Mutton Tikka Butter Masala and Chicken Cheese Kabab, The biryani was nothing extraordinary. The quantity was pretty good with 2 eggs and one piece of potato in it. The Chicken Cheese Kabab was excellent. Mutton tikka butter masala is not worth a mention.

Customer service and staff behaviour is excellent.

This was a home delivery from Tandoori Darbar via a popular online food ordering application. So I can't tell you about the interiors ambience decoration of the place. I ordered a plate of special mutton biryani and chicken bharta shredded. But they called me up after placing the order and humbly replied for a substitute of special mutton biryani and replaced me with mutton masala fried rice (hearing for the 1st time) and salad. The parcel arrieved in time. Food was served hot. Trying this mutton masala fried rice for the 1st time didn't give any surprises. Making mutton fried rice a little spicier is just what is this mutton masala fried rice. Chicken bharta tasted better...had a good dinner at home aftera long tiring day's work.

Tandoori darbar is located at the Hazra crossing near the Jatin Das park metro station. This restaurant is easy to find thanks to the wonderful location. This is a restaurant people should go for if they are incidently anywhere near the Hazra more or Rashbehari avenue or else this is not a restaurant people should preplan of. The restaurant has polite staff. The ambience won't make you go ga ga. It is a very simple restaurant with minimal accessories & simple decor . For the food part, one should go for chicken tandoori which is beautiful. Chicken malai kebab, tikka kebabs & chicken bhartha taste moderate. The soups are not bad either. Chicken manchow soup is the soup i love at this place. I did not try Chinese main course here so I am not really aware of the quality of chinese items. Service is prompt & they serve decent proportions but the price is definitely overrated. Go for this place only if you are near Hazra & hungry, else search for some other eatery. :)

Visited this place for the first time today. I've been to a lot of different restaurants like this which serve Chinese and North Indian, and compared to all those, this is pretty average. But the quantity is good. Quality could be better. But the service is slow even though the place isn't very big. The staff is below average.

We ordered Chicken reshmi butter masala (my all time favorite), i've had better than their preparation here. Chicken chowmeen's quantity was satisfactory i would say. And we had a Chicken tandoori butter masala for take away, and it was good too.

But the ambiance is admirable.

It is a surprise but Hazra junction doesn't offer too many good places to eat from. yea, you may go left and right to rashbehari or elgin and you will find then. So, for a particular number of times, I have visited Tandoori Darbar, running short of sit and eat options in Hazra. This place is a stone's throw away from hazra more towards the alipore way. The seating arrangement is upstairs and it has a decent ambiance only. The food is tasty, and mostly we have tried Biriyani, Tandoor roti, Nan and Chicken Side dishes like Chicken Amritsari and Patiala. Food is quite good. Tried their chinese also, but the Indian/Mughlai seems far better. Prices are unreasonably high, and a simple fried rice with a chilly chicken (the bhat-daal of chinese :P) will cost you a whooping 475 bucks. Quantity is okay. ¬†The waiters are not so well behaved, giving you strange looks if you do not give Tips! And I am cutting some marks for that.

been here this moha sosthi. 
food: food was ok. we ordered biriyani chilen tandoori and chiken bharta. biriyani was below average as the mutton was neither tender nor well cooked. same goes for the poatato. though my froend told me generally they serves decent biriyani, and i admitt puja is not a good time to rate food. however the tandoori and bharta was satisfactory for the price we pay for them.
ambience and service: ambience and service was quite good.
price: price is very cheap. so its very pocket friendly.
so overall this is a good place to visit if you want to test decent kebab and tandoor without burning a hole in your pocket.

Heard about this restaurant from my friends and decided to hit this place on Dashami Afternoon! !

FOOD(4/5)-„Äãbefore getting into the restaurant we have to wait for 10 minute which was expected for puja time and we have to share our table.. cool!!
We ordered MASALA KULCHA, TANDOORI CHICKEN, MIXED FRIED RICE, CHICKEN TIKKA BUTTER MASALA. We thought mughlai dishes would be better than Chinese but we were surprised to have the rice quite good. Tandoori Chicken was perfect served with pudina chatni. Masala kulcha was Okay, amount of masalas were little. BUT Tikka Butter Masala was a great disappointment! ! Only small 4 chicken pieces priced 200 and the gravy was total sour.. like the dish was not fresh. We had to leave the chicken gravy.

LOCATION AND HOSPITALITY-„Äã Location is quite prompt; close to JATIN DAS PARK Metro Station or HAZRA MORE. Delivery of the food was not that slow. But the place was a bit clumsy! Fans were not working. Our bill was 717 including tax.

According to me this place is OKAY type; not that much special that I will go again..

An excellent place to dine if you have time to spare. Don't go there in an empty stomach as the service is not that quick. But once you get the food, it is worth waiting .
The kabab platter is a must have. The quantity and quality of food is appreciable.¬†
Nice decor. Soothing ambiance. Delicious food. Affordable price ...Need i say more???? :-)
Food : 5/5
Ambiance :4.5/5

just had a take away from this eatery.while my bro munched on most of it,i did partake of the chicken reshmi kebab and mixed noodles.the kebab was quite fulfilling.nicely minced pieces of chicken,and good proportions.the mixed noodles ,although had plenty of shrimps,chicken and egg,was a tad too oily and orotund for my taste.maybe the festive season caught up with them.

Visited the place with friends back in June for dinner. Had planned the course from home in consultation with Zomato and ordered The Special Non-Veg Kebab Platter as the starters followed by the Special Biriyanis, Butter Naan and Chicken Kadhai. It took about 75 minutes after placing the orders for the starters to arrive. However, the kebab platter was really exceptional and something one would die for. The Biriyani was also very good and served in huge quantities the only minus point being thatwe came across some undercooked rice fragments while munching which disappointed me a bit. The naans and the chicken dishes were also well up to the mark. Keeping aside the delay in service, it was a fulfilling gastronomic affair ..... :-)

I make it a point to visit this awesome place during durga puja as they serve some specials at that time.I guess I have been there for 20 times but still they have always something new to offer.
Starting off with virgin pinacolada and chocolate shake,for starters I prefer trying tardoor darbar fish special and TD SPL seafood soup as it is the best soup I have ever tried anywhere else.For main course I stick to mughlai dishes like chicken biriyani,chicken afghan kebab,prawn hariyali kebab,chicken tandooori butter masala and mutton pasinda/bharta.Chinese dishes like manchurian,mixed chowmein,sweet and sour chicken are worth trying.
For deserts I stick to tooty fruity and chocolate sunday.
If you are visiting Hazra during the pujas then do visit this place for lip-smacking dishes!!!!

My menu was
1) Mutton Biriyani
2) Chicken Tikka kabab
3) Chicken Reshmi Kabab

Service as well as behavior was good. I will recommend this restaurant if you are in these area and want to have a good food.

Unusual but true, this place offers damn good momos. Large sized, full of moist meaty stuffing and very thin coat. Even the crispy chicken tastes decent. They serve on these large triangular steel trays which I happen to like a lot, reasons- undefined! 

Coming to the actual tandoor-mughlai fare, their Mutton Biryani, I like. Very soft pieces of meat, well cooked potatoes and lightly prepared rice but you get the aromas right, well more or less! Murgh Tikka Kebab, Fish Achari tikka, Chicken Cheese Kebab are worth trying. I would request you not to go for the Red Hot Pepper Chicken though it belongs to a different section. Weird oil they use that stinks. It lacks proper marinade therefore not really flavorsome and a plate full of screaming hot chicken pieces that attack your taste-buds quite blatantly.

Over all a fair enough experience and doesn't upset you much over the price. Cool place for an occasional hang out with friends. And of course, t look at the location- just spot on.

I've been a regular customer here for 3 years. Last year, they've renovated the interior, and they've done a pretty well job doing it. The food quality is surprisingly good and the amount of food served is more than adequate. For starters, my regular is the Red Hot Pepper Chicken and the Prafulla Crispy Chicken. I've tried a few of the other starters, but these two are the best. For kebabs, the Chicken cheese kebab and achari kebab is amazing. For main course, their chinese dishes are splendid. The Chowmein and Fried Rice are mouth watering, even the plain chicken ones. A word of advice: their schezwan dishes are quite hot and spicy. I've usually stuck with the Manchurian chicken fried rice/chowmein and chilli chicken for side dish. Their Tandoori Roti are a bit more crispy for my taste. The Chicken Bharta is quite smooth and tasty. The butter masalas are also quite good, but I prefer the Chicken Tikka Chatpata Masala. The Chicken Punjabi is also good, and goes quite well with the  butter nun. The chicken pieces are succulent in all these dishes and I believe you'll be quite satisfied with them. Their specialty is the Tandoori Chicken, which has a unique taste of its own, thanks to the spices they use. It has a distinct biting taste of the Pudina. Their one plate biriyani is ample to serve two, and the cucumber raita goes quite well with the biriyani. One word of advice: please stay away from the mutton dishes, as they have a strange "goat"-ish odour. Their mocktails are nothing out of the ordinary and isn't worth writing home about.

Really good food,no doubt  the Indian food is good ...
But the Chinese food is also mouth-watering  ... .:-)
Speaking about the INDIAN FOOD, chicken kadai with lachha paratha with kashmiri nan is really a good combo,
I wont say the Biriyani is fabulous, it pretty similar to other restaurants  .Coming back to Chinese ,they provide a lot of variations here,among the side dishes prawn & fish is really good.
One of the speciality  here is the  "fushion kabab". The variations is good in this dish,
If you want to try different places this can be a good place to visit.

ONE OF THE WORST PLACES TO HAVE TANDOORI MUGHLAI FOOD.
this february i went there with some of my friends..during saraswati puja. ... we ordered biryani and chaap and it took 15mins for the waiters to confirm the orders and a great 40mins extra we waited for the food to come.. and to make things worse...the biryani tasted burnt... it was awful.
 plz dont go for this restaurant if u wanna have good food.

On a late afternoon, my friend, a coy photographer, and I located Tandoori Darbar. Primarily for their kebab platter, this place was on our minds. We were completely exhausted after a long day entailing an examination and were simply looking for good biryani.

The place scores favourably on ambience. However, getting the waiters to attend to us was quite an ordeal. It took them thirty minutes to 'confirm' our order and over an hour to serve. There is a range of options between Chinese and Tandoor but the place being called what it is, we stuck to good old biryani and the kebab platter (Fusion Kebab consisting of 12 pieces of chicken kebab in four variations). The biryani was not the 'good old one' we expected. It was quite ordinary. The quantity per plate was sufficient for one person. The platter comprised three pieces each of Chicken Hariyali Kebab, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tikka Kebab and Chicken Lasuni Kebab. Much to our dismay, most of the kebabs were unevenly cooked. A green concoction poured in bits on what seemed to be Chicken Reshmi Kebab was presented to us as Chicken Hariyali Kebab. A few lucky ones including the Chicken Tikka Kebab managed to be palatable. Poor service on a particularly slow business day did not help our frustration. The food was neither worth the wait nor the money.

Well, Tandoori Darbar is a good place for having tandoori and mughlai dishes...chinese dishese are average. 
Prices are not that pricy,,they are reasonable.
Ambience is okay.
Chicken Tandoori is tasty and also the kababs.. The chicken cheese kabab was something new I had for the first time here.
Among the chinese dishes, manchurian chicken and mixed fried rice was nice.
Overall an 'okay' restaurant.
3.5 from me.

A small but nice restaurant, Tandoori Darbar is worth a visit. Located conveniently at Hazra Crossing, this place serves pretty good mughlai food. The place is cosy, nicely lit. The mutton biryani is delicious. Though the potato tasted dull, the mutton was super soft and juicy. A must try here is the Chicken Hyderabadi. Spicy n yum! Overall, a nice place to get yourself full, coz it wont burn a hole in your pocket either!

Being an almost regular customer of this restaurant, I would suggest this place to be a "must try" for all the foodies out there. Impeccable services combined with the richest varieties of various cuisines, this place reaches out to your heart through their warm and cosy ambience. Whenever I have been here with my loved ones I have been guaranteed a worth of a time. The most heartwarming fact about this place is their quality and quantity of food at comparatively lower prices. The amount of rice they serve each time is just more than enough for us. And their chinese and tandoor delicacies are worth a try. I would love to visit this place once a month as it has become more of a home to me.
