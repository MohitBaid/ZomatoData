Definitely not a place for 'fine dining' . I guess over time the sanitation and hygiene of the food has taken a detour. I only buy rotis in case of emergencies from this place. I am giving 3 stars because this place has saved me a lot of times from hunger in the penniless days .

No recommendation at all. Food is not at all good and so is the ambiance. Restro staffs are not even good and service quality is extremely poor.

Really bad Food Taste, ordered chicken curry and it tastes horribly bad. Even the Tawa Roti is too hard to eat and the owner treats you like nothing !!

Not Recommended at all !!

A very simplistic bengali food joint..can also be said as pice hotel in some way.
Umm i have very serious doubts about the quality and quantity of their foods.
From 1st hand experience the doubt arose is now more sanguine .

Aahar is a very small restaurant located at the kestopur more prafulla kanan side just beside the HDFC bank ATM. 

A small joint with multi cuisine option for you with very bengali touch. Even if all the cuisine has a significantly different touch the food tastes good. Yes the quality and taste differs at times but it's there to help you in emergency days specially end of theonth as it's quite cheap. Thanks :)

Been there in this puja at late night, we ordered Biryani (Mutton n chicken), Mutton Kasha, Kebab which are good. But considering their pricing, food wasn't tgat good. But their roll is simply awesome.

Place ain't that good. Food quality is quite mediocre. Preparation time is less. But who knows there might be some bad reasons for it. Dining space is adequate. That's it.

The thing which I like about them is their chicken roll.It can compete with any eatery with their chicken roll on any given day.But I have to say their hygiene requires serious consideration!

Wat the hell. If you wish to save your stomach dont even go near this place. However, if you want to see how a mouse behaves in a food joint this place is a must. I am surprised and sad as to how this place even appears on Zomato.
