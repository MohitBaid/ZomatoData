Located opposite to Great Eastern near sinthi more. This kiosk serves you with variety of chinese foods, pizzas, burgers, momos and chicken wings. Ordered chicken pizza, chicken burger with extra cheese and egg chowmein. The pizza and the burgers filled with mayonaise melts in your mouth and the chowmein was also good. They dont provide seating arrangements. Would like to visit here again.

Best in sinthi.. everyone should try! Each and every item is superb. Forget about so called kfc.Food is a huge passion of mine, and because I want to eat whatever I want, I run every morning, and then I do weights a few times a week. It's just how I can balance eating pancakes in the morning, a big burger for lunch, and then a fat steak and cheesecake at night.

Fantastic place for quick bites. Quite affordable and very tasty foods. Only drawback is not having seating arrangements. 
A must try for everyone and anyone having a snack craving. Go and grab it.

Their burger is delicious. Pocket friendly joint. The only problem is that they run out of items too fast so you may not get what you hoped for every time.
