Ordered Aloo Samosa and Dhokla via Swiggy. The packaging of the food items was good. Loved the Dhoklas, but the samosas were bit spicy. 
Overall, satisfied.

Not that good place to have food. It was mainly famous for its KACHURIs but recently that kachuri has lost that special taste in it. The main problem with this place is that it is very very unhygienic. Again some foods are overrated . So I have some mixed experience regarding this place.

Fulfilling my 7AM Kochuri needs. For over a decade. For anything else, this may not be the perfect place. But for that one out of ten foodies, who needs her/his weekly early morning Kochuri with chaa, this is the begin all/end all of places in this area. Period.

Picked up kachori sabji and gulab jamuns today morning. Had to have lassi as well as perfect accompaniment with kachori ðŸ˜‰  

Gulab jamuns were simply a melt-in-mouth proposition. Also, lassi was perfect. However, the kachori was not as per expectation. It was hard in texture and not the typical mind blowing stuff that you associate with Sharma Sweet.

This is my everyday haunt while returning from my morning or evening walks. You just cannot resist the inviting smell of the kochuri and the amriti. The shop is easy to loate, the service is very prompt and the food is amazing! The kochuri and aloo sabzi along with the chutney, is soul food. They also serve very good lassi and samosas.Â It is THE place top grab vegetarian snacks.

A good place for veg snacks. Tried the dahi vada and veg chop with lassi. 

The lassi was sexy and thick. The dahi vada was good in quantity. Saturday being veg was a good day for eating here. Liked the food.

Nothing to mention about ambience and decor. 

Easy on the pocket and hygienic are two plus points of this eatery.

Sharma Sweets is one of the popular eateries, which I used to visit 3 years back, just because it is located on the way to my college. From the year 2010 to 2013, I have done and tried out many of their delicacies which includes Samosa, Kachori, Khasta Kachori, Gulab Jamun, Jalebi and lassi. The price of these are very reasonable and the food quality is surely top class. Perhaps, this is one of the best road side eateries in Netaji Nagar.

They have like the best sweets and milk products. Their lassi, dahi vada, jalebi, chai, gyulab jamun are just wonderful. Best time to visit is any day, anytime preferably early like 7-9a.m. Or in the evening, like 3-8p.m.you can go before or after too, not a problem. My favorite is their jalebi and lassi. Recommended, try it sometime.

hot kachuri jalebi and kaju katli my forever menu from Sharma Sweets. recently they have renovated the shop but sadly the hing kachuri i die for is loosing the taste gradually also last tym the jalebi tasted sour.......a tip for roadside foodies complete your kachuri jalebi venture with a vand of tea i always go for...go straight towards the statue->take a left from there->after 4/5 mins of walking you will find a lil tea stall right side of the foot.always crowded. have a tea there.....mmmm perfct

This place is an absolute favourite. Just love their jalebis and kachoris. It's a mood lifter if you have these for breakfast. They are a must have and it's a very good sweet shop for the Non-Bengali community in the area. You should visit this place anytime at least once or maybe more. Happy Dining! :)

Waking up in the morning and getting to have gorom kochori and sabji along with chatni and mirchi and that also of sharma is like heaven. And then lassi. Along with hot gulab jamun and jalebi. Foodie like me likes it this way i bet. I have been almost a regular customer during my school days and have never been disappointed by them.
