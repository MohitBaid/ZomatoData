A few days ago I would have had good things to say about this place but I guess good momos are not the only thing that makes an eatery worth visting more than once. We are used to ordering momos from this place since the price is reasonable and the food is not altogether inedible. We ordered 3 plates of steam momo and waited for one and half hours for the delivery to arrive. After a long wait we decided to call them up and all we get is " we forgot to process the order". 
I guess the staff could not care less about the regular customers. There was no hint of regret  in the staff member's voice and no urgency to undo the mistake. 
Service and quality of food speaks on behalf of the eatery. I hope they will remember to provide the food and the services to the next customer :)

First of all, there is no proper sitting area. There are 2-3 tools which are very dirty, so you have to stand and eat or take it up. Only starters are good here. Noodles are so thick n dry, you can't eat without gravy. They take a lot of time to make. 
They take a minimum order of ₹60 for home delivery.
The name "Friends and Fries" do not match at all with their behaviour.

This is just 5minutes walk from baishakhi island. It's a small roadside stall with yummy food. Though you can't really sit and have the food still with small amount of money it can fill your tummy. I have tried their momo,noodles and choupsey and i must say the food is awesome here. No doubt in that.

Just 5 mins away from Baisakkhi island,  it is a roadside stall.  I tried gravy chicken chowmein which was OK  in taste but the quantity was too less . I've tried quite a few restaurants  nearby Baisakkhi, they charge you almost the same but the quantity is much more than Friends and Fries. So, I would suggest if you are passing by you can give it a try but the food is not that yummy that you will come back again and again !!

This place is definitely not for someone who's super concerned about hygiene. Have only tried their momos & chicken lollypop. The momos weren't that good but the lollypop wasn't bad, specially considering the price. A small roadside stall which won't burn a hole in your pocket and will fill your tummy.

Freinds an Fries, a small food joint in Saltlake, serving restaurant quality food at street joint prices, is a must try for all foodies. I being a die hard momo lover, am a big fan of this place. Their chicken steamed momo and pan fried momos are simply mouth watering. What's amazing is the momo sauce they serve. It is the authentic red spicy momo sauce which they make in Sikkim. And the momos are hot, juicy and yum! I'm actually feeling hungry while typing this... and I just picked up my phone and ordered for some crispy fried basa, chicken cheese momo (new inclusion in the menu) and pan fried momos, right now! While I'm waiting to try their new delicacies let me breif you guys about what else you must try out here. Chilly garlic noodles, manchow soup, chicken drums of heaven and fish finger are my favorite too. The food is hygienic, tasty, pocket friendly and they have fast delivery system within saltlake area. I keep calling them up for snacks and dinner at my house parties and gatherings. My friends and family enjoy their food a lot. Glad a food joint like this is in the vicinity. do try it today!
Great going Team Friends&Fries! Happy eating all!

It's a small shabby road side joint with temporary structure... totally unhygenic... but when it comes to food it was very good... And the price was justified too... 
Tried their chicken momo, chicken chilli garlic noodles, schezwan chicken and chicken pakoras all were very tasty... 
Staffs are very well behaved and the service was fast too...

I guess I'm the most regular customer of Friends and Fries and I have to say that not once has it happened that this place disappointed me. This is a small kiosk located close to swimming pool area. The prices are unexpectedly low and it serves great food. 
P.S.- Please increase the size and quantity of the momos. They are too small

We have had momos here quite often! Never having tried anything more than starters!
Some friends came over and we decided to order food from here!
Believe it or not..the delivery took 2 hours!!!! Our guests were unfed till 10 where we had placed the order at 8!!
After much ado the food arrived with one parcel missing whereas they collected the full payment!
We had to call them up again n they said momos were over..such lame excuses!
We asked them to replace the momo with another dish..they did not bother making that effort cited various excuses n said "We will send something tomorrow"...such unprofessional behaviour is uncalled for!
If you are running a joint ..be responsible enough..do not just do it for fun!
On top of that they said " It would be complimentary" where as they had already collected the money!!! Friends..be careful!!

This is a wow place for people living in Saltlake area. It offers best quality street food at unimaginably low prices. Chicken momos come for 35 bucks which just as good as the ones you get in Sikkim. And the sauce they give with it is perfect. Rarely momo joints in Kolkata make the real spicy tibetian momo sauce. But these guys got it right. I keep ordering from this place when I visit my friends in Saltlake. Thumbs up F&F! keep it up!

My experience has been great. I have tried almost everything (veg) that is available here. The chow is really tasty and the spring roll is just out this world. They serve the dishes in a good quality plastic-fibre plate. Its really great for commuters and rates are also not high. A must visit street food stall in Salt Lake area.

Along with my parents, I visited their stall today in the BJ block Puja pandal. 
We ordered a plate of fish fingers, which came at a price of 100 bucks for 6 pieces.
The fish fingers were really good, and were made of very good quality fish, which, according to them, was Bekti. Either way, it was of a good quality.
The fingers were soft and juicy, and very filling. They exceeded our expectations and I look forward to visiting their kiosk at Sector 2.

Friends and Fries is the newest addition in Sector 2 Salt Lake offering brilliant food and ultra low rates. The place is doing a good job since opening in January 2015 and would do great in future if they keep up their standards.

I'm not a fancy décor fan rather a good food one and FnF does exactly the same thing with food. Loved their preparations and the service. Wish you guys a good luck for times to come.

If you love good  quality hygienic foods without burning a hole in your pocket, then look no further...quality service, a diverse menu, and reasonable pricing makes it a great place to order from...
They all come from good families and good education background.
Wish them success.
Just reach out to this excellent kiosk near Swimmer Pool.
I will definitely encourage them regularly.
