This place is just beside the Kavi Nazrul Metro station. The foods are good. I have been here many times. Also I order food for home delivery. But the place used to be better before. These days, they have the tendency to make the food more spicy. Still, this place offer good food with relatively less bucks.

A clean and good place to try some good north indian food .
I wasnt sure about this place so the safest bet would be north indian they prepare that pretty well .
Rest of the items I would say pretty average nothing lip smacking .
So walk out and try to visit this place .

This place gets you quality food at good prices. We ordered lamb initially but for some reason it wasn't available. But this disappointment was soon washed away by their tasty food. Good ambience. One complaint: they can increase the quantity per plate.

Visited this place for the first time today evening, the food quality was good but one worst thing was we found a dead fly in the mixed chicken rice what we had ordered.. The last worst thing you want in any type of dish is a dead fly.. Yes we can understand that  it might hv been done by mistake, but still you can't except these things in a reputed restaurant.. Worst experience for a first time!! Such a shame!!

Tried out home delivery a couple of times from here. It is located really close to the Kavi Nazrul metro station, I have tried out both Chinese as well as North Indian from here and my experience has been pretty decent.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We tried out Chilli Chicken Dry, Chicken Hakka Chowmein, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Biryani and Mutton Kasha. Food was pretty good and quantity was also satisfactory. The chowmein had lots of chicken pieces in it and the North Indian dishes were quite delectable.

FINAL VERDICT- A good place for casually dining one in a while.

Another good cuisine restaurant situated near kavi subhash metro.
Starting from continental, Chinese, Indian and delicious starter course, you can almost find every new and authentic menu here and most importantly, the price is also reasonable and the foods are tasty.
Dont compare it with other restaurants, bcoz different restaurants have different menu taste,and price set up.
Simply you can visit here and spending money on this place will be worthyüòäüòä

Packed chicken roll from this place on a hungry evening. Never had much expectations from this place. But quite surprisingly the roll tasted really good. There was a good proportion of chicken in it. They were actually pieces of kebabs and were really succulent.  The paratha was also crunchy. Allover a satisfying quick bite

Just have visited in 1st Feb. We had ordered gravy noodles, hakka chowmine, chilli chicken and fried rice. I must say that the quantity is enough for two, specially the gravy noodles.. but the quantity is so so.. one thing is very irritated that there has no option for regular water. they take 25 rupees for a litre. Even they charge VAT on 25rupees. Otherwise the place is not so spacious, but it's ok.

Had expectations, this one nailed it! Yes, good taste of mughali as well as chinese food which comes at a good price indeed! The service and ambience is good too, the waiters generally suggests good dishes, I personally liked the chicken with baby corn & mushroom¬† (which is a very healthy dish and a must try comes at Rs195), Ashiana spl. tandoori chili chicken, and mixed garlic fried rice. If you are looking for a good restaurant after getting down from the metro station, this is it!

I have had a variety of rolls from their take away counter before but i only got the opportunity to dine inside yesterday. It was a late afternoon lunch. When we entered, the manager greeted and courteously guided us to the seats. We ordered Chily Fish as a starter and Chicken with Mushrooms and Mixed Chowmein as the main course and the food was very good. The chicken and the chowmein flavours worked well together.
The server and the management staff were very amiable and courteous and deserves a mention as it often makes a good experience great! Will surely return for more.

I owe this place a great review.It was 10-15 p.m and they kept it open only because I requested them to.Even though we were the last guest to dine-in ¬†,the quality of food was not compromised.We ordered :
Chicken Reshmi Kabab¬†
Chicken ¬†Tikka kabab
Chicken reshmi butter masala
chicken tikka butter masala
butter Nan
Veg Pulao

The kababs were juicy from inside and the chicken tasted very fresh.Butter nan was soft and one of the best I have had in a long time.Both the chicken dishes were commendable ,the pieces were succulent and the gravy was appropriately spicy.But my favourite was the Veg-Pulao ,with soft rice ¬†and a lot of veggies.All the above mentioned dishes were reasonably priced and were enough to feed 4 hungry souls.Will be coming back to this place very soon(this time with time in hand so as to not miss out on malai kabab :p).

So I only go to kavi nazrul metro station,very far from my home only for the quality of their food. So for the quality i give them 8 on 10 what i have had ofcourse. We took mutton korma,chicken tikka masala,butter nun,mutton rezela, kashmiri polao,crispy chicken n chilli chicken gravy for starter n all chinese n infian cuisine is total hit. Ambience ok type. I ve only one complain....The waiters don't listen to the customers properly, often argue with d orders n sometimes don't bother to listen to anything.

They are mainly known in the locality for their Rolls. We order rolls from them regularly,3-4 times every month.

Rolls are really good and offer value for money. I have tasted their Veg Biriyani once (took Home Delivery),but it was too bad. I have heard that the fine dining segment of this small joint has improved in the last few months,but yet to try it.

So if you are in Garia, this is perhaps one of the better places to try out Rolls.

Ok let me get straight to the point. This is a pocket friendly food joint. The quantity is sufficient enough. One plate fried rice would be enough for two people. The quality is also very good. Both indian and chinese cuisine is tasty. I used to visit here quite often until one particular incident changed my opinion. I and my friends had gone there for lunch. But after the meal was over we still felt hungry. Instead of ordering dessert we ordered a starter. The waiters and the manager started commenting behind our back. And they were quite loud about it. They made fun of our choice. " ki khacche..koto khacche...ebr abr fried chicken".
So for the food you can definitely give this a try. We never experienced such behaviour there before. The staff should definitely change their attitufe. Otherwise for the food i would have given themw 3.5.....

Bang in front of the Garia Metro sation. Normally we are wary of any eateries near transit areas, but was pleasantly surprised. Decor was gentle with soft lighting. Professional looking people managing the show. We were six people including two kids, so got a corner family table. The sofa is too low slung than the table, management might look into it. We Indians are not that tall really. Now to the food & service. Had a starter plate of Reshmi kebab. Brought fresh but almost cold..surprise! & very salty too. Main course was limited to some Nan / Mutton Curry / Chicken Kadhai.. non-pleasant Surprise no. 3...the kadhai was actually a serving dish..no small copper kadhai like we find elsewhere. Chicken pieces in some Onion & bell pepper...no gravy..stumped. So ordered a quick fill of Chicken Bharta else we would have to eat our Naan with water & salt. The Bharta was good though. Ice Cream as dessert has also got varieties. A rather ho-hum performance as a whole. But again this area hasn't got much decent eating out experience.

I have mostly had rolls from this place. Very tasteful & big in size. Service is slow. Easy on the pockets as well. I have yet to experience their dine in!!!

it is a good place for casual hangouts. pocket friendly, good food, and good quantity. they have variety in their menu also. taste of the goods are decent in that price.

sofas are sooo soft that you will get tucked but the problem is that the tables are very much higher than the sofas..so you may b going to get a little discomfort ¬†while eating..it is the only problem of this place to me.

but for casual outing its a thumbs up..

The rolls are really decent. But a bit oily. So is fried rice. Which is extremely oily. The sauce used is not very good and very spicy. Biriyani is good and decent!! The chicken preparations also good. Try Indian recipes. Rotis not good.

A very exciting restaurant in a not-so-very exciting place, New Ashiana is located a few yards behind d kavi nazrul metro station in garia. Since its located in d backyard most of them r surely to meet a glance at it lest dey dont see d banner hanging at d corner. D interiors r enriched with minimalistic yet elegance and dim lights hanging, dis is surely a place to hangout with ur friends. With my college in Sonarpur, I often come here with my buddies. Well, what surprised me was that there was only waiter(with looks and apparel more of a manager) around. Fortunately, whenever we went der, there were very few people around to snatch d attention of d waiter.

Anyways, now comes the best bet - the FOOD...!!!! A very lengthy menu for such a restaurant seemed awkward but surprisingly, it served almost everything out der in d menu. The Chinese der was equally good like d Indian and Mughlai food. Schezwan is one of their specialities. Starters such as the Crispy fried chicken and drumsticks is my most favourite. D Quantity dey served us threw us off-guard as it was HUUUUGE..!!!! Even a bhukkad like me cudnt polish off an entire bowl of fried rice. :( D garlic chicken is one of their best with d chicken pieces richly coated with d thick garlic sauce. Equally mesmerizing was der tandoor dishes though i mostly ordered chinese out der. 1 glass of cold drink @ 30 was more dan expected. D service time was a bit on d higher side but it was compromised by d delicious food. We would gossip der for hours even after completing our food and dey wudnt seem a tad bothered. As d garia area is very vast i wud strongly recommend everyone der 2 try out dis small, yet exciting plate of happiness once.

This place,located near the kavi najrul metro station is a 10 minutes walk from my place. I went there today for some evening snacks and decided to take home a plate of chicken pakora. It cost me 183 bucks ( including a ridiculous vat in this deserted restaurant which mostly serves as a roll-corner). However, the rude eye opener was yet to come. The pakoras were not bigger than a 2 rupee coin and had an atrocious flour coating making it very ordinary. There were 8 pieces. So each cost me more than 20 bucks and yet seemed to be no better than the cheaper versions at every 'parar morer dokan'! They didn't even provide chopped salad or any pouch of sauce in the parcel. Clearly, serving customers was not amongst their priorities. I will never go back and do advise the reader to visit on their own risk. Period.

My fiancee and I had visited this newly opened restaurant on a rainy evening to save ourselves from the downpour. It is adjacent to Kavi Najrul Metro Station. The interior decoration is simple but very neat and clean which will attract you. There is ample space for 40-50 people seating at once. The waiter was very cordial and humble and always ready to help. Anyways we had ordered :
i) Chicken Hot and Sour Soup: It was ok but a little bit ¬†sour than hot.
ii)Chicken 65 : The outer skin was well cooked but due to big size of the chunks,salt and spice did not enter in the inner portions.
iii)Kulcha and plain Nun: Delicious!!Awesome!!
iv)Chicken Hundi Kebab Masala:Soft chicken pices cooked in North-Indian spices,I love the taste.

I think the North Indian dishes are better than Chinese here. So try the Mughlai dishes.

A student friendly restaurant - cheap,tasty food,great location( opp to Kavi Nazrul Metro station ) .

Both the quality & the quantity will satisfy u. 

I tasted the Chinese. It tastes like any other normal Chinese food.

The six- seat sitting sofa's are so soft & poufy that u'll get tucked inside it :p

Anyways I liked the restaurant because it has a decent price and the food served at that price is quite satisfactory. :)

It was an unplanned visit. They have a restaurant which opened few months back along with the take away counter. It's a spacious restaurant with comfortable seating. 
Do try tandoori chilli chicken that's a v pleasant fusion of Indian and Chinese.
Chilly fish dry was very yum, specially with succulent fresh fish.
The biriyani was also very tasty. Overall a very pleasant experience.
Quantity is very good.
Staff very courteous. And the owner sourav was a very pleasant host.
Would love to be back.

This is a takeaway joint that pretends to be a casual restaurant. The sitting is area is so cramped that if one person is standing up or walking others cannot do so!  How they managed to fit in tables will remain a mystery! 

Having said that the food is decent compared to the price. Though they style themselves as a mughlai restaurant, personally I would prefer biriyani or indian meat dishes from Shiraz or Aminia in the same neighborhood. However the tandoori chicken and other kebabs are ok. The chinese dishes are also palatable. 

Summary: Strictly for casual take out.
