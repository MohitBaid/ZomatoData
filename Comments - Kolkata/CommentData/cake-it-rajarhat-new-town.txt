This place is a must try. I ordered a game of thrones themed cake from 'cake it' and I have to say, they did a splendid job. It was quite similar to what I had wanted. The delivery was made on time too. Most importantly, the cake was delicious as well. Their sincerity gives me a good reason to order again in the future. Thank you and keep up the good work! :)

I placed an order for a birthday cake for a friend's daughter, sitting in Mumbai.
I was super stressed about finding a good cake store near her house and I came across Cake It.
Samriddhi at Cake it was very helpful and quick in understanding my requirement.
She literally made it seem like a cake walk for me. She made a designer cake exactly in 2 hours and delivered it on time at 11.30 pm to my Friend's house.
I am really impressed with the kind of trust they have with their clients and nonetheless the cake looked fabulous and tastes wonderful.
All in all a great place to get your cakes done.

Simply fabulous!!
Best black forest cake I have ever tasted...super fresh, moist, with cloud like soft and fluffy icing!!
Innovative and beautifully decorated pineapple flavoured cupcakes, yummy fruity fondant.
And icing on the cake *pun intended* "Samridhi" is such a delight to talk to.. just as sweet n amazing as her decadent desserts! 
From ordering the cake to devouring it...the entire experience was divine..just like a piece of "her" cake!!

As suggested by my friend, one of the best bakeries that I came across. 

They have ideas to make your cake special. Really worth your time and money.

I wanted to place an order for a customized picture cake for my sister's birthday this year and I found CakeIt on Instagram. They have done an amazing job with the chocolate truffle pastry. Given the size, hassle free delivery and most importantly the baking skills I guess their price chart is also very reasonable and just. The pastry was soft on the inside, loaded with chocolate and choco chips all around. Having seen and tasted a number of picture cakes before, I have to say the picture did come out well than I expected. Good job Samriddhi and team! I hope to check into the place someday. If you are also looking for places regarding your customized cakes for your loved ones, go get them and I vouch for it that you won't be disappointed.

Being away from home on my Mom's birthday was making me very sad. All I wanted was to throw a little party for her to make her day special, and no birthday party is complete without a birthday cake. As I was vigorously browsing through Zomato, I stumbled across this place. The pictures looked quite promising and I didn't waste any time to call them up. They were kind enough to send me other cake pictures , out of which I selected my favorite red velvet. The delivery was right on time and they were sweet enough to have me make the payment through paytm after the delivery was done. 
I was a little sceptical about the cake quality, but all my mom's friends and herself couldn't stress more about the deliciousness of the cake. I am glad that all of them enjoyed it. Thanks Cake it to make my order so smooth and easy and  make my mom's day so great.

Today I ordered one Black Forest cake from here. While ordering i clearly mentioned that to write "Happy Birthday Maa", which was not mentioned on the cake. As the Cake It guys decided to skip the part, maybe because they didn't want to change what is already written from there side. My advice don't deal with the customers like this. 

Now coming to the shape of the cake. Really guys. I ordered a simple cake to celebrate my moms birthday. Not to ruin it. At least when you are taking more time than the expected delivery time, you guys should work on this things. Because it's birthday cake. And thanks to you guys, you guys ruined it in proper way. Please check the pics added.

About delivery. As all of the other things this is also pathetic. Work on this things guys. 

After checking the previous reviews I decided to order from you guys. But after the experience it's really a big NO.

But this is how it was delivered to my mother. In this condition, what is even the point of gifting something?

Mother-daughter duo running home bakery- thats Cake it ! Late evening, I suddenly remembered it was my aunt's anniversary. Called up several bakeries in rajarhat area..most of them close by 8-9 pm. This is one place out of very very few that remains open till 11pm. I placed my order at around 9:20 pm..i was constantly keeping in touch with them over phone.. the cake was ready by 10 pm. It was delivered by 10:15 pm to my aunt's place ! Less than an hour , the cake was prepared ..customized ..packed and delivered ! The way they accepted the order with alacrity is commendable.
I would say prices are on a higher side. A similar cake in monginis or kathleen would have cost much cheaper. Nevertheless , my purpose was solved in a hassle free manner. I am happy. 
All the best to the sweet girl.

This is actually my personal favourite! The cakes are of course very fluffy and yummy but the best thing is how beautifully it is baked. The baker is such a young and bright talent that you'd love the cake as well as her! 
She often takes part in events and has quite a good hold on the frosting! Be it any kind of cake, any design, any flavour, you name it and she will bake it! 💕
Try this again and again with all the love because you won't be disappointed at all :)

We were looking for a bakery to order a cake for my niece 1st bday. We saw Cake it on zomato and really went crazy after seeing the kind of cake they bake.

And then we send a watsapp msg to the owner.The owner was very helpful and she send us few pic and after a couple of round of discussion, placed my order with her.

Cake was delivered at time. We have ordered a two tier cake fondant and it was really beautiful and made to perfection

Cake tasted heavenly and at the same time well textured.

I'm looking forward to order more cake from here.

Cake It: Caked It! :D

Have ordered several times and everytime the experience was great. There are many varieties of designs and types of cakes available + 100% customisation available. In the words of the owner: "Tell me what does he/she likes, the hobbies(for whom the cake is being ordered) and I will design it into a cake." 
From the design, the execution, till the taste, everything is amazing. 
Also, the polite and friendly nature with 100% professionalism is a thumbs up. 
Overall, a highly recommended place. Try Cake It once and you'll always get your Cake 'Caked' from here :)

For my birthday this year, I order two cakes from Cake It. 
One was a #DogMom cake with a little puppy on with. When I saw the cake I pepped up with joy! It was the most cutest cake I've ever seen. Also, it was delicious. Both cakes were chocolate flavoured. 
Second, was my anniversary cake with our initials on it #KD. Beautifully made, very creative and delightful to our mouths! 

Way to goooo Cake It.
More love to you! ❤️

I got the cake I ordered in short notice, even when she was busy with a family event and very graciously apologized and thanked me for cooperating with her about the time of delivery. Her cake definitely made my friend's birthday special.

I recently got a cake from here for a birthday. Samriddhi was very patient to listen to all the specifications I had for the cake and gave innovative suggestions too. The cake looked majestic and was very soft and perfectly sweet. Considering the fact that I had not booked the cake too much in advance, had jut called her a day before the occasion and she accommodated. That was very sweet. Only downer was that it couldn't be delivered where I stay but she came and delivered in person very close to my house. So a -0.5 for just that. Overall, a good recommend 👍🏽
