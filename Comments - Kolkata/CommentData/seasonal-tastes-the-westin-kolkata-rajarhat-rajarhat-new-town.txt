Our first visit to the Westin was a mixed bag. 

We opted not to go for buffet which looked sumptuous and ordered from the menu. We ordered a chicken caesar salad, chicken club sandwich, and crab avocado sandwich. 

On the positive side, service by George was phenomenal. He was attentive to every detail, knowledgeable about the hotel and very helpful. The view from the 10th floor is awesome and I am sure it will be even better when the bar and the restaurant moves to the 31st floor. 

The reason I am giving it way less than a 5.0 is the exorbitant pricing, even by 5 star standards. I have been to the Hyatt and the JW Marriott recently, and have a good benchmark to judge the pricing from. The sandwiches and the salad were each bordering on Rs. 1000, which is really too much. Hopefully, management will consider this aspect of customer satisfaction soon and make the hotel more welcoming.

I went here for my anniversary lunch. I opted for the buffet.
Ambience: suits the 5 star tag, restaurant is quite big and view is really nice from the tenth floor.
Food:
The best part about this buffet is that it comes with 2 live stations. One for Italian and the other for Oriental.
I had most of my food from the live counter. I started with Tom yum soup which was perfect.
I then took a starter with prawns and squids which was well prepared by the chef, i took some flat noodles tossed with vegetables and chicken to go along with it.the chef was extremely courteous to listen to our exact choice of flavours and whip up food accordingly, its almost near to ala carte!
I also took a seafood penne pasta, again made to order by the chef to suit my tastebuds. 
I tried the lamb and fish from continental section which was okay.
There was a wide variety of Indian food, like any other buffet which I couldn't have!!! Because I headed for dessert, my favorite part of the meal.
The dessert section is absolutely huge, with so much variety that one is sure to be confused!!! I loved the litchi pie the most. 
Staff: extremely courteous and polite. I thank my host Arshad who was a great person to talk to, and took good care.
Possible add ons: perhaps they could have given a dessert on the table with happy anniversary written on it, all other major five stars do this, or perhaps place a flower the table, I mean anything to make you feel that you are celebrating a special day.
Pocket pinch: 1250 per head, you get 20 percent corporate discount on lunch. Unfortunately they do not accept the corporate food cards yet.
I highly recommend this place!!!  Please do avail the live counter became that's what makes this place different.

I'll be reviewing this place only on the taste & quality of the food which it serves.

No doubt one of the best place in Kolkata for a fantastic dinner or lunch. 

The quality of food is an absolute delight and will fill you stomach with happiness.

Dinner: Luchi, Peas Kochuri, Alu fulkopi, Cholar dal, Mixed veg, Rice, Chingri macher malai curry, Shorshey fish, Mutton Biriyani, Shreded Chicken hariyali

Thai menu: Thai pad noodles, jasmine rice, Chicken in Thai red and green curry

Desert: Gurer rosogolla, Baked mihidana, Malai chomchom, Sandes & Kulfi

As I was invited for a wedding reception at this place, hence I wont be able to give you any figures regarding the depth of hole it has burned in ones pocket.

The Thai counter was the best. I have never had such great Thai food, specially the 'Thai Red and Green curry' was lip smacking. The Indian counter was also pretty good, the 'Chingri macher malai curry', 'Alu fulkopi' and 'Shreded chicken hariyali' stole the spotlight. Coming to the desert, the 'Baked mihidana' was "Aladai" in bengali terms, totally exquisite, and the "Malai chomchom" was something to die for. 

As the dining didn't take place in the restaurant, it took place in the Banquet, I wont be able to give you any approximation about the budget for a proper meal here. (will add the approximation whenever I visit it).

If you want to have some great Thai food and bengali desert, while enjoying the endless view of Rajarhat, this is the place to be.

They have live kitchen counter for Italian Pasta  and oriental cuisine. Also, the food is fresh and offers a great variety in buffet.. There badam halwa is mouth watering.. But there service is not up to the mark.. We had to keep requesting the staff to serve Indian bread and finally it came after I had finished eating the main course.. But for the quality of food u can rest assured.. All in all its worth a try..

Just after completing their successful one year in Kolkata, of Marriott International Inc., has come up with one of their famous business hotels, The Westin Kolkata Rajarhat which is first under the brand Westin. Situated in the Rajarhat Area. I have visited the All day restaurant Seasonal Tastes upon invitation and sampled the buffet as well as a few items from the a-la-carte. I found the buffet quite decent with good options though they need to work on the general service.

I had been to this place yesterday with my colleagues for lunch. We had a great experience as all of us were pleasantly surprised. Having seen the quality of food recently in another star hotel in Kolkata (for which I have already written a review), we had moderated our expectations. However, this place being new, is very nice.
The restaurant is on the 10th floor and the view is wonderful. There was a complimentary virgin mojito which almost everyone likes! Moreover, you need some drink while having lunch buffet. So it's really nice that the management understands this basic need of any customer.
Coming to the starters, there are some veg and non veg options. I liked the grilled fish and chicken. There is kati roll, kebab, paneer tikka, salads of different types, soups, live counters for pasta and noodles. I tried the sauté chicken with vegetables and prawns and it it was really tasty.
For main course, you have some routine stuff like rice, peas polao, fish, chicken, mutton gravy, etc. Gosht polao was very nice.
In desserts, there were many items like pastries, fruits, mousse, sweets, etc. Baked rosogolla was nice but it had become mashed due to the way it was kept.
Overall it was a good experience and all of us thoroughly enjoyed the lunch.
One area of improvement is the entrance area where a portico would look nice.

Located atop westin hotel, at the 10th floor, seasonal taste is indeed a place to binge on traditional yet uncommon dishes. 
Coming to the ambience, a great place - wide range of sitting arrangement. One part gives a good sight on to busy rajarhat arterial road as well as the Eiffel tower(kolkata special) not very far away. 
Hospitality i must say so far the best. Courteous welcome with a smile on everyone's face- fast service and always checking whether everything running fine.  It makes you feel home.
The food- we went for a lunch buffet. They are arranged in sections as- salads, indian dishes(veg and non veg), bengali dishes, jain dishes, continental breads with kebabs, live pasta and noodle counter, and a gigantic dessert section.
Salad- kimuchi, chicken salad as well as the pepper squid salad tasted great. Types of cheese with meat are there. I liked the honey blazed ham - just the way you want it. Dahi vada and kachori chat are traditional.
Bengali dishes- dal tasted good. Chhyanchra(a bengali mixed veg dish) goes well with it.
Indian dishes- mutton kosha and chicken lababdar tasted good. But the winner was basanti polao with feresta sprinkled over it gave a new twist and taste buds danced into the tunes.
Pasta counter- went for a white sauce prawn and squid pasta, chef made it just perfect.
Continental- the cajun spice chicken roast so well cooked that it melts in the mouth. Other dishes also went well.
Noodle counter- a mixed flat hakka noodle with the spices i needed , made with a perfection.
Dessert section- calling it a section will be insult, rather a store or mart. So many to have. I specially liked- litchi tart, red velvet cake, blueberry cheese cake with macaroons, chocolate gateux, choco mudpie and crunchy tart. 
Pocket pinch- on a higher side obviously being a business hotel, its 1250+ 18%gst- i would say its worth paying that money being a place of great place of gastronomy. Will visit again sooner or later.

when the chef asked for my food preference, I stole the line from the movie Ratatouille and said "Surprise me ... ". Chef Ravish Mishra smiled sheepishly and I could get the reason at the dinner. We chose continental cuisine and the first cocktail was looking just like a watermelon cooler. And I was kinda taken aback ... "A watermelon cooler ??? " But the first sip proved me wrong. It was a watermelon and chocolate cooler with ginger. Served at room temperature, the drinks set the mood for the meal. 

Starter consisted of crispy cheese with tomato salsa and herbs (my idiot son kept calling it cheese papad) and Hazelnut crusted mushroom. After a decade of marriage, husband and wife hardly agrees on anything and we were no exception. While I preferred the former, her choice was the mushroom. Needless to say, both were brilliant. 

My son was getting impatient (he still doesn't know the meaning of relaxed dining) and the intelligent chef team brought him a chicken burger. Thoughtfully, the bun was kept separate to prevent it from getting soggy. And, we were served the Parsley cauliflower soup with truffle. Now, I'll talk about other dishes in due time, but remember, this dish was THE showstopper for the evening and is highly recommended on any a la carte meal there. 
               
Seafood Rissotto was next and it looked brilliant. And while we were expecting the dessert, the second main course arrived. It was chicken breast with asparagus veloute. Maybe the kitchen team mistook our appetite with our size, and we were literally choking. But did we let go of the dish ? No sir, not me at least .... 

We were stuffed till our neck, but only a fool would miss an opera cake with banana ice cream and surely, we were not the ones. 

For breakfast. I started with a south Indian platter along with my health-freak son and wife started with some mixed meat soup and upon chef Debmalya's suggestion, chocolate pancake with honey. But, a warrior's breakfast is incomplete without the meat and soon an order was sent to the kitchen for a specific omlette ( "cheese with mushroom, slightly underdone please" ). And, I've tasted my second perfectly fluffy shaped omlette (from wherever little I've tasted off course) in town. and, they know how to make a crispy, less salted bacon- I am seriously impressed. 

For an outsider, the breakfast is priced at 1000/-, lunch buffet at 1250/- and dinner at 1500/-, all exclusive of Tax. And considering the ingredient and spread, it's pretty justified. 

Will I go again ? Definitely, yes ...

It's good to know about the new place n awesome Buffet but management must take a call on providing soft drinks with the buffet... It hardly costs much for the Hotel which has already made a place for itself... M going to visit shortly n give a detaile
d review.. The GST is still not changed... Should have been 5pc but still it's 18pc... Management must look into it... Just had a talk
On my way to Westin...
Yet again I sit to review... Excellent staff by far the best.... The chef made a special dish on account of our special date... Thanks to the entire Team... But again GSt issue dissapointed.... Excellent ambience... Would highly recommend..... Would surely like to revisit ....Also the Indian spread could have been better

We were 4 of us and 3 children which the restaurant people converted to complimentary on our request. We took the buffet which was highly recommended by them.

The spread is great and one of the best we could have. Cost wise it is costly but then they maintain that ways. Hopefully they understand as to what costing will work with the Kolkatans. Well a bit of dismay was that there was not even a soft drink included in the buffet but they went all out to provide one for us on our repeated requests.

The food is amazing from start to the end of desserts. Man the varieties of desserts will simply wow you. The food is mix cuisine and you will almost get everything you would want. Even the simplest hakka noodles was made in a great way for our kids who do not eat vegetables. We also ordered pasta and some noodles for ourselves too and they were simply marvelous. The starters were simple yet superb.

The only complain which I have is with the indian dishes spread. They were no doubt tasty but I found them to be a bit oily. Might be they would manage this in future but that's what I faced. The taste was awesome but with oiliness.

The best part was the desserts. So much in offer and such a huge spread. What else one can want more? Simply mind-blowing. I was so full I couldn't even try all of them. May be next time.

All in all it is a new restaurant in the town and it has so much to learn and evolve with. It is highly recommended by me. People are friendly and service is good too. A must visit if your pocket allows.

The restaurant on the 10th floor of this skyscraper is unbeatable in terms of views outside. It overlooks the eco park and the Biswa Bangla sarani with a very close resemblance of the queens necklace. 
The lunch and dinner buffets are visually very very appealing and lavish. People with different restrictions on certain kind of food will certainly find something or other that they can enjoy. The buffet spread generally contains variety of salads, varieties of Indian and continental starters, Indian and Chinese main course ( at times traditional Bengali cuisine) and an unbelievable array of desserts. The pastries that I have had here are undoubtedly the best that I have ever had. 
While staying in the property I have ordered in room dining multiple times from this restaurant. Quality of in room dining is as good as the one in the restaurant. 
The buffets are very reasonably priced at 1250+ taxes for lunch and 1500+ taxes for dinner. Overall an amazing experience.

The live counter for italian was average but chef Ugyen of the Chinese counter stole the show. For chocolate lovers it's a paradise. The Venezuelan chocolate desserts are just yum.....

Located atop westin hotel, at the 10th floor, seasonal taste is indeed a place to binge on traditional yet uncommon dishes. 
Coming to the ambience, a great place - wide range of sitting arrangement. One part gives a good sight on to busy rajarhat arterial road as well as the Eiffel tower(kolkata special) not very far away. 
Hospitality i must say so far the best. Courteous welcome with a smile on everyone's face- fast service and always checking whether everything running fine.  It makes you feel home.
The food- we went for a lunch buffet. They are arranged in sections as- salads, indian dishes(veg and non veg), bengali dishes, jain dishes, continental breads with kebabs, live pasta and noodle counter, and a gigantic dessert section.
Salad- kimuchi, chicken salad as well as the pepper squid salad tasted great. Types of cheese with meat are there. I liked the honey blazed ham - just the way you want it. Dahi vada and kachori chat are traditional.
Bengali dishes- dal tasted good. Chhyanchra(a bengali mixed veg dish) goes well with it.
Indian dishes- mutton kosha and chicken lababdar tasted good. But the winner was basanti polao with feresta sprinkled over it gave a new twist and taste buds danced into the tunes.
Pasta counter- went for a white sauce prawn and squid pasta, chef made it just perfect.
Continental- the cajun spice chicken roast so well cooked that it melts in the mouth. Other dishes also went well.
Noodle counter- a mixed flat hakka noodle with the spices i needed , made with a perfection.
Dessert section- calling it a section will be insult, rather a store or mart. So many to have. I specially liked- litchi tart, red velvet cake, blueberry cheese cake with macaroons, chocolate gateux, choco mudpie and crunchy tart. 
Pocket pinch- on a higher side obviously being a business hotel, its 1250+ 18%gst- i would say its worth paying that money being a place of great place of gastronomy. Will visit again sooner or later.

when the chef asked for my food preference, I stole the line from the movie Ratatouille and said "Surprise me ... ". Chef Ravish Mishra smiled sheepishly and I could get the reason at the dinner. We chose continental cuisine and the first cocktail was looking just like a watermelon cooler. And I was kinda taken aback ... "A watermelon cooler ??? " But the first sip proved me wrong. It was a watermelon and chocolate cooler with ginger. Served at room temperature, the drinks set the mood for the meal. 

Starter consisted of crispy cheese with tomato salsa and herbs (my idiot son kept calling it cheese papad) and Hazelnut crusted mushroom. After a decade of marriage, husband and wife hardly agrees on anything and we were no exception. While I preferred the former, her choice was the mushroom. Needless to say, both were brilliant. 

My son was getting impatient (he still doesn't know the meaning of relaxed dining) and the intelligent chef team brought him a chicken burger. Thoughtfully, the bun was kept separate to prevent it from getting soggy. And, we were served the Parsley cauliflower soup with truffle. Now, I'll talk about other dishes in due time, but remember, this dish was THE showstopper for the evening and is highly recommended on any a la carte meal there. 
               
Seafood Rissotto was next and it looked brilliant. And while we were expecting the dessert, the second main course arrived. It was chicken breast with asparagus veloute. Maybe the kitchen team mistook our appetite with our size, and we were literally choking. But did we let go of the dish ? No sir, not me at least .... 

We were stuffed till our neck, but only a fool would miss an opera cake with banana ice cream and surely, we were not the ones. 

For breakfast. I started with a south Indian platter along with my health-freak son and wife started with some mixed meat soup and upon chef Debmalya's suggestion, chocolate pancake with honey. But, a warrior's breakfast is incomplete without the meat and soon an order was sent to the kitchen for a specific omlette ( "cheese with mushroom, slightly underdone please" ). And, I've tasted my second perfectly fluffy shaped omlette (from wherever little I've tasted off course) in town. and, they know how to make a crispy, less salted bacon- I am seriously impressed. 

For an outsider, the breakfast is priced at 1000/-, lunch buffet at 1250/- and dinner at 1500/-, all exclusive of Tax. And considering the ingredient and spread, it's pretty justified. 

Will I go again ? Definitely, yes ...

It's good to know about the new place n awesome Buffet but management must take a call on providing soft drinks with the buffet... It hardly costs much for the Hotel which has already made a place for itself... M going to visit shortly n give a detaile
d review.. The GST is still not changed... Should have been 5pc but still it's 18pc... Management must look into it... Just had a talk
On my way to Westin...
Yet again I sit to review... Excellent staff by far the best.... The chef made a special dish on account of our special date... Thanks to the entire Team... But again GSt issue dissapointed.... Excellent ambience... Would highly recommend..... Would surely like to revisit ....Also the Indian spread could have been better

We were 4 of us and 3 children which the restaurant people converted to complimentary on our request. We took the buffet which was highly recommended by them.

The spread is great and one of the best we could have. Cost wise it is costly but then they maintain that ways. Hopefully they understand as to what costing will work with the Kolkatans. Well a bit of dismay was that there was not even a soft drink included in the buffet but they went all out to provide one for us on our repeated requests.

The food is amazing from start to the end of desserts. Man the varieties of desserts will simply wow you. The food is mix cuisine and you will almost get everything you would want. Even the simplest hakka noodles was made in a great way for our kids who do not eat vegetables. We also ordered pasta and some noodles for ourselves too and they were simply marvelous. The starters were simple yet superb.

The only complain which I have is with the indian dishes spread. They were no doubt tasty but I found them to be a bit oily. Might be they would manage this in future but that's what I faced. The taste was awesome but with oiliness.

The best part was the desserts. So much in offer and such a huge spread. What else one can want more? Simply mind-blowing. I was so full I couldn't even try all of them. May be next time.

All in all it is a new restaurant in the town and it has so much to learn and evolve with. It is highly recommended by me. People are friendly and service is good too. A must visit if your pocket allows.

The restaurant on the 10th floor of this skyscraper is unbeatable in terms of views outside. It overlooks the eco park and the Biswa Bangla sarani with a very close resemblance of the queens necklace. 
The lunch and dinner buffets are visually very very appealing and lavish. People with different restrictions on certain kind of food will certainly find something or other that they can enjoy. The buffet spread generally contains variety of salads, varieties of Indian and continental starters, Indian and Chinese main course ( at times traditional Bengali cuisine) and an unbelievable array of desserts. The pastries that I have had here are undoubtedly the best that I have ever had. 
While staying in the property I have ordered in room dining multiple times from this restaurant. Quality of in room dining is as good as the one in the restaurant. 
The buffets are very reasonably priced at 1250+ taxes for lunch and 1500+ taxes for dinner. Overall an amazing experience.

Went there on Ashami with a friend. Absolutely brilliant place. A must visit for foodies. The buffet had a very large spread. Loved the salmon. The live counter for italian was average but chef Ugyen of the Chinese counter stole the show. For chocolate lovers it's a paradise. The Venezuelan chocolate desserts are just yum..... We would be back again. For sure.
