My experience over there was completely satisfying. The way the cook their foods, that's totally authentic tibetian or chineese. Though the ambiance is little cozy, doesn't have enough space. But after taste their foods u'll forget about the ambiance :) Infact this cozy restaurant awarded as the best thukpa serves restaurant in 2010.

Don't judge this food joint by its size. The place is cringy, but they serve decent food. 'Thukpa's are the speciality of this place and items like pork momo and chilli pork are a treat to the taste buds.
Generally service is slow but is organised.

No card payment facility, but PayTM etc are accepted.

This shabby place serves one of the best momos in Kolkata . Ordered the chicken steam momo. Each dumpling had a handsome amount of chicken filling.The broth served along with it also was good. Also tried the prawn thukpa.
Don't go by the look of the place because they serve awesome food.

located beside sambhu nath pandit hospital and oppsite of rabindra sadan metro. actually  we went there for TIBETAN DELIGHT,  but it was closed. so we have to change our mind. But I am satisfied  with  my decision. The place is shabby looking, one small room like a street food corner. Don't  expect restaurant style atmosphere.  But the food was very good  in taste. prepared  by the Tibetan persons. we have ordered roasted pork, mixed fried rice, fish manchurian, and hot garlic chicken... roasted pork is a must  recommended. but the hot garlic was a little dull in taste. fish manchurian was good, so the mixed fried rice are.

Had chicken steam momo, chicken Pan fried momo and chicken thupka at this place. None of the items impressed me. The steam momos  however were decent and adequately sized. The thupka was too light for my liking. But the greatest disappointment were the pan fried momos which weren't fried at all! By the looks of it, the bloke who cooks over there had simply decided to take some steam momos and toss them in a distasteful tomato based sauce. Won't recommend this place to anyone.

The place looks shabby, but the food tastes good, just in the opposite lane of Lee Road Brand Factory. We tried Pork pan fried momo and chicken hot & sour soup, the momos were tasty, filling was adequate and the sauce was tangy. The soup wasn't upto the mark. They should look after the cleanliness.

Just opposite to the rabindra sadan metro station this restaurant is located, that is just beside momo plaza . This place is very small but this can be easily located because it is on the main road. This restaurant is very small and hardly it can accommodate 10 people. Not well decorated and not so clean but one visits for food and satiety and if both are met then the bad qualities are automatically covered. So we ordered pork streamed momo and mixed thukpa. The thukpa was not upto to the mark, the chunks of white meat were very small however it can satisfy 2 appetites. But the pork momo is a must try, according to the price the size was quite remarkable and taste was very satisfying but the soup which was given along with it needs to get improved. Moreover if youre hungry you can surely sit here but do not expect anything extravagant.

located in the heart of the city (elgin road)alongside chai break and momo plaza, this small joint can give them a run for their money.
It is famous among college students and office goers due to the minimum pocket pinch.
This is a small joint with 3-4 tables which is mainly packed during the lunch time so you might have to wait. However takeaway would be a better option.
This was my 2nd visit with my friends post college for some snacks.
we ordered a plate of chicken pan fried momo which consisted of 5 pieces (large and well stuffed) in tangy sauce which we loved.
However we were dissapointed with the egg chow which was extremely dry and there was even a piece of the egg shell in it😑.
Next the side dish chicken hong kong was another disaster.It was extremely spicy and the chicken was hard and rubbery.
My suggestion would be just to try out their momos for which they are famous and try out the rest at your own risk😅

Have had almost everything under the menu a zillion times for being a regular commuter in that area for a long time..
* Love the momos and the thukpas on the go.
* soups aren't on point though.
* noddles & rice dishes are good.
* chicken & fish sides are fair enough.

The only issue with this outlet is the uncomfortable & clumsy seating arrangements and the surrounding is a little dirty.

Very very bad experience.... I wish I could give negative rating.... Just thought to give this small dingy Chinese-Tibetan joint a try today.... As the name suggests, heard some good opinions about their momos.... So we ordered 2 chicken steam momos & 2 deep pan-fried chicken momos.... The outer cover of the momos were very thick & the filling was so so.... Five momos were there in each plate.... Now, after consuming the first momo, I discovered a long strand of hair inside the 2nd piece.... I showed the plate politely without uttering a word to the person in the counter (probably the manager) and this was his arrogant reply.... "Yeh to ho sakta hay ek-do piece mey.... eh to banke ata hay.... aap yeh rakh do waha par".... and after 10 minutes they were kind enough to give me another plate but this time with 3 momos.... I just didn't dare to go to the counter again.... The funny thing was that they were not sorry at all and as this was my fault to show this to them in front of the other customers.... Yes, it was my fault to go there and will definitely not repeat that....

There are times when you crave for comfort food even when there is already a burn in your pocket. At those times, as a foodie, one might sacrifice on other factors and NOT on taste. Harmo Momo could have been one such place.
The micro eatery is near to Rabindra Sadan metro (Elgin side). The stretch of road has a few eateries but this was my destination this time. This was a second visit to be exact and we ordered a light meal to satisfy the craving. A plate of humble momo and a bowl of thukpa were all we orderded. The momo had proper flavour, seasoning and had a good mouth filling taste. The soup, which comes with the momo can be tagged as average. The heartbreak was the Thukpa. I was introduced to this humble dish in Bhutan. Thukpa should have a soft noodles in a hearty piping hot broth. This dish couldn't make me amaze. However the noodle in it was soft.
It is worth a second visit only if you are nearby and have a tight budget.
Recommended for momos and fried rice.

So we went to this place
We ordered chicken noodles, chicken fried rice, pork roast and dry chilli pork and some coke
The amount of food was enough for 4 of us
Coming to the quality it was enough for the price
They literally served us lip smacking dishes
The ambience was of some old school canteen

Overall a nice and cheap place to enjoy Tibetan

Had their Deep Pan fried Momo which was awsome. Both by the taste & quantity. So this 3 stars only & only for the momo. But along with momo we had chicken fried rice & hot garlic chicken. Frankly speaking we are regreating for that! There was no sign of garlic or the presence of its flavour at all. Only some small pieces of chicken in excess chilli sauce. & the fried rice was avg. Nothing so special about it. Overall it was not so good ecperience at all.

Heard a lot about this place for their momos in elgin.. visited one fine evening with my friend with high expectation of having momo but sadly on our part as we entered and sat with the menu, the waiter quickly told that we dont have any momos except pork ones... Bad luck.. !!!
But aftr gng throough a vast menu we decided to stick with a portion of veg thukpa and a portion of singapore mix noodles. To our expectation the dishes could have been much better.. they need to work on the seasoning part as both the dishes were less on salt.. will try to visit once more to try their momos for sure. Hope next time they improve on their taste too.. ! Give it a try guyz once.

To all college students this place is a must visit for their cheap and delicious momos. Located in elgin road, tbh the interior is too small and not that clean. The smoke from the kitchen will leave u sneezing all thru ur meal. Eating ur food without sneezing like a retard is like surviving an episode of khatron ke khiladi . There is a lot of scope for improvement in relation to the interior as well as the exterior. 
        Coming to the food. the momos were not too small . Well the chicken pan fried momo was spicy and tangy which left a lingering deliciousness. The taste of the gravy was nailed to perfection. Both the quantity and quality was commendable. The chicken fried momo was crispy . The chinese choupsey was nothing exceptional. The stir fried noodles of the chop suey was supposed to be given on top of the gravy but they did the opposite and thus after sometime the choupsey turned to gravy chowmein which tasted so bland.
The pocket pinch was on the lower side and wud surely try to visit this place again for the pan fried chicken momos.

I have spent 10 years studying and working in that Elgin Road - Exide area..  Although I didn't dare to enter or some what overlooked this place bcoz of its shabby look. Even during my collage days we went for Momo plaza and Orchid for pocket friendly food but never entered this place for Hygiene issue. Some of my friend recommended it and use to enjoy its food... But later I realized above to names I mentioned also doesn't care much about their cleanliness,and quality of their food was going down day by day... I stopped visiting those joints..
Very recently when I found that Harmo had made a small renovation /paintings etc. I dared to enter 1day with my friends and tried
1. Chicken Steam momo (4/5): 5 big pcs of Momo with soup, Good portion of chicken minced in it well balanced with onion... Earlier  I  preferred only WOW MOMO as they have solid chicken stuffing, where as at other places u get more of onion and cabages, can count the chicken pcs. easily.. But Harmo's stuffing was good...

2. Dry Chilly Pork ( 5/5) : Very Spicy , juicy Pork more of meat than fat.. Excellent in taste it will charge u up..
 
Another Day we treid

3. Pan Friend Schezwan Chicken Momo ( 3 / 5 ) : Taste was good.. but i don't like momo cooked in sauce as it become soggy.. I was rather expecting it as half fried in low oil....

4. Chilly Fish ( 4/5) : Mild spicy ,6 big pcs@ of fish .. Nice and crispy...Most important not smelly as we get in most of the small joints..

On 10 dec 17 we went for lunch and ordered
1. Chicken Friend Momo (4.5 /5):   5 pcs of crispy n juicy momo with a bowl of refreshing soup...

2. Mix fried rice (w/o pork) (4/5):  Rice was good.

3. Hot Garlic Chicken (4/5):  Soft and succulent 8 pcs of chicken .. Not that spicy, taste of garlic was not strong... But gravy was excellent..

I ordered a pan fried momo chicken momo, and a pork roast, the pork roast which was not only very stale, i would say the raw pork was actually decomposing which was deep fried to remove the smell and then serve. But all the effort made didn't help,i had a major stomach upset after eating all that.

With the first bite of the decently sized chicken momo, I was convinced on the popularity of this joint. The delightfully light chicken stew is worth mentioning too. The place is too small to squeeze in more than 12 people to sit and gulp. But the service was appreciably fast. A sure try for momo lovers.

This momo joint is one hell of a famous small eateries to enjoy some really succulent and flavoursome momos.. I have been visiting this place since I was in class 5 and it's quality is still the same! 

The place is small but prepares some great dishes and can be place to eat some food on the go! Although many people sit inside and eat their meals, many drive in to this joint and enjoy the food in their cars! 
Our favourite from this place are the momos, be it steam, fried or pan fried! Next the Noodles and manchurian is yummy too! 
We just have a small issue, and that is regarding it's cleanliness!

I walked into the place with the impression that it offers amazing momos. Unfortunately, what I received was nothing out of the ordinary. However, I have to add that dumplings were nicely stuffed, and stuffing was flavoursome. I would choose them any day over Momo Plaza or even Wow Momo. There's nothing to say about the ambience - it's a roadside eatery. It's quite well organised, and the service is prompt. Pocket friendly, as well. Altogether, a nice experience.

The best Thukpa in Town. This small eatery is situated right beside the momo plaza on elgin road. They have the menu card featuring all pocket friendly delicacies from chicken to pork and more. We ordered Chicken Steam Momo and Chiken Thukpa. The service was prompt. Everything was hot and fresh. The thukpa was absolute soul food! The soup, noodles, chicken pieces and the veggies. One cannot go wrong with it.  The Momos were hot too and had ample amount of filling inside. But the only thing I don't like is the outer part. It was quite thick which made them feel doughy to eat.  Though the soup tasted good but was a bit oily.  Next time will be back for their pork dishes.

P.S - Ambience is shabby and untidy.

Situated at juat beside of Shambhunath Pandit Hospital, Hamaro Momo is a well known tibetian & chinese food joint in south kolkata. I heared a lot about it's tasty momo. I visited here today(30/05/2017) for the first time.
Truely I don't feel that "wao" experience. We ordered two plate of chicken steam momo, which contains 5pcs in each plate and it's cost Rs. 75 per plate, which I felt a little expensive. The momo is definetly good, and served it with a clear soup - which is tasty but doesn't contain with any chicken. The momo pieces are larger than other reguler momo shop which I visited earlier, and filled of good amount of chicken.
The restaurant have only 3 tables, which is realy cozy and the cooking room is attached with the eating area, so it was really difficult for us to sit over there and enjoy our meal. There is always cooking grinders coming from the cooking room, so sneezing would be very common thing while we were eating. But I noticed a large amount of people come across here and take away their order or prefer seating at their own car and enjoy the meal.

We landed at this joint quite late in the evening with a sudden craving for pork. I have heard a lot about this small Momo joint tucked away in a lane on the back side of forum mall .Its a delight for pork lovers. Personally I am not a Momo lover .I do like dumplings and occasionally gorge on them. The Momos served were hot and had ample amount of filling inside but the outer coating was quite thick which made the corners almost too doughy to eat .Generous amount of lightly spiced filling of pork and not just onions (which is quite common in other places).The eatery is small and not very tidy but the service is very prompt. The server immediately made place for us and handed over the elaborate menu featuring all delicacies from chicken to pork and more. After much discussion we ordered chicken Momo ,pork Momo ,garlic pork starter and a roasted pork starter. The pork dishes were amazing with soft and succulent meat pieces tossed with onions, spring onions and bell paper in spicy sauce .Roasted pork was a little on the spicy side while the garlic one was mild for my palate. They do not include the fat portion of the pork which is how I like it. The bill came to a decent 500.I would really want them to renovate the decor and emerge as a pork lovers heaven.

To begin with,after dropping in quite a no of times to this place I must say I feel the Zomato rating of 2.6 is quite shocking.with zero ambience and only a handful of people to accommodate,the USP of this place is definitely their food.i've tried quite a lot of dishes here,the thukpa and the hongkong fried rice and noodles being my favourite.the pork dishes are equally good.the service is swift too and prices are affordable.so if Tibetan cuisine is your choice for the day,you can easily drop in and have a hearty good meal here.

Just realised I haven't reviewed this joint inspite of repeated visits here for years now. If you are in a mood for some good hot steamy momo then this joint should be in the wishlist. I love their chicken steamed momo and the pan fried momo. They just melt in your mouth. The soup makes the momo eating experience even better. I have also tried their chicken Hakka noodles and its quite good. Though I found the oil to be a bit more, yet the taste would make you forget that for sure. Its a small little joint which is very ordinary. The service is prompt. You can also park your car and order. Pricing is as per the market. Overall one of the best places to try out momo.

After a long wait at the Brand Factory sale, my friend and myself decided to go to Hamro Momo. First because of my undying love for momo and second because that was closer thn anything else. By the look of the place, it doesn't really entice you! But then our hungry and tired stomachs ignored it all and we order a plate of fried and steamed momos. Considering the price, the momos wasnt really bad, instead I found it decent to order myself another plate. So ya a decent Momo joint!

I will be quiet elated to know why in the earth this place is visited by foodies. Made a mistake to drop in here. A small roadside room providing sitting place for handful customers with the ambience of a street side tea stall is still acceptable. But, the food is just a damper. The momo they serve is dry, hard, tasteless. The soup is nothing more than hot water. No momo dip was provided. Even the Thukpa appeared to be below the mark. Sadly, many street side stalls serve better momo than this place but they remain in oblivion.

This place is famous for their thukpa,  yes indeed it tastes that sexy. Apart from that, try out dry chilie pork, pan fried chicken or pork momos.
The shop is just near to brand factory elgin.
Pocket pinch for 2 is near 250 300.

Do not go here, the momo sold on the streets are better. On visiting, I was confused that what was worse the food on my plate or the place I was sitting. It felt like I was having my food inside my toilet. Go there if only everythings closed.

If you are hungry and just want some food at reasonable prices and not care about the ambiance, hygiene etc. of the restaurant, then Humro Momo should be the right place for you. I've had their momos  and they taste little better than average. Portion sizes are good.

One of My friend recommend this restaurant to try their momos but frankly speaking i don't know why i don't like their momos at all.. The ambiance was unhygienic and taste of those momos are BAD.
I can surely tell that the roadside momo shops are better than this.. One Plate of chicken momo cost is 75/- min. But taste was - i don't like it seriously.
Some roadside shops are served u better momos at 40-50 max..
Not Recommended..

East and West wow momo is the best :p

Visited this place on a friend's recommendation.

AMBIANCE: This place is not at all hygienic. Hygiene is not always a factor for me. I'm a big fan of street food where everything is made in the open with fresh air. Dust is better than a damp and dark place which happens to be the breeding ground for what not creatures and kitchen of this eatery. The kitchen is so dark that even if a fly falls in the food they won't know.
Many big and renowned restaurants have dirty kitchens too. Thankfully, I haven't had the opportunity to have a look at them.

FOOD: Naturally what happens after seeing the kitchen scenario.. No matter how good the food was, I completely lost the appetite to eat. Whatever I had, was okay.

May be, if I hadn't seen the kitchen, my experience would've been different and better.

The downer for me was the place itself...though it has sitting arrangement...the arrangement is very poor...the surrounding isn't what I'll call "clean"...hope they improve on these problems to atleast be able to come to people's notice...this is one of the reasons momo plaza gets more customers...

This is not a great place if you think of sitting and eating. Neither there is beautiful ambience nor there are wonderful arrangements. The food is good. A food lover if you are you can try it. Best for college goers or school friends to hang out. Prices are pretty affordable and quantity is good. A bowl of thukpa was good for two of us as we wanted only an evening eat out.
Quality and quantity is good too.

When college friends meet, they want to relive their good old college days. Cherishing the same adda, the same pranks and the same food from the joints they visited together. During college days, Hamro Momo, was always the obvious choice for its location, pocket money friendly pricing, quantity and variety of Desi Chinese/Tibetan food. We ordered what we ate those days. The steamed momo (with that fiery red sauce) and pan fried momo was always the favourite for lunch-break  or while bunking classes. And when someone was treating, it was for the greater good, the oily mixed fried rice/noodles along with roast pork and a gravy dish like chicken in hot garlic sauce. We ordered just that and realised the dishes tasted the same, unchallenged by the changing times. The food continues to be spicy, tasty, regular, tummy filling and  they continue to be as popular with college students and first jobbers alike. That evening, along with the adda, the food indeed played a major role in making the trip down memory lane even more special

A small Tibetan / Chinese eatery serving pocket-friendly food. Dining space is small and congested. There are few chairs laid outside on footpath also. The kitchen area is so small that it's hard to believe they actually serve all the foods from there. And service is pretty fast and friendly. Although the food here is pocket friendly, it is not very tasty. The momo was ok. And the chilly pork was made with readymade sauces. It felt like you are having few pieces of cooked pork along with sauces from Pou Chong or Sing Cheung. There are better places around serving same cuisine.

On my way back home from Forum, I spotted this restaurant. We all love momos don't we. Well most of us. :P
And what better than you getting it from a Nepali shop. Oh well that's what I thought when I read the name. Didn't look good at all from the outside, but then as long as you get good momos you wouldn't care. 
Oh my! What tasteless momos. The outer layer of the momo was just too thick, and I guess not properly steamed. The filling was no good either. A bad experience indeed!

The quantity of the thukpa was good. But lack of quality doesnt make up for excessive quantity. 

The momo was ok. Was expecting better. The size of the momos were larger than most places but it wasnt as good as i thought it would be. 
The soup with the momo was also tasteless. 

Momo plaza close to the elgin hamro momo is a million times better.

I have visited this place long ago, during my first year in college and I loved the steamed momo. It was my second visit here today! Hamro Momo is quite popular among the students because of its affordable prices. 
The location of this place is easily accessible and it is situated just near Brand Factory. 
I had previously heard various complaints about the ambience and hygiene of the place, which indeed is a bit of an issue!
But the staff were good and their service was real quick. We ordered Fried Chicken Momos and Drums of Heaven and that was served within 5minutes. I totally loved the taste of the chicken Momos. The Momos had a lot of filling and the sauces along with it were really good. But, I was a bit disappointed with the soup as it was pretty bland. The drums of heaven was also okayish in taste and nothing outstanding. 
But yes , I would visit the place again for trying out the main course dishes!

Location- Just next to Sombhunath Pandit Hospital. This is a lack lustre eatery which can hardly sit 8 to 10 ppl. Thus having yr food in yr parked car is the best option.
Food-This place is an absolute must visit for any momo lover. Their pork momo is out of the world so are their pan fried momo. the chilli garlic sauce compliments the momo brilliantly.
The thukpas are also very filling and stuffed with veggies and meat.
For a day forget about fine dinind ever hygiene and indulge into fingerlicking food.

Located near to the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station on one side, and Forum mall on the other side, this is a frequent hangout for the shoppers, students, and office going crowd. This place is known for its Momos, though I feel, that quality has suffered a lot over the years. The consistency is missing. To keep the craze of its formative years, Hamro needs to up its ante!

The momos here are really special indeed. Whenever I think of this place the first thing which strikes my mind is their momos. The momos are big juicy with good amount of filling in it. Its more than often i visit this place to have some quick bite of momo. To be honest there are lots of places which doesn't have space but one thing which they should look after is the cleanliness. This is one thing that they lacks in. There have been lots of complain regarding their hygiene.

How to Locate?
Very near to Rabindra Sadan Metro Gate No.4. Just beside Momo Plaza or few steps away from Brand Factory in Elgin. Its quite easy to find.

What to Order?
These are the recommended items you can have over here:
*** Chicken Steam Momo : This is what they are famous for. Soft, juicy and awesome. The filling inside is just delicious. The chicken clear stalk which they give alongside adds some points as well.

***Mixed Noodles : The noodles here is quite well made with good amount chicken, prawn, egg and pork. The noodles deserves a thumbs up.

***Chilly Pork (Dry) : The Chilly Pork is spicy as hell. Its hot, its spicy and a perfect recipe to make you love pork more and more.

***Mixed Fried Rice: This didn't make much impact. I was not much impressed with the mixed fried rice. Can try somewhere else.

LAST WORDS:
This is a place just to have a quick bite and move on. Not cozy and definitely a place to hangout. But this place can give u some awesome Tibetan food for sure. But if you want good ambience this is not your place. The staffs and owner should look after the cleanliness. 
So just go and have some Momo.

3/5 is what i would give to t

Why is their kitchen so dirty ? Anyone who has a glance at where the momos are made wouldn't want to have them again. But since this is such an old joint, people do come in their cars to have their momos but if you have to sit inside and have the same, I bet you wouldn't be able to stand the place as you can see cockroaches roaming around. Really need to work on their hygiene and cleanliness.

Just back from a nice dinner at Hamro Momo. It is located between Brand Factory and Momo Plaza.
The ambience is not much to go by, a tiny room with wooden benches and table fans attached above, but the food more than makes up for it.
We ordered a chicken steamed momo, chicken pan fried momo, pork pan fried momo, chicken thukpa,mixed hakka noodles, garlic prawn and thai pork.
The momos were too good, not oily or greasy and served with a refreshing chicken broth flavoured with spring onions. The thukpa was also a huge bowl full of broth, noodles, vegetables and chicken.
One plate of hakka noodles is enough to be split by two people and it was full of prawn, pork, chicken and egg. The Thai pork too was full of lean pork shanks in a gravy full of crunchy vegetables, the garlic prawn was a bit of a let down as the prawn balls had a cold and uncooked centre, but the gravy was a winner here too.
What I loved most about this place was that the food had a very subtle, smoky flavour to it which was quite interesting and appetizing as well.
This meal, shared among 7 of us came to a total of 800 odd rupees which is absolute value for money. 
It's just the ambience and the prawns which made me deduct a few points.

on being suggested by my father, this place was in my wishlist for a long time. so, one fine winter afternoon, my friend and food partner Antara decided to hog in. actually we were starving so place a quick and simple order- chicken steamed momo and chicken thuppa. it arrived within 5 mins.
now the food, the momo was amazing! thuppa was good but it lacked salt. food was indeed value for money.
ambience: okay for hangouts with friends.
service: good
overall experience was nice. a bowl of thuppa is enough for two hungry souls.

This place is located right beside Momo Plaza , on the opposite flank of chai break , near rabindra sadan metro station . The restaurant is as tiny as it gets , and has three tables with benches for seating and you might have to wait your turn before you get to sit . However , once you enter , do not be fooled by the exterior as the food here is absolutely value for money and very tasty ! The pork here is popular among the regulars , and the food is made in a very narrow elongated kitchen to the right of the restaurant. The pork pan fried momo has five large pieces of Momo cooked in a delicious sauce ,though not as good as the ones served at Blue Poppy , is a filling meal in itself and tastes great . They also serve a delightful bowl of soup with it, which I've never seen being served with pan fried momo . The chicken steamed Momo similarly tastes good. The Thai pork is served in a gravy that has an abundance of capsicum and onions , and is slightly hot but not as hot and spicy as you would expect it to be . The garlic pork , in the other hand , tasted totally delicious and had little pieces of fatty pork in a hot and sweet sauce . Between the Thai pork and garlic pork, I'd prefer the Garlic pork! The pork hakka chow mein was also very good to taste , and had ample pieces of pork in it , and one plate could be shared between two comfortably . The service might be a tad slow , but the food is always piping hot ! Overall , the restaurant is much cheaper and filling when compared to its next door neighbour (Momo Plaza) , and the price- to- taste ratio should give it's neighbour a run for its money !

As the Tibetan Delight was crowded, I checked into this small restaurant by the hospital road (near Rabindra Sadan metro exit) for the first time. The momos, both pork and chicken were really good and the size was impressive. The pork momo I tried was lightly pan fried with a bit sweet sauce with small pieces on tomatoes in it.
The dining experience here may not be pleasant as the place is clumsy. So you will see people sitting in the chairs outside and grabbing quick bites.

A very old small cheap chinese restaurant on the way to Brand Factory. Went there with a lot of hopes to get good food at a cheap rate. But was highly disappointed. The Pan Fried Momo was not that bad. But was Chicken Thupka was so bad, though it is renowned for it's thupka. The American Chopsuey and the Pork Chopsuey was no good either. Five of us costed Rs 480. Cheap enough. But not recommended at all. You will find better food at the street stalls!

Located in the extremely competetive momo area, this place has managed to make a name for itself mainly due to the reasonable menu and quantity. The quality can vary from average to decent depending on their day. 
I've had both good and bad experiences at this place since I've ordered from this place for like forever. 
Their momos are okay,not in the league of it's neighbouring eateries but very reasonably priced all the same. 
Their chicken starters are much better than the main course and I'd recommend this place for a quick take away or for times when you're broke!

Frankly speaking people in our generation learnt to eat momo from this joint.
Momos are still good with a good filling and very reasonably priced.
Sometimes have to wait for space but this can can be dealt with if you want to have something good.
Thukpas are good and light and a good meal especially in winter.
Hakka noodles is also worth trying as it is very good.
Chinese main courses are also impressive keeping in mind the type of outlet.
Though small and packed up but there is not much delay in service.

I have been coming to this small and shady outlet for a long time now. I simply love the veg steamed momos here, certainly one of the best I've had in Kolkata. Perfect size, perfectly cooked, superbly stuffed with fresh and succulent vegetables, served with a very delicious and spicy chutney. However, today the pan fried momos and babycorn were disappointing. I'd still give it a 3.5 for the love I have for their steamed momos.

Also tried the chicken fooyung where the chicken actually had a guest appearance even though the function was meant for him. Overall not a very good experience.

It's not the first time that I have visited this place, but something horrible took place which compelled me to give such a low rating.

Situated in the same lane as Chai Break and Momo plaza, hamro momo USED to provide excellent momos.

I was a big fan of this place until the last time I visited and ordered for a plate of MoMo I found a finger Nail in it. Utterly Gross. And it wasn't a tiny one. Tiny or large, but it was filthy and it made me think about the hygiene perspective. Though with all street vendors we have this hygiene issue and we knowingly consume the food, but this really made me think about such places.

Nevertheless, no matter how good Momos have been served by Hamro momo to me, but I ain't going back to this place.

Regards,
Highly Disappointed and Never-Coming-Back Customer

Had ordered Veg Seamed Momos and Chilli Garlic CHOW from this place yesterday. Those delicate dimsums from Hamro Momo won my heart. The extremely spicy sauce that came along was a perfect taste enhancer. They didn't send any soup tho. That was disappointing. :/
Talking about the Garlic Chow, it was delicious. Thick noodles, spicy and loaded with finely chopped vegetables, it was prepared just the way it is done on the streets. Loved it. 
Until now I just heard praises about this place but today I finally got to try their Momos during my study break. Absolutely praiseworthy.

The place is my personal favourite... Have been going every time possible for last 6yrs...
It's small..which is a disadvantage but momo are very tasty, even veg momo is a yum. Thupa is a thumbs up...
Price are moderate and surely has best momo in town.

What do I say??? Like my heart broke at this place..! My mom told so much about the food and how in her young days she went and ate, but the other day when we went... Oh my God, I literally hated the food! We ordered for Pork Momo and pork gravy chow... First it was sooo bland, second it was chicken not pork! I'm a regular pork eater I know how it tastes! The only "pork" thingy we found was pork fat in the gravy chow. And for the record, pork was told to us that it will be served by "slices" not "pieces". So here's my question: "WHERE THE HELL IS THE PORK?"  Leave the food! The place is so unhygienic! The tables are dirty... I peeped into the kitchen, it was a dirt mess! And moreover the hospitality was horrible. I am more than sure that I'm not going to set foot again at this place... NEVER!

I suppose to have minus . Since there is no minus , I rated it one . I went there yesterday . It was a horrible xperience . I ordered Pork Momo and Pork Gravy Chowmein . I was a regular visitor during my college days . Quality and quantity had detoriated like anything . The behaviour of the staffs was also not good. They were very much reluctant . Pork Momo tastes like Chicken Momo . In the pork gravy chowmein there were hardly any pork pieces . It was full with Pork fat . Really feeling very bad in typing this , as this joint was one of my favourite food joint of Kol .

This place is near SSKM hospital, where my wife works as a Psychologist. So, we often go there for a snack. The only thing I remember having there is the Pan Fried Chicken Momos. The sauce is tangy and hot, but not too hot as to overwhelm you. The momos are also fried properly, so they remain crunchy inspite of being doused in the sauce, and not get soggy. The size of each momo is quite big, by Calcutta standards. One plate of the Pan Fried momo was enough to satiate both of us. And the prices are dirt cheap. The place itself is small and dinghy, and will remind you of a college canteen. But the service is fast and ready. The place is also famous for its Thukpa, which I haven't had. But come this winter, I'll definitely pay another visit to Hamro momo.

If you have come to this outlet at least once then you will remember this tiny place for its spicy food over anything else. The ambiance is poor, hygine not so good and the food extremely spicy. But do try the thupkas and chicken 65 dry. The egg chowmin and hot garlic chicken are not so good but moderately priced. Overall an average outlet with some good and rest average food.

This place is just nearby my office and thus I have visited this place quite often. To be very honest, the place is really unclean and tiny. There are two small tables where only two people would sit comfortably and one large table for max 4-5 people. But such things never stopped me from having good food. I love their steamed pork momo and the pork roast. The chicken fried momo is better than the simple steamed ones. Noodles is just ordinary. If you are looking for greasy Chinese and Tibetan food then this is the place. Pocket pinch for two not more than 400 bucks.

It is a small place located just by Momo Plaza in the lane opposite Brand Factory. Seeing the place and its sitting arrangement won't impress you much but the food sure will. As the name of the place suggests you should definitely try their momos and it will surely make you pack a plate for home. The chicken steamed momos have a thin and soft covering with a delicious chicken filling in it. Even the fried chicken momos has a lovely crunch outside and a soft chicken filling inside. They serve it with some sauce and a simple but tasty clear soup. 
The place is quite reasonable for the yummy momos they serve. 
The chicken fried rice is also good and can be tried. 
If you have come in your car, they also serve you in it. 
To many the outlook of the place might not be very appealing but the food will surely change your mind about it. They sure serves great momos and is worth trying.

I tried chilly pork n roast pork..Both r just awesome! It's a bit on the spicy side..but I love pork dishes cooked like that only.The best thing is their pork is not chewy at all.They serve it nicely sliced..Some pieces containing the yummy fat.I always visit this place whenever I am in rabindra sarovar area.Price is very cheap too.

Their pork dishes!! They are one of a kind!!

The clinch is the very short space and no ac. Very humid as the kitchen is just aside the sitting arrangement.
Other than the sitting arrangements there isn't any lack at all.

Well well this is a small food joint in Elgin, next to Momo Plaza and diagonally opposite to Chai Break. Thie is a small joint and not evry happening or attracting. Rather it looks like a roadside stall and is BUT it serves one of thr best momo's in Kolkata surely. I got to know about this from Facebook in a page about best momo's in India and this SURPRISINGLY was there. It also got the best momo or something award from Burp back in 2010.

We ordered a chicken steamed momo and a deep pan fried momo and an Egg Chow. They didn't take much time there and the momo's were really good and well filled. The pan momo was just too good. Crispy, saucy, chickeny and yummy. While the soup and chow were okaish, the momo's were really good.

So if you're looking for good Tibetian stuff, do visit this place. Of course if you can ignore the exteriors and looks of it.

Me and my friend went to the place long back to grab some quick bite after shopping at the brand factory Elgin road. The place place ambience and decor can be described in two words small and dirty. There are many Chinese restaurant near this place like momo plaza and others. When we went in one person was having mixed fried rice. We had no idea what to order so we ordered steamed chicken, and pan fried momo in tossed in tangy hot garlicky sauce. The momos  had sufficient filling. Then we ordered mixed Chowmine. The Chowmine tasted normal noting exceptional. But had loads of meat, egg, and veggies. 
It's a budget place, ok for friends dine out with cheap food. However some cleanliness is required.

This famous momo joint was a let down. We ordered chicken momo, lung fung soup, chicken fung yu and pork momo. The steam momos are as dry as they can be and very dull. The stalk they gave was OK but we found a dead insect in it. The soup looked horrible but was nice to eat. The fung yu is basically an omelette with chicken and vegetables and tasted about OK. Moreover a guy sitting next to us and eating noodles also found insect in it. Serious hygiene issues. Be careful about what you are eating.

This is really good. Situated in bhawanipur and serves delicious Momo,thukpa and noodles. I tried chicken Momo,chicken thukpa and egg thukpa and each tasted absolutely delicious. It cost 70 for Momo, 80 for thukpa and 90 for noodles. Must visit for Momo and thukpa lovers. Five stars without a doubt.

The place I equate with momo. Have been coming here for about fifteen years. It's like a shack you'd find in a hill station where you can stop by and enjoy your momo. Low on comfort and frill, but high on tasty Tibetan food. They don't have chairs, it's benches with tables. 

In momos I don't remember ever having ordered anything other than steamed pork momo. Momo means pork to me, chicken momo comes when pork isn't available. Also for chicken momo there's no dearth of places, but you can't have pork momo in too many places. They serve it with red chilli sauce and clear soup. Their Chinese food is good too.

Only that you need to be patient with the service. Probably because there is only one cook who's never idle, your order will take a while to come. The pricing is perfecty reasonable. Highly recommended for momo!

Location: Near Momo Plaza; Diagonally opposite Chai Break (Elgin).

This outlet of Hamro Momo has been on my wish list for quite a long time, but, was always skeptical about visiting it due to the hygiene levels of the place.
But, today this outlet was finally visited after being persuaded by a couple of friends and an assurance that the hygiene levels had been increased.
And yes, the hygiene levels had actually increased and it looked a much neater place with a seating area for an approximate of twelve heads.
My friends ordered Steamed Momos (Chicken) whereas I being a vegetarian, stuck to Steamed Veg. Momos. :P

- Steamed Momos (Veg.) [5 pieces]
The wrap was thin and soft with a flavorful filling inside. But, I missed the steaming hot feel and the accompanying clear soup.

- Steamed Momos (Chicken) [5 pieces]
Was served with a clear soup (non-veg) & as per my friends, they loved the preparation of both the momos and soup. But, complained of the momos not being steaming hot.

- The Momo sauce was spicy and complimented well. Was decent, have had better.

The polite staff served at a prompt speed.
Prices were found to be pocket-friendly.

Overall an average experience.

One of the best places for momo..don't look for the ambience but the taste is just awesome. The smallest joint in this momopara but both the steamed & pan fried version of chicken & pork momo will blow you of your feet..always drop in whenever m there in the locality

This tibetan food outlet serves the best momos in town. If ur looking for a decor and hygiene,then this is not the place for you. Hamro has been serving delicious food for more than 30 years now. Also it does not burn a hole in your pocket! A must try would be Mixed Thukpa, Chicken Steamed Momo, Pork Panfried Momo and my all time favourite,Pork Roast! It's better if you have your food in your car than sitting inside.

The momos are delicious— hot, spicy and cooked perfectly! If you like momos from blue poppy you'll probably love these too.
The fried rice is also delicious. Combined with the momos, the meal is taken to a next level.

Ordered chicken steam momo, chicken veg mushroom soup and pan fried steam momo. The soup was very delicious! Finely boiled & the broth was tasty! Pan fried was not so good, momo was only sauted in tomato sauce only! No extra taste. Momo just ok type! Not at all good ambience and interior!

I had visited here with my best friend a long time ago(2yrs i think) after he found this place via zomato. We both are big momo lovers & we both like to discover new places to eat out & hence our culinary adventure had brought us to this place :)

Its a very small cramped food joint located on the route towards brand factory or beside momo plaza to be precise!! The place is able to accomodate 10 people at max..

We had ordered just 2 plates of steamed momo.. Upon eating the 1st piece we were taken to some culinary wonderland *Ahhhh*.. Soft & tender pieces of momo literally swept our taste buds to another level :3. The soup was equally very tasty & often we see that the soup doesn't compliment with tasty momos of some other places but here it was an exception!! The prices are very affordable & pocket friendly & is a huge hit among the younger group of people & also the locals there

A huge thumbs up :D <3

Small place. Very few tables. BUT the most awesome noodles ever in Bengal! and when I say that I mean, if you want some REAL street food- flavored-rich in oil and spices-and lip smacking 'chowmein'-then Hamro is definitely your place! They are quite generous in serving good amount of food and when you order anything in chicken, you do get chicken only and not just crap! Delicious, genuine, satisfying and pocket friendly, Hamro is a must-visit for allll those who disregard ambience and concentrate on food only! Happy Eating!P.S. Their momos, thukpas and chicken delicacies are equally delectable!

The best momos, thukpa and gravy chow in a crowd of Tibetian eating joints, Hamro Momo serves up a good range of Tibetian-Chinese food. Food is pocket-friendly & portion sizes are also good.
The only drawback this place has is the size & appearance of the outlet, which resembles a shabby shack with seating for 16 in a tight squeeze. If the looks of the shop puts you off, suggest take-away...

It's the best place I know to fulfil your momo craving.
All the preparations of momos - steamed momo, fried momo and pan fried momo will exceed your expectations.
Do try the other Chinese offerings - the Hakka noodles, the chilly chicken, fried rice etc. 
one of the musts to eat in Calcutta for sure!

I was pleasantly surprised to see this restaurant featured here. Having literally grown up having their mixed chowmein and chilly chicken, this place holds a very special place in my heart. And I might be slightly biased here, but these guys make the best Chinese in the whole of Kolkata. 

If you are looking for fancy interiors, then this is not the place for you. A shabby little eatery on the side of the road, this shop gets no marks in the looks department.  In fact, one will hardly find any customer inside. But try out their chicken momo or prawn fried rice, and you'll know that you are in the right place. As for the price - you'll actually feel guilty that you are paying less. 

It has been ages since I last had food from here. I do sincerely hope that it has retained all its old-world charm.

This place was good enough a few years back but now it is lossing its reputation. The soup is like any other ordinary soup and the chowmine tastes worse than any chowmine wala selling chow on footpath. Chilli chicken is too bad, no taste at all. Better go to dicky's at harish mukherjee road.

This is a first time for me as I am live blogging. HAMRO MOMO...is a known name to all mortals who immortalise momo.... It has a record and is for serving near to 1000 plates of momo a day and is studied in b schools as a case study. A small joint near exide this humble joint offers piping hot modestly flavoured momos which are huge in size and appearance. But the filling is not that handsome in quantity. Decent momo but not amongst the best in taste

Hamro is just beside Orchid. Forget all aspects related to hygiene if you wish to try the momos here. Go for the steamed chicken momos or the steamed pork momos. I personally am not a fan of fried momos at all. Its nothing exceptional but its been there for a long time now and somehow one associates Hamro with one of the best Momo joints of the city. Whenever I'm craving momos its wither Tibetan momo or Orchid or Hamro. Since its piping hot and steamed and pretty much sufficient filling, not a very thick flour coating, it pretty much serves as a decent snack. They should really do something about the hygiene issues though. Making it slightly more visually appealing, cleaner will go miles in drawing more customers.

The comfort of the steaming hot bowl of thukpa of this tiny joint is something which is not easily forgotten. Light, hearty and delicious, no one knows this Tibetian delicacy better than Hamro. Add to that their steamed and pan fried chicken or pork momos, nothing beats this original king of momos, to be taken with a pinch of nostalgia.

People argue but I have a belief that you get the best momos of Kolkata in Hamro.
I just love it.
Chicken Steam Momo, the authentic one is better than the ones you get in other joints. Pork Momos are damn good! Better than chicken, in my opinion. But the best momo dish is Pan Fried Momos.... Remember, not fried momos... Pan-fried momos.... There's a huge difference between the two.. You will fall in love with the dish..
And yes they claim to be better in Thukpas than in Momos... I love both...
I will just suggest that if you are a Pork-eater then it's better that you order for a Pork Momo or a Pork Thukpa... Somehow I feel that it's better than the chicken ones. 
Do visit the sexiest momo joint of Kolkata.. :)

Hamro may not look like a great place to eat but once you enter and sit inside the smell of food will remind of the flavours of tibetian food. This is probably one of the best places anyone should try if you want to eat tibetian food. The appearance may put off one's appetite but the quality of food is absolutely fantastic. The pan fried momo, steamed momo and the best of all thukpa all taste brilliant. Out of all the outlets in area I would recommend hamro as it is good in both quality and quantity

It has even won the " best momo of kolkata " award so give it a try. The taste is so good that you will promise yourself to go back again.

I was always more attracted to the little red grilled joint rather than the very small joint that stands three or four shops away from Momo plaza. It might not appear very striking to anybody as it is very easy to overlook this place, like I did too, but S introduced me to this place.

As S knew that gluttony was one of the seven sins that is proudly into me and also that I absolutely love momos, he decided to introduce me to this small little joint. He asked me to accompany him to this place and letting him know about the momos in this place. That was my only visit to that place. The place is very small with few red tables and quintessential bottles of sauce lying in one corner of the table. We reached there and I glided into the joint and seated myself. We ordered two plates of chicken steamed momo and waited for our order to come. It was not long enough when we were served with the momos that was oh-so-delectable to S. The momos were big in size and looked good(though all momos does that) I took one bite and was quite happy with the quality. Not that I was overflowing with happiness and wanted to declare my love for this place immediately, but a momo lover's happiness in having good and tasty momo was evident. 

Hamro momo is not a very flashy place, especially with so many flashy places in that area, but I enjoyed the momo. Though, I would not be particularly tip-toe around like a ballerina to reach this place, I would not be disheartened too if someone wants to come here for a chitchat and few bites of good momo.

I have for long visited places around this small outlet located on Suburban Hospital Rd, probably put off by its none too clean appearance and its location right adjacent to a hospital... but having heard much about it, four of us trooped in for lunch one day.

Unfortunately momos were not yet available. We were the first customers (at almost 1 pm). We settled for chicken fried rice and chilli chicken. The rice was very nicely done, and flavourful. The chilli chicken I was wary of, and it did not taste that great. We had Thums Up with it (they handed us a large bottle)

All in all "paisa vasool". You get what you pay for. I am sure the momos, if available at that point, would have made our experience more pleasant. So yes, it remains on the list to try out.

Hamro momo is a small little joint in thr momo para. Its just beside momo plaza on the same foot. A small joint which you are likely to overlook. Very congested and too less spacious.  But what is good and happening is the food. No a.c but you will still feel like having the food. As the name rightly suggests. The best available food here are the momos. Be it steamed or fried or panfried. Everything is going to fill your taste buds with a new feeling. What I like tasting here is the sumptous pork momos. The awesome soup that tastes heaven. Also the chilli chicken dry that they prepare is really nice. The gravy chowmein tastes excellent.  But the momos are so delicious that it will make you forget there is no a.c in this joint. Also if u r too hygiene conscious its better to get the momos parcelled. Please do visit.

A small little joint in the heart of the city (Forum). The ambiance is quite poor, but the food is superb. Pork momos are one of the finest in Kolkata. I was highly impressed with Roasted pork too.After the first visit, I cannot stop myself from going again and again.  So yum yum !! Its for those who are only bothered about the food and not the over all ambiance !! Highly recommended !!

Small. Dirty, filthy and if you want a morsel down the throat suggest not peeking through the curtains, the kitchen might just take your appetite away.

But till date,  it cooks up the best plate of momos and the thukpa is not too bad at all. The latter at rare times can taste a little floury though. However their Indian Chinese is quite average. 

The place has its regular loyalists and visited by many for its
sheer legacy.

Eating out lesson : If a Restaurant has a name coupled with the name of a food, don't make the mistake of ordering anything other than that particular item while in that restaurant. 

I made a grave mistake in not heeding this particular lesson while at Hamro Momo recently. And for that I have suffered. Hamro Momo is situated on the Suburban Hospital Road or the road which heads from the southern outlets of Rabindra Sadan metro station to Forum Mall. It's on your right a small distance ahead as you enter from the main Jawaharlal Nehru road end. It's a small food joint sharing a wall with the Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. 

It feels like one of those places which has extended itself to become a restaurant from a small food stall. The place is small with the 3 tables inside holding a maximum of 8 people. The brightly coloured walls and backlights under the false ceiling lend an air of comical overindulgence. Especially when coupled with the fact that the place is not essentially clean. Service is fast though, with a lone server. The menu is average, offering a slew of standard Chinese and Tibetan fare at nominal prices. The Momo section is quite large.

Then comes the tricky part. We had the pork Chowmein. The finely chopped vegetables, over oiled glistening noodles and dark, spicy meat looked like the typical pork fare from any  small chinese eatery. Except for the fact that it did not taste like Pork. It may as well have been diced bits of Chicken we were munching on. The portion was also not satisfying. To say it in another way, the food was tasteless. The fact that they did not charge any form of Service tax or VAT helped spoil my mood.
The Momo's here are arguably very good, as testified by the many reviewers. I'm sorry I didn't order them. :( Ergo, the lesson at the top.

Chakraborty Tips :  There's a number of establishment's at the start of the road, all of which are popular, easy on the pocket and serve good food. So, option wise, your hands are not tied. Without sounding too critical, I'd say that it's obvious that they've ridden on the popularity of these larger, pedigreed establishments to make a name for themselves.

I just went there to fetch my dinner for a night duty and I was determined about the dish I was going to order, the Singapore noodles. So, it happened like I went there by foot and placed my order. The cooks was obviously busy with previous orders but the manager intervened and said, " I guess a person is waiting here for his dinner on foot, please process his order first" (the other people were either waiting in their ac cars or were seated). I liked this mentality but as I told in my other reviews that I will solely concentrate on the food but this novelty was worth mentioning.
The food was pretty good. Although when I got scope to consume it, it went cold. But still it was tasty. The veggies reserved their own taste (most of the outlets overfry them which makes the flavor bland), the noodles were perfectly boiled. all in all inspite of being cold (which is not the restaurants fault) I enjoyed the dinner. Definitely looking forward to revisit it.

Since I always give special importance to issues of cleanliness, behaviour and hospitality of a restaurant, Hamro Momo's ratings have suffered due to that. Although the place is very crammed up and shabby, with little to no maintenance, their Momo is absolutely mouth watering. Hamro Momo is always full during the peak hours due to it tasty fares (They let you sit on a bench outside as you wait). The kitchen is to your right, as you enter. Never ever look that way. If you do, your appetite will die. The utensils are also not very clean and most of the times they are greasy. So go to Hamro Momo if you do not have a problem with the above mentioned factors. Otherwise, the food is great.

Whenever I had a momo craving I would go for Tibetan Delight..sometimes Momo Plaza..tried this only in the recent times and found it  superb.
While they have earned accolades for the thupka, it might not suit everyone. The broth is lighter  compared to Blue Poppy's and they only serve with flat rice noodles-no option of  pull noodles, so that's a limitation.The momos have a generous amount of stuffing,is a bit thick skinned and the edges tend to dry up, other than that its good.Coming to my most loved dish over here- Roast pork--excellent marination, tangy, spicy juicy with the crunch of small onions, in general i leave out the soft fat but when it comes to this dish I give that rule a miss.Do give it a try if you love Pork.  l quite like the other pork dishes  , esp the garlic ones. I confess, my love for pork has forbidden me from trying out anything from the chicken selection, I will try someday, perhaps.
Word from the wise, please don't venture out thinking its a well-maintained, sparkling hygienic restaurant..
Its a incy wincy small eatery with three tables and  just enough space for a counter ; the smell from the kitchens, the sizzle and the clatter make up for the ambience..they have also managed to put up two tvs and keep Nat geo or sports running (Phew! for that) , the service is prompt and you find the patrons shouting  out the to the lone server Raju da, 'ekta steamed chicken' , 'ektu kom spicy banio' -so I guess that sums up the place :  a tiny informal joint serving good food.

Being a very small outlet beside momo plaza near elgin road, it tends to get overshadowed by the latter but place serves some top notch momos, one of my favorites in the city !!

The eatery is very small with a capacity of 8-10 people inside which feels very stuffy especially without an ac. They place some plastic chairs outside for college groups but that does not work well either. The best part is that they serve you in the car which is how i prefer beside a quick takeaway. Honestly, hygeine was the main reason for me not being a frequent visitor here but in recent times, i feel cleanliness has improved. 

Coming to food, i love their basic steamed momos that are real value for money with an amazing taste. The ingredients are fresh and of good quality. The size of the momos are big  and texture is soft inspite of a thick skin. Thukpas are claimed to be a speciality but i find it decent, nothing spectacular. Momos here is a must try !!!

Feels like sitting inside a pressure cooker. While sitting..comes the smell of urea/ ammonia from the bathroom. As if not cleaned for months. The ambiance is pathetic. Too small to be visited with a group f friends. Food quality is satisfactory. I doubt if i would visit this place again. Visit momo plaza a few yards ahead/before. Its a lot better. This shop(hamro) is good for take away, or have it standing outside. Its dirty,even the shop name board is!
DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW, I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT.

I have been to this place countless times since it is near my college! And that the food is good at really modest prices, helps too! From outside this place doesnt seem very inviting being a very small place with the obvious air of being a little unclean but I still keep going back there for simple love of tasty food! But for people to whom ambience and cleanliness is of utmost importance, they should simply stay away from this place! Take away and eating in car is a good option though! Every time I go back there, a must order thing for me is their deep pan fried pork momo which is both very tasty as well as hunger satieting at very low price and the clear soup they provide with it adds to the taste! I have tried both the deep pan fried and the normal pan fried momos in the chicken and pork variant, also the chicken thukpa, american and chinese chopsuey, pork fu-young, chilli baby corn, chilli pepper chicken, hong kong chicken and roast pork! Among all my tried items here, only the chilli baby corn and the chilli pepper chicken were the things with which I had some complaints cause they werent really to my taste! So ambience and cleanliness factor apart, this place is a definite go for me and I will keep going back here no matter what!

Hamro Momo , is a very small momo joint opposite to Chai Break . The seating area is very small and looks like a bathroom. It feels uncomfortable inside and the smell also kills you. Its a good place if you prefer eating in your car.
Steamed Momos are the momos to be had here . Veg steamed momos are served with sauce without soup.
Sauce is spicy , though could have been spicier . 
Momo layers are thick and filling , though i preffer thinner layers , like the one available in Blue Poppy.
Pan fried momos have an overdose of Tomato Kechup and sliced onions . They are edible but not something you would crave for.
This place is pocket friendly , I think they even get cold drinks from outside .
Good if you just want to eat something , not for the tastebuds !

Hamro Momo

Decor -  A very small, hot place where it gets uncomfortable to sit after some time. A better way to eat when you come here is in your car. The service is quick and the servers ok. They can be a little snobbish at times.

Food - I really like the chicken momos here. They are big and have lots of chicken. The spicy sauce to accompany is also to my liking and blends perfectly with the momos in my opinion. A nice way to eat the chicken momos is to pour a little of the broth provided with them on it and then put chilli paste on it. The thukpa is decent. I noticed a wall mount which said that Hamro Momo had received the award for best Thukpa so wanted to try it. The thukpa was ok, its soup could have done with a bit more flavour and much more vegetables.

Opinion - Go here for the chicken momos and try to eat in your car to have a more comfortable experience.

Hamro momo- Kosto raamro momo  :-) Been there quite a few years back with a friend, and the succulent and yummy taste of the steamed pork momos still lingers on in my tastebuds. The delectable momos (fried or steamed) are worth dying for which are served with spicy and very tasty chutney/sauce. We also had pork thukpa and chilli pepper chicken, which were pretty decent. Being from Shillong, I love chinese and must admit that my sense of taste is pretty refined too! So hamro momo would be my reco as one of the best momo joints in town serving succulent and authentic momos that you'll ever have. Don't miss it if you are a chinese or more particularly a momos fanatic!!!

Hamro Momo has been an integral part of our lives since school/ college days. When we never used to care about anything else apart from the food. This is one of those places where you can have a quick bite at a very reasonable price. 

Situated near Elgin Road, the lane opposite to PC Chandra which leads to Brand Factory, Hamro Momo serves Tibetan and Chinese at a very affordable price. The momos are always fresh and filling. I personally love the steamed chicken momo. Never tried Pork momo, so cannot comment. Fried Momo is also okay but I always prefer the steamed variant. Their Chinese items taste a little less spicy and have this cooked at home feel which is unusually tasty to my taste buds. Most of my friends dont like it, but I keep going back for that taste. My personal favourites are the Pepper Chicken and Chilli Chicken. 

Please do not expect any fine dining experience here. It is a small shop capable of seating 8-10 people. The interiors are dirty and looks unhygienic, but we never used to care about it during our school or college days ! 

A plate of Chicken Steamed Momo costs Rs 60. Chilli Chicken is priced at Rs 100. So a good meal for 2 should not be more than Rs. 350 including taxes. This place is fit if you want to take away or sit in the car. You can check out Hamro Momo if you are near Elgin road, but definitely not to be missed.

one of the go-to places during college days. Cheap momo's and chinese food served up really quick. Did not really care about the look and feel of the place - the food was good and cheap. Reallly all that we cared for.

Pork momo's are the best of the lot, you can try some other items if you fancy, however, my tip would be to stick to Momo's :)

Although this place is unhygienic, If you don't mind standing on the road or sitting in your car, This place serves excellent momos. I really doubt that they have separate cooking utensils for vegetarian and non vegetarians though and also if the kitchen is clean. The steamed momos are exceptional and so are the pan fried momos  (if you do not like spicy food ,don't opt for the pan friend kind).Good place to go to on a tight budget especially when the weather is good.

Hamro momo is a really small n shady place n is very conviniently located. Their pork momos have been my favourite for quite a few years. But off late i found their quality very disturbing. Its not up to the mark anymore. The fried momos are too oily n the mixed fried rice i had ordered last time was stale. The prawns had a pungent taste. Also the place is very unhygenic n tables have to shared with strangers which is a little disturbing at times.

Hamro Momo is a small food joint that offers Chinese and Tibetan food. The place is unhygenic as well as the food is not so tasty. I had Thukpa, it tasted really bland with no masala and it was really bad.

Pros:
1. The rates are really very cheap. Thats the main reason its one of the favourite places for the student groups.

Cons:
1. The place is really small for dine-in. So there is no proper sitting arrangement.
2. The place is very unhygenic. The tables are really dirty and the water they serve is not good.
3. The Chinese food is much over hyped.

If you are looking for good Chinese or Tibetan food at cheap rates, please seek another alternative.
This place is a strict NO from my side.

If hygiene and ambiance is your first priority then stay away. 
However coming to the food, I'm not so fond of the momos they serve, maybe because i'm a vegeterian.. However, my friends swear by the chicken momo.
Coming to the chinese, it IS amazing!
The gravy chowmein is one of the best I've ever tasted.
The fried rice I'd ordered once for a take away hardly had any vegetables :/
The baby corn was tasty too, just too sweet for my palate.

However, I've one complain from this place, the location and the interiors cannot be helped maybe, but atleast they can clean the tables and good water can be served, right?

heard a lot of this place and went to check it out..
ordered basic steamed chicken and pork momos
well..what to say?
people generally say good things about this place but i found the momo crusting a little rubbery and hard..
and the soup was dull.it wasnt lip smacking.. and they dont provide any momo special sauce like other places do! 
now i dont know this is their regular drawback or it was just for today...

Foodies die for food and not for surroundings...Though it is a cramped place but people do have their food in their cars like the dhaba type...the place is very small but it is not unhygienic....if ambiance does matter then this is not the place to sit and have...parcel or having the food in the car relaxing would be a better option....momos are quite big in size and filling is very good....
My favorite dish is the pork-foo-young which is my sure try whenever I visit this place...Burp rated its thukpa to be the best thukpa in kolkata and surely it is...It is a pocket friendly place and the service is also quite prompt...

My favorite place in kolkata for having steamed pork momo and roasted pork. I am a regular there for more than a decade now. 
Positives:
1. They specialize on momo, its real good. Among top 3 momo joint in the city.
2. Pork dishes are equally good, my favorite is roasted pork.
3. Their thukpa is also bery nice.
4. Prices are really pocket firendly, meal for 2 will cost you around 300-350.
5. Location, very near to exide xing and forum.

Negatives:
1. It's a road side joint. Do not expect fancy decor. It's very basic.
2. Extremly  unhygienic. My suggestion, like most of us do, order from your car. They will serve in the car.
3. Avoid ordering Chinese dishes like rice or noodles.

If you like Pork Fried Momo's do give Hamro Momo a try ..... but if you can't handle unhygienic places then please skip this place. I make sure I am served in the car .... good  chicken fried momo as well and I like the sauce they serve with their momo's. Their Chilli Pepper Chicken or Pork as well as Dry Chicken 65 are not bad. I personally usually head there in the winters so as to avoid any infections because the hygiene is quite poor. Avoid the Thukpa though, I have tried it on two separate occasions but did not enjoy the flavours and taste at all.

i really love the momos and thuppa here it reminds me of kalimpong. the sauces served is also superb especially the red chillie paste sauce. it may look spicy but in reality it is sweetish in taste. i wont recommend you the chinese its terrible. of course health and hygience factors are important too and the space needs to be spruced up. but its packed all the time. the pork momos are the best here and so are the fried momos.

A friend and I dropped in Hamro momo a few days back and ordered the pan fried momo, chicken sixtyfive, and steamed momo. it was a hot day, and there was a couple of people loitering about. However, our order came in quite fast and the meal was not bad at all. We were disappointed by the tasteless broth that came with the momos, but the spicy chicken 65 was good.

Our bill was very reasonable, and I can safely say that for chicken items, they do not scrimp on the meal. the sauce that came with the momos were nice too, so good value for money if you ignore the less-than-nice ambiance.

TASTY FOOD IN UNHYGIENIC SURROUNDINGS!
1.5 out of 5

Hamro Momo is a small food joint that serves tasty Chinese food in unhealthy surroundings. The ambience and surroundings are poor and ordinary to say the least. The price is what makes this joint a much favored place in spite of the unhygienic tag associated with this place. 

The place is too small for a dine in, and hygiene being an important issue, it is best to eat in the comfort of your home. Despite this, the place is always packed with people especially the student crowd.  In spite of the apparent and most significant negative, the place is a popular food joint for its cheap fare.

The place is frequented by regulars and newcomers for its scrumptious momos. Whether the momos are steamed, fried or pan-fried, they are always juicy and tasty and meaty as well. Though they serve pork momos and pork dishes, (one assumes they use good quality pork); this meat item should be had with a measure of caution. Some of their popular and fast moving items are chilli baby corn, chilli chicken, chilli pepper chicken and chilli Manchurian. All of the items mentioned in the menu are generally available. Though they serve thukpa dishes as well; their thukpa dishes can be a letdown on off days when you decide to try them. I remember this one instance when the soup tasted more bland than usual. Their fried rice and noodle preparations are well made without being too greasy or heavy for everyday consumption.

If you do muster up the courage to have food there, you should avoid looking at the kitchen as the sight of the open drain in it might just ruin your appetite. This place is best suited for the brave who can stomach their kind of cooking.

Ambiance is not impressive.

I tried thukpa without pork. It is just plane noodle soup topped up with spring onion shreds. Tasted bland like water without any masala. 

May be Tibetans prefer boiled noodles in clear water. But I did not like it. 
After all, I am a bong.

chicken pan fried momo should be on everybody's list if you want to eat at hamro momo. the pork version is good too and they use good quality pork. the momos tasted quite rich in taste and was hot and spicy. located off the main road, so parking is not an issue. you can wait with your car parked and then take delivery and drive away. their packaging is good too to keep the food warm till you reach home. overall, it's a nice food joint and i would recommend it to all momo lovers of kolkata.

A good, small chinese eatery near Suburban Hospital...The momos are the best...the chilly baby corn was well made too. Staff is polite, ambience is good and prices are affordable. The Chilly pepper chicken is very tasty and so was the chicken manchurian. Mixed fried rice was good and chilly chicken was okay,,,did not like it much...

small little place, but always packed. very popular with the student crowd. 
did quite liked the thukpa but the fried momos were decent. the momo dipping sacue is good. 

place is very unhygienic, but its a roadside place so if ur expecting hygiene then ur expecting too much . do try the lemon chicken and the chicken65 both r quite innovative ( they dont taste either chinese or tibetan) but they taste nice. 

perefer to pack and eat than dine in... as not sure how clean the plates r ..

hamro is an extremely popular eatery in south kolkata .. and people and food taste doesn't change here.. like a 10 seater place hamro has been a wonderful place to chomp in great pan fried momos and always has been pocket friendly for all people .. decent Chinese and overall a nice place.. scores very high on being unhygienic and the kitchen can be seen from outside the place so if you want your taste buds to be happy.. forget about the hygiene and enjoy a sumptuous meal there ! 
overall would rate it as 2

Humro  is a very old  joint  serving  tibetan  spreads , but  it  is more  of  a  take away  joint  rather  than  a dine in  place  , but to mind the place is real  dirty ....  infact filthy is the word  ...  ONLY  for  TAKE  AWAY  ....  don't  try  to  go  there  for  lunch  or  dinner with  family  ...  the  place  is  really  cramped ..... try out thukpa & steamed momo  but  even the sauces  there  are  dirty  &  used  by  other  diners.....  that's what irritates  me most about this place  ... &  yes  Beware  of  the  pork  dishes  out  there.....  don't  try  them

Cost for 2 Rs300 without Alcohol ??? Hamro Momo never served Alcohol. A meal for 2 will not cost you more than Rs150. Come here for the Momo's( Steamed/ Fried/ Pan Fried) and Thupka's! Don't forget the red chilli sauce. Please Please Please never take a peak behind the curtain and peer into the kitchen..the open drain amongst other sights might tempt you never to come back! Your best bet is to take away or eat on the bonnet of your car as seating capacity is limited and more often then not, you'll be sharing your table with a stranger.
