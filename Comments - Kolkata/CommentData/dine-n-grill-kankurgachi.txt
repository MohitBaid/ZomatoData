Visited the place for the first time. Its a small restaurant with a good ambience. 
They serves good food and have pocket friendly prices. 
Staffs were very welcoming and humble. 
A foodie who loves to discover new places must visit.

Giving a very late review... Visited this place last month,but couldn't get the chance to write a review. 
So,here it is.
This restaurant is new in the phoolbagan area. Located just beside Akash institute, phoolbagan.
Small space,but nicely decorated.
They serve both north Indian and Asian cuisine. But unfortunately the day we went there, they weren't serving Indian dishes due to some problems. So we ordered from the Chinese section.
We ordered- crispy chilli baby corn for starters,it was really good. Then for the main course we had chicken fried rice, honey pepper chicken and chilli mushroom.
The honey pepper chicken was too sweet for my liking. The mushrooms weren't properly cooked. 
Would like to give this restaurant another try to taste their tandoor dishes.

If you want to have the worst biriyani in the world literally you should definitely try this place out. We went there on saptami afternoon and ordered for reshmi kabab .After made us sit for like 30 minutes they informed us that no starters will be available from indian menu. Having no other choice we had to go for mutton biriyani..We ordered 3 for 4 people and a butter chicken.and it turned out to be a disaster. Mutton was smelly like it was smelling like some rotten meat.after complaining they told us confidently that this is how their biriyani tastes and people hadn't complained about it before. And their pathetic service..Omg. really ruined our lunch.

This is the most disgusting restaurant I have ever been, first of all more than half of dishes ain't available. So we couldn't order starters.
We ordered mutton biryani which was horrible. The quality of meat was terrible. It was smelling  shit. I would suggest you not to visit this place .

Disappointed.  Will be my review in one word. Went for lunch at around 3 in the afternoon but to our surprise we had very less variety to choose from. Firstly we ordered baby chilli corn which was not available,  then we shifted to mushroom which was also not available and ultimately they made us settle for gobi manchurian. I mean that's not how you run a restaurant. Moving on we ordered 3 kulchas at first.  Later when we asked for two more additional kulchas they simply denied and made us sit with rotis.alrhough the food was really tasty but the service let their rating down. Not looking forward to another visit.

A new restaurant in the bloc. Sumptuous meal the menu also has varieties in the dishes. Has some exotic dishes too in their menu eg squid,crabs. Looking forward to try them. Seating arrangements r spacious good ambience centrally located. Although the kebab rolls that I had ordered was on a downside. Starters dragon pepper chicken and chili corn was praiseworthy. Small place but the food won't disappoint you. Looking forward for a second visit.
