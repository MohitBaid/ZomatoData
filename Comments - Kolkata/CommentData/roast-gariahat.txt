This was previously where rubi's grill was.. probably it has been renovated and changed.. and is called roast now.
Lived the ambience of the eatery. It gave me a feel of a hillside cafe with the cozy seats, and graffiti printed walls. It has 2 seating areas.. we chose for the outdoor , and weather was sunny yet chilly hence it was amazing. 
The menu surprised me a lot, as it had a variety of uncommon items. 
We ordered a chicken steak, served along mash and buttered rice and a sunny side up.. 
And a roast pork. This was my hero dish. It had 6 pieces of roasted pork along with trimmed fat cooked in brown sauce served along mash and sauteed veggies..everything complimented each other like a jigsaw puzzle and tasted superb. 

The prices are a tinge on the upper side.. but it's worth it. Definitely gonna come back..

This one is a must try. They do organise private parties. And i had the pleasure of organising my birthday party in here. It’s perfect for upto 15-20people. They will help you with customized menu selection. The sizzling brownies are a must try. On another occasion we had ordered chicken ala kiev from here and they made sure it reached me in time and with perfect warmth so that the butter inside was still in its liquid form.

A nice place for a cozy chitchat with good food on a wintry evening. I went with some very close friends who already had experience with Roast previously. We had the Roast platter, which to my opinion was ok, considering the fact that the mashed potatoes were not upto the mark. However, I was surprised with the sauce of the roasted chicken in bacon wrap. Here also, to my opinion, as for an Indian sitting in a restaurant cafe in Kolkata, the bacon were a bit undercooked. We also had beer battered prawns. Overall experience was good, service took a bit of time though, hard to say, but I liked their sauce for every preparation I had last night! And oh!  I liked their presentation off course!!

We have been there on March to celebrate Birthday of my friend. It is in Dover Lane, the previous name was Ruby's Grill and now it known as Roast. A well-decorated Continental Restaurant.  Clam and peaceful environment. Decoration is simple but sober. Well behavioural staffs. Now come to the foods. We have ordered spiced bubbles, fruit Juice, and Virgin Mojito in braverage, Fish Finger in starter, Spaghetti Carbonara, Carabean Roast Chicken, Chicken Steak as Main Course and Blueberry Cheese cake as desert. 
Spiced Bubble is nothing just a Spiced cola. Fruit Juice was very bad as taste. The best one was Virgin Mojito. Fish Fingers were good. Spaghetti Carbonara was also good in taste. Carabean Roast Chicken came with the platter of Smashed Potato and the butter was oozing from it. Excellent test. Anther excellent dish was the Chicken steak. and the main attractiong was the sunny side up poached egg on the top of he steak.  Taste was good but in my opinion the chicken steak of the Steak Factory is better than this one. The Blue berry cheese cake was heaven. food were not bad but the cost of the food is little higher than the quality. If you like continental food you can visit the place but I like Steak Factory most.

A quiet, cozy little place which plays old favourites. Had tenderloin steak and chicken cordon bleu.  The steak was a little overdone, but tasted amazing nonetheless. The cordon bleu was perfect.

I have visited the restaurant quite a number of times and the food preparation is absolutely lip smacking they provide very fresh and good quality of fish and the meats are very tender too on the recent times it has become one of my most favourite place to order food or to go for dinner love the place and the ambience is very homely very nice and economic to go with family and friends, one of my all time favourite is their Fish florentine and salt & pepper fish even their barbecue meat pizza is equally good so overall this place is very much satisfying for the tummy and the pocket as well.

I have been there a couple of times and I gotta say the food there is pretty good. The quantity of the food is a bit less but the taste was good. The chicken wrapped in bacon tasted pretty damn good but the portions were a bit less. The pizza was a not at all good, the crust was hard and dry and the cheese wasn't really melted. On another occasion we had had Chinese which tasted good but again the portions seemed less. There ambience is not too bad and the service is very good. Still there is room for improvement.

With great expectations I had come over to this place and I must say I wasn’t happy to my heart’s content..!! A lot of people had given brilliant reviews of this place and that’s the exact reason I had decided to bring over a group of 16 people on the occasion of “Bhai Phota”
Firstly, couple of items which were there on the menu weren’t available. To mention, bacon, prawns and pork which was available just one portion. 
The tenderloin steak had been much talked about and thus, I had chosen to order the same. Well, it definitely didn’t meet my expectations. I would be giving it a 3.5/5.0. Also, another thing that I would like to add is that, their portions are quite small so you need to keep that well in mind before placing the order...!!@

Good place to hang out with friends. The decor is bright and eclectic. Courteous staff, and you can actually tailor the items a bit to suit your likings. On the negative side, a lot of items on the menu may not be available when asked for. Also they take time to prepare, so reconsider if you're in a hurry. Now on to the food. We had:
Mango Ginger Spicy Mojito  - Rich and tasty. As soon as you sip it, it'll taste simple like mango juice. Let it roll down to your throat and it'll tingle your senses with a variety of strong spices, leaving you with a gingery aftertaste when you finally swallow. A true delight.
Fresh Lime Soda  : Simple, generic thing of good quality. Nothing jaw dropping, but not disappointing in the least.
A Custom Mocktail!  : It had mango juice and honey along with cucumber. One of the waiters suggested this when we didn't seem too interested with the other options in the menu. This drink, served in a mason jar, screams "Summer!". Mildly sweet and sharply cold, a drink that satisfies but doesn't overpower
Roasted Chilli Pork: Hands down, a disappointment. Priced at 290/-, the quantity served is meagre, there's a doughy coating, and I've honestly had way better servings of this at other places and at a cheaper rate.
Grilled Chicken Salad: A proper salad. Not overflowing with mayonnaise and sauces like so many wannabe salads. Fresh veggies and properly grilled chicken, tiny oodles of cheese that surprise you by melting at the roof of your mouth. Topped with crispy white croutons. Surprisingly good.
All in all, I recommend this place for a hangout and snacks, certainly will visit again.

I visited this place during puja, which attracted the most is the decor of this joint, we were sitting  on the outer portion of the joint, which was just by the road, and some fine lighting was also there., on the wall there was graffiti of some cool stickers and posters, the lampshades were made out of the wine bottles. 
We had pork chops and roasted chicken wrapped with bacon.. well, both the dishes was delicious. The pork chops comes with some veg salad and French fries. The roasted chicken wrapped with bacon was very good. 
We had some virgin mojito, that was good as well. The service is good, food is good, and most importantly this is not at all expensive. I would definitely visit this place again.

This food joint has literally forced me to wtite back after a long time! Considering it's rating, it would be misleading for other foodies like I was. Hence, this review. 
I'm quite choosy in my pick ups & heavily depend on zomato & am often disappointed! What a let down this joint is! Nothing is good about them. 
The decor is very ordinary, keeping most of the things from the last joint which was located exactly there.
Astonishingly the food quality (I guess the reason behind the last one had to close the doors) was also same i.e very bad. Overpriced,poor quantity  & very poor food quality.
We ordered chicken wrapped in bacon with bbq sauce. There were 6 tiny pieces in the plate & the flavour of the sauce destroyed everything else!along with that we ordered virgin mojito which was good.
After that we ordered pork chops with french fries & sautéed veggies!I never had such a bad pork chops in my life!The fatty part was literally smelling,the size was also small & even the veggies they couldn't bake properly.
There was nobody in the restaurant except the 2 of us in a lonely afternoon, yet the waiter constantly gave us a feeling that we should order, eat & go asap. No sense of courtesy seemed to appear even when we insisted!I really hope this rating was applied because initially it is their acquaintances who visited & rated this place! With places like steak factory & hondo's who deliver such delicious & value for money dishes, I don't know on what basis the owners think that foodies like us would revisit this place once again!

On sashti, I visited this place with some of my friends. We had cravings for steak so ended up being here. We went there around 12:30 and the place was relatively empty. The decor was nice and I found the place to be quite spacious. We were handed the Durga Puja special menu which had very limited options and was a bit overpriced. Nevertheless we settled for bacon wrapped prawns for starters and for the main course we ordered Carribean Roast Chicken, BBQ Pork ribs and Tenderloin steak.
*Bacon wrapped prawns: soft juicy pieces of prawns wrapped in bacon. The dish was quite good and satisfied my tastebuds. It was a bit tangy which I preferred.
*BBQ Pork Ribs: The dish was a total dissapointment. Before ordering the dish we paricularly asked for lesser fat but what we got on the plate were 3 pieces of fat filled meats. Also, the sizes of those pieces differred from plate to plate. The fat content of the pieces were more than 75℅ and there was hardly any meat. Now coming to the taste, I missed the smoky flavour of BBQ sauce and it was sweet. The only thing I liked were the sauted vegetables and mashed potatoes served with the dish. Not at all recommended.
The tenderloin steak and the roasted chicken which my other friends had were good though.
Overall not a very pleasant experience. Maybe I will look out for some other places if I want to have steak.

I have dined here as well taken food away a couple of times and my observations follow.

The interiors of the restaurant is decent and the place is pretty spacious.

We ordered the below items:

Cheese Fries-Tasted very average which was essentialy French fries with shredded cheese on top.It was priced at INR 110.

Chicken Steak-It was also average in taste which also had mashed potato and sauteed vegetables.This was priced at INR 290.

Pork Chops-This also came along with mashed potato and sauteed vegetables.The fat content was pretty high though I didn't mind it as I like it that way.However,the sauce was a little too sweet for my liking.This item was priced at INR 280.

Salad-I don't remember the exact name and price of the item.However,it had chicken and cubes of vegetables in a spicy mayo dressing.

Caramel Custard-Again an average tasting desert priced at INR 130.

Please note that all prices are excluding taxes.

Today i visited this place for the first time with a few friends of mine. Since this is Durga  Puja time they have made a new "puja special menu card" ( limited number of options with enhanced prices). In the starters we had Bacon Wrapped Prawns. It was good, not very sweet and a bit tangy. Then we ordered Carabean Roast chicken, Tenderloin steak and Bbq Pork ribs which came with mashed potatoes and saute vegetables . The chicken and the tenderloin were quite decent but the Pork Ribs was just horrible. They gave 4pcs in each plate and almost 80% of which was only FAT. There was hardly any meat. I don't think that i will be visiting this again.

Went there in February for the first time. Liked the food very much. Except the fish n chips. The fish had a bad smell. The steaks were quite good. Went back again in August. The food sucked. Big time. The cordon bleu was burnt. The crust was very hard and bitter. There was no cheese. The chicken just tasted like boiled chicken. I know how a cordon bleu tastes like hence it was very disappointing. French fries were over fried. The only good thing was the Irish broth. The food also took an eternity to arrive. Totally opposite of how the earlier experience was.  After complaining to the person in-charge we got a reply. Saying, that the executive chef was on leave. Hence, this debacle. Well, that is their internal matter and for that a customer should not suffer. I don't think I would go back to this place , again.

The restaurant is tucked away in the backstreets of Gariahat.

We went there looking for Continental food, but were disappointed in finding they wouldn't offer Continental cuisine that day.😔
So in a way the reason for which we left quite a number of Chinese restaurants to go there was in vain.

We tried Chinese, along with a pork Side dish. 

The food was good, though it took some time to be served despite we being the only customers.

Ambience is good, though they seem to play the various & numerous covers of the same song over and over again.

Price is reasonable.

The chicken and the tenderloin were quite decent but the Pork Ribs was just horrible. They gave 4pcs in each plate and almost 80% of which was only FAT. There was hardly any meat. I don't think that i will be visiting this again.

Went there in February for the first time. Liked the food very much. Except the fish n chips. The fish had a bad smell. The steaks were quite good. Went back again in August. The food sucked. Big time. The cordon bleu was burnt. The crust was very hard and bitter. There was no cheese. The chicken just tasted like boiled chicken. I know how a cordon bleu tastes like hence it was very disappointing. French fries were over fried. The only good thing was the Irish broth. The food also took an eternity to arrive. Totally opposite of how the earlier experience was.  After complaining to the person in-charge we got a reply. Saying, that the executive chef was on leave. Hence, this debacle. Well, that is their internal matter and for that a customer should not suffer. I don't think I would go back to this place , again.

The restaurant is tucked away in the backstreets of Gariahat.

We went there looking for Continental food, but were disappointed in finding they wouldn't offer Continental cuisine that day.😔
So in a way the reason for which we left quite a number of Chinese restaurants to go there was in vain.

We tried Chinese, along with a pork Side dish. 

The food was good, though it took some time to be served despite we being the only customers.

Ambience is good, though they seem to play the various & numerous covers of the same song over and over again.

Price is reasonable.

The only reason this place has been given a 1 rating is because it is not possible to go below that. Given a choice, I would gave rated it -5.
And the most unfortunate part is that this rating is not even based on the food. Because the food never did arrive at the table before we had to leave. I think the only way you can hope to get your food on time here is by ordering 24-hrs in advance.
Consider the facts: we reached the restaurant at around 8:30 pm on a Saturday evening. At that hour the place was about 30% full. Our order was -
2 fresh lime sodas
Starter - Crispy Spicy Pork (or something similar)
Main Course - Chicken Cordon Bleu, Roast Platter
The fresh lime sodas arrived after 35 minutes. The Starter hadn't arrived by the time we walked out at 9:55 pm! Forget about the Main Course.
The best part is that even the check for the drinks order that we asked for about 10 minutes before walking out also did not arrive. So we just left the money on the table.
Hence, to repeat, it is a shame that a restaurant has to be reviewed not on its food but its service - or rather the lack of it.

We visited this place because it shares the same location with rubi's grill. But they changed the interior in a irrelevant way. Like some forceful renovation. The quality and quantity both couldn't satisfy us. Rubi's grill was far more better than this

I went there to have some evening snack on 21 aug 2017. Had beckon wrapped roasted chicken and chicken steak. First of all they didn't even have french fries or chicken nuggets, so nothing for my kid. Service was horrible. After the starter the main course came after 45 mins. We opted for garlic bread in place of Rice as chicken steak. Still rice was given. Food was okay though. Bad experience overall, hence wont come back again.

found a new restaurant near Gariahat, one of the shopping hub of Kolkata. the staff were very cordial. they recommended one of the best starter - roasted chicken wrapped in bacon. it was difficult for us to resist & satisfy with 1 plate of it only, so that we can dig into our main course too. the mocktails, the chicken steak & the bbq pork ribs were also awesome.
the decor can be worked upon.
hope to visit again soon.

Had Malaysian seafood noodles. It was really yummy. Ordered the monster burger, it was tasty no doubt, but not at all jumbo in size. Was looking forward to tetrazzini but was informed that pasta wasn't available that day. The good thing is that all the prices are inclusive of taxes. The decor is really nice, will advice everyone to sit outside. A word for the staff - extremely courteous and polite !!

Locating this place is a bit difficult, but not impossible with the help of google map. Visited this restro in order to celebrate raksha bandhan with my only brother. Though the decor is okayish but the seats are cozy enough. Ordered chicken clear soup, chicken steak, and caramel custard for desserts. The soup was as usual tempting to the tastebuds. While the steak was tad bit less in quantity. Yet good for a person. It consisted of a big piece of chicken breast covered in mushroom sauce with mushroom on top of it, a plate of french fries and a small portion of buttered rice. Its tasted really rumm. And at last the custard also didnt dissapoint. Hence the whole thing was quite satisfactory. Would return for more definitely. 😊

Just when I thought Rubi's Grill closed down for the worse, Roast proved me wrong. Right from the colourful menu, to the lip smacking dishes, Roast was a really good experience. The Pepperoni pizza served here is one of the best pizzas I've had in a while. "Wake me up when September ends" was being played when they served me my birthday cake. Lovely ambience.

Ordered pork belly and spaghetti with meat balls along with beef roast. The food was delicious, the meat is spot on and tender. The pork belly and spaghetti can be complimentary to each other.. Had there been a little more rice and vegetables for the beef roast it would have been good. But nevertheless the food does taste delicious !

Thumbs up - Good location, and comfortable seating

Thumbs down - Bland food, the menu reads out variety of dishes, it raises your hopes like anything but when the food is served ( after half hour. Yeah! This is how long it takes to serve you ) bam!  It's rock bottom.  I ordered for chicken steak, chicken was chewy, which is not a good sign when your majority of dishes in the menu is non veg and out of that 80 % is based out of chicken, the sauce was bland only positive thing was the mash potatoes. Then we ordered for chicken burger which was OK but not as per what the steward had told us. 

Overall it wasn't a pleasant outing the graph is just dipping day by day. Roast was earlier Rubi's grill but after its initial modification it just screwed the taste and preparation. 

Highly disappointed :(

Meeting sisters after a long is always refreshing & it all adds up when you meet over good food. Roast is one of the best restaurant where you can find mouth watering dishes with most unique menu.  They understand your starving & bring your order on your table as soon as possible. 

I was craving for pasta since long, hence ordered chicken tetrazini. It's something to die for. It did justice to my taste buds...yumiliciously good... 

Owner of this restaurant is really friendly & cordial. All I can say is keep it up man. 

This place is worth the hype. Definitely going back to try their other items. 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I have ordered the following:
1)Bacon wrapped chicken (as starter): It had a little sweet saucy(tangy) taste because of the kind of sauce they used and it was very juicy. The bacon coating was thick and kind of cheesy. I can say this plate is worth taking and delicious.
2) Chicken Cordon Bleu :There is most probably grilled chicken inside wrapped all up in cheese and coated with bread crumb.The plate is quite heavy because of all the cheese. It is cooked perfect and served with mashed potato. If u are a cheese lover , u should have it. It is very delicious.
3)Pork Pulled Burger: It disappointed me because they had also grilled the burger buns
4) Virgin Mojito: perfect 
5) Roast pork: They served it with rice and some gravy.I didn't like that.Very average.
6)Tenderloin steak : Just beautiful ! The sauce they used was delicious and the steak was soft and juicy.

This cafe is located in Singhi Park. It is a small one with a double chambered seating area. I went with a group of friends to have their specialities.
We ordered a pulled pork burger which was served with a huge burger stuffed with pork, cheese and veggies, patty and French fries. The burger is very filling and juicy as the pork melts as you take a bite. It can be shared by two. Then we ordered tenderloin steak which was served with a thick beef piece and mashed potato and veggies. The beef was juicy and very well cooked. It was served with an egg poach and the sauce was really good to taste. The juicy and tender beef stole the show. 
The price is little on the higher side but good food is always pricey. The presentation is good and the service is great. The quantity and quality is top notch. A highly recommended one from my side.

First of all i would like to clear it up that the menu card that they are showing on zomato is not the updated one. The prices have increased for most of the dishes and i request the management to display the new set of price menu on zomato. 
Starting with the interior- not bad, quite cozy and decent.  
The staff members were very cordial and i liked their service as we did not have to wait much for them to serve. 
Now coming to food, we ordered 
1) roasted prawn wrapped in bacon
2) chicken steak
3) chicken tetrazzini pasta. 
Roasted prawn was simply amazing , absolutely juicy and perfectly tossed in honey sauce. 
The chicken steak was served with rice , egg poach and boiled vegetable. It was very tasty though i somehow found the chicken to be slightly fibrous and not properly cooked. But it did not affect the whole preperation that much. 
The pasta was really a treat to the tongue. I personally felt it to be one of the best prepared pasta i have ever tasted. 
The prices are slightly high though affordable. And they include VAT and service tax.

Located conveniently on the quiet Dover Lane is this in-house diner.
If u r a movie fanatic,u will want to pay a greater attention to their walls rather than what's on ur plate.
The attention to detail is rather intricate which isnt something you would hope for in a diner of this dimension.
The tracks they play is far far better than a lot of hyped joints I have visited.

Comin to the food,
I ordered a plate of Pork Chops which was served with roasted veggies,a generous scoop of mashed potato and red wine sauce to dress the chops.
I dint like the serving in particular.
The ribs had way too much fat for my liking and was lean on the meat.
The taste though, was undeniably, sassy.

My partner got a pasta tetrazzini and it was a lip-smacker.
The portions of dishes was a little light in my opinion.

But for th ambiance and ease of access,I look forward to visitin this place a far more number of times than I have rated it.

Not very impressed. Liked the food better when it was Ruby's grill. The decor has improved through. We had ordered BBQ pork ribs and chicken sizzler. The proliferation had too much fat and no meat besides. The chicken was way too saucy and fibrous for taste. Over all, not a very pleasant experience.

We had ordered, bacon wrapped chicken and sweet chili Pork as starters., Fish Florentine as a main course, and to wash them down a virgin mojito and mango ginger cooler. For dessert, we had ordered chocolate brownie with icecream(I dont remember the exact name right now ).
Be it a date, a get together or a family night out, I feel its a great joint for all occasions. Do check them out.

My heart had broken when I found out that my favourite Ruby's Grill had shut down. However, Roast is a worthy successor. Tried their pepperoni pizza, chicken Tetrazzini and Caribbean Roast Chicken. Save the tad extra saltiness of the pizza and the overpowering taste of black pepper in the pasta, Roast is a lovely place to have continental food at. The ambience is quite pleasant and they have very courteous staff. I'm just glad I have a good continental restaurant in my neighbourhood that I can run to whenever I crave bacon and white sauce pasta!

Roast is the replacement of Rubi's Grill. On a lazy afternoon, I went alone to have roasted prawn wrapped in bacon. The place was empty except for a couple sitting at a corner. The staff was prompt and helpful. 
The bacon wrapped prawn was delicious and nicely served. I will soon be going back to try out the rest of the dishes.

Finally we decided with Roast.
The idea of this place is almost the same as that of Mio Amore - Rubi's Grill in a new package. Yet, on arriving at the spot, the exteriors and the interiors delivered on the same note in terms of appearance.

We were the first ones to appear as the place seemed pretty deserted with a waiter and a couple of others hanging around. On our arrival, they started playing some beautiful music in the background. Due to some kind of weird idea (?), they switched the television on with some '90s Bollywood movie which was somewhat funny to pair with the music.

Keeping the weird stuff aside, we ordered for a Lime Soda and Strawberry-Mint Mocktail. The Lime Soda was refreshing, which is well, nothing new in there. The Strawberry Mint Mocktail on the other hand was actually nice. It wasn't overtly flavoured with strawberry, and had a really nice balance.
We next ordered Pork Chops. The waiter offered us with the options for the sides. We agreed to Herb Rice-French Fries and Mashed Potato-Sauteed Veggies combo for the two plates of Pork Chops. However, while one of the orders was maintained, the other was compromised with Mashed Potatoes-French Fries combo. What was disappointing was, the waiter did not bother to ask us and let us reconsider our choices due to the absence of Sauteed Veggies.
Coming to the pork chops, they were really well made. The sauce/gravy was lightly spiced and garnished with basil. The meat was almost coming apart from the bone. When it comes to pork, I really think it's all about the pork fat that makes the difference. Yet, what was served was basically thick unrendered pork fat with extremely thin layer of meat. I would've really preferred the portion with an equal ratio of meat and fat.
The mashed potatoes were nice and smooth with butter and herbs. The French fries were the usual McD-KFC kind, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. According to my friend, the herb rice felt like the normal steamed rice with butter kinda thing with very negligible amount of "herb" in it.

For desserts, we were told that nothing apart from hot brownie and the usual ice cream were available. We chose hot brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. It was good with some serious issues. The spoons accompanied with the dessert were already on the surface of the hot plate, which left us with spoons that were too warm to touch by the time they reached the table, along with a layer of caramelized chocolate sauce that stuck on the surface of the spoon. The brownie was a bit disappointing as well, as it was pretty hard in its texture.

All in all, it was a tad bit over average but certainly nothing like we had expected. But we might come back to this place for the rest of the dishes.

This place used to be called Rubi's Grill and I adored that joint. They rebranded and now it is known as Roast. Located on Dover Lane the place is easy to find.Went here a week back. The place is well decorated with movie posters and even the menu has a lot of movie references which is a nice touch. The staff was welcoming and helpful.Coming to the food,  we ordered Roasted Prawn Wrapped in Bacon as a starter. The bacon was juicy and soft but the prawn itself was a little hard. The sauce it was cooked in was a little tangy but it went with the dish.For the main course, we ordered Pork Chops  and The Roast Platter. The Pork Chops were cooked in the same  sauce as the Bacon Wrapped Prawn and it didn't go too well with the dish.  The quantity was generous, but it had more fat content than meat and that is not to my liking. If one is okay with the fat content and the tangy flavor, then you should go for it.The Roast Platter on the other hand is made up of assorted meat such as chicken, sausages and lamb and also fish and prawn and is well cooked in a light mushroom sauce. The Roast Platter was a marvel and I would love to try it again.
The main course comes with sides of your choosing.
For dessert we ordered Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Hot Chocolate Sauce. The combination of the sizzling brownie along with the ice cream was a treat for a sweet tooth like me.The service was prompt. I would visit this place again to try out their burgers and pasta which I hear are to die for.

This is what used to Ruby's Grill. It's located near Hindustan Road. The place is easy to miss, but its definitely not too easy to forget. 

To start off, the inside is kinda nice, with posters of Hollywood classics adorning their walls, the music complimenting it. It's a tiny restaurant, hardly 3-4 tables in the indoor seating area. There's an outdoor part as well, which was off limits owing to the heat of an early April afternoon. 

Now coming to the food, we ordered pork ribs and a tenderloin steak, medium rare. Unlike most places, these guys get their meat perfect. The steak was beautifully done, and it retained the pinkish tenderness that you want in your medium rare, with that extremely​ slight hint of meaty rawness. The steak was perfect. The pork ribs, along with the gravy they were in, were heavenly. The meat was soft, perfectly cooked and just slid off the bone effortlessly. Needless to say, their food gets a 5/5.

The service is where they get a 1. The waiters were casual in the way they attended us. They couldn't be bothered with change, and promptly refused without even bothering to check or at the very least apologize. They were downright rude when the card wasn't accepted even though their machine had connectivity issues. Ultimately when the card did work, they didn't bother with an apology and promptly walked off. The service from their staff is what would make not want to visit again, even though their chef is probably working magic in the kitchen.

Ruby's Grill went under reconstruction and voila The Roast came out, the meat lover's paradise. 
This joint is located at a walking distance from gariahat. Small and cozy place with usage of cheerful, bright colours in the decor. Behaviour of the staffs are welcoming and very cooperative. There's a filmy touch in the menu. We went straight for 'Gone With The Roast'. Ordered roast platter and most probably tenderloin steak. The roast platter was outstanding.

A minute's walk along Dover Lane from the Singhi Park pandal area and you find this pretty cheerful-looking place. We were the only diners there and the staff was enjoying the IPL match. Anyway, I had pretty high expectations from this place but somehow it didn't click this evening. First, we were really thirsty and being a sucker for coolers, we asked for the simple virgin mojito and lemon iced tea but were informed that there was only aerated drinks available. I was disappointed to say the least but settled down with a couple of sprite. Then we ordered cheese wrapped sausages and tenderloin steak both of which were well-prepared and absolutely stunning. I was more or less happy and ordered the blueberry cheesecake but again, it wasn't available and we had to take caramel custard for desert. It was quite delicious though. Service was prompt but unavailability of dishes was quite a let down.

The location is convenient and is easily accessible. The restaurant must put up bigger hoarding to spot it immediately.
I loved the decor and the sitting area which in two stages-out and in. The walls are adorned with quirky photos of bollywood stars. It is spacious. The waiters are really polite and the service is very very quick.
We ordered baked potato with stuffed mozzarella and bacon. The potatoes were well baked,stuffing was yummy,the bacon juicy but the quantity of the cheese shoud have been a little more.
The chicken steak served with mashed potatoes,a poached egg, boiled veggies was delicious served in brown sauce was quite a plateful.
The chicken cordon bleu is fantastic! Being a cheese-lover I was ecstatic to find the dish slathered in cheese!(I guess that makes up for the mozzarella! ;) ) The coating was crunchy and was packed tight with plenty of chicken and bacon. Its was fabulous!
The apple pie with vanilla ice-cream was really tasty but I wish the pie was a tad bigger.
The virgin mojito and mango ginger spicy cooler are worth a try.
The prices are reasonable.

Good, not great. We ordered beer batter prawn, chicken sausage with mayo dip, bbq meat pizza and slow cooked and fried pork belly. We also ordered a fresh lime soda. The food was tasty but not as good I thought it would be. It's the sausage that I enjoyed the most because there was chicken and cheese and the awesome mayo dip. After that we were served the beer batter prawn which was good but too salty. That was served with another mayo dip so I'm not complaining, I pretty much enjoyed it. Then came the pizza which neither looked good, nor tasted good. The crust was not crispy and I did not feel like it had much to taste. I'm a pizza lover but this was the first time I did not feel like eating the pizza. The pork belly was soft and small which tasted good but then again I've had better. I did not feel there's anything extraordinary about the ambience or the food in this place. It was okay, not bad. It was only the fresh lime soda that was refreshing at the end.

The location is exactly where Rubi's Grill was! But certainly here u get better cravings that will leave u spellbound. Continental is a cuisine that one can find limited to a few places only. This place has certainly added its name to those fine dining continental cuisines! The ambience is cool n cosy with standard decor. Coming to the important part which is food- 

#beer batter prawns- soft fresh prawns coated in a beer batter n fried till fluffy with minced parsley sprinkled over, served with a tangy sauce which contains the flavour of beer! Quite good n tasty.

#The roast platter- contains 2pcs of chicken, 2pcs of fish, 2pcs of mutton n 2pcs of prawn all tossed in an exotic sauce. Served with buttered rice n mashed potatoes. All were good to taste n our fingers were licking good!

#the devil chicken burger- it was a pile of meaty burger with a thick chicken patty, sausage on top, caramelized onions, cheesy bacon n lettuce leaves! Just yummilicious!

The food was fantastic. So was the owner Mrs. Dasgupta, who came up to the table for review about food, service n suggestions for improvement. Such a courteous approach made us overwhelmed with happiness. My only suggestion would be- try to keep up this overall positivity n confidence to get the soaring success. My good wishes to the team n hope to revisit soon.........

Roast stands in a place where once was Rubi's Grill. And, try as I may, I can not stop drawing comparisons between the two. Both of them serve (well, past tense for Rubi's grill) fantastic Continental dishes, and there is a striking resemblance in the coziness of the ambiance of the two. 

Anyway, let's cut to the chase. We ordered french fries, Chicken Steak, Carabean Roast Chicken, and Caramel Custard, along with Virgin Mojito and Lemon Iced Tea.

The French Fries were beautifully crispy and golden, and with the help of a dash of oregano (yes, you will find oregano and salt as table condiments), they tasted absolutely perfect.

Now, to the main courses. The Chicken Steak was nice and well-done, and was served with a sunny side up egg, a heap of parboiled rice and french fries. It tasted delicious, though some more seasoning of the rice or some herbed rice would sweeten the deal even more. Nevertheless, it's excellent as it is.

Now, the Carabean Roast Chicken. The dish consists of roasted chicken drumsticks, mashed potatoes, caramelized onions and steamed veggies. The roast was beautifully seasoned with herbs, but was just a skosh under-cooked. Had I eaten with my bare hands, it would not have been a problem, but carving chicken with knife becomes particularly difficult when the chicken is under-cooked, even by just a bit. In the end, I actually had to resort to using my hands :) The mashed potato was beautiful. Like every quintessential Bangali, I am an expert when it comes to mashed potatoes, and I don't think I've ever had such a smooth mashed potato ever in my life. Not a single lump was to be found in it. Just add generous dash of oregano, and you're good to go.  The boiled veggies, to me, lacked a bit of salt, but that's my personal preference. I would suggest to saute them lightly in butter to make it absolutely heavenly.

Then came the dessert. The Caramel Custard is as gorgeous as it looks, and has that slight jiggle to it that is usually associated with Panna cotta.

The Virgin Mojito was served in a mason jar, and is enough to fill one's bladder. The Lemon Iced Tea was unique in the sense that, unlike the ones that many others serve, you can actually taste the flavour of the tea here.

Coming to the service, the waiter who took our order may have eidetic memory. He memorized every order he took, and he didn't write down a single letter. After every course, he came and took our feedback on the dishes served. In the end, when we were about to leave, a lady, who is probably the owner of this establishment, approached us and took a detailed account of what we ate and what we thought of the food.
That sort of sincerity and earnestness is rare in these days and it shows that they are willing to grow, instead of being complacent. I have the very best of wishes for them, and hope to visit again in near future.

A not too big restaurant with a seating capacity of 20 people inside. The outside place which I guess was earlier open air seating has now been covered and made part of the restaurant which can now seat another 15-20 people.

Even though the restaurant is not that big but the decor , cleanliness, and food quality are of good grade.

Food is not at all costly but is cooked with perfection. in fact you can see them cooking through the glass fit walls of the kitchen. 

Ordered a russian salad which was just wow. One plate was good enough for two people, both in quantity and quality. Ordered two chicken roasts from their "GONE WITH THE ROAST" menu. Both were equally delicious. 

Ordered two mocktails one of them had a bit fiery sensation when consuming. I guess that was  mango ginger spicy cooler. Don't go for that if you want a smooth one.

Staffs were nice enough to charge our mobiles when asked. Service was fast enough.

This place has a wide range of menu choice, and the best part is every food item in their menu card is a bit different from the menu found in conventional eateries. Beer batter prawn, sausage wrapped with cheese fried and caeser salad with grilled chicken is a must try. Another good thing  about this place is Roast has a wide variety of vegetarian menu choices as well. Crispy chilli babycorn and vegetable steak are two dishes that even the hardcore non veg people will die for. Apart from these, ambience and service of this place is excellent. A must visit for all the foodies.

Are you a freaking meatarians or craving for some brown sauce to elevate your meaty hunger: the newly born 'Roast' is your answer.This is the new 'Rubi's grill'.

 Very easy to locate in Garihat to be precise in Dover's lane, Ballygunge very near to Singhi Park. If you are coming from south Calcutta then at the mouth of Garihat Flyover, you will see a Pantaloons outlet, take a turn keeping it in the right-hand side. After few steps, you could easily see the well-lighted red banner of 'Roast'.Somehow I find restaurants in Garihaat and Golpark are way better for sumptuous pocket-friendly meals if you compare it with Park street where it is more opulent. 

Coast for 2 person Rs-800-900 max (including tax).

Coming to food I ordered one pulled pork burger as starter and in main course BBQ Pizza and chicken steak with smashed potato, boiled corns and a half boiled egg on top (see the photo). The good thing about this steak house is the steak preparation, where I found the lamb and chicken pieces were medium rare cooked hence retained the inner juiciness (which I love) whereas mutton was a bit well done so a little robust (i don't like).Thus it's a perfect place for both of these standard categorized steak lovers, so win-win situation. Pizza was nothing to brag about, normal but large (sufficient for two people). But as I said the catchy part was its steak and its presentation and moreover preparation.  
The desserts looked delicious but I was in a rush so couldn't try. Next time i m surely gonna tick that. 

Ambiance: Not a very large place but two partitions are there, inside you will find a bit loud music whereas outside its peaceful and one can easily chill out with friends. The outdoor has a large space for smoking and all. 

The service is not up to the mark though the behavior of staffs are really cool but chief takes time to prepare food. You can ask for food packing without any hesitation. And the owner and his wife keeps an eye to every customer with care (though its pretty hard to notice but actually they do). All in all a magnificent meat affair with Continental Expedia: RoastGo and get grilled.Cheers!

The place to be for meat lovers. Definitely.Located on Dover Lane this Continental and Mughlai restaurant has all the reasons to attract the young crowd.Started with the ambience, they kept it simple and sophisticated. Sort of relaxing!The menu cards are very innovative using famous movies to categorise the food.It's great to look at. The music that plays is also amazing, mostly old school! Coming to the food. I remember ordering Chicken wings which was well cooked with the ideal mixture of spices and sauce. It was good to start off the meal with it. The tendorloin steak was just delightful. You need to taste it to know how good it was. The bbq meat pizza was also a dish worth trying several times. The service is also worth a mention.A great place to eat at,with a reasonable budget. Meat lovers are definitely gonna dig this place!

Getting the Meat of the Matter @ Roast..!

Are you looking for a place to fulfil your meaty desire? Or are you craving for the brown sauce to sativate you. Kolkata has something brand new to offer to you and answer your meaty cravings. The newest address of char grilled steak and sizzlers is Roast – a simple destination for a range of pastas, pizzas and grill dishes served with a mocktail menu.

Location : Roast has replaced the prior Rubi’s Grill. The address reads 7/2 B, Dover Terrace, Dover Lane, Ballygunge. This is a straight walk from Gariahat via Singhi Park.

Decor and Ambience : A typical steakhouse ambience – quiet ,cosy and casual. The amazing red- white alternative scheme just adds to the visual perception. A great place to hang around with your friends over great food.

Food : The name Roast implies the delicacies served. From the land of Europe comes the char- grilled , roasted favourites sizzling to your table.

A very late review though but it was memorable. I went there on December. I ordered steaks and one starter. Their preparation was so good. The meat was tender and not over or under cooked. Before it was Ruby's grill and I would say they surpassed them.

The newborn called "Roast" is a fresh start in my city. Previously it was known by Ruby's Grill. To be very honest, that was not so good experience. But the new Avatar is just absolutely stunning. We had ordered Pork Chops, Chicken Burger with French fries and Lemon Iced tea. Pork Chop served with mashed potatoes and boiled veggies. Proper juicy soft tender meat. Beautiful taste. Chicken burger is quite heavy.. Good feeling food. Must try..

Ruby's Grill is now Roast in Gariahat. Roast is quite easy to locate in Dover's lane. The place is divided into 2 sections and is well decorated.

Coming to food, we ordered Chicken Wings in Bbq sauce. The pieces of chicken was scculent. The spicies were correct and it was tasty. But the quantity is quite less according to the price. The dish had only 4 pieces of wings whereas many other restuarants serving the same dish has 6 to 8 pieces!

For main course we ordered Bbq pork ribs and Carreabean Chicken Steak. The pork ribs were soft and well cooked. I loved the whole preparation in spicy bbq sauce. It was served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The mashed potato tasted better than most other mashed potatoes that I have had!

The Carreabean Chicken Steak was tasty too.
We didnot have desserts. Next time will surely try out desserts here!

Ambience was nice. Staffs were well mannered.

Finally checking this place off my wishlist. It is located in the same site where the old Ruby's grill was, and being at Ruby's last year I can vouch for the fact that the new owners have done wonders with the decor of the place. The seating area is divided into outer and inner parts. The outer part has huge glass windows, books on the shelves and beautiful glass lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The inner part is more dimly lit, with comfortable booths in the style of American diners. The menu is elaborate and quirky and filled with absolutely dreadful puns.
  Coming to the food, we started off with the bbq meat pizza and let me tell u this is one of the best damn pizzas that I have had in my entire life. Thin crust, soft base, just the right amount of cheese and loaded with meat. It is very filling though and we were a little daunted by the fact that we had two more dishes coming up- the tenderloin steak and pork chop. My medium rare steak was accompanied by fries and boiled veggies. The steak was beautiful, tender and flavoursome- no complaints there. But it was slathered in a not so flavoursome jus. I really wish they would have served the jus separately, like Steak Factory does. Coming to the fries, they were ample in amount, but soggy and bland to the palate. I had a bite from my friend's pork chop and it was pretty good. We finished off with a caramel custard and a virgin mojito (I loved how this was served in a mason jar).
  The service is prompt, the waiters are courteous and well-informed about the menu. The food is reasonably priced. This place has a really fun play-list. It's a joy to get to listen to Scorpion, Pink Floyd, and Bon Jovi songs while feasting on the scrumptious food. To sum it up, we were really satisfied with the experience and glad that we had "gone with the roast".

The Interior Decor Was Good... Now Coming down to the food....Ordered A Spicy Chilli Pork as starter...
The texture of the food was good but coming down to the taste it was hard rock solid... the pork was just not properly cooked and it was like I ordered Pork Pakora.... the batter over the pork was hard and very tough to get a proper bite....
Then I ordered the Roast platter.... and it was my worst experience ever... the platter had pork chicken mutton basa and shrimp... the basa was not at all fresh it had the particular fishy smell that proves its days old. The shrimp was again not fresh as soon as I had a bite I understood it....the chicken and mutton was not properly cooked it was very fibrous and hard to get the knife through... but the pork excellently cooked... the hospitality was very good and the people there were very active in the matters..

We went there yesterday ..well to me it's ambience is average .. what I really looked for some awesome food.So I ordered first their signature dish Chicken Stick with virgin mozito. I must say it was really very good . Then We ordered platter which has chicken ,mutton, pron. Grilled. But the mutton was very bad to eat and the taste of this dish spoiled our mood. I don't recommend this dish ,though they changed the dish after my complaint.but  still this dish is not as per the price.

Service is very good. ,I must say.

Well for me it's a average place to eat.

Roast is the new Rubi's grill , present in the same Dover Lane. I went for lunch with my friends and we had the strawberry and mint , virgin mojito and the pina colada. The drinks were good and adequate in quantity. There was no error in them. 
For starters we had the baby corn , pizza and calamari. The baby corn had too much soya, so we sent it back and the fresh batch that came, that also had too much soya. There were only bell peppers as vegetables in the dish. So it wasn't good. We had the pizza which was good , a soft base , a good tomato sauce and lots of cheese. Calamari rings were also good and were served with mayonnaise. 
For mains we had the chicken steak and the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was basically macaroni cooked in white sauce so it wasn't authentic. The chicken steak I have to say was good. They used rotisserie chicken with a blunt parsley jus and served it with sautéed onions, mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. To top it all, there was a fried egg. The entire dish tasted very good and this is the reason I decided to rate this place such. The chicken was a bit over cooked but it could be ignored. The taste was really good. 
For desserts we had blueberry cheesecake. The blueberry jam over the cheesecake was amazing. However, the cheesecake filling was very solid and had the flavour of gelatin, as if too much was used. The crust was good. 
All in all a good place , but not a great place as the other reviews reveal. Ambience , staff and prices are good enough.

I know this place was used to be Rubi's Grill but i wont compare the two as they have different management, menus and probably different cooks....
The ambiance is great.... a perfect place for a weekend hangout or for mid week datings.... The staffs were very freindly.... The service was great.... I even met the owner, she was very polite and down to earth....
The food.... now what can i say about the food.... it was finger biting good to the very end, specially the chicken quesedilla, chicken steak, fish florentine and the roast platter.... The price.... the price is very reasonable and pocket freindly, we ordered 9 items and the bill was just 1900, thats like 200 per item....
Suggested Dish: Chicken Quesadilla, Roast Platter, Fish Florentine and Chicken Steak....!!
Overall View: I am definitely coming back to this place to try out some more mouth watering dishes....!!

Well, after finding so many good reviews, and being a foodie couldn't stop myself(accompanied by and Ms. Bagchi, partner in crime for the food hunt in Kolkata) from hopping down to this restaurant. The ambiance was super, and the hand crafted interiors by Rohan was actually spicing up the decor of the restaurant.

We started with the roasted chicken wrapped in bacon , and yes it is as delicious as it sounds. The juiciness of the bacon was balancing out the mild crisps of the roast chicken.

Then we opted for a Tenderloin Steak and a Pork Chop. Both meats were done to its perfection. Only would suggest to place the jus by the side in a mini glass jar as well, instead of poring it entirely on the meat. The guest may add up as per the requirement. The food was accompanied by boiled veggies and some mashed potato. Another suggestion, you may put a option in mashed potatoes as well.. like Rosemary mashed potatoes, to some garlic mash or lemongrass mash.

To end the gastronomical expedition, we asked for the owner's choice. And here it was, a fresh cheese cake with some thickened blueberry puree on top. The bite to it was so amazing and memorising, that I couldn't stopped myself from giving a 5 star to the outlet.

It's really been a long time after my good old Leela days, I had such amazing gastronomic experience. This restaurant is a must "Visit".

Went here after reading some good reviews last month. For anyone who is wondering where this restro is located, simply speakingg, this restro is Exactly where Ruby's Grill used to be!!
Presentation was nice as was the ambience. The decor enticed me as a Rock Music fan and the playlist too was to my liking.
Coming to the food!! It was ok but nothing great. The steak was a little tough to eat but the calamari was nice. The dip was vibrant and definitely complementing the calamari. The Grilled chicken was well done but I personally prefer the juicy kind.
I will definitely revisit the place hoping for a far better menu and improved food.

Scrumptious Meat Affair & Continental Expedia at Roast, Gariahat..!

It’s hard to shred off a clichéd brand existence being located at a place which has already been famed by some other name, but if there’s one name which could have had done this isn the first place, it has to be ‘Roast’. Situated conveniently close to Gariahat and precisely at Dover’s Lane, this place happens to be a meat lover’s paradise and a long lost love of a hungry deprived soul. The place isn’t a big restaurant paradise if one thinks in terms of accommodating numbers, but the sheer quality and quantity is enough to prove their supremacy.
            

The menu is carefully segregated and divided into parts consisting of starters, main course, drinks and deserts. The place has a minimal décor approach, and hence gives more than enough attention when it comes to the preparation of food. Not much time back, we were invited for a bloggers meet-up, and following were the mouthwatering delicacies, which were up for grab.

To start with, first came the quintessential Virgin Mojito and Fresh Lime Soda. These were followed by two other drinks; one of them however was quite interesting. The Mango Ginger Spicy Cooler had a hint of fresh Mango Juice, but yet a harsh and biting touch of the ginger with probably a hint of chili flakes. While on one hand one could have the smoothness and exotic slurp of the Mango Juice, on the other hand the ginger would help in digestion of the food.

Moving on to the starters, starting from Spicy Chili Pork, to the Pulled Pork Burger, the Tenderloin Burger, Fish and Chips, Baked Potato Stuffed with Mozzarella and Bacon and finally to the Roasted Chicken wrapped with bacon, it was all a gala and scrumptious affair. The Spicy Chili Pork was a mix of lean and fatty meat, while the Pork Burger and the......

Hopped into this restaurant yesterday.. Well, i was very impressed with the innovative filmy menu card they have and their good collection of food items... Situated in dover lane, exactly the place where Ruby's Grill once coexisted we thought of giving this place a try.
FIRST, coming to the interior. I quite liked the vibrant, vivacious interior they have.. The pretty coloured walls and the wooden roof on the top gives the complete feel of a steak house.. Well, their playlist was great which will keep u even hooked up to this place..
The staffs are good as well, quite helpful..
Now, coming to the most important part which is the food... We ordered
1) FRIED CALAMARI and 2) ROASTED PRAWN WRAPPED in BACON as the starters..
Well, personally i felt that the fried calamaris were over fried and was too crispy. But the sauce they served along with them, was pretty tasty and was complimenting the deeply fried calamaris well..
I really liked the Roasted prawn In bacon.. It was very tasty, nicely cooked and quite flavorful..
Now, coming to the main course. We ordered
3) THE MUTTON ROAST which was delicious. Right portion size, good quality and is a thumps up..
Lastly as dessert. We took their CARAMEL CUSTARD which was also delicious. Nothing over the top but was good to the mouth...
So my overall experience was nice. They are not charging with any tax which is great. I really liked this place and will strongly recommend this restaurant to everyone... Debarpan

A very brightly decorated cozy and comfortable place. We ordered tenderloin steak, pork chops and fried calamari. Service is a bit slow. Coming  to the food, the pork chop was disappointing. Some herb or spice they added totally killed the taste making it taste bitter at times. Fried calamari was very delicious but tenderloin steak was the show stealer. It satisfied every inch of my taste buds. Quantity was pretty good and price is decent. One thing I would like to say is the meat they served was of very good quality. Would love to revisit.Aniket Mallick

We went down for a snack break, ended up buying dinner too. The bacon wrapped roast chicken was blessing from heaven. Perfectly bite sized, each set is a grenade of pure unadulterated flavour. The smoky juiciness takes your senses for a roll (best felt with eyes closed). Drinks were a bit too sweet, but complementing nevertheless.
Finally we packed up pizza for dinner which was nice topping of chicken and meat!
Overall it was a great experience, will visit more often for sure!

A shopping spree in Gariahat always remains incomplete without a visit to some of the very good restaurants in and around the place. Of course that means that we are often spoilt for choice. Zomato surely comes to the rescue and this time it pointed us towards Roast. 

This place would be familiar to anyone who had visited Rubi's Grill before because that it exactly where this restaurant sits today. Neither my friend nor I had been here before so we looked out for the Gariahat Police Station. The place resembles an American-style diner with two seating areas all filled with comfy sofas. The ambience is made complete with the music system which belts out English pop music from the yesteryears. 

Coming to the food, we had ordered the crispy fried calamari, chicken steak, tenderloin steak, lemon ice tea and ginger soda. The food had been presented beautifully and without much delay. I felt that the calamari smelt a little bit of the oil in which it had been fried. The sweet sauce with which it had been served paired very well with the dish. The steaks were cooked to perfection and the accompaniments--roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes-- were to die for. I only felt that the lemon iced tea was a little too sweet for my taste. The taste of neither the lemon nor the tea was prominent. I think I preferred the ginger soda over the iced tea. 

Overall, it was a good experience in this place and I would definitely go back for more of those steaks. Oh and did I mention the best part about this place? It is the fact that the price of the food fits comfortably within your budget. Win-win for all of us foodies.

​Kolkata’s latest destination for meat lovers happens to be Roast, Gariahat. Roast stands at the same place where Rubi’s Grill used to be. I was invited here for a bloggers meet. I was quite excited since I’m a big fan of roasted meat and this place excels in that ! The ambience is very homely. The seating area is mostly on the ground floor. The mezzanine floor is mostly for large groups. Now let’s get into details on the food that was served to us !

A very brightly decorated cozy and comfortable place. We ordered tenderloin steak, pork chops and fried calamari. Service is a bit slow. Coming  to the food, the pork chop was disappointing. Some herb or spice they added totally killed the taste making it taste bitter at times. Fried calamari was very delicious but tenderloin steak was the show stealer. It satisfied every inch of my taste buds. Quantity was pretty good and price is decent. One thing I would like to say is the meat they served was of very good quality. Would love to revisit.Aniket Mallick

We went down for a snack break, ended up buying dinner too. The bacon wrapped roast chicken was blessing from heaven. Perfectly bite sized, each set is a grenade of pure unadulterated flavour. The smoky juiciness takes your senses for a roll (best felt with eyes closed). Drinks were a bit too sweet, but complementing nevertheless.
Finally we packed up pizza for dinner which was nice topping of chicken and meat!
Overall it was a great experience, will visit more often for sure!

Okay so 7/2b Dover Lane and I go way back. I was a regular when this used to be Rubi's grill, and now that it's Roast I've already visited it twice since their opening!

The interior is sassy and trendy and I love how they've incorporated the outer area as a part of the restaurant now. I loved the lighting and the vibrant hues in which the restaurant is done up in.

∆First visit∆

I visited this place for the first time with my mom, and hell, we both loved the newly revamped place.
• For starters we ordered, French fries and Devilled eggs. Now I must say that I was really very impressed with Devilled eggs. It was soooooo good. Try it for yourself to believe it.
• For mains, we chose Carabean Roast chicken and Chicken Tetrazzini. The roast chicken was fabulous with 2 chunks of chicken served with mashed potato and butter rice. Tasted divine.
The Tetrazzini on the other hand was creamy and cheesy. Incidentally the portion looked small but boy oh boy, it was filling! The amount of cheese and cream can melt any foodie's heart! Absolutely recommended!

Bill - 997

∆Second visit∆

We were a group of 5 and visited Roast on the 1st of Jan. Yeah quite a good way to start the year!
• For starters we had Golden fried mushrooms and babycorn, and crispy fried calamari. Both of them tasted outstanding but my heart goes out to calamari, cuz hey I love squid! The former was saucy and tasted brilliant. Both the dishes had good portions.
• Now the mains.
Two of us decided to go for Carabean chicken roast, after they heard me raving about its awesomeness! Both of us went for it with butter rice and mashed potato as sides.
Two of us decided to go for Tenderloin steak. This was heavenly to taste. Though my friend was apprehensive about the texture of the steak, after one bite he was made sure of its soft and succulent nature. The other just hogged into his plate as soon as it was served.
Another one decided to order Pork chop with french fries and butter rice. This looked really tantalizing and tasted equally brilliant!
We had also ordered Virgin mojito and Mango ginger cooler for slurping. Here I would specially recommend mango ginger cooler. This was just too good. The sweet and the spicy - how well it complemented to create this fantastic fusion of a drink!

Bill - 2350 for the five of us.

Now coming to the service. It was spot on both the times! They managed the rush of new year really well and the staff is warm and helpful. Definitely worth many visits.

P.s - I'm very soon going to become a regular here too, as I already have my third visit planned!

We had gone here during the christmas time and this cute cafe was very well decorated.
The interior is very beautiful with candles,bottles and pretty hanging lights.
We took a strawberry mint mocktail,Deep fried sausages in cheese and fish florentine served with butter rice and boiled veggies.
The fish item was totally lip smacking.
Food presentation is pretty normal but foid quality is great.
The staffs are friendly but the service is not so prompt.
Anyways,it is a nice cafe for great hangouts and good pocket friendly food.
The best part is they charge no extra tax. 😁@

Whenever I visit Kolkata, my bestie makes it a point to take me to all the top notch restaurants of Kolkata. Perks of having a food blogger friend. Roast was in her bucket list and she was really very excited to take me there...The name did not appear much appealing to me so I tried to drop the plan but anyhow she managed to convince me. 
After visiting this place, I would definitely say never judge a book by it's cover. The place is just amazing. Fantastic ambience with trendy decor. I don't have words to explain how good the food was. If you visit once you would definitely want to visit again. 
5 of us went and we had a gala time on 1st January. It was a great start to a new year. 
We had ordered: 
•Starters- golden roasted mushroom and crispy fried calamari(must try)
 •Mains- carabean roast chicken with butter rice and mashed potatoes, pork chops with butter rice and French fries and Tenderloin steak. 
Adding to the above, Virgin mojioto and the mango ginger spicy coolers were superb. 
Last but not the least, kudos to the staffs...they were doing a splendid job in such a rush hour. I've never received so much of warmth from staffs. I'm very pleased and would definitely visit again.

Nice cozy little place in Dover lane. Those who are unaware of the place it is in the alley of Singh park durga Puja in gariahat. The restaurant is located just opposite of western union and India post branch in Dover lane. The décor and ambience is minimalistic but quite overwhelming. The most interesting feature of this place is their innovative and creative thinking. This is visible in their choice of dishes and naming. The menu is conventional with a dose of sarcastic humourous innovation. I tried out their BBQ meat pizza. The pizza was delicious with ample cheese, soft thin crust bread and 3 types of BBQ meat -chicken, pork and beef. All cooked to perfection. The only drawback is the pizza base sauce. It has too much of a tangy feeling which overpowers the palate. It should be changed or toned down a bit so that other flavours can come out. No matter how much oregano & chilli flakes you add the taste of the sauce refuses to die down. If this thing is corrected their pizza is winner. It is excellent in terms of quality, quantity and taste. One pizza is enough to feed 2 people. Overall my verdict is good but can do better.

Clearing all confusion...yes Roast is the new Ruby's Grill. Now its important that when you replace a former restaurant of the same genre expectations rise automatically... To begin with, the starters which we had taken included Roasted chicken wrapped in bacon and spicy chilly pork, both of them were quite good, especially the latter. For mains the monster(burger) is a definite try out... the roast platter is not exactly the big platter you expect..portion is definitely small, fish being the standout in it...bbq pork ribs had too much sauce and in this regard The Steak Factory takes the reward... chocolate brownie with vanilla ice-cream was definitely good, the brownie being a little spongy... blueberry cheesecake is so so...not fresh to be true...drinks could be wayyyy better...needs to be worked on....ambience quite good and adequately lit.... all in all a good food joint.

I went there to look for Rubi's Grill as I was looking for good pork items. After some initial confusion I found out that it is this new outlet that has taken its place. Ambiance nice. Service though a bit on the slower side was courteous and its ok for those who come in groups and wish to chit-chat. Ordered pulled pork burger and sausage wrapped in fried cheese. The first was nice while the second was excellent ! And lastly, the lady owner of the place was very hospitable. Surely i would like to come again. And I wish i ll get chilled beers next time.

This place had always been on my radar ever since they took over Rubi's Grill. Also being a meat lover and a big fan of the big brother of the joint (The Steak Factory) I really wanted to devour all I could at this restaurant. 
First things first: I love the bohemian decor. The lights, he American diner feel were exactly the way I expected. I tried the Roast platter and a tandoori pizza. The platter included mutton, chicken, prawns and fish along with an option of choosing two out of four servings of French fries, boiled veggies, rice mashed potatoes. Every item in the platter was delicious, especially the fish. The mutton seemed a little undercooked for my taste. 

The other item I tried here was the tandoor pizza. Now, his was a thin crust pizza which had such an amazing flavour and aroma. This made it a winner, almost. However , it was a little overcooked and was a little too soft for a pizza. 

The only suggestion I have is an inclusion of an indication of how many people a dish can feed. (Say the Roast platter-serves 2/ serves 4) . 

I will be back to this place to try out some more items off the menu. Will update this review then.

THE STAFF HERE ARE THIEVES... Me and my cousin tried this place a few months back and really liked it so we had decided to come back here if we were to come in the area again and were excited about it. This time disappointment is an understatement. They reduced the continental menu to add very basic Chinese dishes. The wait staff behaved as if they were doing us a favour by serving us. They served us  chicken steak with stale mashed potatoes and gave us kitchen knives to cut the meat. WE WERE CHARGED  A BILL OF RS 780. WE KEPT RS 800  IN ONE 500 NOTE AND THREE 100 NOTES IN THE TAB. THE WAITER TOOK AWAY THE TAB AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER SAYING THAT WE JUST PAID RS 300. WE INSISTED THAT WE HAD PAID THE ENTIRE MONEY. THEY KEPT ON ARGUING AND DENYING TAKING THE MONEY. SINCE IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF US AND WE DID NOT WANT TO INVITE TROUBLE WE PAID THE EXTRA MONEY AND LEFT WITHOUT CREATING A SCENE. THIS KIND OF HARASSMENT WAS UNEXPECTED AND WE WERE BOTH SADDENED BY THIS INCIDENT AND WE THOUGHT THAT ANYONE ELSE THINKING OF GOING HERE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS.

31st eve decided to have a house party at a friends place. Wanted to have some continental food so found this place on zomato online ordering section.

The order took an eternity to come due to the high volumes of orders received by zomato. Food arrived and we dint even waste a second to hog.

Food ordered
1)beer batter prawn
2)Caribbean roast chicken
3)the roast platter
4)blueberry cheese cake
5)caramel custard
 
The food was cold as it was delivered very late. The prawn appetizer was good. Coming to the Caribbean roast chicken it was such a disappointment due to the piece of chicken used in it. The chicken was not de-skinned properly. Even bigger put down was the roast platter. The portion size was very small that it made me and my friend look for it in the carry bag whether there is another container or not. The taste was pretty average to be honest. Coming to desserts the caramel custard was overcooked as it had pours all over and dint have a smooth finish. Now the star of the evening was the cheese cake and it was just impeccable!
My experience was not so great with the roast but maybe the dine in option can turn it around.

I was searching for a good place to have lunch near Gariahat as I wanted to try out a new place. My friend suggested Roast(she got to know about it through Zomato). We called up and got the exact direction. The decor is pretty simple and the walls are adorned with photos. It has a very casual atmosphere something I enjoyed. We ordered- 
1. Virgin Mojito
2. Crispy Fried Calamari
3. Chicken Steak
The food was quite good. I would not say it was extraordinary but definitely very good. Mojito was really refreshing and I loved the calamari. 
The owners made it a point to check whether we were enjoying the food and also asked about our overall experience which was a real good gesture. The service was very prompt. I would like to come back.

Roast has almost continued the same legacy that was Rubi's Grill in the same place; brilliant decor, great taste in music, and even better tasting food! I went with my friend for lunch, and left the place with both satiated belly & a heart. We ordered:
1. Crispy fried Calamari - 5⭐
2. The Roast Platter - 4⭐
3. Ham Steak (new addition) - 3.5⭐
4. Tenderloin Steak (rare) - 4⭐

Pros:
Great ambiance, music, polite service, mouth-watering dishes. Pretty reasonable rates for the service and quality it has to offer, though will not call it cheap.

Cons:
The only issue that I really had (and also shared my feedback with the personnel) was that a rare steak should ideally be a rare steak, not medium-rare. I guess it is completely not the chef's fault, as the idea of a 'bloody rare' steak would make most cringe, but a rare steak is what it is...and fooling around with that is sacrilege!

A solid 4.5⭐ for Roast, a definite repeat visit. Kudos!

It's a quaint restaurant just opposite the Dover Lane Post office. And it's a continental food lovers' delight. The roast chilli pork, prawn wrapped in bacon, chicken wings were outstanding. The ginger mango drink was very refreshing. Just 2 months old, this restaurant offers new punches and it's definitely worth a visit.

Walked into this very nicely done up eatery just about a 100 m from the singhi park puja pandal. Well behaved waiters and a very positive energy as you walk in . The waiter helped me in the order and we ordered Carribean Roast chicken , roast pork and park spare ribs along with a pepperoni pizza . The portions were good and the meat was delectable . Sauces used were perfectly done and overall good justice to the name ROAST.  I recommend this as a must try for all . Cheers to the team Roast !!!

If the option would have been there, I would rate this place negative! I went for dinner with my wife and cousins. At first the place looked nice and the only staff/waiter present was courteous and polite while recommending a few options in veg and chicken. We ordered for mushroom soup and chicken cream soup. Quesadilla, spaghetti aglio olio, chicken steak for dinner. The food was totally bland and cold. Steak was very chewy..the aglio olio was excess salty and peppery..although the owners were sitting inside and chatting, the refused to show up when called upon..pathetic place and management..

When you are taking someone else's seat . people will definitely have some better expectations from you . well it was not all a disappointment rather The Roast is going to have it's own identity. We ordered bacon wrapped prawn as a starter and Pork belly and Tenderloin Stake as main . the pork belly was average. The stake was good and well cooked . but the bacon had stolen the show . the price is really pocket friendly . service was good. The overall experience was good..

Walked into this very nicely done up eatery just about a 100 m from the singhi park puja pandal. Well behaved waiters and a very positive energy as you walk in . The waiter helped me in the order and we ordered Carribean Roast chicken , roast pork and park spare ribs along with a pepperoni pizza . The portions were good and the meat was delectable . Sauces used were perfectly done and overall good justice to the name ROAST.  I recommend this as a must try for all . Cheers to the team Roast !!!

If the option would have been there, I would rate this place negative! I went for dinner with my wife and cousins. At first the place looked nice and the only staff/waiter present was courteous and polite while recommending a few options in veg and chicken. We ordered for mushroom soup and chicken cream soup. Quesadilla, spaghetti aglio olio, chicken steak for dinner. The food was totally bland and cold. Steak was very chewy..the aglio olio was excess salty and peppery..although the owners were sitting inside and chatting, the refused to show up when called upon..pathetic place and management..

When you are taking someone else's seat . people will definitely have some better expectations from you . well it was not all a disappointment rather The Roast is going to have it's own identity. We ordered bacon wrapped prawn as a starter and Pork belly and Tenderloin Stake as main . the pork belly was average. The stake was good and well cooked . but the bacon had stolen the show . the price is really pocket friendly . service was good. The overall experience was good..

Fantastic Ambience with nicely done up interior. Very attentive waiters and must appreciate the creativness displayed in designing the menu. The taste of food were excellent and there was that personal touch from the Chef!! Being at the other end of the Dover Lane, place has ample parking space infront as it is devoid of traffic per se. Perfect place to cozy up and enjoy a variety of meat.

Roast. Evening 8.40 pm. Missus and I. We don't know Roast. We just bump into it. We were on our way to another restaurant when this caught our eye. We were staying in the neighborhood.

Small place. Cozy seating. Open kitchen. Nice staff. Courteous. We are seated and menus offered very fast.

We select Irish broth and Bacon wrapped chicken for first course.

The broth is neat. Small chunks of mutton. Delicately peppered. Enough to improve the taste. I alternate between the bacon wrapped chicken and the broth. Contrasting features. The bacon is salty and crisp. The chicken is a bit overdone but excellent in taste. Tinge of garlic in there. Enjoyable. The cooking is with some emotion. Visible. 

We order chicken a la kiev and fish n chips for main course. Fish is fried in batter. The batter is smooth and so the fish is uniformly coated. Just golden brown in colour. The fish is Basa. I usually am ambivalent about the fish but am surprised at its freshness in the hands of the kitchen. They have a good storage process, I can see. Again lightly tempered with salt and pepper. Groovy!

The chicken a la kiev is served on mashed potato. Green vegetables on the side. The butter oozes out with the first cut. Like it should. The chicken is fresh and succulent. I am floored with the efficiency. 

The restaurant needs to be known. Quickly. The owner was around. Very gracious lady. I did not get the name. Next time. Perhaps!!

Roast formally known as ruby's grill was a huge disappointment when compared to its old days before the renovation. The ambience is great..groovy and the staff is also very friendly however the food was a disappointment.
They have changed the menu and the burger I had gone to eat was not available so I tried a new one. I had the pork pulled burger. The food was good however the quantity of French fried served was disappointing. Previously they used to have burgers with so much stuffing that the bun was not attached to the burger. However sadly this looked pathetic as compared to the previous burgers they served. However it tasted good but I would have like a bit more fries and a bacon and sausage on it.
My friend had tried fish and chips and the batter was a bit soggy. The fries that they served on this dish was pathetic. It was there just because it said chips were to be served. We could count the number of fries.
However,it is still a great place to try American cuisine.I just didn't find the place satisfactory when compared to the price I had paid.

What to say.. what not to say.. i need to start of somewhere i guess.. will start with the location, I would say..easy to find easy to locate.. a great taste starts with a great location I believe and the owner had just that in mind I'm guessing before even it all happened..then u have got the food.. never would i have been more right if i had not seen roast in action.,brilliant fusion between mughlai and continental cuisine and saying that which couldn't have been done without the decor.. and when i say decor i mean those vintage photographs those paintings the rustic walls..and it has happened to me once or twice in my life that i knew already before even I ordered my food in a restaurant, i knew that its gonna be right.. and as i said i was a winner with the choice of food that i had ordered..i tried bits and morsels of couple of dishes..and i so loved them.. and i will get back to roast to try the next couple of goodies they had to offer..ROAST U GUYS ARE DOING IT R8.. keep up the good work.... cheers👍🏻👍🏻😀😀

Located in the side roads of Gariahat, this  quaint new restaurant was our choice for a sibling get-together during Durga puja. It's not a very  big space but the decor is very unique , with hand painted wine bottles. Maybe because it was new at the time, but the service was a bit lax and wanting. We had ordered a chicken steak , a tenderloin steak and pork chop from the pooja special menu. The chicken and  tenderloin were pretty delectable, assuming from the expressions of my siblings but unfortunately the pork chop, which i had ordered, was a pretty tough piece of meat and the fat was not rendered properly. We also ordered a caramel custard  which rounded of the meal pretty well. Would like to see this place serve alcohol or at least some beer , in the future. The menu is well suited for it.

The best thing about the restaurant to me was the menu card. Apart from that nothing special to write home about. The portions I would say were on the tinier side. Needs improvement to catch up to the reputation with the earlier restaurant that shared the same space Ruby's Grill.

Pathetic food... Went there after reading the reviews n high ratings in zomato... Beef steak was bloody not rested properly and sauce that barely covered the meat. Chicken wings was more like kosha mangsho.
Very small portions also.
The 1.5 is for the virgin mojito which was surprisingly the best thing we had.

This definitely is a Hidden Gem! Same place where Rubi's Grill use to be. If you enter the lane keeping Gariahat Police Station on your right, keep going straight after which you will see a brightly lit up Roast on your left. Now coming to the food.. I ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu, Pepperoni Pizza and a Tenderloin Steak between two of us. The Pizza and the Cordon Bleu was way above what I expected. Generous amount of cheese and the crust of the pizza was just perfect. The steak too was very good with mashed potatoes and veggies. The quantity too was very good. I went back to them yesterday and ordered a burger as the staff suggested and it turned out to be a meaty affair oozing great taste! Service and time taken to serve is impressive too! Needless too say I will go back to them again!

We visited this place on a day when the chefs were on a leave and apparently the owner was cooking.
This translated to a meal time of 3 plus hours.
The servers kept apologising for the delay but the experience really tasted our patience.
They kindly agreed to serve us non veg lasagna which was off the menu.
The portion size was miniscule and lacked flavour.
The grilled chicken dish was better,though by a small margin.
Each dish arrived seperately,at an interval of more than an hour.
The bill was 640/-

So a couple of days back, visited this place with a friend.The first impression is homely and different. The decor stands apart what with its low hanging lamps.

The waiters are friendly too.
I agree I ordered too little to give a comprehensive review about this place but still it calls for one.

The minestrone soup was so-so and I have had better chicken tetrazzini elsewhere.

I intend to revisit this place since I personally feel it would be nice to update this review.

As wanted to try this place since durga puja..one fine late evening thought to go to roast for dinner.it amazed me and my wife with the lovely handmade interiors such as the hanging bottles and gramaphone disc lamps with some old Bollywood movies and some classic English movie posters attached to the countyside look painted walls and the menu , all these were designed by the owner itself rohan Chanda...The ambience of this place was very classy and cosy with the countryside look .Now let's come to food..so we tried roasted prawns wrapped with Bacon's,one platter and a beef burger..must say..one of the best continental I ever had..the burger was lip smacking delectable..so as both the items..this was the 1st visit for me and my wife.But I m sure that we visit this place many more times to try rest of the mouth watering dishes..well done my friend Rohan Chanda..all the best..

I was a big fan of the burgers at Rubi's Grill, which led us to Roast this afternoon. We sat outside (or what was previously "outside" but now glass bound and air conditioned) The décor is quirky with painted jar coated lights and a meat-related quotes covered wall. We ordered the non veg lasagne (not on the menu, has to be asked separately) and the BBQ pizza initially but the pizza wasn't available. So we ordered the Caribbean roast chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. The bill came to be 640/-
Pros-
-The gravy, in both the dishes were flavoursome and the meat was well cooked.
Cons-
- Service was extremely slow, which was later explained by the waiter that the chef was absent and the owner himself was cooking. A little bit of mismanagement could be seen.
- The lasagne, for the amount they took compared to other eateries, was pitifully less in quantity. Just a lump of chicken keema and a bit of cheese and too much pastry left us dissatisfied and wanting for more.
Definitely expected better food and service so slightly disappointed.

Same plot as the previous restaurant Rubi's grill in dover lane ,with a little enlarged space with increased seating capacity and wider range of menu Roast is all set to take the carnivorous calcuttans through some joyous meaty rides. The space is all well planned with bright yellow lights and decent comfortable seating , a tiny washroom and very efficient courteous staff.
Three of us had been there for last sunday dinner , and ordered CHILLI PORK as starter and CARIBBEAN CHICKEN ROAST , TENDERLOIN STEAK(medium rare) , LAMB CHOPS , LAMB LASAGNA for mains. The food tasted impeccable , chilli pork was outstanding , not the usual chinese way but this one had some tangy and sweetness packed along with chilli in the sauce which really stood out. i had some good chilli pork quite after a long time. The steaks arrived , with two sides each and though all of them had similar sauce but the quality of meat , the amount of cooking was perfect making them very juicy and tender. The one big con i could make out was the portions , all the dishes from starters to mains were quite less quantity wise when we compare the pricing.One main dish along with the sides may not fill one adult .So a little bit of generosity in terms of the portions of meat per dish would easily fetch them full marks .

No point writting a review. As when I confronted the Maitr D and the chef they were in denial.. Thus its useless.. The worst experience I had.. Considering this as my 4 visit and the last.. Steak which is Shredded and Peproni pizza had chunks of pork and chicken (YES!! Thats right.. CHICKEN).. No point writting a long elaborated post.. 

Adios..
---------------------------------------------
                        Well.. Had a lot of expectations for this place. I won't say that they didn't live upto my expectation but somethings are not that easy to ignore..

What we had?

1. Cream of Chicken Soup

2. Cheese garlic Bread

3. Pulled Pork Burger

4. Tenderloin Steak

5. Spaghetti with Meat Balls

6. Virgin Mojito

7. Mango Ginger Spicy Cooler

What we loved?

1. Cream of Chicken Soup

2. Cheese garlic Bread

3. Tenderloin Steak

4. Spaghetti with Meat Balls

The Good Side :

Located in the quiet little neighbourhood of Dover Lane near to Singhi Park Puja towards the Government Quarters. The place is quiet clean and open. The interior had clean minimalist deco of the west.

The staff (may be it was a late afternoon Sunday) were a bit occupied themselves in chatting. We entered and we had to call one of the waiters to ask if we could sit in one of the tables outside. After they sat us went inside and started fooling around again. Had to call him again getting up to give my order. To be honest I know the service at Steak Factory so had a hunch this would be the service that I would get.

Moving on to the food...

Cream of Chicken Soup - Taste: Amazing, Quality: Should have been creamy and hot, it was almost cold and the garlic bread served with the soup was cold.

Cheese garlic Bread - Taste: OK, Quality: It was as if the bread was just put in the micro for a couple of minutes and served.

Pulled Pork Burger - Taste: I WASTED MY MONEY, Quality: The patty was soooo dry and crumbled being old. The bun was probably old as it also crumbled. Trust me I have had my share of BEEF BURGERS, they are supposed to be juicy and grilled properly. The patty was burnt. I showed this burger DISASTER!! to the waiter(Whom I had to call from his throne). He said that he would give me another one to go. I refused that as I was not looking to be a free loader.

Tenderloin Steak - Taste: Good, Quality: The sauce was simply amazing (Probably the second thing I liked). The veggies were dry and the fries. Steak didn't look like a 200 gm one rather a 100 gm.

Spaghetti with Meat Balls - Taste: GOOD, Quality: Really good. It was not hot but warm.

Virgin Mojito - Needs a lot of work. Only mixing a Mojito mix doesn't help.

Mango Ginger Spicy Cooler - Supposed to be spicy but not this much. Overall nice.

Pros..

1. Affordable

2. Clean

3. Good Deco

4. Good Location

Cons..

1. Food temperature is a big issue. Its important for food to be at a certain temperature depending on the dish. THIS WAS NEGLECTED.

2. Staff needs to be attentive.

3. Portions.

4. Carry cash, cards don't work here.

5. Be ready to get up to call the waiters a lot to get their attention.

Overall the experience was OK. Since I am on a steak spree in Kolkata, I was a bit detailed about my review. Sorry guys if you felt bad. I had to be honest as I am a huge fan of STEAK.

I visited Roast during Durga Puja. This nice little joint was quite a pleasant surprise. I really loved everything we ordered however,for me, the chicken steak and the lasagna stood out among all. The service was very good and given the portion size I think the menu is quite reasonably priced. I wish to visit Roast again very soon and would recommend all continental food lovers to definitely give this place a try.

ROAST is the third Hand for the owner/partner Rohan Chanda , after Steak Factory New Alipore and Southern Avenue , and as expected has come up with the most innovative menu , a little different from the conventional joints and eateries around South Kolkata. Apart from the generation friendly ambiance, the music is also one of the pluses mostly more because as it has been one of the many points people are penning it down on review pages and feedback forms parallel to the quality food. Last but not the least staffs and chefs are the most friendliest and co-operative staffs you would find in here. And to top it all yumilicious for all the meat lovers , as value for money is just an understatement.

Nestled in Dover Lane, near Shinghi Park, this little eatery has a lot to offer. Your evening will be made with the wide range of delectable delicacy topped with a soothing ambiance. From pastas to pizzas and from salads to burgers they seem to have it all. The menu left me confused and surprised as I was unable to choose what I should go for. As an avid cheese lover, I finally settled for a portion of cheesy onion rings, potato volcano (which is potato wrapped with bacon and grilled with cheese), dry chili pork and a portion of Caribbean chicken roast. The onion rings were beyond amazing (no compromises were made with the cheese, which is a rarity), the potato volcano were cooked to perfection (bacon and cheese never disappoint), the chicken roast brought over the tropical flair to our taste buds. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables, I loved the flavour the chicken had to offer. The chili pork too was nice and spicy, just the way it should be. Unfortunately, with all the food, there was no space left for desserts, which also gives me an excuse to visit them again. The blueberry cheesecake looks way too inviting. And the pocket pinch you ask? Not much at all. An amazing meal at an economical price!

Very good continental food joint. Splendid gastronomic experience. Co owned by a friend and neighbor, we were invited to the gala opening party. Being a continental food buff, I had a blast. The bacon wrap, chicken steak, fish steak were excellent. But the dish I enjoyed the most was the beef steak. Fabulous, well done, just the way I like it. It's a must have experience for people who swear by continental food. Oh, and great English music to boot!

Rubi's Grill has been replaced by 'Roast'. The menu and decor are almost in sync with the previous ones but not quite. We ordered the Pulled pork burger which was good but as we had expected it to be like Rubi's, we made some comparisons and gave our opinion to the chef who was very friendly and open to feedback! The non-veg lasagna was delicious and came in huge quantity. It is pocket friendly and fills the tummy. Staff is good too. Overall, a fine place to hang out in, with wholesome food.

Headed to Roast with my two work colleagues for an early dinner after a gruelling day. We were tired, hungry and cranky. Thankfully, the experience at Roast made my day very memorable. We ordered the 'mac n cheese pie' as a starter. It was delicious, and very filling. The flavours were not overpowering, just right. The bed of mashed potatoes it was served on was also of a nice creamy consistency. For the mains we ordered the 'Carebean Chicken', the 'Roasted Basa' and the 'Meat Pie'. The chicken was a delight, the sause was truly finger-licking good. It was served with steamed veggies and finger chips which the very sweet waiter changed to mashed potatoes after we requested him to. The meat pie was quite good, though I would have preferred it to have been warmed a bit more, but I was famished and the flavour was so good that I had no patience to return it to the kitchen for warming. The hero of the evening was undoubtedly the basa. The flavour, the texture, the colour! I'm salivating as I'm writing this. We all shared a blue berry cheesecake which was quite yum, not too dense and the preserve on top had the right balance of tart and sweet. All this, and the bill was 1490. I'm definitely coming back for more. Oh, and the decor is very quirky, as is the way the menu is designed. Better you go see for yourself :)

Well Sunday dining often means continental style 
Other than those age old Park St ones we hav #Roast @ Doverlane whose decor is so creative with a touch of Colonial Style of 60s & 70s alongwith music from Linking Park , Eagles , GnR ..
It has an array of lovely continental dishes which cant be finished in a day so we started with Bacon wrapped chicken which was sumptuous especially it's innovative accompaniment .....   Seafood chowder which is rarely available in the city had apt taste .  .  
The mind boggling meat pie whose meaty stuffing made us gaga.... It's seasoning & taste was too good .... I love the way  they served their delicious buttery mashed potato with it...
In Kolkata any other restaurants wouldn't giv so many choices of accompaniments( sauteed veggies/ mashed potatoes / buttered rice/ garlic bread ) with Roasted Mutton ....  
It's was an amazing experience altogether

A cozy eatery located at the Dover lane near Singhi Park. Visited yesterday for dinner take away - chicken wrapped in prawn and the barbecue pork ribs which tasted very very delicious. Both the dishes were tossed perfectly with well balanced sauce. To quench my thirst, their staff recommended for virgin mojito which was really good. Staff was very well behaved and his recommendations for the 2 great signature dishes really tasted brilliant. Service was instant. Lastly, coming to the ambience - the eatery has 2 separate sitting arrangements - inside and outside are. Although the outside area is fully covered with shade but the hand made interiors are really eye catchy - vinyl wall papers themed with Western cuisines and chandelier like lamps hanging all around the corners. I would strongly recommend the meat lovers for western cuisines to visit this joint.

Located in Dover lane, Roast is the newest addition in the city serving a wide range of continental delicacies! Roast is where Ruby's grill was previously located and they have maintained a similar decor though i found the lighting to be more bright, the music quite electrifying and the ambience was quite good along with a couple of courteous staff members! 
We were a group of 6 and since this restaurant is pretty new, it wasn't difficult to get a seat over here! 
Now coming to the food, we had ordered :
1. Bbq chicken wings - Do try this one and i am sure you will crave for more. Apart from the fact that  the chicken pieces were humble in size and well cooked, the amount of sauce added was just perfect and that is why this dish stood out! 
2. Monster burger - I was disappointed with this one as there was nothing monstrous about it, since I expected it to be bigger and better in quantity and size! 
3. Bbq meat pizza - priced at rs 280, this dish will suffice you in quality and quantity!  
4. Caribbean roasted chicken - Again a thumbs up from my side for this one, the amount of chicken is quite generous and it is served with a portion of rice along with veggies and mashed potatoes! 
5. Bbq pork ribs - The thing about pork ribs is that it is either cooked to perfection or it turns out to be a disaster and in this case it was the former thankfully! Though abit of improvement can be made in regards to the sides! 
6. Chicken tetrazzini - The quantity was sufficient and it was adequately cheesy though the proportion of chicken could have been a bit more!  

To sum up my experience, i would definitely recommend this place and since it is quite new, judging by the food quality and value for money, it has a long way to go so cheers to this place!

So, Roast is the place where we wanted to check-in since Mahalaya, and we finally got a chance to be there on saptami evening. We had quite a high expectations, since 'Steak factory' is one of my favorite places to satisfy our meat cravings, and this restaurant is coming from the same person. Firstly the puja special menu disappointed me, as I had seen the full menu before, and it had loads of options. We ordered Roastes chicken wrapped in bacon which was fairly good ,Chicken Tetrazzini and Veg Tetrazzini which were just too awesome, Tenderloin and Chicken steak which we liked too, and BBQ meat pizza which has the flavour of BBQ sauce quite high in it. 
The wall is beautifully decorated with movie posters which is trying to portray that east meets west here. Al-Pachino & Amitabh in one frame, and Steak & Kebab in the same menu. 

So, this is what saved us on crowed puja evening, and we got to have what we wanted (meat and more meat). Steak factory was special as it was the first of this kind, but I would like to visit Roast again on a non-pujo day to explore more !

well my first visit to Roast was on saptomi eve.. better to say it was the resting place for us after all the pandle hooping. the interior was quite avarage but it was a homely atmosphere for being a resturent. now a food place must b known by food only and i am also trying to write so. we first ordered chilli pork which was nodoubt amazing. it was crispy from outside and soft from inside. the coating was also not very thick so u can easily bite the meat which was really tender.then we opt for beaf and chicken steak. the beaf was soft compared to some very wellknown trditional places,so my teeth got blessing on puja eve. the chicken was well grilled as it was a well mixture of tangy and mildness. the only fault i found that a lil more spice was needed to make it little tekhi..
overall a good dinner to sumup our puja dinnerArnab Alankar Samaddar

Well, went here yesterday, it was a nabami evening. I ended up here by mistake,actually. I was craving  a nice,juicy lamb burger with a tall glass of vanilla milkshake and my go-to option for this was Rubi's Grill. Well, I had no clue that Rubi's Grill had closed and the restaurant was transformed and renamed 'roast'.
Well,both me and my partner did take a seat and decided to dig in.

We were handed a shortened and temporary puja menu which I was not very happy about. Still, we opted for a monster tenderloin burger and since there was no milkshake available, we just had to settle for a virgin mojito. Seconds later, the waiter came to our table with an apologetic smile and reported the unavailability of mojito. We then asked for fresh lime soda instead which too was UNAVAILABLE.We had to make do with thums-up.Since it was during the pujas and the place was recently revamped we chose to overlook the shortcoming, though it s really not a good first impression for a restaurant if things as basic as soda water or mojitos are unavailable. 

Well, on the upside the burger was pretty good. I will be honest when I say this that when the burger was served I WAS a little disappointed by the size, maybe my idea of 'monster burger' comes from American cookery shows. But, halfway through it we were already full. The solid beef patty was really heavy and the strong aroma of chopped garlics and herbs infused in the patty was a treat for a foodie like me. I would have preferred caramelised onions and no tomato in my burger though, but that of course might not be the case for everyone. The side of French fries and also a couple of chicken sausages tucked inside the burger buns was an additional treat. My only recommendation for their burgers atleast, would be the choice of personalising  the filling. The waiter was really friendly though and seemed genuinely apologetic about the hiccups that occurred. Hoping for a better experience the next time around.

We ordered for Golden Fried Babycorn, Roast Chicken Wrapped in Bacon, Chicken Steak and Chicken Tetrazzini and I must admit, we were mesmerized. The quality and flavours were maintained unbelievably well, and the ambience adds a cozy comfy feel to the place. Planning to go back there tomorrow again.

After the whole day of pandal hopping last evening i went to this new place with few of my friends. We were really taken by the decor of this place its simple yet very classy. All of us were starving hence ordered for the meaty monster burger and bbq meat pizza. Oh!!!! what a delight it was for us to have the meal the burger is aptly named as it seems like a festival of meat going on inside your mouth. There's bacon, chicken sausages and beef in the monster burger and everybite is just pure bliss for meat lovers. I am falling short of words in trying to explain the exact fun and pleasure i derived from this burger.... Guys its a must try for everyone visiting this place. Coming to the pizza the first thing that stole my heart away was the crust which is very essential for pizza lovers the thin crust, the crakling noise the moment you take a bite. Needless to say this pizza had the perfect crust and again the feast of savoury flavours coming out of the meat with the cheese melting in the mouth. Yummy!!!!! I fell in love with this place. To wrap up such a scrumptious meal we had chocolate brownie for dessert it was the perfect icing on the cake. The dessert sealed the deal for us. Great food....soothing ambience and warm welcoming staff. One of the best places in town...will be back soon with family...its a must visit for everyone.....

Exhausted and hungry, after a round of pandal hopping this year, some of us friends found this place unexpectedly as previously there used to be this other famous food joint over here which shut down. This place is no disappointment. Personally i found it very nice and spacious. Very much a pocket friendly place with mouth watering delicacies. We could just have steaks 'cause they turned out to be very filling. I will visit again to have more!

We are two Canadians living in Ballygunge and have been walking by the restaurant over the past few weeks as renovations have been underway. We finally saw that it was open and decided to try it out. The decor and ambience was great, we especially appreciated the creative light fixtures. 
For our dinner, we enjoyed two chicken burgers that reminded us of home and had onions rings and sweet lime sodas to go with. Overall, the service was great, the restaurant was clean and the food was delicious! We'll definitely be visiting again.

Roast is the newest addition from the guy who has really made a mark when it comes to meat cravings . After creating a bold statement in " bangali rao beef steak bhalobashe "  , from his endeavours in the steak factory , he has now ventured into another outlet which is quite similar but still has got its own niche . We are talking about meaty stuff, a joint which targets to be a meat lovers paradise . Taking over from "Ruby 's grill " which was itself a meat lovers destination , this new joint promises to deliver bigger ambience , a bigger menu and a new brand . 

For now the restaurant is serving the puja special menu which I have attached , but they will soon deliver all the items in the menu given in zomato . Being an avid meat lover I could not resist the temptation of waiting and went there to try them out .

° Location :- situated at the dover lane . The best way is to go to gariahat and then identity the lane that houses the sinhi park puja Mandal . From the area where the Mandal is constructed you have to take left walk a few paces and then you will reach "Roast ".

°  Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- Pretty much impressed as to what they have done to this place especially when I knew what Ruby's grill was like . There are no longer any space constraint as the joint houses seats in both inner and an outer space which ever you choose to occupy . Although we sat inside I thought the outer part was more cosy for couple seatings . Nevertheless, ambience was quite good . You can have a glance at the kitchen while seating . The service was good considering the items we took . Serving time was close to 10 mintues and the presentation of food was quite good .

------------------------------------
FOOD :- Now let's get straight to the part where all meat lovers droll . We ordered :- 

1. BBQ pork ribs ( 4/5 ) :- This was the best of the evening . There were 3 pieces of cooked pork meat , the ribs were detached from them . The meat was tender with a very little bit of fat something which is heavenly for pork lovers . Non pork lovers can have this an instantly fall in love . A good pork ribs dish can change a person's appetite . This was one of them . Served with French fries , this was a perfect item to order . A small suggestion would be to make the pieces 4 at that price . Highly recommended .

2. Caribbean chicken roast ( 3 / 5 ) :- Heard a lot about this one was but was not that impressed . Yes, the meat was once again tender but I was expecting a bit more in the preparation . The preparation is similar to every other roast chicken dish that is to offer in the other outlets of the city . The sauce that came with it was stunning and that saved the dish . It had the flavor of mushrooms and went well with the dish . Still not a bad dish to try but not a new one.

3. Tenderloin steak ( 4/ 5 ) :- Pretty basic your normal beef steak . We preferred medium cooked and so it was . Served with sauted veggies and mashed potato , it was like was we expected and we were dying to have a  beef steak like that . The veggies and mashed potato went perfect with the meat and I am sure everyone will love it .

4. Virgin mojito ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Almost the best drink to go with when you are having a lot of meat . It is really cold and the quantity was enough for one . Served in a jar it was pretty cool to look too . Please order this drink while you are having the meat here .

--------------------------------

° Verdict :- We expected it to be good and we were not dissapointed.  But , I will come back to try the items which have a lot of potential like the roasted octopus . Thereafter this review will be edited . For the meat lovers out there if you can't wait then come here and eat , you will surely not be dissapointed .

All the very best to Rohan chanda and hoping "Roast" becomes a meat lovers paradise .

Definitely worth a visit. The Pujo menu is short and precise. The spicy chilly pork is the perfect appetiser with the perfect blend of fat and lean meat, which most restaurants get wrong( pork lovers will understand). The Carabean Chicken Roast is juicy and the sauce served with it adds a delicious touch to the meat. Will definitely pay another visit soon.

This new restaurant has come into being at exactly the same place where Rubis grill used to be. I came to know that the owner has changed,  and so has the cook. Whether this change is for the better or worse will be proved in due course. It was their first day in business and luckily my visit was like a first day first show encounter. They have come up with more seating capacity and a basic yet decent decor. They are stuck with the movie themed wall hangings. The original menu as I can see is available in Zomato,  but for the time being they have stuck to the puja special menu. I ordered the Caribbean chicken roast which was a treat to the eyes. It was lip smackingly delicious. The hint of mustard and the mushroom sauce served with it resulted in an overwhelming concoction of taste, flavour and aroma. The Basa fish was beautifully made, but the quantity was a bit of a disappointment.  Particularly the absence of mashed potato was felt. The chicken Caesar salad was freshly made, but there again the absence of garlic bread asked for a compromise. 
Still overall I was satisfied and would recommend people visiting it. I would give it a second try after the pujas when their full menu would be on board. The review would be updated likewise.
