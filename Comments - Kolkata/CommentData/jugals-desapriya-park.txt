Yes I have a sweet tooth...No better choice than jugals. Wide variety of sweets starting from rosogolla to mishti doi to nolen gurer mishti. The speciality of the sweets over here is that, it enhances the taste buds.I forget to maintain my diet , atleast four to five variety pleases me.

Located opposite to the tridhara sammilani club, or walk in 6mins the road beside Ashoka Hall or Dugout, Southern Avenue is a old sweet shop of kolkata which is famous for its chanar jhilipi, rabri, or its varied sweets.
They serve all sorts of sweets of various price range. Evening delicacies are also available like samosa,nimki,etc ; Overall it was a nice experience. 

The staffs are friendly i need to mark that point.

During my tuition days near Desapriya Park, visiting Jugal's had been a daily affair. I wouldn't rate it as high as the other well-known Bengali sweet shops in the city, but their rasmalai and rasgullas are still the best stress-busters!

Jugals holds a special place in every bongs heart even their their quality has deteriorated  ever since but they still manage to serve decent sweets at decent prices till date. 

From their Chanar Jilipi to Lengcha and then their sandesh ranging from Rs 10-15 are quite good. 

Got their Green Mango Sandesh and a white sandesh and both were fresh and delicious. Appropriately sweet and size is great!

Jugal's , a good one for sweet lovers around desapriya park. Tried it several times for different sweets & snacks.

Rasagolla, here is really delicious. Dahi bada needs special mention, they are mouth watering!
Sandesh & singara are good too.

Overall, a nice & sweet sweet shop!

I've been visiting this place since I was a child. My personal favorites are singara and kheerkodombo. Unfortunately, can't say the same about their service. The staff is rude, disinterested and make you feel unwelcomed. There's no way to give feedback directly to the owner so I hope the owner takes a note of this feedback and either fires the staff or drives some sense into them. One specific scenario that I'd like to call out - my father passed away 2 weeks ago and he was specifically fond of the singaras from Jugal's. Thus we decided to order packets of sweets and singaras for the shraadh ceremony. My aunt and sister spoke to them about the order and mentioned the date and offered to pay advance. They refused to take the advance and said they will give the delivery on the date without prior advance. After a few days, I dropped in to confirm the order but they nonchalantly told me they can't fulfill the order. I was very disappointed and hurt at the casual behaviour of the staff. I placed the order in another place and will never visit Jugal's again.

I was gifted a box of sweet from this outlet of Jugal's by a friend of mine. He bought in two types of sandeshes. I liked one of them but however the other one (which is depicted in the image above) was not at all tasty. Infact I did not have it after a bite.
Since, I did not personally visit the outlet, I cannot comment on the other factors of the place.

My mom's office is located near Rashbehari Avenue. On her way back home she encountered this particular outlet of Jugal's and eventually decided to purchase some sweets. She chose to parcel  and brought them home. I generally don't have a sweet tooth but on my mom's insistence, I tasted them. And, I don't regret my decision. They tasted like heaven. Yum and authentic.

** Brief = Have been a visitor since childhood as my maternal uncle's house being nearby.

** Ambiance = Great and the people there are super great, always attending with a smile.

**Recommended = Rosogolla, Chomchom, pantua, Sor Bhaja, Rabri, Rasa malai.

Also love their chocolate mishtis.

Their rabri is probably one of the best in Kolkata.

** Purse Check = Spend Rs.100/- and you can try an array of heavenly sweetmeats.

Jugal's....on Rashbehari Avenue near Priya Cinema is a well known mishti shop. I think it's a part of a chain of mishti shops( they have one outlet in the Park Circus area, I'm not sure if they have others elsewhere). Here too their mishtis are quite good. Loved their kaacha gola, which was soft and tasty. Also their sandesh was soft and just the correct sweetness. Lovely. The shop is reasonably big and one can stand and eat there as well as take away in packets.They also maintain hygiene and it's clean.
A good shop to visit for reasonably priced Indian sweets.

Jugal's is one of the most iconic destinations for Mishti in this area and is so popular that the juncture it is established on has come to known by its name. Both the Roogolla and the Mishti Doi are the trademarks here. While I have tried the former, the latter still remains untried.

The rosogolla is soft and almost feathery. It melts in your mouth. It is hard to stop yourself from going for seconds. Some other delights on offer at Jugal's are- the kesor bhog, taalshash, kheer kodom and kalakand and the rasmalai. 

You must try the kheer kodom and rasmalai here.

I've tried very few sweets from this place but what I have been eating since I was in school is their 'dahi vada'. Soft vadas immersed in flavoured yogurt mixed with spices. Yum!
Also, today I tried their 'chenar jilipi' and it was delicious. You ca. Really taste the ghee that they use for frying in it.

One of the iconic sweet shops in Kolkata. Never really got to try and of their sweets but have had their Mishti Doi countless number of times. Truth be told, their Mishti Doi is regarded as one of the best in this city and gives a strong competition to Amrit's aka Amrito. A must try if you are here even if you do not wish to try their sweets.

A decent sweetmeat shop located in rashbehari. Its the nearest from my office so have ordered some sweets from here. Sweets worth mention are gulab jamun and mishti doi. The mishti doi here is a must try. Recently I packed chocolate sandesh and mango sandesh from here and honestly didn't find them good.
This place is average compared to a ganguram or ballaram or even some unbranded local shops like Jal khabar that churn out mouth watering sweets!

Pretty average.

They serve traditional Bengali sweet and are not engazed with the recent trend of fusion sweets. For that reason they are probably lagging behind from the other big names for sweets.
Most of the items have balanced sweetness. Those who like more sweetness may feel it little bland. Sandesh are a bit dry.
Conclusion: Neat and clean traditional sweet shop.

I tried darbesh and roshomalai.. Very good... balanced sweetness. The size of sandesh is also good. I have tried most of the sweets of Jugals over the years. Its one of my desired shops. They should consider keeping Lassi in their menu. For summer afternoon.. a couple of sweets and a Big glass of lassi is what you desire..

They have a good variety of traditional Bengali sweets. I particularly like the fact that their sweets don't have an overt amount of sweetness.However,I really hope they come up with newer variables and try fusion.

They serve traditional Bengali sweet and are not engazed with the recent trend of fusion sweets. For that reason they are probably lagging behind from the other big names for sweets.
Most of the items have balanced sweetness. Those who like more sweetness may feel it little bland. Sandesh are a bit dry.
Conclusion: Neat and clean traditional sweet shop.

Located opposite Priya Cinema, this is quite an prominent old sweetmeat shop. The decor is nothing to write home about, nor is there any seating arrangement. Variety of offerings is acceptable. Pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side, considerably because of the locality it is situated in I guess.
I tried their gajar halwa & rabri.
The rabri was quite good, in fact one of the best I have tasted in kolkata, despite it being wee bit costly compared to regular shops.
The halwa was good , but could have been better.

A great sweet shop which turned mediocre with time. Though the Mishti Doi is still good to gorge on. And i would suggest this place for the same as there aren't many places selling good Mishti Doi in kolkata. Rest of the sweets are mediocre like any "parar Mishti dokan" (local sweet shop).

Jugal's - A Small sweet shop with Huge ceilings.
=====
Location: Jugal's is a sweet shop which is located in the More near Deshpriya Park
=====

Intro: This place is on my wishlist since a long time. Visiting this place reminds me that this place runs from quite long time because the attitude of the staffs says it all. Their conduct and body language speaks of giving the sweets fast to the customers and just make him leave the place. Nevertheless, this place looks super cool from the outside as it has huge ceilings. Once you enter inside, there are flies all over. The floor is filled with flies and sometimes even the sweets. I personally would not like to visit a place with all flies around.¬†
=====

What i tried:¬†

1) Gulaab Jamun - The Jamun here had the rose syrup inside it. As the name suggests. However, i have had better and much hot Gulaab Jamuns before. Nevertheless, one can give it a try here.¬†

2) Rasmalai - Usually, the rasmalai which i have is either very small round shaped ones or say somewhat sausage ones. This was more like a flat round structure. Tasted super awesome. Not too sweet. #musttry.¬†
=====

Pros:

1) Quite reasonably priced.

2) Service is fast.

3) I somehow prefer places with huge ceilings. It gives you space to breathe.¬†
4) Location is super awesome.
5) Have a large variety to serve.
6) A little hygiene is maintained with the 'use me' dustbin.¬†

Cons:

1) Hygiene is not maintained herein.¬†
2)The staffs can be a bit more courteous towards their customers.¬†
=====

Expert Suggestions:

1) Improve your quality.

2) Improve your hygiene.

3) Work on customer satisfaction.¬†
=====

Meal for two: 50-125
=====

Summary:

Food Presentation: 3.1/5
Food Quality: 3/5

Food Quantity: 3.3/5
Ambience: 3.3/5
Hospitality: 2.8/5
Value for money: 3/5
=====

Conclusion: Would only visit if they maintain proper hygiene and clean off the flies. With people being health conscious, they must improve their outlet.¬†
=====

Note: Unbiased Review based on my visiting experience.

Jerokom naam sunechilam, abhigata holo na, khub exceptionally bhalo noi. Rosogulla gulo besi misti. Customer service is not upto mark, the helper seems to be confused. Jeta chayechi seta ditche na aar akta kichu ditche. They should be smart enough to deal fastly with customers. 

Other services like drinking water facility is very bad, dustbin is dirty, no wash basin facility, floor is also dirty too.

But the location is prime. Jodi uporer bola gulo correct kora hoi, khob bhalo cholbe dukan ta.

Some people have the opinion that sweets from Jugal's are one of the best in town but I don't really find it so. For one, their sweets are a bit overpriced and the taste is not at all anything exceptional. It is just like any other sweet shop in a locality. There is nothing very exceptional about this place. The sweets are okay, the staff is quick to tend to you and the ambience is okay.

I would recommend this place to people, but I would add that there is nothing special like others say.

Location: A couple of minutes away from Priya Cinema.

Jugal's has been in the food world for years now and has been serving the people with authentic Bengali sweets of top notch quality. 
It is located right on the main road (Rashbehari Avenue Road). Happened to visit it during the afternoon thanks to my sweet tooth getting attracted towards the delicious magnets (read: Sweets). On seeing through the offering I could easily conclude that they specialized in the regular sweet fare rather than joining the new trend of improvised flavor sweets. Called for a Gur Rosogulla and a Sukha Rosogolla (As I have called it since childhood, sorry don't know it's real name).
- The Gur Rosogulla was so soft and simply melted in the mouth. Delicious!!
- The Sukha Rosogulla was dry and had the bite on the outside, yet soft from the inside. Exactly the way it should have been. Pure bliss. 

Loved both the sweets and got the Gur Rosogullas packed for my family members as well. A sweet experience it was. :)
- Have heard that Jugal's is famous for its sweet curd (Mishti Doi), Chocolate Sandesh, Gulab Jamun, Sandesh, Chumchum and Savories. Thus, would be back someday for its savories, mishti doi and Chumchum! The rest being due on a later date. Comments due.

"Jugal's" is regarded as one of the pioneers among the "sweets & confectioner" industry in Kolkata. This outlet is located in gariahat, adjacent to triangular park. Its a spacious and squeaky clean joint, selling the most traditional sweets and savories. Unlike other leading sweets outlets in town, "Jugal's" didn't engage themselves with the trend of "fusion" sweets and all; they completely dedicates themselves in offering the most traditional sweets in its best state. Though this joint doesn't offer too much of variety, but the limited number of varieties offered by them are served with perfection, oozing with quality and tantalizing flavor. From the traditional "talsash", "sankha", " ata sandesh", "chamcham", Misti doi(sweet curd); everything is offered here in its pure form and flavor. Hence in order to enjoy the succumbing traditional Bengali sweets in its authentic form and flavor without any kind of fuss or fancy nonsense, "Jugal's" is one of the best place to be in.

If there's one place that runs on nostalgia and good publicity,this is it. Located just opposite my physics tuition,I have tried almost everything from here.
The singara,chop and kochuri fail to impress and are overpriced. The sondesh and similar chenna sweets are often compromised in quailty due to bad chenna.
Nothing to write home about,apart from the swanky decor. 
The doi is the safest bet. But if you listen to me,don't bet if you can help it.

A landmark on Rashbehari Avenue, this has been there since my childhood serving decent sweets for years now. I have tasted their gulab jamun, mishti doi, sandesh, etc. I feel their sandesh are a tad dry and the sweet spectrum lacks a bit variety overall when compared to Banchharam, Balaram, etc in south Kolkata. Also tasted their kachori and singara which were okay but nothing really to be excited about. Overall, a decent place serving old bengali sweets suitable for grabbing a quick bite. Cheers!

Now this one is a famous name for all of kolkata's sweet lovers. Most of the time it is crowded and the sellers can never give you enough attention. But they have some of the really great bengali sweets and sweet curd. Recently I got to try their mango sandesh, misti doi and kalakand. I must say the kalakand stands out among all of them. It is amust try here !The misti doi was also good. The ripe mango flavoured sandesh was nice but sandesh not being one of my favourite, will stay at the bottom of my list of recommendation. Overall Impressive.

Used to frequent this "mistanna bhandar" (as we, the polished people of Calcutta, call it to any sweet-meat shop) whenever I needed to assuage my excruciating hunger. To tell you the truth, I was never unsatisfied with the quality of the sweet-meats they sold (and, in all probability, they still do). The ones I liked to taste were Gulab Jamun and Rasmalai. It's a sweat-meat joint, in plain language, without any accommodation for seating, but what gives it an edge over the others is the disposition and the demeanour of its staffs.

With its huge sign board Jugals is used as a landmark to locate any place at Rashbehari avenue by the locals.But I have been to this place a couple of times and I must say I have not been terribly impressed.The singara was average.The sandeshes were rather dry.The mishti doi and rosogolla were decent.The varieties on offer were a bit limited.With many of the popular sweet shops of today offering many different varieties which look and for that matter taste impressive Jugals lag behind in this regard.Most of the sweets are too traditional and one dimensional and even rather bland in appearence.Though it is pretty decent on the whole,I for one feel there are better options available.

Jugal's has been around for ages and dishes out pretty decent stuff. It has a faithful client√®le who swear by it and has maintained its quality over the years which is a huge plus. The sandesh are very good and always fresh. Rasmalai and Gulabjamun are very nice. Mishti Doi you can't go wrong with and they serve up a pretty good one. In the snacks I have sampled the singhara which was average and the khasta kachori which is quite nice. Not tried the other stuff. A good place to stop for a bite if your in the area.

Jugal's is a very familiar name when it comes to some well-known and traditional sweet shops across Kolkata. This outlet of Jugal's is no exception. It is one of the most visited sweet shops out there in Rashbehari Avenue.

The sweets are excellent, various sandesh, kancha golla, cham cham and other mouth watering sweets are available here. Snacks include radhaballavi, singara, khasta kachori and other stuff.

Efficiency wise no complaints and decoration wise, cannot expect a ton of modernization from such an old shop. The only problem that one could face is that the store often runs out of sweets during occasions such as pujas.
