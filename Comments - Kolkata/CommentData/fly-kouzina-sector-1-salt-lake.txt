I was planning to visit Fly Kouzina from a long time. But wasn‚Äôt getting company since none of my friends were very enthusiastic about visiting a vegetarian restaurant!. I had to treat a friend recently and she is a vegetarian, so I finally found the perfect opportunity to visit Fly Kouzina.¬†
It is a flight themed restaurant and the beautiful setting and ambiance of the place was enough to make us happy! The windows show videos of moving scenes which make it a real flight-like experience. We were fortunate to see two take-offs and two landings!

Went to this restaurant expecting some great food, decor and service after going through the many reviews on zomato.

The experience before I entered the restaurant was pretty poor. They have a really bad management about how you enter the restaurant.

Thankfully when you manage to finally get a seat, after waiting for a long time, both the decor and the quality of food is awesome and worth the money. The service was nice as well. 

To recommend this place to others I would definitely change the waiting queue policy.

One of the aircraft themed restaurant in kolkata.
Located in Salt lake sector 1.
This place offers for a wide range of vegetarian food items. Starting from the starters till the desserts I find it should be a legacy to visit this restaurant if you are a vegetarian.
We ordered for Mexican corn soup and Hariyali Paneer Tikka. The Paneer was fresh and large cubed pieces and I liked the taste of the green masala.The Mexican soup tasted in a sweet and sour and it was served hot.
Next we ordered for Pizza Kouzina. I loved the pizza .The thin crust with added olives,corn,and other pizza toppings. Tasted amazing. We ordered for an extra cheesy one though.
Next we ordered for some Butter Naan and Malai Kofta. Butter naan tasted good and was freshly made and soft. Malai Kofta was something of sweet in taste. It was creamy too. Kofta was soft. 
As a part of dessert we ordered for Tutti Frutti which was amazing. The different in tastes of fruits along with vanilla and strawberry flavoured ice cream scoop tasted amazing! 

Had a wonderful experience. 
Service was good. Food quantity and quality was good too.

it's an aeroplane themed restuarant and the ambience is good.the moving window scenes and the boarding pass add well to the theme . it's an all veg place and we had their special pizza which had many exotic veggies and was good. they don't serve indian food sadly in happy hours time so missed out on that. but if go from 4-6 .30 ie happy hour time u get 30 prcnt off your billing which is cool .the service is very good and i may visit this again.

üî∏Deco/service : Very much lived up to the flight theme. Well maintained and great service. Unfortunately I forgot the man serving us but he did his job well. The place is much in demand despite being vegetarian so visit early or waiting can be a pain.
üî∏Food : A M A Z I N G
Must try : veg lasagne ( can't even tell you how amazing it tasted. Better than even chicken lasagne üòù)
Crispy chilli baby corn
Shirley temple : loved this drink
Pizza kouzina can be given a try. Brownie was superb, very very moist and chocolaty. @
These were the stars.

Portion size is also good. Pricing is apt looking at the near flawless service and food. Waiting time isn't a problem, nearly 15 mins for each course to arrive.

Miss : Seating.. It feels a little cramped. Probably because of the theme. They took the economy class too seriously. For larger groups, you may face an issue in finding a big table all to yourself.

We reserved a table through Dineout app and got 10% discount and additional 20% cash back. So a 1863 bill was lighter on our pocket. Use my code : RJWZN while downloads and get 100rs off on 1st bill payment. Happy dining. 

Still I do recommend this place. Am visiting again.

Wonderful experience at this place! It's a pure vegetarian restaurant serving all kinda food..be it North Indian.. Chinese.. continental. It was fun to feel like sitting in a plane and having delicious food served by the flight attendant and supervised by captain himself! The food was served soon after we placed the order and it was just amazing. The price is a bit on higher side but it's totally worth spending! Plus we also got a boarding pass as a discount offer for next visit! üòä

It tasted heavenly and does redefine the meaning of "soul food".
 For a hardcore meat lover, this place still managed to make it a blissful experience! It's one the finest vegan restaurant in Saltlake, Kolkata. Situated at AD - 73, Near BD Market Bus Stop, Sector 1, Salt Lake City, Kolkata.

An absolute must visit. Top notch ingredients, laid back comforting ambiance, and a fusion experience like none other.
 With no exaggeration, not being used to eating so healthy, at first bite I was taken back of how delectable vegan food could taste. To the extent, I craved for a "sinful" dessert in the end which also of course was sugar free and what not.¬†

Dine in here alone, or take a date, you cannot go wrong will be surprised.

Must Order :

STARTERS :
1) Hariyali Paneer Tikka
2) Barwan Firdosi tandoori Aloo
3) Moroccan cheese cigars
4) Pizza Kouzina
5) Cheese Fondue

MAIN COURSE :
1) Butter naan
2) Nargisi Malai Kofta
3) Munnaka Bharwan Palak Kofta

DESSERTS :
1) Walnut Brownie with Chocolate Syrup
2) Creme Brulee with Apple Compote

Thank you for the beautiful journey I had. Keep up the good job Crew. I had a an awesome flying experience.¬†

Would definitely visit again to try other items.

Fly Kouzina is one the finest vegan restaurant in town.
Starting with the name as you can guess it's just an themed restaurant with an interior design of the ambience of flight.
The ambience is lovely with fined decors and the waiters are dressed as crew members.Yes. you can imagine how lovely they looked with black suit and that cap.
Coming down from the menu they provide you with a variety of finest vegetarian items amongst them some of which we tried out is :
‚è∫Ô∏èMushroom Cream Soup: Was the best soup i ever had from any other restaurant.It was Smooth creamy and delicious and the mushroom was well minced and added to it.
‚è∫Ô∏èHariyali Paneer Tikka: Paneer cubes was large and tasted great and more importantly the Paneer was neither uncooked or overcooked which is one of the problem we find with the Paneer.
‚è∫Ô∏èBarwan Firdosi tandoori aloo : Boiled Aloo pieces/Cubes were stuffed with masala Something out of box as the stuffing was too good .
‚è∫Ô∏èCheese fondue: The liquid Cheese was great.
‚è∫Ô∏èPizza Kouzina : Pizza is bae. The best veg pizza i ever had in my life ‚ù§
‚è∫Ô∏èButter Naan : The pieces were good.Neither too small neither too large .
‚è∫Ô∏èDal Makhani : Another of my favorites.
‚è∫Ô∏èNargisi Malai Kofta : The koftas were soft and the curry tasted a bit sweetish on side .
In desert we tried for some Cheesecake and Tutti Frutti. One of the best cheesecake you'll find as the taste is just awesome to be in your tongue for some days .Tutti Frutti was great.Assorted with fruits.

Had a wonderful experience .
The service was good.
The ambience was just a 10 on 10 Along with the service.

Fly Kouzina is one of the most beautiful fine dining vegetarian restaurants I have been to...as the name suggests it's a themed restaurant showcasing the interiors of a flight..even the staff are dressed in accordance with the theme.. I would like to give a full 10/10 to the ambience, decor, and service.. and a special mention goes to Pritam and his team for the prompt service..niw coming to the most important part what I had..
Since am down with cold I preferre@d to go with some soups unlike my pals who settled with some super amazing mocktails..so this is it--- cream of mushroom soup and mexican corn soup..
They are known for their starters so we went high on them---
Hariyali panner tikka
Moroccan cheese cigars
Bharwan tandoori alu
Pizza kouzina
Cheese fondue
For the main course we went low key --
Butter naan
Nargisi malai kofta
Munnaka bharwan palak kofta
for the dessert we had - cream brul√© and it was amazing..
This place is very close to my house situated in salt lake sector 1 and they definitely know how to please the customers coz each and every food item wass a treat to our taste buds..

I visited long back just few days after it opened. Concept was nice but due to heavy rush we were very ill treated also because we were just 2 and they were giving priorities to families (4 or more) which we really disliked. Coming to food, we dint enjoyed much. Hope one more visit will change the review.

Formulating the concept of aeroplane in their restaurant,Fly Kouzina deserves much appraisal for its service and food. Their speciality is delectable vegetarian food. Each and every dish you order will be praise-worthy i can vouch on that.The place is beautifully decorated and the service being absolutely top-notch. 
Mocktails: 
Virgin Magarita(strawberry)- really refreshing and beautiful
Virgin Mojito(orange)- yet another refreshing drink which is absolutely worth trying. 

Starters:
Mushroom Cream Soup- sheer heaven this is. Its rich and beautiful. Highly Recommended.
Mexican Corn Soup- this soup is packed with flavours. You get the spicyness from the soup and then the corn bits add a different texture to it. Highly recommended
Crispy Chili Babycorn- need any additional description? As i said earlier, whatever you order will be praise-worthy.
Bharwan Firdosi Tandoori Aloo- ahhh this is like wow. Dry fruits incorporated tandoori aloo. The spicyness from the tandoori masala and the crunchy sweetness from the dry fruits and the softness from the potato is just mind-blowing. A big wow.
Hariyali Paneer Tikka- beautifully cooked paneer and the flavours were perfectly balanced.
Broccoli Corn Dumpling- awesome. A must must have dish. You just need to try this one if you are a momo/dumpling lover.
Moroccan Cheese Cigar- another highly recommended dish. That oozy cheesy goodness when you bite into it is just the thing you want. A praiseworthy dish.
Spring Roll- this is so good. I liked it.
Main Course:
Lasagne de Verde- the best lasagne i've had till date. Trust me guys i absolutely loved it. Its difficult for me to describe how beautiful this was. Highly highly recommended.
Pizza Kouzina- a lot of toppings and cheesy goodness goes into making this pizza. So naturally the flavours just bursts out. Only one word- yummm.
A few of my friends ordered a few indian dishes from which i sampled a few and some of them need special mention in my review
Desi Videsi Jugal Bandi- basically mixed veg which tastes absolutely fantastic. 
Kaju kumb Mattar Makhan Wala- this is my absolute favourite. The gravy is just awesome. Highly Recommended.
All of the above indian dishes i paired with tandoori roti and mixed masala kulcha. Heavenly combination.
Desserts:
This is my favourite part. Being a dessert-freak,i cam vouch om the fact that Fly Kouzina serves beaitiful and some wowsome desserts you will come across. Here i am just gonna give ratings for i will surely be at loss in describing how gorgeous the desserts are
Classic Cheesecake- 5/5
Walnut Brownie with chocolate syrup-5/5
Creme Brulee with apple compote-5/5
Tutti Frutti-4.5/5
Fried Ice cream-4.5/5
Fly Kouzina you just made me fall in love with veg food all over again. I am coming to this place again. Thank you for the beautiful journey I had- the best journey I had.

This place was on my wish list for long and today I finally planned a lunch here with my friends. 
The ambience of the place is very nice . The staff is very cooperative and polite . 
We ordered a choice of cream soup - mushroom . A delicious thick and creamy soup , the best way to start lunch.
Next we ordered 
Crispy chilly baby corn - the quantity was good and the taste was superb . 
Malai paneer tikki - the presentation of this dish was amazing . The tikkis tasted even better than what I had expected . The crispy outside engulfing a very soft filling of paneer. The dips were good too.
Cheese cigar - when it comes to cheese , the taste buds expect a lot and they totally met the expectations. This was my favorite starter. U must try this .

We also had a pizza kouzina , which was again very delicious. The crust, the toppings , and the presentation .. on point.

For main course we ordered nargisi Malai kofta ,palak kofta and Desi videsi jugal bandi along with assorted breads. All the dishes were perfect in quality as well as quantity. Very rich in taste and aroma . Also we had vegetable pulao which was delicious , assorted veggies and perfectly cooked rice .

Finally for desserts
Classic cheese cake - the presentation was WOW . It took me a while to get over it and to start eating it . Tasted yummy too.
Tutti Fruty - the fruits , ice cream and syrups blended in a way to make you go crazy about it. Simply loved it .

It was time to take off at Fly Kouzina with their much talked about interiors which resemble the fuselage of an aircraft. The staff, all dressed as in flight attendants added to the feel. Hence full marks for the ambience and special mention goes out to Mr. Pritam and his team who did a great job with the service adding to the dining experience. Coming to the food, it was delicious with the starters stealing the show, a filling and tasty main course followed by some quality deserts. 
My picks out of the menu would be: 
-cream of mushroom soup
-malai paneer tikki
-broccoli and corn dumplings
-kaaju kumbh matar makkhan wala and,
-strawberry cheesecake

Fly Kouzina, Sector 1, Salt Lake City. A first restaurant with theme based of Aeroplane. Its amazing, you get boarding pass, you get table near window where a loop recording of a flight taking off from the Airport and landing back is shown. The ambience is cozy and  warm. The service is excellent. Food is delicious. Whenever I go, I have cold coffe. Cold coffe is amazing. Personally, I feel good being at this place.

Awesome Family Dining place. I would suggest make a booking or else you might end up waiting long beacuse it was crowded on a Monday evening as well. 
They live up to their name. You will actually feel you are Dining while flying üòÑ They have these small flight windows which constantly play a video of plane on motion. We witnessed a real landing on it üòâ
The attenders adorned in the cabin crew attire, internal decor, seating arrangement, light music and complementing Menu card, complete attention to details impressed me! 

Now the food is lip smacking delicious. We being non veg food lover were a bit sceptical about Veg food but were amazed by the taste it offered. We ordered Cream of asparagus soup (must try), Manchow Soup, Crispy Babycorn (never tasted such crispy ones), coriander and chilly Mushroom (this was crispy too and nicely spiced with Green chillies, beware if someone can't tolerate spiced food), hakka noodles with Burnt Garlic sauce (this had good amount of veggies and we did not need a side dish) , fresh lime sodas (great quantity) and finally deep fried ice cream (delicious).

Overall I loved all the food items, would definitely visit again to try other items. Keep up the good job Crew üòÑ I had a an awesome flying experience üòâ

Last Sunday that is 30Oct I had a visit to Fly kuzina ....had heard a lot about this restaurant....basically when we are talking about kolkata its really difficult to get a pure veg restaurant ......so just went to have the experience of onboard meal and that taste ...my friends are a regular visitor to fly kouzina we ordered pizza kuzina crispy baby corn ....and the indian ...i guess it was paneer lababdar or something ....to my utmost surprise ....it just stood up to my expectations..ill also give 9 on 10 to hospitality although it was crowded .....we were taken atmost care .....there was proper dinning system .....staff were friendly and also that lady was really cheerful with a pleasant smile . Captains were taking orders and taking care of our requirements from time to time ..I am not from kolkkta so I got really amused visiting to such place like this n being a bong girl I prefer non veg only but visiting that place was totally worth it...would recommend my relatives too ...only thing that ill suggest would be the music ...it would be better if they have good collection of musical sounds t@hat we get to hear on airport ...that would give a real ...almost real feeling of sitting in plane ...rest price is also a bit more as compare to quantity of food....but its fine I guess when u get such a fine class service food and hospitality ....high five to fly kouzina team ....will see u soon.Cuz I am loving it.

I would have rated them a 5, had it not been for the constant rush the restaurant seems to be in. So much so that you actually feel like you have to hurry through the entire meal just so other guests may get seats. That was the ONLY let down: we didn't get enough time to enjoy the brilliant food.

--Food : Being a hard-core non-vegetarian, trust me when i say this - these people sure know how to make you fall in love with purely veg food! Every dish was well thought out, well seasoned and perfectly cooked and not for once did we miss our usual "maachh-mangsho". :P

--Ambience: If you don't really mind people sitting too close to each other in a tiny space and talking at the top of their voices around you, i guess one would actually enjoy their meal. We went at night , so i wouldn't know what the situation is during the day.
And regarding the hyped "flight experience", there wasn't much except a boarding pass that they hand to the ONLY person who's booked the table. So don't expect much there either.

--Price: Reasonable. Very. Four of us ate for around 1400/-, and we had two drinks, a soup, an appetiser, two main courses, and a dessert. Which is great, actually!

All in all, despite the hurried meal, i wouldn't really hesitate recommending this place to my meat-lover friends. :) :)

For me visit to fly kouzina was totally worth it....and thank you for making my friend birthday so happening...... See u soon fly kouzina..... Keep up the good work always..........

Had heard a lot about this place, to an extent that it‚Äôs an aircraft from inside. Well it‚Äôs split into two parts, on the one it‚Äôs made to resemble an aircraft and the other is a like any other restaurant with aircrafts hanging etc etc. 

The tiny windows have take off, landing, and taxiing video running. But are you really served food in a flight at any of the above. Concept failure I guess but it still attracts a lot of local crowd from salt lake maybe because the food is pretty ok. I mean I didn‚Äôt try anything but Indian as I found that would be the safest option. 

It‚Äôs usually crowded during weekends thus would suggest to go on a weekday and try the food when it‚Äôs a little less noisy and maddening. Please give a pass to the staff (Stewarts) because a couple of them are truly jokers of the highest order. Dressed like captains, I wonder how a senior pilot or first officer would react seeing  duplicate-captains serving food and taking orders.üò≠

A pure vegetarian restaurant with interiors resembling that of an aircraft. You can actually watch the flight taking off and land through the windows. :-). The staffs are dressed as flight crew members. They take your name and contact details and issue boarding pass, so don't forget to ask for one if they don't give already. The staffs are courteous and always there if you want help. 
Coming to the food,  we ordered virgin Mojito,  Jalapeno cheese balls,  manchow soup, and spaghetti in mixed sauce, and fried ice cream.  All of them tasted quite good, but the spaghetti tasted delicious. I am definitely going to come back again for their spaghetti. 
Pocket pinch is moderate,  but they do add service charges to the bill. 
Overall a nice experience.

Very nice ambience. They have all their staff dressed like inflight crew-air hostess, ground staff, pilot. The dining couches have false windows replicating the view from a window seat. The ceilings and aisle have the same feel.
The food was decent. Manchow soup was okay, and fried Ice cream was a novelty. What was impressive was the spaghetti. Loved it.

They have a discount on off-hours till 7 I think. We received it. They also gave a next visit discount in the form of a boarding pass. Sadly, we had to remind them and ask for it. Management,please take note. The customer shouldn't have to remind you of your  services.
Overall, it was a nice experience. The lady also took my number, and later the restaurant texted their appreciation. A bit incursive in my opinion, but altleast they try.

This place in salt lake is an airplane theme based restaurant. Food is good but the service really sucks. We ordered a fried ice cream which was replaced twice as it was not properly baked. Even after getting replaced it tasted the same. So the service isn't good at all. Price is a bit on higher side when compared to quantity. Ambience is really nice and a good work is done on the theme.

One of the most hyped resturant of kolkata.I dont know on what basis the ratings are dis much high. Except the ambience ,there is nothing spectacular about fly kouziana. A pure veg resturant with a classy ambience but what it lacks is a delicious food. Too many items in der menu card with classy names but nothing classy about it. Ordered roll which was d only thing i liked .Coming to the main dish malai kofta was very rich on look but lacked taste. And in  their western course ordered vegetable strongonafe which was very ordinary and even bad in taste.
Well for ambience 5/5 while for food just 2/5
Price are much high and the quantity too low. In just few order of two people the bill was around 1300 while we ordered only main course and one starter though. A complete disappointment it was.

Yes i was also confused once i entered the place.
With a theme of Flight inside..this place has a good ambience.
Way of giving the boarding pass once u are seated in your seats was something unique.
We tried paneer tikka masala and chola masala..the taste was good.

Horribe treatment to the customers. We were told that our table was confirmed and we received a confirmation text from the restaurant itself. But we were denied the table on arrival. Inspite of the fault on their part, they behaved rudely and there was no sense of respect. Worst experience ever. We walked out on them and we're never going in ever again. Will not recommend this place to anyone. They should shut down the place. No professionalism at all.

It's an absolute treat to be here! Themed restaurant done right. 
The decor catches your eye and wins the heart. The seats are arranged and designed like that in an aeroplane. To top it, if you look out of the "window", you can see a video clip, as if you are on a plane on a runway or flying through clouds. 
They issue a boarding pass in your name, which guarantees a 10% discount on the next visit, within a month. Great touch! 
For starters, we ordered Jalape√±o cheese balls and Aloo Sumilan. The cheese balls were okay, but Aloo Sumilan deserves a mention. Cheese and aloo and vegetables with a crisp outer crust, served with pudina chutney. Lovely! 
We tried the Mexican corn soup, chef's speciality. I am not a big fan of soups, but this was delicious. Good mix of spices! 
Next, we ordered 2 mocktails- Berry Blast and Kiwi Margarita. Berry blast has all kinds of berries served over crushed ice. You will love it! Kiwi Margarita was also good. 
Our main course was Onion Kulcha, Masala Kulcha, Dal Makhani, Desi Videsi Jugalbandi, Veg Stroganoff. 
Dal Makhani is lip-smackingly amazing! Must-have! Desi-videsi was nothing extraordinary. 
Veg Stroganoff was loved by all of us and we ended up ordering it again. 
For desserts, we had Creme Brule and Fried Icecream. Both were amazing and I can't decide which was better! 
Only thing I don't understand is the addition of 5% service charge. If you do that, you aren't eligible for a further tip. 
Anyway, thanks for the lovely dinner!

Lovely ambiance, few gimmicks with plane landing and taking off since the whole feel is as if you are sitting in an aircraft. Fast service and quick to attend, staff smiles. 
Now what puts your off after all the goods. The place give you a low fare aircraft effect, with noise levels not allowing you to even chat with your partner, plane having a passenger train feeling, the background music has no meaning, Portion size is to the levels of almost cheating, the container looks sizeable from outside but has shallow base within, one can barely eat in two people with one portion, you pay far more for too less. With so many rewards and accolades one needs to be proactively looking into these preferences.

First ever aviation themed restaurant in Kolkata, located at salt lake sector 3, this is also a pure veg one. With airplane like interiors and staffs dressed like cabin crew, the best part here are the windows, which simulates view of an airplane in flight. They serve a variety of cusine like Indian, Chinese, continental, etc. We ordered the Tandoori Jashn platter and Spring Rolls and Virgin Mojitos as appetizers. Masala Kulchas, Garlic Naans, Paneer  Butter Masala and Dal Makhani were our main course. We also decided to try their special continental dish Risotto Alle Verdure and I must say it didn't disappoint. It was a cheesy and buttery delight. I must say the food here is so sumptuous that you will not miss non-veg dishes at all. Price of the food is appropriate as per the taste.

I am a hard core non vegetarian. Yet decided to hop in with my pure veg friend.

Decor is something just excellent.
You will feel you walked into a flight and as you sit you can see the flight windows which have a great effect. The feel is like you are flying and eating.
Ambience is the reason you should go there once at the least.

Now coming to food, it is just awesome. I never could have believed that vegetarian food could also be so delicious. 

Must tries--Dal Makhani and Virgin Sex on the Beach.

Kolkata - no more just a place for " MISTI DOI " ( Sweet Yoghurt )

Such beautiful conceptualisation and such tasty food add to that a tinge of attractive presentation and yes you get this place.
One more thing - PURE VEG place to dine. Simply Love it.

An UBER ride to this place located in the plush salt lake place with easy accessibility. The area is divided into 2 sections - the most hyped is the section which gives it an aerodynamic view and the other is the simple restro. Though the food served in both the places is the same so we just had a look at the plane and took a family sitting place for 6 in the adjacent compartment due to ease of sitting.

Chinese bhel - one of the least popular dishes can be made so romantic at this place - do give it a try. It's semi spicy with deep fried noodles and fresh veggies - a indo-chinese fusion you would love.¬†

The other starters paneer tikka, dahi kebab all are freshly marinated and served with lot of love and care. One plate is enough for a group of 4 so do order judiciously.¬†

They offer a variety of main course curries but do not miss their malai kofta - it has very very freshly kofta's made of fresh dairy " Channa" which breaks into fine pieces once it is chopped and cut into halves.¬†
Stuffed naan is something different and has a lot of flavour in it.¬†

We were almost full and then on extreme request of the waiter we order their desert - some ice cream sundae whose name I do not remember - The lesson I learnt here never order even the most fantastic dishes when you are full - you will end spoiling your food experience.

Over all a wonderful place to dine and be in. Do give it a try.

I have been to this place twice with a large group of Family and ordered food on two occasions,& I can say with confidence that any item on their menu, even the ones that sound experimental to you, can be ordered without hesitation, because these people are absolute experts when it comes to their Preparations. And their theme is also very well done. Make reservations because there is always a huge waiting here.

For all those who find it difficult to eat in aeroplanes, this is just the place for you. One can (more or less) experience the look and feel of an aeroplane (minus the constant humming and occasional turbulence) especially with the way chairs and windows are designed. Great Indian food complimented with great service and a pure vegetarian joint. Do try the Dal Makhani, it is one of the best and team it with Garlic Naan, Dil khush hona hi hai!! :-)

For the first time I enjoyed so much in completely a veg restaurant . The ambience including the staffs and the presentation was quite cool and soothing for Sunday lunch with my friends . The interior looked exactly like of a plane and it got the echo system which happens for real . But a few suggestions to give : if there could be a non veg counter along side and some arrangements for drinks would make the place more happening . I know it's a family kind of restaurant but would appreciate this fine gesture for the thirsty customers like us . We had a proper veg lunch consisting of yellow lentils ,butter nan , mixed vegetables and steamed rice . I was so busy eating the tasty and finger licking dishes that did not get the chance for clicking . However the shows stopper was the creme brulee which looked and tasted heavenly however I'm not such a person with big sweet tooth . Over all the lunch was quite tummy filling .

This place is really good for a dineout.. for vegetarians it has a number of delicacies that cannot be resisted.. starting from the jalapeno cheese balls to the crispy chilli babycorn which is adorable.. the Shahi paneer dish.. has really fine taste... that can be taken along with kashmiri pulao.. which has great essence added to it.. in the beverages ..they have a collection of virgin mojito with mint and cranberry flavours.. last but not the least the walnut brownie adds to the completion of the food.. it has been a good experience until now..!!

One of my favourites in salt lake.
Food:- no complaints
Service:- no issues
It would be great if they add up more variety of dishes in the menu.
I asked for red sauce pasta and unfortunately it wasn't available.
Meanwhile, it is best for north indian food.

The place and the food is amazing. The staff is very polite and friendly. Place is a must for people who like North Indian food. Khao Suey is a must try for people who like Burmese dishes. Fried ice cream is an art and barman's pitcher is simply amazing. Overall the place is worth your money

Concept wise it's a great place to visit and have the feel of sinking while you are flying . The food was complete vegetarian and was good , but not that great to be compared to other veg restaurants. 
The staff was very well behaved , cooperative and understanding. Timely the dishes were served and crowd was maintained. 
Do visit once for a different experience.

Went to this place for a late lunch. I found the service to be horrible. While placing the order we asked for their recommendation on certain cuisine and elaborating about our choice of food. The quality of the food served was horrible. 
They also have problem with their card swipe machine(s). I gave them three cards and they turned down all the cards stating that the network is down. Finally I had to pay by cash. 
In the feedback form, we marked all the parameters as "excellent" and the quality of food as "good'. The waiter came back and kept on requested us to mark them "excellent" on quality of food. This was highly unprofessional. 
Lastly while leaving the place we called uber and it was raining heavily. In front of us, they offered umbrella to other guests who arrived in cars. When our turn came to board the uber cab, two waiters stood still and let us get drenched in rain. 

Request to the management of the facility, please improve the level of professionalism.

This restaurant was said to be built on the theme of airlines... Well at first the impression from the exterior failed to impress but once inside the d√©cor may suit your liking. Luckily  reached before the dinner hours and were lucky to get a table immediately but otherwise I will recommend that a table should be booked before you go there. Coming onto food I ordered the Dahi jeera tikka for appetizers and it was something really different and good. Food was good and the quantity enough to fill you up.  Overall an above average experience.

This place is one of the most perfectly themed restaurants I have visited!

Great ambience..aeroplane feel ,boarding pass &the windows with the screen...make it feel even better!

The restaurant offers a variety of cuisines...indian, chinese, oriental , italian....a lot of options to choose from!
We went there in evening around 4 pm ..so decided to order spring rolls & lasagne de verde!

The spring rolls came is no time ..was impressed by plating...nicely served with sweet-chilli sauce...tasted crisp and delicious!!
As we finished it..lasagne was served! So , was really impressed by the quick service....
The aroma from lasagne was really tempting! It was served with 2 slices of toasted bread...the quantity served was sufficient for 2 persons...tasted awesome!!

Overall ..a nice experience!

Many of my friends who lives in Salt Lake told me about this vegetarian restaurant. Normally I prefer non vegetarian mainly, but why not try for once....So We went there for dinner. This is the one and only aircraft themed restaurant of Kolkata. The interior basically looks like the inside of an airplane. You get in and you feel like you're in a flight. We also found boarding pass of your name which lets you avail discount on your next visit. The waiters are dressed like the cabin crew, and the food taste also delicious and the presentation is great. Visiting here again soon.

Even though this place has been around for quite some time in my neighbourhood, finally made my first visit here. I had heard good things about this place n I wasn't let down. 
The staff is courteous and extended warm hospitality at all times, which is one of the prime parameters for me to recommend a place. I was pleasantly surprised to note that despite being a busy Sunday evening the service was pretty prompt. 
Coming to the ambience, it's quite unique in style with flight cabin style seats. The most intriguing feature for me was the side panels which show visuals like an actual flying experience - take off, landing, taxi everything. Made me feel like a kid onboard her first flight üòù
We ordered cheese cigars for starters, followed by dal makhani, some spinach kofta dish, masala kulcha n biryani for the mains. It was all very likeable. 
M surely gonna visit again soon to try the other delicacies the place has to offer!!

Horrible "boarding" experience. This Airline, like most other Airlines, seems to have a problem with punctuality and professionalism. We arrived at around 9 15 in the evening... saw a long queue outside but decided to wait. The captain said it would take approximately 30 to 45 minutes, we said ok. After waiting for 40 minutes I checked with the captain ..how much longer? 5 mins he said ...then again after few mins ...same reply.. an hour and half later, I saw we were the only ones left waiting. Now we were late but definitely not last, as I had seen at least 5 other "families" arrive after us. The captain for some reason had us shoved at the bottom of the queue. Already late and with very few other options available nearby my patience gave away. I gave the captain a piece of my mind and  thanked him for ruining the evening. He still insisted we wait for 5 more minutes. With literally no one else waiting alongside we gave him another 5 minutes. Someone left, we got in and finally sat down after waiting more than one and a half hour. Not even done reading the menu... the flight steward comes and asks us to order everything immediately as the kitchen was closing. F. U. This  Airline's food shall forever suck.

Recently, I ordered food twice from this restaurant recently and I found the food quality quite good. The first time I ordered Hyderabadi Shufta with Butter Roti. The vegetable Shufta was really good and not like anything I have had before. The second time I ordered Lasagne and it was out of the world. They pack the food neatly. The prices are quite high, but the quality is amazing.

Plane food (and that too vegetarian) has never really been something to look forward to, right?

Being a core non vegetarian, I don't frequent towards Vegetarian Restaurants but this was a choice considering the theme one evening which turned out to be nice.

Decor, you can't miss it.
On the quieter stretch of Salt Lake City, there stands an airline beacon signage right on the pavement. As far as theme restaurants go, the novelty and adaptation of a particular theme is the first thing that one catches.
From a sliding glass partition entrance to exact replicas of steel chair lounge at the refurbished modern airports in India, at first glance it is impressive. Inside the feeling is enhanced. Entering into an exact aircraft design, with well demarcated leather aisle and window seating, complete with the aircraft lighting and window screens at each table giving the outside view through bobbing clouds and blue sky. The waiters are dressed as crew members. Actually, the only things missing are the strap-in seat belts and the Captain's announcements ;)

There are 2 cabins; the first cabin is reserved for larger groups of diners and the second cabin is where groups of four can be seated.

The menu makes an appearance in its multi-cuisine rainbow splendor. 
Fly Kouzina provides an extensive multi-cuisine menu with an array of Chinese, Continental, and North Indian cuisines.
It is the tidbits of airline history which makes it more interesting read than the regular on the go menu.

We ordered Paneer Tikka for starter which was superbly done with just perfect grilling.
Therafter ordered Dal Makhani, Kadhai Paneer, Thai Green Curry, Veg Pulav, Garlic Naan and Tandoori Rotis. The portions served were sufficient, generous in quantity.

Service was brisk , staffs were courteous and the food - scrumptious. What more can a diner ask for.

Taking a break from the breweries and pubs or the dhaba culture, Fly Kouzina is good change.

Found the bill to be on a bit higher side but its worth the experience you go through.
In nutshell, it was an admirable experience with the restaurant and the food (obviously). Recommended !!

Food quality is below average. 
We had ordered dal makhani , tandoori aloo and garlic nan and tandoori roti.
The quality of dal makhani was very poor. Tamdoori aloo was still ok. There was plastic inside garlic nan, they had changed it when we complained. Tamdoori roti was quite thick.
The only thing saving the restaurant is their ambience and the corteous staff.

Fly Kouzina is one of my favorite dinner restaurants in Kolkata! Usually when I go there, I order North Indian food, Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Garlic Naan and fresh lime water, and I totally love it. This time I decided on trying the cheese Risotto and cheese cigar, in order to fulfill my cheese cravings. I don't think it could have been any better! I love the food, I love the ambience. The staff is polite and prompt! It's a perfect place to have a good dinner with family or friends. 

The prices are a little high, but I believe it's totally worth it!

The staff is extremely courteous and warm. The service is brilliant. 

Try pairing up mint lemonade with cannelloni Florentine. The food was very well cooked and is a must try!! 

A must visit restaurant in the heart of Saltlake.

Being a devoted fan of chicken, I hardly visit any pure vegetarian restaurant; but thanks to one of my veg friends, Bhawna, whom I asked to join me in a vegetarian lunch in Sunday afternoon. Earlier I heard of their aircraft based theme, but the moment we stepped in, I was overwhelmed with the splendid decor. We did not order much.¬†
¬†(1) Cannelloni Florentine (4.5/5): This is basically baked pasta with cheese and spinach fillings. The cheese and spinach is so well cooked an blended, one will automatically be relaxed with the melting sensation in the mouth.
(2) Risotto Alle Verdure (3/5): This is fine but not as good as the former was.
(3) Virgin margarita (5/5): This comes in kiwi or strawberry flavor- a bit of spice - and a perfect combo of salt and orange juice. We ordered the strawberry one, and it was refreshing and very very tasty.
The bill was 750 inclusive of all taxes and we think it worth the money.

This place made me fall in love with vegetables and I would like to visit here again and again.

Went for dinner on a tuesday with 13 family members without booking. Was disappointed due to half an hour waiting time. Food was good as expected and the service was also remarkable. However, the family dining area was missing the ambience and the feel. Also, location of the washroom just besides out table was a major irritant. Please avoid this table as sight of the washroom inside every now and then is quite annoying. Some complimentary items could be added to make people feel a little pampered.

Fly Kouzina is a perfect dinner date for your family!
We had reserved our seats on Zomato in advance and reached the place on time. The seats were reserved under my name and I was given a "boarding pass" with discounts for the visit next time.
We ordered Broccoli Corn Dumplings (4.5/5) and Malai Paneer Tikki (5/5). The Broccoli Corn Dumplings was their signature dish but we enjoyed the Malai Paneer Tikki more.
Then came in the Pizza Kouzina üçï (5/5) which looked good and tasted even better, overfilled with cheese.
For the main course, we ordered Cheese Paratha (5/5), Shahi Paneer (4.5/5) and Methi Malai Gobi (4/5) and Kashmiri Pulao (5/5). Everything was delicious and upto the mark, especially the cheese Paratha which was just amazing. The quantity was good enough for a group of 4 or 5.
For Dessert, we ordered Date Pan Cake üç∞ with Plum Sauce (3/5); Cream Br√ªl√©e with Apple Compote (4.5/5); and Tutti Frutti (5/5) - it was so good that we ordered one more!
Overall, it was a great experience. Definitely a 9 out of 10! :)

But the main course over here has disappointed me on both the occasions. Once we had ordered noodles with veggies which were okayish. Same for the north indian food. 
May visit again in the future to try their starters

The restaurant is aircraft themed in salt lake sector 1 and its divided into two sections one for big gatherings like ppl come in groups and second section is air plane themed. In one table maximum six ppl can accompanied. The staff were dressed like cabin crew ppl. The only missing things was air hostess....jokes apart come to food.

First we order appetizer peneer tikka and crispy chilly baby corns. Well CC baby corn was good but i m bit disappointed with paneer tikka as paneer was not soft its make feel paneer as rubber.

Thereafter we order lasagne.... its was the superstar of our dinner.lasagne sheet and vegetables are perfectly cooked.

Then the main course we order desi vedeasi jugalbandi, paneer butter masala and dal makhani with masala kulcha. Jugalbandi was taste very good but its very spicy. Paneer butter masala and dal makhani was ok.

Will visit again yo try other varieties.

"Fly Kouzina" the name itself is enough to make people understand that it has some theme related to aviation, 
So let me tell you it is an Aviation themed restaurant having interiors of an aircraft and the Staffs are dressed like Cabin crew team.
The service is lightning fast and pleasant.Starting from the soothing-to-the-ears-but-not-too-loud-to-drown-your-voice-during-conversation music to the luxurious seats, 
everything is exemplary. A must visit place for vegeterians and north indian food lovers. This place is a *paradise* for vegetarians. Now the mocktails, these place offers a huge variety of mocktails, finally we settled for Barman's Pitcher and Berry Blast. 
Barman's Pitcher was Red Bull based while Berry Blast was a mix of Cranberry, blueberry and strawberry. Tried their Broccoli and Corn dumplings was a surprise and made me wonder , who the chef is? He has been really working on his Culinary skills.
Dal Makhani ‚Äì Good, 

Kadhai Paneer - Fine, nothing much to brag about!

Pudina Paratha ‚Äì Exceptional ‚Äì truly pudina!

Plain Naans - Fine

Masala Kulcha ‚Äì Good

Complimentary vinegar onions as well as pickles did provide leverage, but our expectations were much higher than what we actually received ‚Äì both in terms of quantum served as well as taste. Mind it ‚Äì they serve pretty niggard quantities, so it is advisable to order huge chunks at inception itself!

They even gave us the boarding passes.
Fried ice cream and the hot chocolate sundae souffle were too good.
Ambience gets 10 out of 10.
A must to go place .....!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Even after pre booking a table they made us wait for an hour and then made us 8 people sit in a table which is meant for 6. When we arrived there they asked us to wait for half an hour which end up being an whole hour. Further, what was more frustrating that they were not giving us straight answers.
The food wasn't that bad but not that good either looking at the cost. The menu also wasn't versatile. Almost the same thing we get anywhere else. The place is not big enough if you ate going in a gang. It is ideal for maximum 6 people.

First and foremost, the ambience was awesome.its an aeroplane themed restaurent trying to deliver a look and feel of "in flight" dining. we enjoyed it a lot. we tried oriental dishes. The food actually tasted awesome! we then ordered mocktails which proved a bit dissapointing!
overall it was a very good experience, though i felt it was a bit overpriced...

Welcome to the one and only aircraft themed restaurant of Kolkata - Fly Kouzina! If this isn't enough to pique your interest, let me tell you that this is one of the finest vegetarian restaurants that this city boasts of. Located at Sector 1, Saltlake, Fly Kouzina will surely give you an experience like never before!

My fellow blogger, Subham Ghosh and I were invited here for a food tasting session. On reaching the restaurant we were warmly greeted by the owners and the PR. Fly Kouzina is divided into two sections - the family lounge meant for big groups and, the other is the aircraft themed dining area, that totally resembles an aeroplane. To enhance our experience we were given boarding passes which had our names and seat numbers. It further had the details of the offers which were active in the restaurant. What really caught my attention was the uniforms of the staff which was similar to those of crew members on a flight. Another interesting point was the LED screens in place of windows which depicted scenes from an ongoing flight.

Without much haste, let's start talking about the food.

MOCKTAILS :

We were served with two mocktails, Kiwi Margarita and Strawberry Margarita. Both the drinks were served in salt rimmed glasses, and tasted amazing. My favourite was the Strawberry Margarita, which was a blend of Strawberry and Orange juice. The Kiwi Margarita had a tangy taste and was very refreshing.

STARTERS :

‚Ä¢ Bharwan Firdosi Tandoori Aloo - These were tandoori grilled potatoes stuffed with dry fruits, green chillies and spices. It was served with mint chutney. Being an ardent fan of potatoes, I absolutely loved the impeccable taste of this dish. The Mint Chutney went perfectly with this heavenly dish! If you're looking for a potato starter, it couldn't get more perfect than this!

‚Ä¢ Broccoli Corn Dumplings - This starter is one of the signature dishes of Fly Kouzina, and rightly so. These dumplings were stuffed with minced broccoli and corn. The texture was brilliant and the stuffing tasted superb. Never expected broccoli to taste this good! This dish was served with spicy Schezwan Sauce. If you want to surprise your taste buds, go for this one.

‚Ä¢ Malai Paneer Tikki - Another wow starter arrived, and this looked so tempting. These tikkis had mawa stuffed with cottage cheese, and was served with Makhani Sauce. The tikkis were so soft that they were almost melting in my mouth. Such excellent dishes could easily give the non vegetarian kebabs a run for their money!

MAIN COURSE :

‚Ä¢ Pizza Kouzina - This was the Chef's Special pizza which was loaded with cheese, paneer, bell peppers, broccoli, corn and olives. Although it was a thin crust pizza, the crust was not wafer thin, much to my joy! The pizza tasted excellent, especially when paired with the Pesto Sauce it was served it. All the ingredients added to the taste enormously and it turned out to be super flavourful!

‚Ä¢ Cannelloni Florentine - Hands down the best dish of the evening!!! Home made pasta baked with cottage cheese and spinach spells perfect! The amount of cheese was sinful and made this dish my favourite. I've always been a fan of baked pasta, but wasn't sure how a veg version would taste. But let me be honest, this exceeded all my expectations and just blew my mind! If you're visiting Fly Kouzina, You. Need. To. Try. This. Period.

DESSERTS :

‚Ä¢ Date Pancakes with Plum Sauce and Ice-cream - Never been a fan of dates, but this dessert changed my views. This is a recent addition at Fly Kouzina, and my oh my! One has to taste these pancakes! The pancakes were stuffed with dates and deep fried, hence the crispiness. Special mention to the Plum Sauce which enhanced the taste ten times!

‚Ä¢ Creme Brulee with Apple Compote - This dessert looked beautiful. Served in a glass topped with a cherry, it looked divine. This was also served with vanilla ice cream. Another speciality item of Fly Kouzina which won my heart! This one's for all of them with a sweet tooth.

We ended our dinner with some amazing desserts, and all I have to say is that - Fly Kouzina is one of the best pure vegetarian restaurants I've visited over the last decade. The food, the ambience, the hospitality, the service, everything was top notch. It is hard to find a restaurant which has no glitches in any area. Fly Kouzina, you've won my heart! Here's a true blue carnivore promising many more visits to this pure vegetarian restaurant!

We went on a Sunday night, the restaurant being overcrowded, they asked us to wait for 45 mins, but we were allowed a seat only after 1.5 hours. The management needs to work on this, as anyone would tend to get angry when the waiting time is doubled.
Coming to food, the food was good. The flavours, the quality of food, serving plates, the dressing of sabzi, and kulcha, was appealing. Must try panner butter masala, and dal makhni. Even the masala kulcha was we'll stuffed with masala, and the kulchas were soft.
Pindi Chana had too much salt. 
The ambience was something to reckon with. Seats, tables, and the surroundings were well matched with the theme of restaurant. Even the waiters and captains, were dressed in the attire of the theme.
The waiter at the table, however, seemed overworked and forgot to serve us the food. He even failed to refill the water. Had it not been for prolonged waiting, and the waiters forgetfulness, this restaurant would have definitely got a 5 star rating from my side. üòä

Being a hardcore non vegetarian, I hardly give pure vegetarian restaurants a visit. But one such restaurant which recently changed my conception and bowled me over with its food was none other than Fly Kouzina. I was invited here for a food tasting session. So let me take you on a journey, narrating my overall experience at this place.

Fly Kouzina is an aircraft themed multi cuisine restaurant in the heart of Salt Lake. It can be considered as one of the best themed restaurants in the city from the first look of this place. The interiors are beautifully done. The first section is a lounge, which is mostly for groups and gatherings. The second section perfectly resembles an aircraft. The seating has been well planned. The waiters are dressed as crew members. Even windows have been constructed with LED screens, which show actual scenes viewed from the window of an aeroplane. This place is the best example of a themed casual dining restaurant.

I was accompanied by my fellow blogger, Nilanjana Bagchi . We were greeted with utmost hospitality by the owners and the PR. On our arrival, we were given boarding passes containing our name and numbers, along with the seat number, thereby giving the actual flight experience. These were not just normal boarding passes. The offers which are currently ongoing in the restaurant, are printed on the reverse side of the passes. The menu for our dinner was suggested by them, which included the signature dishes of Fly Kouzina, along with few of the new inclusions in their menu. The service was pretty fast, considering the crowd in the restaurant at that point of time. Let's move on to the food and drinks that were served to us !

We tried two mocktails - Kiwi Margarita and Strawberry Margarita. My favourite was the Kiwi Margarita. It was chilled and refreshing. The sweetness was balanced and the flavour of kiwi was beautiful. The Strawberry Margarita was good as well. It was a blend of strawberry and orange juice. You can go for either of the two, depending on your choice of flavours.

The first appetizer to reach our table was the Bharwan Firdosi Tandoori Aloo. The name is tricky and so is this dish. The potatoes were stuffed with dry fruits, green chillies and spices. They were grilled in tandoor and served with a mint chutney. Potato is my favourite vegetarian item and any potato dish is always my preference. So I had huge expectations from this dish and this actually surpassed all my expectations. The potato was soft and well grilled. The stuffing was heavenly. The sweet and spicy filling tasted great with the mint chutney. Want to fall in love with potatoes again? Give this dish a try !

I've heard a lot about the Broccoli Corn Dumplings. I was eagerly looking forward to try this special dish. Six steamed dumplings were served in a basket. To be honest, I believe nothing can beat non vegetarian momos or dumplings. But these dumplings were the first to change my vision. I would recommend all my non vegetarian buddies to give this a try for at least once and I'm sure you'd regret for not doing that till now. Well, I was taken aback by the amazing dumplings. The texture was perfect, while the minced stuffing was brilliant. The medium spicy Schezwan sauce deserves an additional point for its beautiful flavour that went well with the dumplings.

After two beautiful starters, I was pretty amazed. But little did I know that a lot more surprises are on their way. The Malai Paneer Tikki which came next was Mawa stuffed cottage cheese balls. This was equally amazing as the other two. The tikki was soft and delicate, so as to melt in my mouth. The makhani sauce played a special role by imparting a beautiful flavour to the tikkis. I'm ready to skip non vegetarian kebabs if veg starters turn out to be so good !

We started our main course with the Pizza Kouzina. It was the chef's special pizza topped with enermous amount of cheese along with paneer slices, american corn, bell peppers, onions, olives, broccoli, etc. The pizza was thin crust yet had the consistency, which I loved. This was unlike most other places where thin crust pizzas crumble. The cheese and the toppings had their own magic, giving a beautiful flavour to the pizza. It was served with a pesto dip, which went well with the pizza.

The next was Cannelloni Florentine. Home made pasta was baked with cottage cheese and spinach. I completely fell in love with this dish. It was extremely cheesy, yet not overpowering. There was a proper balance between the flavours. The layer of spinach was beautifully cooked. I'm personally a fan of baked pasta and this is definitely topping that list !

With a full stomach, we moved on to their desserts. The first one was Date Pan Cake with Plum Sauce. The pancakes were stuffed with date and deep fried. They were sweet and super crispy. The pancakes were served with plum sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This is a rarely found dessert which is definitely recommend.

The last dessert was innovative and my favourite. It was Creme Brulee with Apple Compote. This dessert was presented in a glass, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This is the speciality of Fly Kouzina and I agree to this fact since I kept running my spoon till the last portion of this dessert. It was heavenly. The apple compote containing juicy apple chunks was excellent.

Overall, I'm more than satisfied and happy with Fly Kouzina. It's after a long time that I feel so enthusiastic while writing about a pure vegetarian restaurant. The ambience, the food, the service and the hospitality found here is unparalleled. It's not easy to find everything in a single place and Fly Kouzina has proved to be brilliant blend of all these factors. I'm definitely coming back and that too with my hardcore non vegetarian friends to try the other dishes on the menu !

Moroccon cheese cigar was not upto the expectations, being chef's special. The Mexican corn soup could have been a lot better. The Desi Videsi Jugalbandi and breads were not at all value for money. However, Walnut Brownie was the saviour. Ambience gives a good feel. Loved the boarding pass concept. Staff very courteous. Overall, a good place for "one time" visit.

it was our first time today.. went for dinner with family.. the ambience is quite exquisite.. the interior is decorated as a plane.. with each table having digital plane windows.. the waiter's and the staffs wore cabin crew uniforms..

since the place is crowded during weekends, we had to wait for 20mins to get a table..

once settled, the waiters were quick to take the order.. water was served in wine glasses‚Äã..

we ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Cream Broccoli for starters.. where the former one nailed it..
for main course, we ordered Butter Nun, Gobi Manchurian and Methi Malai Gobi.. and some chocolate ice cream for desserts..

Food: 3/5 (need to try some more items next time)
Ambience: 4.5/5 (one of the finest designed pure veg restro of Kolkata)
Service: 4.5/5 (0.5 deducted since they gave us the bill of a different table)
Overall: 4/5

would be visiting again shortly ‚ò∫

Worthless Veg restaurant scoring high for their ambiance

Food: We ordered cheese cigars, one brownie sundae and a milkshake. The cheese cigars were 4 fish finger like structure containing cheese instead of fish. The brownie sundae was so so. And the milkshake was absolutely worthless. Food quality and quantity both were downright worthless.

Ambiance: The interior is shaped like an airplane which is a good concept. The bill comes as boarding passes and all the staffs are dressed as cabin crew. That is the only plus point of this restaurant.

Service: Staffs are helpful and service is okayish. However, for the three items we ordered, our bill came above 900/-. We weren‚Äôt even half filled. Absolute waste of money. 

Overall: Only visit this place if u have a lot of money to waste or if you have never been inside a real plane and want to see how an airplane interior looks like. Otherwise, totally stay away from this place. Basically, the food served in flights r better than the food served here.

The food is great, decor is simply out-of-the-box, but the one thing nobody can beat them in, is the hospitality. 

I was remotely located and have been planning for a surprise treat for my family, today. It was a matter of phone call, and the team kouzina was all set with the necessary arrangements, decorations,  making the day a memorable one for my family. 

They went out of their way to customize their service based on customer request, and that is exactly where they left an everlasting impression. 

Fly Kouzina - this one gesture proves that you stand out from the rest.

Keep up all the good things about your restaurant.

Family restaurants got boring? Well this one will spice things up in your regular restaurant experience.
With a top notch ambience with the interiors of a plane, each family is greeted with an amazing staff and a boarding pass per group.

Staff: Courteous and well trained. Sometimes a little lag during rushes but thats understandable.

Food: We tried almost every tandoori starter on the menu. It was incredible.
Dal makhani is a must try. The breads were well baked and cooked.

Drawback: Dont go with a group of more than 6 because the sitting arrangement does not allow to make more than six people sit together. We were 12 and we wished we had brought walkie talkies.

Have heard a lot about this restaurant and finally got a chance to visit it on my recent trip to Kolkata. A pure vegetarian restaurant built on an aeroplane theme. Went with a group of colleagues and experience was mesmerising. From starters to deserts or from soup to mocktails, everything was sooooo good. Staff were well groomed and were very courteous. Few items which definitely need a try are veg dumplings, chilly mushroom, tandoori aaloo, vegetable lollipop, barman‚Äôs pitcher. Overall experience was very good and will definitely visit again on my next trip to Kolkata.

Till now the exprnce has been good. Slightly pricey but they have never let us down in 5-6 visits in food quality n service. Could increase the size of the portions.

The discount card is a let down as most people would not eat at the same place every month. It's validity should be at least 60 days, to be useful

Had heard and read a lot about Fly Kouzina, and I must say that it was true. It's a theme restaurant where the interiors are made like an aeroplane and the waiters are dressed like the cabin crew, but do not worry, the food isn't like the ones server on a plane :P The food was really very good and did match my expectations. Visiting here again soon.

Fly Kouzina ticks off all the right parameters of fine dining. They tried to emulate the interiors of a flight and accomplished it perfectly. Starting from the soothing-to-the-ears-but-not-too-loud-to-drown-your-voice-during-conversation music to the luxurious seats, everything is exemplary. Service was remarkably swift. All the items were cooked to perfection. While leaving, you would wish, if only real flights offered such gastronomic delights.

One of the best pure veg restaurant in north Kolkata. It's famous for the food and I liked their friendly service as well. It's expensive but pure veg restaurants are usually expensive in kolkata if you're looking for ambience as well. Not sure about other days but that day there was mostly marwadi crowd.

I have ordered Jain Dal Makhani 3 times from here. First 2 times they were more than fabulous. The last order I had was pathetic. It also felt like I could do being hungry.
I have never had any complaints, but the orders placed through Zomato or Swiggy, are either never passed on, or the restaurant person never reads. I am a Jain, and I specifically order Jain Dal Makhani, Butter Naan, Roasted Papad. They always give Onion, when I am a Jain. I have mentioned, not to give Onion individually, but to no avail.

Otherwise, the food is awesome, and a bit over priced.

The theme is unique. A very spacious restaurant with the interiors of an aircraft. The service is lightning fast and pleasant. The food was exceptionally well cooked. Even the lassi had its ingredients in perfect proportions. We tried their kulcha, lachcha parantha and paneer makhani and we are not complaining. However the place has a diverse menu. The only disappointment is that it serves vegetarian food only. But to each his own.

I had a bad experience in this restaurant, I booked the table for 9pm in advance and I was given table by 9:40,  Then what was the purpose of booking table in advance, Still we thought that food might make up but The starter was good. But the main course was not that good, And the main part was I ordered 4naan and the waiter told that they were out flour so we cannot have any of the breads except tandoori roti, then what is the point of serving north indian when they cant give the food. And the service was also very slow.

This place is a *paradise* for vegetarians. Being a non vegetarian first I was not sure about visiting this place, but I made up my mind to visit this place for lunch with my friends. And this place stood up to my expectations. The food, service, ambience everything is awesome.
It is located in sector-1, salt lake and is easy to locate. It is an airplane themed restaurant and the ambience is too good. The service is very prompt and the staffs are very courteous.
Coming to the food, we ordered Moroccan Cheese Cigars for starters, Dum Handi paneer and Roti ki Tokri for main course, Barman's Pitcher and Berry Blast for mocktails. Moroccan Cheese Cigars were average but the dip along with it was too good. Roti ki Tokri consisted of Masala Kulcha, Butter Naan, Laccha Paratha and Tandoori Roti. Dum Handi Paneer was very good.
Now the mocktails, these place offers a huge variety of mocktails, finally we settled for Barman's Pitcher and Berry Blast. Barman's Pitcher was Red Bull based while Berry Blast was a mix of Cranberry, blueberry and strawberry. Both the mocktails were equivalently good. Would like to try the other mocktails in the menu as well.
The prices are a bit on the higher side. Overall a very good experience here. Good Food , Good Ambience, Good Service.

Writing this review after visiting Fly Kouzina twice .

It's a Restaurant with in Flight theme, wherein the interiors are close to interiors of Airplane.

Generally theme based Restaurants forget to focus on the food they serve, but Fly Kouzina surprises here. They have focussed on the Food as much as the interior and Service.

Have tried Indian, continental and Oriental at their place.

While the Indian food is good, Continental fine, Oriental is ok.

Tried their Broccoli and Corn dumplings was a surprise and made me wonder , who the chef is? He has been really working on his Culinary skills.

This flight themed restaurant will attract any foodie even though it is a pure veg restaurant.
Just after entering one gets the feeling of the flight.
They evn give the boarding pass.
Fried ice cream and the hot chocolate sundae souffle were too good.
Ambience gets 10 out of 10.
A must to go place

A new place in Calcutta which we tried during our few hours stay. The restaurant has the "airplane theme" and it definitely justifies it by seating , uniform of staff and those panel windows on the side of table which shows the take offs and landing.

Apart from being the themed restaurant , the food is really delicious and staff is very courteous.

If I have to suggest I will definitely recommend Pizza Kouzina and Chocolate Shake.

Located 1 block away from 4no tank and 2 blocks from pnb salt lake.
This is a vegetarians delight. 
Well not a veggie myself. Usually prefer meat over veggies but this restaurant serves absolutely delicious vegetarian dishes. 
Tried panner bahar. It's two thin slices of panner sandwiched into one with pesta and nuts as its stuffing. Cookied in tomato taste, a bit spicy but good.
Next up was shahi paneer, it was cooked in white sauce. Low and spices and just perfect for someone who doesn't like much spices.
Next was kaju kukbh matar makhanwala well didn't like this one. It was also cooked in tomato sauce it's just that the mushrooms and the sauce didn't blend in.
Apart from the main course we tried lasagne de verde , it was baked to brilliance a must try here and one dish was cannelloni florentine it's a another baked dish based on spinach it was great too 
Also tried garlic naans and cheese naans. 
If you're cheese lover you would love the cheese naans.

It's usually very crowded so do take some in hand as you at have to wait.

Wanted to have good food and found this place on zomato. We decided to have an early dinner and walked into the place around 7 pm. So there were not many people around and we easily got a place. Nice and calm ambience, good soothing music and some very good and satisfying food. The staff was cordial and checked for our liking of food and in case we wanted any customisations to be made in our food. We were two people and ordered 
Starters
American corn in hot garlic sauce - They offer an option "Make your own Starter" so we picked American corn and hot garlic sauce. It was nice and crispy.
Jamaican Mojito - It was mojito with a hint of strawberry, pineapple and ginger. It was different but good. Just a little bit more sweet for my palette.
Main Course :
Dum Handi Paneer : This was a red onion and tomato gravy which was nicely made. Paneer pieces were good in size and quantity, soft and flavourful.
Pudina parantha, butter nan, tandoori roti - Pudina parantha had layers and was just rightly crisp. Butter nan was soft and good.
Overall enjoyed the food and experience. I would recommend this place for a good vegetarian meal.

Airplane food has never really been something to look forward to, right? An aviation-themed restaurant in Salt Lake aims to turn that idea around by serving wholesome multi-cuisine vegetarian food.¬†. ¬†Fly Kouzina in AD 73, Sector I, Salt Lake (near BD Market bus stop) is calling all veg foodies. When you arrive at the correct gate, the sensory doors will slide open to allow you inside. The first cabin is reserved for larger groups of diners. The second cabin is where groups of four can be seated.
                                                                ...

Well, I am a frequent flier of Indigo and yes, today I decided to fly again, but this time with Fly Kouzina! 

A visit to them was long overdue ‚Äì may be since their inception and grapevine about them being a pure veg aeroplane themed restaurant which serves great food! Location is pretty accessible, nearby the BD Market Bus Stop at Sector 1, Satlake. Ambience, pretty nice with attendants dressed as cabin crew members and windows styled like the aircraft ones ‚Äì you do get a genuine Indigo feeling!

I was offered my ‚Äúboarding pass‚Äù on arrival as well. However, we were disappointed at they declining the Axis card discount of 15% (which is still reflecting on their Zomato page).

To kickstart, we ordered their coveted crispy babycorns ‚Äì which was a beauty! And yes, by crispy I indeed mean ‚Äúcrispy‚Äù ‚Äì it was great to taste a babycorn of such calibre! For mains, we ordered :-

Dal Makhani ‚Äì Good, not great

Kadhai Paneer - Fine, nothing much to brag about!

Pudina Paratha ‚Äì Exceptional ‚Äì truly pudina!

Plain Naans - Fine

Masala Kulcha ‚Äì Good

Complimentary vinegar onions as well as pickles did provide leverage, but our expectations were much higher than what we actually received ‚Äì both in terms of quantum served as well as taste. Mind it ‚Äì they serve pretty niggard quantities, so it is advisable to order huge chunks at inception itself!

However, full marks to them for presentation as well as service.

Prices are pretty high and they are not doing true justice to your pockets!

Full flight ambience, they also give you a boarding pass just to make it look more real :p
Their service is really prompt and helpful.
Loved their food - had ordered for a garlic bread, American corn, Pizza & penne mixed sauce pasta.
Drink - mint lemonade - such a wonderful drink
Very different from normal lemonades.
A good experience !

This place is one which no veggitarian should miss ! We started with Chinese bhel and Paneer Sheek. Both were superb and out of the world, even without onion and garlic it tasted heavenly. The main course included Nargisi Malai Kofta and Aloo Bharma Bhojpuri with onion kulche. We also had fried rice. All of the above were superbly cooked and tasted Yummy to its core. Do not, i mean do not miss this place. The experience is asking amazing and the manager is very cooperative !

Hi all,

I have been here twice and both times, their awe-inspiring taste and service didnot fail to amaze me. I have tried spring roll (which is awesome) ,lasagna, risotto among the appetizers and in main course, we took dal makhani malai kofta and roti basket. Apart from the food , the environment is new too.

Pros

1. Tasty food
2. New environment
3. Very prompt service

Cons

1. Bit noisy , maybe the day we chose was not good But yeah there was alot of noise.

Suggestions

1. To give more of an on board flight feel, maybe you could run some announcements similar to those made in flight.

2. You could serve the food in trolleys to give ur customers an in flight experience.

3. Man, the screen is not put correctly, for the person sitting on right, the flight is moving towards your kitchen and for the person sitting on left, the flight is moving towards your entrance.. maybe rotating anyone side of lcds is a good idea.

Date of Visit - 12/03/2017 the day of Holi
Ambience - 3.5/5
Food - 3.5/5
Service- 4/5

The staff in the restaurant is very friendly and the security helps out with the parking in a very polite and respectful manner. Once you enter you get a boarding pass with your names and some prevelant offers on the card which the staff communicates too. There are two areas : one which looks like the interior of the flight and the other like a normal restaurant setup. No one would actually like to go and sit in then normal setup if they have come for the inflight experience. One minus point is that they have only one washroom which is common to both the sexes.

There are tables for four in the flight sections where the windows are like those of airplanes which are like real showing taking off, landing and the travel while you dine. The restaurant is generally crowded by Gujarati and Marwari crowd , because it is a vegetarian restaurant !

The lighting is excessive as compared to an aircraft.
The starters taste good and are served quickly without much delay. The mayonnaise and the green mint chutney are way too good.

Also the quantity is decent when it comes to main course. The Indian dishes looked delicious and the Oriental dishes were served with exotic flavours (much above expectations).

Also to add to the benefit there are discounts on Axis bank cards (15% off) for billing value above 2000.

Probability is there that they might serve alcohol in the near future as they have a bar counter which currently serves mocktails. 

Recommendations : Make prior reservations !

One of the finest places to eat at for vegetarian food in Saltlake. Close to BD block, This place is really awesome and unique. 

Imagine a meal in business class seats in Airplanes, with the Stewards serving you in full uniform. 

I love the place and am a huge fan of their food. It's like veg food can't be this good. Also they have a extremely elaborate menu and each dish is equally unique and tasty. 

I loved their service and the decor and ambience. Pricing is fine. It's a while experience. 

Waiting eagerly for my next visit

This airplane themed restaurant is grabbing eyeballs for all the right reasons. Conveniently located near PNB, Sector 1, this place will welcome you in style, make you sit comfortably in a business class themed seating area and surely will surpass your service expectations.

I had tried a number of dishes here. All of them were really good but I will mention the best ones. The "Absolutely Not to Miss" ones.¬†

Mocktails -¬†

Virgin Margarita. The best I ever had. Quite refreshing too.

Starters - ¬†

Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Broccoli Corn Dumpling. Please note that many of us were not too fond of broccoli yet all of us wanted to re-order this lip smacking ¬†dish!

Main Course -¬†

Cannelloni Florentine, Subz Dum Biryani and Pizza Al Fungi. The 1st one was a cheesy affair and a deliciously blissful treat. ¬†The Biryani had the perfect taste and aroma. The Pizza was thin crusted, had adequate toppings and tasted great!
Oh yes, I loved the naans too.¬†

Dessert -¬†

Gulab Jamun. The perfect ending to the awesome dining experience.¬†

Portion: Good enough. Price: Reasonable.

Recommended!

Fly kouzina is a one of a kind restaurant. Really liked their concept of the aeroplane themed set up. The uniform of the food and beverage personnel are also very aviation oriented.

Coming to the food and beverage ordered-

1) orange mojito - A virgin mojito which has the dash orange in a subtle way. Really liked it.

2)virgin margarita- A must try over here. Just loved the taste.

FOOD

1)Crisp chilly baby corn- An old school dish which has been justified here. It was not soggy as we find it in most of the places.

2)malai paneer tikka- soft cottage cheese with the richness of mawa all over it. Yummylicious!

3)pizza kouzina- one the best thin crust i had in recent times. Must try here.

4)Dal makhni- this reminded me of dal bukhara from bukhara in itc. It was just a lip smacker.

5)Gulab jamun- my favourite indian dessert here is definitely this one. It has added nuts and raisins to enhance the taste. The show stopper to my meal.

Service is brisk , staffs are courteous and the food is scrumptious. What more can a diner ask for. Must try place for all the foodies which includes non vegetarian like me too. Highly recommended for all!!.
Keep it up team fly kouzinaüëçüëå

I am an out and out meat-lover. And when I give a vegetarian restaurant full rating, it definitely means that it has earned it. Fly Kouzina is one of the places which can change your concept of vegetarian foods and how amazing it can be, if cooked well.

The entire restaurant is decorated like the inside of an airplane, and the waiters too are dressed in the same fashion. There are miniature airplanes dangling from the wall, and clocks set with different time zones looking back at you. There are two dining places- one with the decor like that of an aeroplane, and the other is a normal one.

The music is soothing, though the videos being played on the TV screen do not have any relation whatsoever to that! But once you're settled and have the menu card in hand, there's a long list of items that you're allowed to choose from. I will just mention my order.

Mocktails:
Lemon Grass Mojito, Orange Mojito and Virgin Margarita.
While the LemonGrass Mojito is the usual Mojito you get elsewhere the Orange Mojito and Virgin Margarita really stood out for me. The latter even had salt sprinkled on the edge of the glass! And the taste of strawberry and orange blended very well to give a refreshing taste. 

Starters:
1. Crispy Chilly Baby Corn: Quite the usual one, but pretty tasty.

2. Malai Paneer Tikki: One of the better starters.

3. Broccoli Corn Dumpling: It's one of the best dumplings I have ever tasted! And it's tough to imagine that you can mix broccoli into something so delicious. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS ONE.

4. Coriander and Chilly Mushroom: I felt the dish was a little more fried than it should have been.

5. Tandoori Broccoli Malai: I personally did not like it so much, since it was basically broccoli covered with a layer.

Main Course:
1. Cannelloni Florentine: Another star dish of the evening. Absolutely loved the filling of cottage cheese and spinach.

2. Pizza Al Fungi: I found the base a little soggy for a thin crush pizza. The toppings made up for it a little.

3. Munakka Bharwan Palak Kofta: Spinach balls stuffed with raisins and cooked in yellow gravy. Tasted good.

4. Paneer Begum Bahar: Paneer in tomato onion gravy and stuffed with dry fruits. This also tasted good, but I was too full by then.

5. Dal Makhani: One of the better dal makhanis I have had.

6. Subz dum biriyani: I always felt veg biriyani is an oxymoron till I tasted this one. Even though I really missed the meat, I can't deny that the rice, aroma and the taste were done to perfection.

Desserts:
1. Gulab Jamun: Hot pieces of gulab jamun dipped in the saffron syrup are surely the perfect end to a meal.

2. Date Pan Cake with Plum Sauce: This was a big disappointment, but the rest of the food more than made up for this one.

Overall, it was a lovely experience to dine at this place. It definitely gave me the courage to try other vegetarian joints in the city. So fasten your seat belts and start your gastronomic journey!

Fly Kouzina, from being the only aircraft-themed restaurant to the amazing vegetarian food and service they provide, one is bound to be impressed by this place. I would never know vegetarian food can be THIS wonderful if I hadn't come to this place.

Just on entering, you will be greeted with an issued boarding pass by the staffs who are all dressed up as air-hosts and pilots to give you a feel as if you're really in a flight.
There are two sections - one which looks identical to the inside of a flight and the other which looks less like it but is more decorative with hanging mini aircrafts and framed pictures of the same. One wall comprises of clocks, displaying time from the different world time zones.
If you've had prior reservation, you will also be greeted with an SMS in your phone before and after your visit.
Ambiance, music was amazing and staffs were equally professional.

Mostly all the food items found place into my liking but I'm only mentioning those that I, personally, felt stood out from the rest.

For mocktails, we were served the Virgin Margarita and Lemon Grass and Orange Mojitos.
‚Ä¢ Lemon Grass Mojito was personally my favourite pick.
‚Ä¢ Virgin Margarita's taste did justice to how nice it looked.

Our starters comprised of the following :
Malai Paneer Tikki, Broccoli Corn Dumpling, Crispy Chilly Baby Corn, Coriander and Chilly Mushroom and Tandoori Broccoli Malai.
‚Ä¢ Malai Paneer Tikki has the perfect light crunch outside and it will just melt in your mouth when you take a bite from it, leaving you craving for more.
‚Ä¢ Broccoli Corn Dumpling was heaven. Being an immense fan of broccoli, I think I just had the best vegetarian momo in town. God bless the chef!

Main Course had :
Cannelloni Florentine, Pizza Al Funghi, Pizza Kouzina, Munakka Bharwan Palak Kofta, Desi Videsi Jugalbandi, Paneer Begum Bahar, Dal Makhani with Butter Naan and Subz Dum Biryani.
‚Ä¢ Cannelloni Florentine is a cheesy spinach filled baked dish which was lip smackingly good!
‚Ä¢ Munakka Bharwan Palak Kofta is a gravy dish and goes great with Naan.
‚Ä¢ Desi Videsi Jugalbandi - I hate all those vegetables I could see in the dish and when the person first served it to me I only wanted a very small portion of it but when I tasted it, I couldn't believe it could taste THAT good. I had to serve myself more.
‚Ä¢ Dal Makhanis never disappoint you. So didn't this.

For desserts Gulab Jamun and Date Pan Cake with Plum Sauce was ordered.
‚Ä¢ Gulab Jamun was topped with cut almonds and served warm and nice.

The only dishes that were not my personal choice are the Tandoori Broccoli Malai, Subz Dum Biryani and the Date Pan Cake. Others may like it, though.

I'm more of a food critic but I'd recommend Fly Kouzina for the best vegetarian restaurant experience and it definitely tops my list.

This is one of the best themed restaurants in kolkata i've ever been to..fly kouzina presents to u the experience of getting into their flight and enjoy their onboard delicacies...the decor inside is a replica of what you would find inside a flight..they have seat numbers written with the aisle and window indications as you would find in a flight..as you grab your seat and look at the windows , u would get a visual of your flight running on the runway, taking off and soaring through the clouds..and as you sit amazed at the beauty of the theme,they present you with their multicuisine catalogue...sadly, it is a veg restaurant though...they do innovative stuff such as presenting you with a boarding pass like leaflet with your name and seat number on it , which is actually your discount coupon..we had gone in there for a light afternoon snack..so we ordered a dish having our all time favourite cheese  - cheese cigars and one of the items that we came across for the first time - Deep fried ice creams..on many occasions i have had cheese dishes which does not really have the quantum of cheese to satiate a cheese lover..but the case was not the same with the cheese cigars at fly kouzina..it was a chef's special dish, was crispy and had cheese oozing out of the cigars at every strike of the spoon (priced 275, 6 pieces per plate, served with salsa dip)...the deep fried ice cream comprised 4-5 half scoops of vanilla ice cream coated with batter and deep fried and served with chutney and tasted delicious - easily one of the best desserts i have had..it was priced at rs 165...the service was very good and the staffs really courteous...had a great experience...if 2 non veg people come out of a veg restaurant satisfied, then it must be something special...prices are somewhat on the higher side for veg dishes, but for the experience and the food quality you are gonna have,that can easily be thrown out of the window..do try..

Fly Kouzina is a welcome addition to the very few themed restaurants in Kolkata. It's an aircraft themed, pure vegetarian restaurant situated at Salt Lake,Sector 1. I was sceptical about dining at a pure vegetarian restaurant,but gave in to my friend's suggestion. I am glad I did because I had a gala time here. We ordered the following:
Mocktails:-
Lemon Grass Mojito
Orange Mojito
Virgin Margarita
All were well made and refreshing. The best out of the lot was the Virgin Margarita.
Starters:-
Crispy Chili Babycorn
Malai Paneer Rikki
Broccoli Corn Dumplings
Coriander and Chilli Mushroom
Tandoori Broccoli Malai
All these dishes were well made. My favourites are the Babycorn and the dumplings. Both these dishes were to die for. Simply amazing way to start the meal üòÉ
Main Course:-
Cannelloni Florentine
Pizza Al Fungi
Pizza Kouzina
Munakka Bharwan Palak Kofta
Desi Videsi Jugalbandi
Paneer Begum Bahar
Dal Makhani
Subz Dum Biryani
Different types of Naan
The cannelloni was spectacular. I can go back for it again and again. The pizzas were thin crusted which enhances the taste. The palak kofta was something new for me as it was stuffed with raisins. Fly Kouzina serves a mean vegetable biryani. Have it to believe it. #recommended
Dessert:-
Gulab Jamun
Date Pancake with Plum sauce
The dessert options were great and the portion size was enough for two.
Being a themed restaurant the decor is a point to be mentioned. It's done up very nicely with a major part of the restaurant depicting the interior of an airplane. The staff are dressed as airline pilots and air hostesses. Their hospitality and service was commendable. Thanks for the great experience üòÉ
P.S- Have already uploaded the pictures seoara

Fly Kouzina is an aeroplane themed restaurant in Salt Lake Sector 1, few minutes walk from the City Center 1.
The most impressive part is their theme and looks. They have taken extra care to maintain their theme. From the walls , doors to the staffs in pilot suits everything was well managed. We started with two drinks here, Lemon Grass Mojito and Vergin Margharita both were extremely good.
.
For starters
‚Ä¢ Chilli Baby Corn
‚Ä¢ Brocoli Corn Dumplings both deserves to be mentioned specially the dumplings.
.
Main Course:
‚Ä¢ Pizza Al Fingi : Brilliant in taste.
‚Ä¢ Desi Videsi Jugalbandhi : Exotic vegetables tossed in gravy. Very good.
‚Ä¢ Subz Dum Biryani : If you are in doubt whether to have Veg biryani or not. Don't be in, order the Biryani here and I am sure you won't be disappointed.
.
Desserts:
Gulab Jamun. I couldn't resist myself from having it after seeing one of our neighbor having the big sized extremely delicious Gulab Jamun.
.
Fly Kouzina was totally worth visiting and completely worth each penny spend.

If you have ever ignored a Veg Restaurant in Kolkata, Fly Kouzina is sure to change your perspective. Though Fly Kouzina is like a paradise for vegetarians but it never disappoint hard core non-vegetarians.
When you enter the restaurant,you will feel like you are boarding into a plane.Exotic interiors,luxurious seating arrangement.

Apart its ambiance n decor,I was overwhelmed by their vegetarian dishes.coming to the food.Restaurant serves a variety of Indian, Oriental, continental food along with some awesome mocktails.
*Mocktails*
‚Ä¢Lemon Grass Mojito-blending of mint leaves and lemon grass ,very refreshing.
‚Ä¢Virgin Margarita-blend of strawberry and orange juice.it is also awesome.
Their Mocktails are hit for any time ,specially for summer.
Another best part of their food ,their starters.Note worthy experience of my tounge.we ordered
*Malai Panner Tikki-Mouth melting, extremely delicious.
*Broccoli Corn Dumpling-this one is their gem,and highly recommended.it tastes awesome.stuffed with brocoli and corn and cheese.
*Tandoori Broccoli Malai- it was also good.roasted Broccoli covered with delicious malai.looks so tempting.
*Coriander and Chilly Mushroom-crispy ,have great taste.
After experiencing excellent starters we ordered for maincourse.
*Cannelloni Florentine-baked pasta with cottage cheese.created a cheesey affair on my mouth. Highly recommended.
*Dal Makhani-it tastes also awesome.
*Subz Dum Biriyani-tastes really good.
Jugalbandy,Pizza Al Fungi also deserve special mention.
*Dessert*
*Gulab jamun-stuffed with nuts ,raisan. This hot ,soft Gullab jamun is ready to delight you at the end of your dinning.
*Date Pan Cake-It is also good .
Entire dinning experience will make you feel that your are in a flight with the journey of lots of different kind of food.
Highly Recommended.

Location : Sector 1, salt lake ( Not very far from Citi Centre 1)

The theme of the restaurant is brilliantly executed. Divided into 2 sections, the airplane feel to the restaurant is superb. As you book your seats, tickets are booked in your name and you are treated like a true passenger.

Food is awesome. I had no idea I'd like Vegeterian food so much. From continental to Chinese to Indian, every item was exquisite.

Special meantions are :

* Crispy chili babycorn
*Paneer malai tikka
*Al fungi pizza
*Cannelloni florentine
*Corn and broccoli dumplings
*Munakka bharwan palak kofta
*Dal Jugalbandi
*Panner begum bahar
*Dal makhani

All the mocktails were superb, especially:
*Lemongrass mojito
*Orange mojito

And to end our meal, we had warm melt in your mouth gulab jamun üòç

Service is one of the best I've ever experienced. This place bags a solid reccomendation from me!

A quirky part of the gradually budding species of themed restaurants in Kolkata. I just love reviewing such dining spots as there so much to write about the decor. Fly Kouzina is located just after the 2nd island on the First Avenue.

The restaurant is themed towards giving you a dining experience that of inside an airplane. And it manages to do so to some great extents. Right on the entrance you‚Äôll see the sliding doors and greetings from the guard dressed as airport security. Then you arrive at the dining area that is inside of a fuselage (plane‚Äôs body). The servers are dressed as flight attendants and officers. The pothole windows have been moulded into walls beside each dining cabinet that constantly play videos of the views you experience from inside the plane‚Ä¶the take-off‚Ä¶the cotton clouds‚Ä¶the landing. The sides of the potholes have been mirrored on all sides to reflect the videos playing on the window, thus taking you closer to reality. The air-conditioning also switches on & off just like in an airplane.

The meals provided here are also of a sky high level. This is a pure veg restaurant, thus has varieties of dishes for the veggies.

The service was a complete enchantment. The staffs are on constant manoeuvres, checking out tables to be attended. One of them asked for my name and phone number for the purpose of making a boarding pass. Yeah that‚Äôs right. The boarding pass is an eccentrically crafted discount coupon which looks like any ordinary boarding pass, and allows you a 10% concession on your next visit.

Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Kolkata welcomes one of its very best themed restaurants at Salt Lake, Sector 1- Fly Kouzina. Getting boarded and experiencing business class service without having to ever¬†touchdown has never been more easier!. FLY KOUZINA IS AN AIRCRAFT THEMED PURE VEGETARIAN, MULTI CUISINE RESTAURANT. That being said, it also serves Jain food and has an inbuilt aircraft shaped dining¬†setting inside and a separate dining hall outside. The restaurant does not just rely on its very glossy theme. And I have pictorial proof to support my statement.

This was my first visit to any theme based restaurant in Kolkata and it was just "WOW". A complete flight experience on land. The moment you enter the place a proper air hostess is ready to welcomes you with warm hands. The interiors and ambience makes it sure that you can't feel any less of your flight trip. Their add on services makes it like business class. 
Now come to the food. It is a pure veg restaurant. Their exotic mocktails like virgin margarita &  lemon grass mojito gives you goosebumps. Their best part were their starters. Malai paneer tikki,  Broccoli corn dumplings, which btw featured in the top 20 must try items Pan India, were simply wow. 
In the main course they have traditional but perfect blend of taste & quality in desi videsi jugalbandi, Paneer Begum Bahar. 
If you want some change with your regular dine in then visit this amazing place.

0.5 extra points only for the taste of the food. Had i to rate the experience, quality and service, would have given ZERO.
1. I was carrying a nearby voucher for which i was told that i can choose any starters in the menu except the platter. Upon ordering for cheese cigars they contradicted themselves saying I can order only from selected 3-4 items.
2. There was a STONE piece (photo attached herewith) in my dal makhani and upon complaining, they offered to pack another dal makahni as a take away. Wow. They feel we crave for extra free dal makhani instead of good service and experience.
3. At first they asked us to order for complete course as we were carrying the nearby voucher but while serving they forgot to serve the mocktails with the main course. Upon reminding them all they said is 'sorry, we forgot..!'
To top everything, the restaurant manager was either not present to listen to all the complaints or the staff was reluctant to call him infront of me. When asked to give me the phone number of the owner, finally they called the manager, who smiled continuously while I was telling him about all the incidents.
Pathetic SERVICE.
GO THERE ONLY IF YOU WANT TO EAT FOOD WITH STONES IN IT..!!

Edit: while my above review stands, i am considerably increasing the rating for an amazing experience on my second visit. Well done and good job done.

Kolkata has very few themed resto, this being one.
Interiors like that of an airplane..cool na

Ambience: music soothing and suited to all age groups!!

Service: the staff were helpful and courteous. Pleasing smile on their faces!!

Food: this was the best part. North Indian Food at its best. 
Dal makhani, paneer, rotis, soup(mushroom-one of the best), mock tails- everything was really good!!

Pocket pinch- totally worth it for the awesome food and hospitality..
Cheers guys!!

serves standard North Indian & Chinese with a wide variety of appetizers and drinks (no alcohol though). Quality, quantity and presentation of the food is fairly good and I will strongly recommend a visit. Its a vegetarian joint, but meat lovers will not be disappointed.

On the eve of 31st evening, I made a plan to visit a strictly vegetarian restaurant. Hence we quickly search few places and got this one in our near by list. We reached around 9pm and saw people were there already in a queue. I gave my name for a reservation for 2 person. After 15 mins waiting they call up and gave us a table. It is a themed restaurant. The seats and a part of their sit-in arrangements are designed like a flight in house. The LCD side views gives an extra feeling to the theme. We ordered panner Malai tikki and coriander chilly mushroom in starter. The tikki was awesome. The cottage cheese present inside  gives this to an extra ummm feeling when get in to mouth. The chilly was not up to the mark. But then we ordered Ginger apple punch and a mint lemonade. Both of the mocktails were good. Enjoyed the evening in a thematic restaurant.

Well my visit to this themed restaurant was pretty decent.
The feels of having food while on a flight was great but the food was average. 
We mostly had North Indian food and tasted just fine.
Overall a nice experience.
Worth a visit !

Today i revisited the place. The food and the service was actually great! I liked it a lot this time.
However the location for me is still a task but for food and ambience and service, i give them the generous rating.
I guess i would again want to go there to try their other cuisines!

A place which was strongly recommended ¬†by friends and family , however i didn't had best of times with food or its services. We were 12 in numbers variety of starters were ordered covering crispy chilly baby corn (one can never go wrong with this ) , american corn (was undercooked) , paneer platter which tasted very synthetic and mushroom which was very substandard standard. Main course was equally disappointing kali dal in North Indian main-course is something that determines the reputation of a restaurant the same was sub standard and tasteless . In case you have a sweet tooth Kashmiri Naan is a must try . I might just not take a risk to visit again.

The place has a very nice ambience and the service here is pretty great. One thing here is a must - Malai paneer tikka, soft,delicious. It melts in the mouth with an amazing dip to compliment. Also the mushroom and asparagus risotto is worth a try. Overall, it's a really good family place and is brilliant deal for the vegetarian ones.

I am strongly a hardcore non - vegetarian. To be very honest, I was extremely hesitant when it came to visiting a pure veg foot outlet. But, it would be very wrong if I say that the lasagna was NOT up to the mark! Infact, it was way better than I thought it was!

Won't be talking about ambience as there are a lot people who have described it already.

The food tastes good. We ordered kadhai paneer, jhal frazei, munnaka bharwan palak kofta. I think the vegetable jhal frazei wasn't exactly I expected. A little more spicy and just a bit of gravy to not make it look like a salad would have improved it.

The breads were well cooked and after a long time received non-burnt breads.

The biryani though wasn't good.

The service is very good and all the staff people are courteous.

Even though Fly Kouzina is a sheer paradiso for the vegetarians, it did not disappoint hardcore meat eaters like me.
I went there once with my school friends and had Malai Paneer Tikka and Chilly Baby Corn for the starters, which arrived at our table really fast and tasted superb.
For the main course, we went for Risotto, which to our surprise was much better than our initial expectations. It was rich, creamy and velvety and smelled like heaven, and we literally ended up licking our plates and ordered two more risottos.

Apart from the terrific food, the unique and unusual aeroplane theme of the restaurant, its fantastic interior design and display truly is intriguing.

Being a hard core non-vegetarian i was very skeptical about going to a pure vegetarian restaurant but my doubts were soon dispelled.We had ordered for cream of mushroom soup, cheese cigar, risotto, cheese garlic bread and mojito. The food was great. The mushroom soup had perfect seasoning and consistency.The crunch combined with the goey meltiness of the cheese cigar was heavenly.The risotto too was top-notch. The place successfully replicates the feeling of being inside an aircraft and kids will have a lovely time staring out of the 'windows' and watch the plane taking off.Brownie points for the boarding cards issued to customers. The staff was very courteous as well. Its definitely worth a visit!!!

Okay. I guess this is the very first 'Pure Veg' restaurant I have been to. Being a strict non vegetarian, I never really expected veg food to be soooo good!
Firstly, the ambience. As the name suggests, the interiors look like the interiors of a plane. Also the menu, has this aeroplane touch. And oh yeah, we were also given a boarding pass. üòú
Classy look. Well mannered and friendly staff.
Secondly, the food. We ordered for Tandoori Maharani Platter which had I guess 4 types of kebabs (2 pieces of each type), and it was delicious! We also took this mocktail named Virgin Sex On The Beach which was a very stylish looking drink. It was the perfect blend of Orange juice, Cranberry juice, Peach and Grenadine. You can check out the photos. For main course we ordered for Lasagne de Verde. This was my first lasagne experience and it felt a bit too heavy for me. It was good but didn't like it too much.
Pocket pinch is decent. Ideal place for pure Vegetarians.

Located in sector one near cc1....i rate this place high mainly for their hospitality and service. 
Its designed well to give the feeling that one is actually inside an air craft. 
To receive a boarding pass is equally sweet and a wonderful gesture. 
Coming to the food:
1. Cream of mushroom soup- excellent
2. Crisy chilly baby corn- well made. Nice and crispy.
3. Pizza al funghi- thin crust and flavourful
4. Rissoto- good too

I would like to make a special mention for Mr. Deboshri....he took great care and his service was great, giving special attention to the guests. 

Great experience.

A plane themed restaurant.
From the word go
Hot and sour soup is hot and tasty
Hakka noodles is as the name suggests noodles tossed up
Manchurian is must as it is delicious and spicy
Pizza is normal nothing special and the base becomes bit hard.
Spring roll is good
And then u get a boarding pass with your name and contact number
A 10% to 15% discount voucher valid 15 to 30 days
Tutti Fruity ice cream is good and ample for two
Warm brownie with ice cream is also great in taste.
A great veggie friendly restaurant.
As it serves jain food too some of the items if asked.

This place is more than what it shows on Zomato.
The interior it has, the food it serves and the hospitality, is a perfect match to the description about this place. 

The place gives you the complete feeling like you are on a flight, travelling in a business class.
The way they get you your personal boarding pass is a special way to heart. It just feels a lil special to the person who is visiting this place for the first time because small lil things do matter. 
Also the windows have a complete airplane moving video like flight taking off, its landing, in the sky, with clouds.
Food is good too.

A great & different ambiance for a restaurant. The food quality was also good (not very good). But the most annoying thing was that people were screaming and talking at the top of their voices, and it just looked like a fish market. The whole beauty & ambiance were disturbed by the behaviours of those customers. Neither any staff took any initiative to tell them to be polite or anything. This is the only reason I will never ever visit Fly kouzina. ¬†The loud conversations must be stopped and people must be reminded to be polite and it is not their home.

I have visited this restaurant many times but my last visit was not up to the mark! The service was slow and the quality of food had deteriorated. .
We did not expect such services from this popular joint ! 
So I strongly recommend to visit the place in the later half of the week and specially on weekends! Monday must be skipped as they have poor service quality on this day!

Cons:The ambience which was a big let down fr me.It is totally crammed up.leg space is also nt great.Aerodrome part being the main attraction doesn't offer a seat fr a family size of more than 4.Plus the noise level of the restaurant was also very high.

Themed around an aeroplane, interiors are designed to look like the inside of an aeroplane cabin, complete with lifelike window views of take off and landing in motion, and comfy plane seats on either side of the aisle. Staff are dressed like uniformed pilots, and service and hospitality is prompt and gracious. They also give personalised boarding tickets which I found was quite innovative.

We ordered the hot and sour soup, Pizza Al Fungi served with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar mixed with soy sauce, and also chili flakes and seasonings, and the honey-glazed Darsan with vanilla ice cream for some sweet ending. 
The pizza was hot and delish, a thin-crust pie covered with mozzarella and chunks of soft mushroom.
The darsan is a Korean-style Asian dessert becoming popular these days and offered in the menu of many restaurants in the city, consisting of crisp fried noodles tossed in sweet honey and served with scoops of ice cream on top for consumption. The taste of the noodles kind of reminded me of hot jalebis!

Overall very satisfactory dining experience at Fly Kouzina - Long Haul Gourmet Delight!

Fly kouzina.. the most awaited themed restaurant on my wish list! This place is a paradise for veggie lovers.. and yes this place is the most popular amongst both veg n non veg lovers ..
Last night I visited this place with my friends.. for a get together!
The Interiors of this place is of a business class plane.. and when you visit you're also given a boarding pass with your name printed on it.. for sure you get that feeling of boarding a plane...
Their hospitality is awesome.. the stewards know what they're serving and they are very good with their service..
Coming to the food and drinks..
We had crispy chilli baby corn.. it was nice and crispy
Malai cheese broccoli.. which is so good for health too.. was just brilliant!
Pizza AL fungi.. which is also known as pizza kouzina served with extra virgin olive oil was perfect!
Their Indian food were also very good.. like Desi videsi jugalbandi, paneer begum Bahar .. dal makhni and assorted breads..

Yes the best thing abt this place is their veg biryani.. being a die hard non vegetarian.. I loved their flavored Veg biryani.. it was too good!

Their drinks.. were great like lemon grass mojito was too refreshing.. orange mojito was amazing and virgin margarita was different and best of all

For dessert we tried gulab jamun... And to end this beautiful dinning experience we had Date pan cake with plum sauce .. which I tried for the first time and it was just beautiful to taste..

Highly recommended.. do try out this place and fall in love with this pure vegetarian restaurant..

Visited this fine place on Ashtami night with Vineet Jaiswal. Had to wait for an hour for a table but was highly impressed with the organised online table reservation system and the air-conditioned waiting room which is rare in Kolkata.. The interiors of this joint was more of an Aeroplane which is an innovative theme to have. You get the feel of having a meal in a flight. Coming to food, we ordered Cheese Balls and Alfredo Pasta as Appetisers. Both were cheesy and tasty. The white sauce was perfectly baked and so were the Cheese Balls. In the main course we had a simple combo of Dal Fry n Chaawal. Even the simplest of food was soothing to eat. So I would rate this joint quite highly.. A must visit for all the veggie lovers..

I have not visited only Kaidi Kitchen till date as far as vegan restaurants are concerned...believe me...Kouzina is the best...Be it appetiser like traditional crispy chilly baby corn or my all time favourite continental dish Veg Au Gratin...so pure to pamper your taste buds...Indian breads and Kadhai paneer are too good...even I could not afford to leave the capsicum in the gravy...we took two types of mock tails...viz. virgin colada and revival punch...both are perfectly blended...in desert it was mouthwatering hot Choco brownie with walnut fudge in butterscotch scoop...Service is super quick and courteous...Go and dig yourself in the greenfield!

Are you one of those staunch non-vegetarians who runs in the opposite direction from anything green? Most of those who know me will certainly agree that the above describes me perfectly. I had been hearing good things about Fly Kouzina ever since it opened via friends and fellow food enthusiasts , however because its vegetarian I sort of never got around to going there. Then one day I received a lovely invite from them for a Bloggers Meet Up but regretfully I already had a prior commitment so that fell through. I finally made it a couple of weeks back and was truly surprised at the way my evening turned out.
                                                                ...

So this place does not take bookings over the phone. As per the manager you have to be at that place and then wait outside (on the road) for 40-45 minutes. And in case you want to save those 45 minutes...Sorry that option is not available.


So I went there and waited ( I forgot to carry my luck with me and it started raining). After 30 minutes I decided to call an Ola.

The best thing about a themed restaurant is the sense of familiarity and the occasional nostalgia attached to them. ¬†Well, quite ostensibly, planes don't evoke poignant feelings in me but they do make for an incredible interior design. The first thing you notice after entering the plane..err¬†restaurant is its sheer size. Separated into two different sections, one resembles a lounge while the other is just the inside of a plane, adorned with windows that show flying over skylines, staff dressed as crew members, and the overall authenticity of the act which includes aeroplane styled seats and customised boarding passes (YAY!).

Now, the place is entirely vegetarian. Don't let that mar your spirit, though. The food here is terrific and can give a serious run to many other places. I had ordered a Risotto Alle Verdure and a Virgin Margarita to go with it. The Risotto was nicely done, full of cheese and myriad vegetables that enhanced the taste twofold. The experience with Margarita was..complicated. I loved the distinct tastes of Strawberry and Orange Juice but the Margarita was a little too tangy for my taste. Not that I didn't like it. It went awfully well with the creamy Risotto, providing a dichotomy of flavours in my mouth. Just the extreme tanginess was unexpected.

The area is quite spacious and I would say that the prices are moderate. A great place for a family outing. So, just jump on the flight and fly off into the distance. Just don't forget the boarding pass. :D

If you have a thing for aeroplanes then you‚Äôre going to warm up to this restaurant immediately. The attention to detail from the personalized Boarding Passes with seat numbers printed, to the seating, to the crew uniforms on the service staff, to the simulated LCD windows to enjoy the ‚Äúview‚Äù all seriously enhance your experience. Service is warm and efficient and fairly quick even though the place is chock a block full on a week night.

We started our culinary flight at Fly Kouzina with a Strawberry Margarita Mocktail and a Strawberry Mojito Mocktail and Bharwan Firdosi Tandoori Aloo, Brocolli Corn Dumplings, Cheese Balls and Malai Paneer Tikki all of which were seriously delicious. The Malai Paneer Tikki was brilliant and I loved it and was my pick of the starters. Then we tried the Pesto Cheese Shaslik and a Risotto both of which were nice. This was followed by the Indian Mains we ordered Paneer Butter Masala , Pindi Channa , Dal Makhani and an assortment of Naan and Roti. The Indian mains were excellent and I really liked the Paneer Butter Masala which was very well made. We ended this delicious journey with Gulab Jamuns that were served piping hot and hit the perfect sweet stop. 

The restaurant is actually in two sections, the one where we were seated had interiors like an aeroplane and the other was a lounge section themed with photos of aircrafts, model aeroplanes , a large wooden propeller. 

I really enjoyed my experience there and surprisingly enjoyed my dinner thoroughly and certainly did not miss the absence of non-vegetarian items. I would happily go back anytime and look forward to my next visit soon. And for my vegetarian friends this is a place you simply cannot afford to miss out on. An ideal destinations for a delicious meal with family and friends. 

Great work Team Fly Kouzina !

I only tasted the Margarita mocktails..which had a hot spicy "kick of a mule".. unexpected and different to my palate!!.. but not unenjoyable.

This restaurant deserves my recommendation, and please maintain your high standards and i wish you continued success.

I was mesmerized by the interior of the place. The food was quite tasty, but the service gave it away. I had a feeling that everyone who was working there were forced to do so. Once the food was bought to you there was no one to help serve it. We had to atleast ask 5 times for to be served. Please work on the service because i want to come again for some good Chinese.

Food Bloggers meet at Fly Kouzina..!

Eat in a dining room designed to feel like an airplane at this venue with the menu having a global spread. Was invited by Dineout to Fly Kouzina for a bloggers meet.

Ambiance and Decor :

The feel of flying and having a scrumptious meal is already an enticing invite for you. It has great interior that is well furnished, and equipped with amazing lights and impressive dining table. It gives the perfect ambience to spend few hours of peace, fun and exotic dining within the aircraft set up.

Food and Beverages :

It offers dishes like Continental, North Indian, Italian, Chinese vegetarian mouth watering dishes that make you feel delighted.

Surfing off foodway..

Soups:

1. Manchow Soup ‚Äì Fermented soya & chilli soup topped with crispy noodles.

2. Hot & Sour soup ‚Äì Classic Chinese soup which adds a tang to your taste buds.

3. Minestrone soup ‚Äì the classic thick Italian soup made with vegetables & topped with pasta was quite authentic and well made.

Never imagined I would love a vegetarian menu so much. The pastas and pizzas are just perfect. Lovely theme. If you visit, try going for the inner side segment. They have a virtual reality type setting where you can look out of aeroplane like windows for beautiful cloud scenes outside. It would have been great if they could serve the food too in a way it's served in a typical flight - airhostesses with the food trolley. Even on a weekday evening the place has a bustling crowd, thus if you want to have your dinner in a calm & quiet environment, this is not your place.

Ambience steals the show for this place.There are very less themed restaurant s in Salt Lake,thus it was a new concept to the people.Ww order for haryali kebab,paneer butter masala,tandoori roti,dal makhni and fresh lime soda.The food is ordinary but the price is quite on the higher end.

Seldom I go to an all veg restaurant and hence decided to give it a try. The restaurant welcomes one with its fine decor and an aeroplane interior like room. The family room has a very posh look.

They offer Indian, continental and oriental dishes. We ordered manchow soup which tasted yum despite cooked without onion and garlic. For main course we ordered kadai paneer and veg jhalfarezi,malai kofta, tandoori roti and veg Dum biriyani. I must complement on the quality of the food. All the dishes were excellent. The staffs are extremely cordial. Prices on the higher side but portions are good. For dessert we ordered brownies with ice cream and deep fried ice cream. The brownies were excellent and the deep fried ice cream- ice cream dollops coated in corn crumbs and deep fried was awesome. Good experience. 

The only problem was one of the soup bowl was broken.

Ambience is great, in the direct copy that of a airplane. Staff is dressed like cabin crew and is cordial. The biggest down is the quantity of food for the price.
Had cheese cigars and brownie with ice cream and a milkshake, the bill came to 811. We were not even half filled. Taste is good but portion very very less for the price. The concept of a boarding flight in form of a discount coupon is great!

Caution: You might fall in love with food & ambience of this place!!

Located in salt lake city, this is a pure vegetarian, Aeroplane theme based restaurant. They have putted each and every effort to make this place LOOK & FEEL like as if you're sitting inside an aeroplane. 

Ambience: As mentioned, ambience is great! You get your boarding pass as soon as you occupy your seat üòÄ, Windows have LCD display fitted inside them playing synchronised content of Take-off & Landing scenes during a flightüò≥

Food: Food is just Awesome!! If you haven't been to a pure vegetarian restaurant till now then visit this place & you might get fall in love with the food out there.

I would highly recommend it visiting with your friends & family.

Noteworthy experience including the inner ambience, fast services and food quality which value for money.
We ordered- 
Minestrone soup-some small pieces of pasta with a rich taste of Italian rich soup.
Spring roll-Again another mouth watering dish with cabbage and carrot stuffed with deep fry. But there was no mushroom we got as it claims.
Cottage cheese steak- Soft cheesy paneer bites with bell paper and mixed pasta which make the dishes scrumptious.
And finally, the king of the dish was Fusilli Pasta with cheese and butter.Lovely combinations of cheesy creamy taste with olive and neuter herbs.¬†
Outstanding experience with Fly-Kouzina, Hope to fly again :D

Fly kouzina is a nice restaurant in terms of food and ambience. They serve good veg food and i would say kind of healthy veg food like there are restaurants who just put alot of oil and masalas in the food which tastes good but no that healthy but fly kouzina serves good food with less oil and masalas and ya salt too...
Overall its a good place with nice flight experience. Staffs are humble.
Its a good place to dine in with your family and freinds..

This is the best poace so far for a pure veg lover. Thiugh the food is little heavy on pocket but taste is worth it. Specially i get tasty jain food at very less places in kolkata and fly kouzina is aming ine of those. We ordered north indian, malai kofta and dal makhni were suberb. Even people who didnt like jain food ate with me without finding it poor in taste. In terms of quality its 4.5 out of five as they dont serve all times in jain; in terms of ambience is also 4.5, staff is also excellent.

These are things I liked. 

1. The waiting area is really well made. I suggest other restaurants to take cue from this and make waiting a pleasurable experpence for the customers 

2. The ambience is neat and as per the theme. You really do get a feel that you are in an airplane. 

Things I didnot liked. 

1. Alloting seats to 6 people in your 4 seated arrangement. If you are going full please say clearly we cannot take more guests. But announcing Urself as a premium restaurant and then doing things which a local one do is just not done.

2. Food was totally below average. I have been to many north Indian restaurants and I thought they are just not well equipped to handle big crowds. A good restaurant is one whose quality shall never suffer because of a crowded weekend.

3. Service was slow. 

Overall a very average place. You can just try it for a new theme. Or else not worth it.

Sorry to say, but I would definitely not recommend this restaurant.  Firstly the plane setup sitting area is just 4 seater and so clamped that you would just feel the first negative vibe right there itself. Secondly the lightings are so harsh with a hot suffocated interior. The food service and ambience is nothing to boast about. Didnt like anything served. The waiters stand on your head begging you to order saying that it will take time . But voila they serve you in 5 minutes flat. Infact they overload you with everything in half and hour and you are done with your dinner. Thats because there is a huge queue waiting outside oblivious of the fact what they would be facing next. Overall a really bad experience.

Have you come across pictures of your friends with delicious dishes inside an aircraft & kept wondering how they managed to gets such great meals. Well that‚Äôs because they weren‚Äôt inside a plane at all. Rather they were simply having some good food & clicking some great pictures in Fly Kouzina, an aeroplane themed restaurant in Salt Lake, Kolkata.

Fly Kouzina was on my wish list from the time it opened op. However the prospect of vegetarian food seldom excites me, hence kept postponing the visit every time. However a couple of weeks back got a mail from Thinkquisitive regarding a bloggers meet at Fly Kouzina hosted by Dineout. Now surely this couldn‚Äôt be, & shouldn‚Äôt be missed. So it was time to post a status on Facebook & take a flight to good food.

An aeroplane themed restaurant, the decor is well done and matches upto the theme. 
The food was good , we tried the bharwan firdosi tandoori aloo and the cheese cigar for starters and for main course we tried the butter naan and the paneer lababdar .
Liked all the dishes  specially the cheese cigar and naan ,the mojito was well prepared.
The service was quick and efficient, very attentive. Will definitely visit again.

We specifically told to recommend non spicy dishes. The aloo starter was tasty but very spicy thus was not eatable. The tomato soup was very average. The paneer lababdar and dal makhni was the worst one can have in kolkata. The lababdar had flavours of artificial essense. They should learn the recipe from kaafila, casa kitchen, zaranj etc. We judge a restaurant from the dal makhni they serve. I am not able to say what was missing in their dal. Its was just creamy and heavy, with no taste even nearing to a black dal. The palak kofta gravy was very tasty. The palak edges was hard to eat and not properly blanched. Again it didn't taste too fresh. The tandori roti were returned at the first instance as we had asked for crispy rotis. The second roti order was again soft and soggy. Till that time we were so disappointed that we didn't care to return it and choose to eat amd leave. The bill was 3350 for 6 people with 2 drinks. May be i was in for a pathetic experience today. The floor manager/incharge could help in any way either. They themselves were confused whether a particular dish can be made less spicy by their chef or not. Neither did they do anything for damage recovery. When you charge nearly 26% tax then we expect 5 star hospitality standards. So we thought we must better not experiment at this place as we do in our regular north Indian restaurants. No way returning here but they seem very popular as the place was pretty crowded. All the best guys.

What are your views about in-flight meals? I always found them not very like-able, with too few options and painstakingly slow service. How about an unending line of choices across cuisines, served steaming hot at your seat, minus any turbulence? That‚Äôs exactly what you get at Fly Kouzina, the city‚Äôs first aircraft themed restaurant, dishing out Italian, Oriental & Indian fares with elan..... I then let the Captain take control of the culinary flight and the and the air-hostesses serve some happiness on my plate.

If innovation and conceptualization had a barrier, then set the limit once again! For Fly Kouzina has risen up to the occasion and created a benchmark of their own. While the restaurant may look sleek from the outside, a plethora of surprises waits for you as you hop onboard. A one of its kind restaurant, this is located in between Number 3 Water Island and BD Bus Stand. If you are entering Salt Lake from Hudco and Salt Lake Gate No. 1, go straight till the next island which is named as PNB (Punjab National Bank). Keep coming straight and cross the next island, which would be Number 3 Water Island. A couple of steps walking after crossing this island, and this restaurant would fall on your left.

As surprising it may seem, this was my first time in this paradise, even though I stay at a stone throw distance away. This locality is one where I have literally roamed around when I was a kid. I remember how there used to be a Photocopy shop just opposite to where Fly Kouzina is, at the edge of the small lane connecting the block. They used to sell snacks like Fish Fry, which at one point of time garnered them a lot of popularity. Even when Fly Kouzina was being constructed, I was amazed at seeing the cabin area naked from the open road. The first random thought which came to my mind, and possibly to many other passerby was probably that this place is going to be an airline coaching institute. Time passed, and this place became something else. Much to our dismay, this is one of the hottest topics in town and most of the local residents are still contemplating what might be behind those frozen glass doors.

Much about parading through history and snubbing my memories, numerous bloggers, spread across the length and breadth across this city were cordially invited by Fly Kouzina, in association with Thinkquisitive and Saumya and her team to share a ride to their culinary heaven.  A pure multicuisined vegetarian restaurant, a question is bound to pop up in everyone‚Äôs mind. What makes this place so special? To hit the bulls eye, the theme of the place is based on an airplane. The main restaurant can be segregated into two halves. One, which has the main aircraft, consisting of cubicles and can house 4 people at the max. Another, which is the lounge area, as can be seen in any airports. There is a waiting room, just outside the main lounge, which also has the feel and look you would find while coming over maybe to drop your friends or relatives.

Since we were seated at the lounge area, I did not get much chance to explore the airplane section. However, as per feedbacks and generous reviews from my friends, the interior represents very much to an actual airplane. The scenery keeps on changing at the windows, so you get an actual feeling of the clouds or other nature formations as you indulge into their delicacies. The flooring is probably made of wood or thermocol, but it is the ambiance and decoration which steals the show. Unless you are guilt-conscious, there is absolutely no way for an individual to demarcate between this place and an actual airplane.

The Captains and stewards deserve a special mention here. They are dressed exactly like the flight attendants and so is the Pilot. Once you enter the restaurant, you are issued a boarding pass, which has your name printed upon it. Speak about innovation and perfection going hand in hand! The lounge section falls not much behind, with some quirky pictures of planes, accompanied with huge round clocks depicting time at some of the major cities around the world. Right up the ceiling, there also is a miniature model of a small airplane. There is a small bar at the extreme end with a large LED Television, to keep you glued to some ongoing movies or sports to give you company. The lighting here is dim and keeps up with the simplistic and elegant theme of this restaurant.

Fly Kouzina, in association with Saumya and her team and Team Thinkquisitive had cordially invited a selected group of bloggers to grace their restaurant and go on an expedition of food and drinks. A set menu was already carved out to make our job simpler. So, all we had to, is to haul our energetic souls, receive our boarding passes and touch the sky onboard Fly Kouzina!

Soup:- 

1) Manchow Soup: First to arrive, but the flavor lasted even after I went back home. Spicy, tangy and flavorful bowl of soup, served with crispy noodles by the side, this is bound to excite your tastebuds and give a kick to your tired soul. The flavors are extremely alive and went well with the crispy noodles, which were served by the side. The soup was seasoned with finely chopped vegetables and cilantro, and this fermented soya and chilli soup proved to be the perfect beginning to your journey.

2) Cream of Mushroom Soup: Hard to explain, but the best of the two soups. While the Manchow Soup was extremely alive, this one on the other hand was calm and subtle. A thick puree soup, with cream to go with it, the flavors for this one was quite subtle. The mushrooms along with the cream, created that thick yet rich consistency, which helped myself to calm down and balance the highly alive flavors of the Manchow Soup.

Starters:

3) Crispy Chilly Baby Corn: A pure vegetarian delicacy, this is one dish, which is equally praised and craved by non-vegetarians as well. Steamed babycorns enticed within a thin batter and fried till golden brown; this preparation had the perfect crunch, yet retained its juiciness in every bite we took. The batter wasn‚Äôt unnecessarily thick, and hence did not overpower the simple flavors of the babycorn. The sesame seeds, which were sprinkled on the top added to the visual pleasure, while the lovely colored ball peppers were used for garnishing.

4) Pesto Cheese Sashlik: One of the exotic looking dishes for the evening, this one had cottage cheese, which were marinated with pesto and then grilled with perfection. The cottage cheese was skewered in a bamboo stick along with some capsicums, tomatoes and onions to accompany the subtle flavors of the cottage cheese. Tomatoes, capsicum and olives were used for decoration. While the grilling quotient could not be argues with, somewhere I felt, that the amount of pesto sauce could have been slightly less. Otherwise, the dish tasted fantastic and made us crave for even more of such masterpieces.

5) Cheese Balls: Oozing cheese packed inside a soft and crunchy batter. Shaped round, we were served eight portions, with capsicum dip filled inside a decorative looking green bell pepper. There was another red bell pepper used to enhance the appeal of the dish. The cheese balls were soft and crispy and melted in our mouth in no time. Try pairing this up with one of the Mojitos.

6) Broccoli Corn Dumpling: Take a break from some of the non-vegetarian dumplings or momos which had been beckoning your heart for so long, and enjoy these new kids in the town. The round bamboo bowl was enough of an attraction and lured us to find out what awaited us inside the round bowl. Five portions of giant sized dumplings served with an attractive red sauce in the middle. The dumpling had fillings of broccoli and corn, yet tasted so much better than its non-vegetarian counterparts. The coating throughout was soft and silky, and paired well with the medium-spiced Szechuan sauce. The dumplings were steamed to perfection, making us crave for even more.

7) Malai Paneer Tikki: This was the best dish for the evening. Panner Tikka, which are toasted in a clay oven, making sure that the entire dish is oil-free. The Tikki‚Äôs are filled up with chunks of flavorful cottage cheese. However, it is the cream which is served by the side, which made all the difference to me. The cream represented the taste and flavor of the malai, and was a sheer ecstasy to have. The Panner Tikkis were soft as well, and paired very well with the Malai Cream. Try this, if you haven‚Äôt yet!

8) Kadak Subj Seekh Kebab: The entire concept of Seekh Kebab is changing. A few days back, when I had went dining at a very popular restaurant at Ballygunge, just beside Kasturi, I had ordered for a Seekh Kebab pertaining to a non-vegetarian item. The Kebab did not have the usual flavor, which I was so used to have. The same happened here. The Kebabs were soft and was devoid of any earthy flavors. Infact, the taste was simple and easy to catch. However, this minced vegetable kebab could have been less dry, as some of us were not exactly pleased with the moisture content.

9) Cheese Garlic Bread: Herb and Garlic Toasted Bread, topped with cheese. Might sound as one of the regular cheese breads you might have. However, after indulging myself into the exoticness of the Malai, for some reason, I could not enjoy the uniqueness of this dish. The bread was however crisp and the cheese looked quite rich dancing on top.

10) Virgin Colada: A frothy mix of coconut, pineapple juice and ice cream, and served with a slice of pineapple and cheery at the top. This drink was oozing with flavor of coconut, and yet had a subtle hint of pineapple. Should be enjoyed at an optimum cold temperature, else the coconut may taste a bit bland.

11) Strawberry Margarita: The drink looked promising with its elegant look, but the drink failed to impress me. Comprising of a blend of strawberries, orange juice and lemon with a pinch of tobacco & Worcestershire sauce, perhaps the bartender did not get the proportion right. Looking for a better and modified version of this one in my next visit. :-)

12) Virgin Mojito: One of the basic and popular Mojitos available elsewhere, it all comes down to how well one can make it. And I must say, that this place did not disappoint. Comprising of a blend of fresh mint leaves and lemon juice, with a hint of brown sugar, the drink was refreshing and helped us digest some of the meals we have had till now.

13) Lemon Grass Mojito: Undoubtedly, one of the best drinks for the evening, there wasn‚Äôt probably a soul, who did not enjoy this drink.  Made up of fresh mint leaves and lemon chunks muddled with lemon-grass and mint mojito syrup and then was topped up with sprite. The chunks of lemon and mint leaves were floating on top of the drink, while the white lemongrass sticks and the black straw added a contrast of colors. If you want to move ahead of Virgin Mojito, try this one. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.

14) Orange Mojito: A twist to Virgin Mojito and LemonGrass Mojito, with chunks of Orange replacing the lemongrass, this one had a blend of fresh mint leaves & orange muddled with brown sugar. I wouldn‚Äôt say, that this drink wasn‚Äôt brilliant or refreshing, but for some reason, the flavors imbibed within the lemongrass mojito, attracted us the most.

15) Barman‚Äôs Pitcher: More of a holy alliance after a long fought war, this one had a relaxing blend of apple juice, cranberry juice, peach syrup and grenadine syrup topped with a can of Red-bull. The flavors were too many to comprehend, and hence it was a bit difficult to identify and feel each of the inputs on an individual basis. Looked good though, being served on a tall and long glass. Maybe, a dollop of ice cream at the top would have added to the flavors inside.

16) Mint Lemonade: Fresh mint leaves & lemon juice served with crushed ice. Difficult to identify from Virgin Mojito, infact tasted pretty much the same to me. However, doesn‚Äôt really negate the fact, that the drink is refreshing, and is a must have If you feel tired or out of breath, in between your meals.

17) Pizza Kouzina: The lone pizza for the evening, but proved to be extraordinary. Topped with exotic vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, babycorns and others, the pizza was loaded with cheese. Every bite of the pizza was like an explosion inside the mouth. The crust was thin, yet did not crumble like one gets to see at most of the other places. Served with a small bowl of green pest dip on the side, try this one, if you are craving for some vegetarian pizzas.

18) Risotto Alle Verde: Breaking the age-old tradition of Non-Vegetarian Risotto, this one had Arborio rice cooked with cheese & corn. The Rice was loaded with cheese with herbs sprinkled on the top. Served with two garlic breads on the side, the cheesiness does not overpower the rice. One will not miss this one, if he/she loves cheese. :-) 

19) Lasagne De Verde: Layered pasta, accompanied with loads of exotic vegetable. Baked in red sauce, this dish was rich and bursting with flavors. The cheese was molten hot and the vegetables went along together with the cheese and the sauce. You wouldn‚Äôt even need the garlic breads on the sides. The taste was rich, yet so pleasant. Once again, a must-try dish.

Oriental Main Course:

20) Chilly Garlic Noodles: Resembled a plain Kol-katta styled Hakka Noodle, with a dash of Garlic and Chilly to go along with it. The Noodles were crispy and weren‚Äôt the bland ones, you usually get at the roadside stalls. The Noodles were loaded with vegetables, and came in a large bowl, enough to feed say two hungry souls. 

21) Sweet & Sour Cottage Cheese: A perfect side dish which went along with the Chilly Garlic Noodles, this one had cottage cheese cubes, tossed in tomato and pineapple sauce. Served with some pineapple cubes, cherry tomatoes and with some finely diced green onions sprinkled on the top, the sweetness was just right and did not overpower the chilly and garlic flavor of the noodles. 

22) Subz Dum Biryani with Raita ‚Äì Fragrant combination of aromatic Basmati rice cooked with vegetables in dum style. If Vegetable Used to mean Fried Pulao, or Khuska with the meat portions being scooped out to leave the Biryani rice along with a piece of soft potato, think again! This particular dish changed my entire perception of Vegetable Biryani. Large and soft flakes of Basmati Rice, mixed up with flavorful vegetables, and sprinkled with a dollop of ghee to be cooked altogether in ‚ÄòDum‚Äô style! The aroma was simply irresistible and the entire dish was luring us due to the fragrance of ghee. Unfortunately, by then, we were so full, that we could only have may be a spoon or two of this delicacy. 

Desserts:

23) Gulab Jamun: Liked by all, disliked by none, this is one sweet which is close to almost each and every Indian, no matter where they live. The gulab jamuns were prepared fresh, and hence was warm and was oozing out of the syrup. The round fried balls, consisting of nuts and raising, was dipped within the saffron syrup. What a way to end our meal!

24) Hot Chocolate Souffl√©: Sunken Chocolate Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream, the souffl√© was filled with hot chocolate sauce, and once you made a cut, the rich and hot chocolate sauce, got mixed up with the cold vanilla ice cream, creating a holy infusion of flavors. The souffl√© was crispy from the outside, yet soft and molten from the inside. If you want to indulge yourself into some gastronomical expeditions, this dish should be your travel companion.

There is absolutely nothing more, I can sing in praise of this restaurant. The service was top notch, and the captains did a marvelous job to look after the comfort level of each and every blogger present on the abovementioned evening. The food came fresh and hot and none of the dishes disappointed us for being bad. We may not like the flavors, but that didn‚Äôt mean, that the dish wasn‚Äôt worthy of any recognition. It was just a case of one dish being way better than the other.  Saumya and her team helped manage our reservations, and took umpteen care, so as to issue our boarding passes and also make sure, that none of the bloggers, missed the flight. Team Thinkquisitive deserves a special recognition as well, for organizing such a wonderful meet-up and making sure everything was smooth as silk. What impressed me the most, as to how Alka Ma‚Äôam, had been so kind and lovely to all of us and made sure everyone was happy with the ambiance, food and service.

It was indeed one of the smoothest and jerk-free rides, I have ever taken. Just as we were about to leave, we were presented with a parting gift on behalf of Fly Kouzina, Saumya and her team and Thinkquisitive. Some lovely cookies, a wonderful diary, an elegant and stylish looking pen drive. With me, missing out on some of the goodies, Saumya, from Saumya and her team, took special care, to courier me the missing ones within a day or two. Such is the personal touch and care, these guys have for their patrons. Usually, I do not prefer to recommend any vegetarian dish, let alone a pure vegetarian restaurant for that matter. But, without any ambiguity, or a shadow of a doubt, Fly Kouzina should be your next destination. Be it with some of your closed buddies, or with your partner, or even with your family, get ready to indulge to fly the trip of your lifetime.

Airline theme restaurant. Serves only vegetarian food. The food is good and the service is nice. But the ambience and the theme of the place steal the show.
We ordered chef special dishes only. Started with Paneer Malai Tikki, which was good. Dal Makhani was very rich and nicely prepared. It was the best dish. Along with this we ordered garlic naan which was also nice.

The ambience needs a special mention. It provides complete flight experience right from when the automatic doors open, as if you enter the airport building, and then we proceed to the flight.

The most happening thing for a restaurant to grab eye balls are its fresh theme and concept of serving great food and giving a perfect reason to remember the place they ate with a smile and its speciality, holding a lasting impression for a period of a long time.One such fine restaurant i had an encounter with few days back was FLY KOUZINA which is a aircraft theme based restaurant . The reason i had this opportunity to try this place was because of a blogger‚Äôs meet organised by THINKQUISITIVE at this beautiful place which has it own creative way of making food eating, in a fun and stylish way .Many of us have travelled in a aircraft atleast once and are very familiar with what kind of hospitality you get in an aircraft and very well your comfort level is at top priority anywhere you go .At FLY KOUZINA located in Salt lake AD-73 block which is close to 3 no island/tank , i had an experience of an Aeroplane hospitality session in this restaurant , right from the start as i saw the led board outside ¬†displayed i started imagining it to be a new experience and as i was greeted by the security staff to enter inside and ¬†i was in a different zone once the door opened cause i saw ¬†a packed restaurant divided in two halves as the blogger‚Äôs meet had already commenced,pretty much confusing me where to go thankfully Aishwarya of Thinkquisitive guided me and welcomed me to take a seat and from then started my beautiful evening in FLY KOUZINA .

Bloggers meet at Fly Kouzina in association with Thinkquisitive

I was familiar with Fly Kouzina but never got an opportunity to visit this unique aircraft themed place. So last week when I received an invitation from Thinkquisitive at the Bloggers Meet arranged by Fly Kouzina in association with Thinkquisitive I was really elated and excited to be a part of this event. 

If you are not familiar with Fly Kouzina, then I must start by saying that it is truly an amazing place (that you can well check out from my pictures of this place) that will entice you with its ambiance and satisfy you with its food and mocktails. It is Kolkata‚Äôs first aircraft themed, pure vegetarian multi-cuisine restaurant. As you walk inside the restaurant you will find a classy and spacious aircraft themed eating joint with amazing airplane models hanging from the ceiling or nicely framed fighter plane pictures on the walls, but that‚Äôs really nothing! This outer section is somewhat like a lobby at the airport maybe. You are yet to feel the real Fly Kouzina thrill, since till now you haven‚Äôt yet boarded the flight, the exquisite gourmet flight! 

So, now if you step inside the aircraft section, you will actually feel like you have stepped inside an airplane. Though you won‚Äôt find the overhead lockers but that doesn‚Äôt make much difference since you can see the exact sight from your seat like you see if you are inside an aircraft. So as expected this section is a long I- shaped area like it‚Äôs there inside an aircraft, you have seating arrangements of two sides of an alley (with wooden flooring) The seats are grouped into four forming some sort of a cabin, so if you are a group of four of less it‚Äôs better to sit in this unique aircraft themed section. The seats are perfect and look like the aircraft seats with proper height and feel. Now you have the small aircraft windows beside your seats precisely as you get in reality with the scenes of clouds floating by while you devour your favorite delicacy! Even you have the emergency exit at one of the seats with was really interesting to spot since I was actually looking for it :) The interior of this section and the lighting is absolutely fabulous, nothing less than that. 

So you can have a turbulence-free comfortable eating expedition sitting inside an aircraft, which seems to have landed right here at Kolkata :) In the outer lobby section you get some really comfortable couches, with wall clocks showing world times and some amazing background music. You have a bar counter at the farthest distance from the entrance which is nicely decked up and has a revolving sparking ball on top and a huge LED TV on the wall, but sadly the place is yet to get its bar license. Since I am talking about the ambiance and feel I would also like to mention the way the staffs are dressed, they perfectly look like the crew members you will find inside an aircraft, that‚Äôs another obvious point which has been kept in mind and executed perfectly. And yes, the person at the gate won‚Äôt scan you or check out your baggage tags like they do at the airports, so chill and enjoy your meal :) But not to forget the amazing Boarding passes which we were handed over with our Blog names printed on it! Looked so real and that gesture was pretty impressive!       

Now let‚Äôs see where this aircraft is actually parked? Well, it‚Äôs very easy to locate this restaurant at the Saltlake sector-1 AD block. It is basically near the BD market bus stop, so you can ask for that if you can‚Äôt locate this place. You can park your car right on the main road right outside the restaurant like you can do all throughout the Saltlake area, so that‚Äôs not an issue; and relax, the parking is actually free unlike the airport parking :)   

Now let us come to the food, the crux of the matter for which we had gathered at this place :) But before that we were greeted by a scroll menu and special note which looked fabulous. It was lovely to have so many bloggers under one roof. Coming back to the food, the Fly Kouzina Menu set for this amazing Bloggers Meet was huge, to say the least. In the end we could not taste all the items and were left over stuffed and extremely satisfied! The menu had various cuisines like Italian, Oriental, Continental, Indian, etc. Here are the items we had tried:

1) Manchow soup ‚Äì We started off with this pretty common steamy bowl of oriental soup with crispy noodles by the side, the soup is a combination of fermented soya and chilli that tastes good if not great. The seasoning of chopped cilantro and veggies in there made it quite filling. The consitency was not too thick and the spice level was just optimally correct.   

2) Cream of mushroom soup ‚Äì To start with, this bowl of soup looked gorgeous, with the cream on top it would have looked even better had it been served in a black colored soup bowl. The cream of mushroom soup had some amazing subtle flavors and should have been tried or served before the manchow soup. The thick soup with the mushroom pieces in the bottom was a treat to have. 

3) Crispy chilly baby corn ‚Äì One of the most common dishes you will get in an eatery these days, and if you are vegetarian you are almost bound to order one plate of this every time you go out for a meal. The taste here was good like it should be with a nice crunch to it. The dish had sesame seeds sprinkled on top and tossed well with bell peppers. 

4) Pesto cheese shaslik ‚Äì Here we start off with some artsy yet filling starters, this one was Pesto marinated cottage cheese skewers with bell peppers, pineapples and onions grilled to perfection. The cottage cheese or paneer cubes were fresh and soft. This one is surely worth a try. ¬†

5) Cheese balls ‚Äì Oh I loved these cheese balls, we were served eight cheese balls in a plate with a artsy green bell pepper carrying the mayonnaise dip. The presentation all though out was pretty impressive. 

6) Broccoli corn dumpling ‚Äì I tried three pieces of these dumplings and I was longing for more. I rarely go for veg dumplings at places where you get chicken or pork dumplings, but as a matter of fact I am madly in love with dumplings in general so the filling inside can safely vary. Here I was overwhelmed by the bamboo box presentation and by the size of the steamed dumplings, mighty impressive. The looks were not at all deceiving since the first bite assured that I will go on to try more of this. The super minced broccoli and corn fillings was juicy, tasty and teamed up well with the silky soft outer cover. Dip it into some red medium-spicy momo sauce that was provided. Must try!    

7) Malai paneer tikki ‚Äì These were really some melt in your mouth stuff, oozing with flavors. They are clay oven toasted Paneer tikka with cream, the tikkis are stuffed inside with a smooth paste of cottage cheese with zero spiciness. Soft, somewhat gooey filling that goes well with the creamy orange dip which was provided.¬†

8) Kadak subz seekh kebab ‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt like this starter much. A plate had six kebabs with thinly sliced cucumber shaped like noodles. The kababs which have minced vegetables in it (and cooked in tandoor) were too dry for my liking and did not have that kick or stuff in it to get you glued. 

9) Cheese garlic bread ‚Äì It had the subtle kick or garlicky flavors in it. It‚Äôs just herb and garlic toasted breads with cheese on top. The cheese was put just in right quantity and overall you can try this, nice one.

10) Virgin Colada ‚Äì One of the best mocktais for sure that is available at this place. It is bit thick, white colored frothy drink with a mix of coconut, ice cream and pineapple juice. Very refreshing and needs to be consumed when chilled. Must try!

11) Strawberry Margarita ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt quite like this though it looked very promising and the presentation was wonderful. It has a blend of strawberries, orange and lemon juice with a pinch of tobacco and Worcestershire sauce.

12) Virgin mojito ‚Äì Classic cooler and refreshment option available at every restaurant these days. Here also it was nice and refreshing with a nice blend of fresh mint leaves, lemon and sugar. There is nothing to write home about but it‚Äôs nice as it should be.

13) Lemongrass mojito ‚Äì This was one of the best coolers of the evening. Very refreshing and had a nice tang to it that suited my palate. It had fresh mint leaves and lemon chunks muddled with lemongrass and mint mojito syrup, topped up with Sprite. The presentation was wonderful and the black straw in all the drinks looked more sturdy and classy. Must try!

14) Orange mojito ‚Äì The orange mojito was nice but somehow I preferred the lemongrass mojito more to it. It was a blend of fresh mint leaves and orange muddled with some brown sugar.

15) Barman‚Äôs pitcher ‚Äì Without a whiff of doubt, this looked amazing. It was served I a log glass. But taste-wise it had taken bit too much ingredients in it to taste like one single thing, as a result it got a muddled taste which surely needs to get back its unique character. It has a blend of apple juice, cranberry juice, peach syrup, grenadine syrup, and topped with loads of Red-bull.

16) Mint lemonade ‚Äì It was nice and refreshing but tad too minty for my palate. It was relaxing though with a blend of lemon juice, mint leaves and crushed ice. 

17) La Pizza Verde ‚Äì From here we started off with the continental main course. It had loads of exotic veggies like zucchini, broccoli, sweet corn, etc and loaded with some great quality cheese. The crust was not too thick and not at all chewy. I would recommend this stuff.¬†

18) Pizza Kouzina ‚Äì This was the second variety of pizza for the day. It was the chef‚Äôs special pizza with the pesto dip. The pizza was again studded with exotic veggies and I could remember having baby corn, yellow and red bell peppers, etc as the toppings. A nice one and not at all spicy.

19) Risotto Alle Verde ‚Äì The risotto was somewhat not having that zing which I was looking for. Maybe I was dreaming about some pieces of chicken in there which was missing since this is a vegetarian joint. It had Arborio rice cooked with loads of cheese and optimal quantity of corn and herbs sprinkled on top. The dish was supported by buttery garlic breads by the side which were nice and quite something not to be missed.

20) Lasagne De Verde ‚Äì Oh I loved this lasagna and though I thought I will not find this interesting for the vegetarian finish, but then after the first tryst with vegetarian lasagna I found this to be equally attractive. It had layered pasta with an array of exotic vegetables. Must try!¬†

21) Chilly garlic noodles ‚Äì One portion of this dish was enough to suffice the appetite for two. The simple garnish with chopped spring onion leaves was common yet somewhat appetizing, the noodles had enough veggies in it having the perfect crunch. It was a typical Kolkata style hakka noodles which is common in several eateries. The garlicky touch added some brownie points to it along with the mild spiciness from the dry red chilies. The flavor could have been tad better since it was somewhat marred by the excess oiliness in there.

22) Sweet & Sour cottage cheese ‚Äì The side dish that was provided with the hakka noodles was sweet and sour cottage cheese. The preparation was quite simple with mild tangy gravy having bell peppers, tomato and pineapple cubes tossed along with some fresh paneer cubes. Nice one to go with the noodles.

23) Subz Dum Biryani with Raita ‚Äì This biriyani was the star dish, for sure! I rarely try veg biriyani but this time I was floored by the sheer aroma and flavor of this show stopper dish! We were completely full when this was served and were reluctant to try it, but then when we tried a spoon we realized it‚Äôll be a crime to miss this! The biriyani looked great as the various shades of long flaky rice gave an amazing look to it. The aroma of ghee was mesmerizing and in the end I was shamelessly having it directly from the the handi :) It was slowly cooked in dum pukht style with lovely basmati rice and generous quantity of vegetables. Must try!

24) Gulab Jamun ‚Äì Lovely warm and soft gulab jamuns to end the meal. It was drenched in the sweet saffron syrup which was deep in there the gulab jamuns. The entire stuff was melt-in-your-mouth types with nuts and resins and a soft core.   

25) Sunken Chocolate Pudding with Vanilla ice cream ‚Äì This was just the dish we were looking for to end our meal. It was yum, fudgy and delicious! This was hot chocolate souffl√© with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. It was another melt-in-the-mouth dessert that impressed each and everyone. The cream patisserie was bouncy and smooth, and surely very well beaten. The ice cream was bit molten when served but otherwise it was perfect. Must try!

There were many more items, especially in the Indian main course menu which we could not try since we were super stuffed! And infact, some of the mocktails were so good we tried couple of glasses of them leaving us more stuffed :) Maybe serving so many items and to so many bloggers left the servers weary and in the end we could not taste the Indian main course items, not that we were not full when we reached that point of time! Otherwise the servers were very courteous, soft spoken and polite. And I would say they did their best to handle such a huge group of bloggers as well as general customers seated in the aircraft section. Overall I will give this place 80% positive feedback and it is a must-visit joint for all the vegetarians, no doubt about that. 

As the tagline of this Bloggers Meet goes - this was all about great food, great friends and great times! We thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this turbulence-free scrumptious meal in this unique aircraft :) And we are extremely thankful to Thinkquisitive and Fly Kouzina management for all the awesome hospitality, special thanks to Alka for being such a great host. Had a really great time with my fellow bloggers from ‚ÄòPanchphoron‚Äô food-bloggers group. The meetup ended on a happy note and quite late into the night, maybe we took quite a long time tasting all those items :) While we were all set to leave we were handed over some amazing goodies which had numerous wonderful stuffs including some gorgeous and flavorful Kaos Cookies! 

We thoroughly enjoyed this in-flight best in class service and food without getting thousands of feets off the ground! Now I really believe great food and aircraft goes together. Yes they do, at least when they are on the land, especially it‚Äôs true for the one at AD-73 Saltlake Sector-1 :)

Cheers!
                                          ...

We searched for a veggie friendly restuarant over zomato and decided to go to this place. The place was divided into two sections. One, that gave a complete look of the interiors of the plane. Other, of the waiting area in the airports. After getting a table in the outer section, perhaps the inner plane section became empty and we were happy to get an "upgradation". Decor gave the feel of a plane as they had windows, similar to that of a plane, with a video that was in a loop and gave us the view of the clouds. We had ordered baby corn and lasagne along with moctails of each 5 of us, from which I loved the baby corn and the Mint lemonade. Virgin colada also had a good taste (though 3 of us did not like it at all!!). We then decided to settle down with the north indian cuisine and ordered dal makhani as because it was under the recommended list and malai kofta along with masala kulcha and garlic naan. I love the kofta. It was delicious. And the breads were also good. Overall, quick service, co-operative staff and tasty food leaves one satisfied. :)

Aeroplane themed restaurant. The entire dining experience will make you feel that you are in a flight. This ensures that the ambience is different and good. Located in salt lake and easy to locate - thanks to GPS! Service was quick and very good. And so was the quality of the food - right from starters to mains to deserts to mocktails. Must try is the fried ice cream. Very popular for kitty parties and hence can be noisy at times when some of these parties are on. The only drawback (not for me though!) could be the fact that they serve only veg. Pricing is little on the higher side but worth the food, ambience and service. Worth a visit!

Salt lake first proper flight themed restaurant..they gained popularity in such a short time! There is a snake like queue right outside on weekends!
The place was interesting enough to drag a non-vegetarian to this joint. Quite fond of their cottage cheese dishes n quality.

Have been to the place a couple of times and have ordered for delivery many times. Oriental preparations are good. Have tried continental preparations a couple of times but they were below average.

We usually order salt and pepper mushrooms, chilli coriander mushrooms, hakka chow and Cantonese vegetables. Taste is consistent. Ambience is interesting in the first visit. Staff could be better trained.

We liked the Shanghai potatoes, khow suey and Thai green curry as well.

Had gone on Mother's Day with family after reserving a table through dine out app. Table was reserved for 8 15pm and we reached at 8 10 only to be told that we need to wait for a minimum of 1 n half hours
We said we had a reservation but were denied saying its a Sunday. 
Do not go their on a weekend unless you can go around 7 pm or can wait for an hour.
Previous experiences were decent hence 3 rating.
Aeroplane themed restaurant with slow service however their spring rolls are amazing

When you enter the restaurant you will actually feel like you are boarding a plane. Led monitors in the windows displaying images of outside like you see when in a flight, great creativity!! 
Now coming to the service and food both of them were pretty avg. We ordered nan, tandoori roti, dal makahni, jhaal fraezi, paneer butter masala. Nan tasted horrible while dal was also not up to the mark & rest was okaish.
Service was horrible we waited for like 45 mins for food to come to our table that might be because it was Sunday that day but still 45 min!!
Just because of the d√©cor I think everybody should at least try it once.

An unique theme restaurant in Kolkata where the ambiance make you forget that you are not in a real aeroplaneüòÇ.
4 rating goes only for the indoor theme - that automated door opening, that non flying seating area, that flying seating area (where we had our dinner), waiters dressed as pilot/ cabin crews, that menu card with cloud print,those windows where displays are changing every now & then from clouds to bird's eye view earth, mountains or sea just like real flying experience. Seating arrangements too. We were even issued a boarding pass with our names printed on it !!!!!!!!!üòÇüòÇ
Coming to food, this is a pure vegetarian restaurant, being a hardcore chicken lover, I thought I would not enjoy the food but boy!was I wrong! We ordered sweet corn soup, Stuffed Tandoori potato, cheese garlic naan, butter naan, kadhai panner, & strawberry mocktails. Starter were mouth watering, paneer was soft as butter only tasted better! The strawberry mocktail was saltry/chillies flavoured which I liked most. Were so full from this delicious journey, didn't have any place left in my stomach to have the desert. Overall a real good experience having dinner here, Will definitely visit this place sometime soon!

Went yesterday for dinner. We were 5 people and we're made to sit on a table that could accommodate only 4 people. When we told to provide us with another table at which one lady steward told us to wait for 20 mins and a male steward told us to wait for 10 mins... Some confusion was going on amongst them. Anyways we waited and we're alloted a table after 30 mins. Coming to the food the American corn pepper salt was not good and had too much oil and pepper in it. The pasta & risotto were descent and noodles just ok. North Indian food was highly priced, the high price does not justify the quality, taste or quantity. Ambience was ok....

An airplane themed restaurant with an amazing ambience. The staff are extremely courteous and well behaved. Eating inside the restaurant will give you the proper feel of an in flight meal because of the way the interiors are done and the staff taking orders are also dressed in the cabin crew outfits. The food is amazing in taste and the portions are also decent. It is one of the few pure vegetarian restaurants in the city that present an amazing variety of dishes to choose from. Visiting Fly Kouzina was an amazing experience for me and my friends. We tried cheese fondue, lasagna, crepes and the soups. The Darsan was fabulous and one of the best I have had till date. Would love to revisit the place.

We ordered a veg maharani platter in appetizers, that was cool. Main course was paneer lababdar and butter nan and yes the deep fried icecream in dessert. Well the later is quite heavy. Over all a really good option.

The main attraction to this place is its themed part.
Tried their alfrago pasta it is one of best my tastebuds has ever tasted and garlic naan and dal makhani was somewhat average as the former one was too crust and not at all soft and dal makhani was average nothing special.
Service was a little poor as the staffs were really busy with phones apart from it a good place to visit for vegetarians.

I visited Fly Kouzina today with friends and family. Firstly i need to say that they have nailed the whole flying experience down to the letter, what with the windows giving a view of the sky,waiters dressed as stewards and captains,interiors done up like the cabin of an aircraft. After they give you the boarding pass you are all set to fly,well,eat.
We had ordered cheese cigar,malai paneer tikki,laccha paratha and spaghetti in alfredo sauce,and beverages. We liked both their indian as well as continental courses.
We just had an issue with the bill,as they had charged us for something extra which we had not ordered,but luckily we checked the bill and cleared up the confusion.

My friends and I ended up here one weekend after a bit of shopping and had to wait around 15 minutes to get a table. The host was quite gracious and the d√©cor struck us instantly. The interior is done up like a big airplane complete with airplane windows that let you see the "clouds" outside. 

We ordered a Virgin Strawberry Margarita, garlic bread, the desi videshi sabji and some rotis. Everything was quite delicious, the garlic bread was delicious and reminded me of those garlic breads you'd attempt at home (in a good way). The sabji was basically "videshi" veggies like zucchini, broccoli, babycorn, mushrooms in a regular Punjabi gravy.

The OOTD (Order of the day) was however the strawberry margarita that was made from freshly crushed strawberries and had a hint of Tabasco. A must try if you ever visit this place! All in all, its a nice, family friendly place but if you're going in a big group on the weekends, chances are you'll be waiting a bit before getting a table.

When you enter their flight themed area you will actually feel like boarding a plane ‚úà.  The LED monitors in the window like replicas were displaying sky images. The ambiance was nice, the courtesy of the was commendable and of course the food was delicious. It is a pure veg restaurant. We ordered crispy chili baby corn üåΩ, chili garlic noodles üçú, three treasures vegetables. We took Virgin Margarita and Virgin sex on the beach as mocktails and deep fried ice cream as desert. Each and every dish was yum! Though the baby corn was a bit spicy but it will be OK with maximum people (only not for people who have very low talarence towards chili) . They also gave us a discount coupon for our next visit.

Food - 4/5. No doubt it's good, but there's quite a many scope for improvement. I won't appeal for bringing in non veg items into the menu as I went there knowing well that it is a pure veg restaurant. 
Location - 4/5. The place is in a place which is a bit off known. But can't really complain because it's still in saltlake.

We happen to visit Salt Lake for a doctor visit and after that we had time to dine and the nearest was Fly Kouzina. Amazing place and wonderful decor. I had for long wanted to dine here and finally we and our friends got a chance to give it a try.

We ordered Tomato Basil and cheese bruschet, Chilly paneer, risotto alle verdure, Pizza Kouzina, Virgin Margarita. Risotto Alle Verdure was recommended here on Zomato and it was simply great. Virgin Margarita was what was the new launch and they insisted us on having it and it was good enough. Though I did not like it much but others liked it.

I specially liked the Pizza Kouzina because I like eating pizzas and it turned out to be a very good one. The presentation was good and also the whole food and the service was also good. The staff was very courteous.

The decor was like that of aircrafts one and the whole theme was of the planes one. Simply good and good lighting also. Lovely surrounding and good seatings.

All in all a must recommended by me. Full marks.

Fly Kouzina... A fabulous  concept, the very first in the City of Joy a definite add on to the joyous pallet of the city. The Risotto is every Italian food lover's dream...  Extremely creamy with the  perfect blend of Parmesan and herbs.. The Kouzina Special Pizza is also  a dish which you shouldn't go amiss. The super fast service and helpful staff with suggestions for the menu, adds like a bonus to your gastronomical experience... A must visit with family to earn some brownie points from your partner for the varied options on the menu and from kids for the awe striking  flight  interiors , ambience which gives them a  boarding pass to the land of Yummilicious Food!  Fly Kouzina par takes a perfect  take off to achieve greater heights in times to come.

Have ordered a couple of times from this place,  via swiggy.  Coming from a vegetarian  family,  there are few places in Salt Lake and thus this place has a clear monopoly.  Coming to the food that I have eaten, 

Bhune pyaz ka dahi kebab: excellent  taste.  This was the reason I ordered the second time.  

Kute March ka paneer Tikka and haryali  paneer tikka : strictly average.  Under seasoned and paneer quality is not worth the 315 rupees. (including taxes).  

Next time if I order it will only be the dahi ke kebab.  An all veg place simply cannot go wrong with paneer tikka.  Have rated it three just for the dahi ke kebab.  Or else I would have given a 2.5.

Welcome to Fly Kouzina.From the entry to exit,you will get the feeling of sitting in an aircraft.
If you are a non vegetarian, avoid it as it only serves veg food.
Decent food,good ambience,nice hospitality. Good with family.

Theme- Scored! Aesthetic- Scored! Food- You score double!
My homecoming is always been christened by visiting new habitats for food. After a long and languishing movie with my parents at the City Centre we were searching for food vegen. food avenues and specifically which serves Jain Food (my parents are devout Tulsi bhakts). This place suited the bill.
Once you enter, the airplane like theme gives an essence of a business class and the flight attendants and captains serving you ups the ante. Placed looked nice and since we were very late for lunch it was quite appreciative of the host to offer us Indian cuisine given we give all the orders at a single-go. Delighted we ordered for a malai-kofta, veg. jhal frazi, dal makhani, stuffed kulcha, butter naan and stuffed paratha. For the sippers we ordered one fresh lime, Ginger ale punch and for my a Revival punch (strawberry and apple based punch).
The food was served on an immediate basis. Dal Makhani is a brilliant find, adequate mix of dal and rajma with spices flavoured from the north and the aroma was also soothing.
Malai Kofta not a person who favours sweet savoury this was equally enticing. Less sweet and the kofta balls and adequate creamy layer which were easily diced. The curry served with the Kofta was thick and the cream was adding a good taste.
One thing to be pointed here are on high esteem are the breads. The stuffing was evenly spread and crispness of the bread was the best. The butter naan had minimal butter to keep the crispiness of the bread intact. We loved this place. In the meanwhile this place has windows like the aircraft which gives an aerial view is something innovative.
For the mocktail the Ginger Ale punch was a relevation while Revival punch had it streakness of goodness.
Overall it was a really satisfying feeling and more over it was a date with my parents after a long time.

Wish to dine in Flight?? Then Fly Kouzina is your place.. Fly high with Fly Kouzina.. Great ambience to start with.. I was in awe of this place the very first time i entered! Felt like Flight Mode is on.. Flight Attendants serving the customers from their cabin where the pilots(chefs) are preparing dishes for you! Let me get started:
The Food: So i ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn and it was awesome.. Right amount of spices and crispy to the core! Must try it guys.. Then i ordered Vegetable au Gratin and it was hopeless and wished to cancel the order but the lady who was managing the restaurant didnt cancel the order and gave us some other dish instead which she claimed to be fresh and good.. So we were given Cheese Cigar Rolls.. Which was disappointment too.. So it started with a good note and ended on bad note.. 
The Service: They say that Customers are always right and its the duty of the staff to listen to their wants. Thats called being courteous and hospitable! Anyways the staff were soft spoken and were patient enough to listen to us!
The Pocket Pinch: Exhorbitant of the highest order.. Dining in here is an expensive affair.. 
Please pour in your thoughts on this one..

Ambience and service were very good... Food was good.. Servers were pretty decent and humble.. The problems being, serving portions were very less for a 300ish bucks dish.. The breads were pathetically hard and chewy.. All in all, potentially a great restaurant with few improvements needed!

Im a big fan of themed restaurants and since it is the only aeroplane theme restaurant of the city me and my colleagues have decided to visit it, though its an exclusive veg restaurant but still everyone was eager to try it and we were immensely satisfied with the experience we had. Flight ambiance was superb, hospitality of the staffs were excellent, serving time was relatively quick,and last of all the food items-everything was just perfect. we ordered variety of items-kute mirch ke paneer tikke, hara bhara kabab, malai paneer tikka, masala kulcha, onion kulcha, veg biryani, paneer begum bahar, bhojpuri alu, khumb matar makhanwala, blue lagoon, mint lemonade- all the items were excellent. I Would like to give this restaurant 5/5 but deducting 0.5 points as it was bit costly, per head cost was rs-850 per head which is slightly higher for veg restaurant but overall had a great time at fly kouzina.

This was the 4 th visit to fly kouzina. What has happened to the courteous staffs there ? Went on 29th Nov for breakfast with friends . We were interested in their package deal and we ordered accordingly . The waiters are forgetting our orders and asking us anything else . We ordered one onion masala dosa : onion needs to be tossed a little and then served and not kaccha, one cheese dosa, one plate idly,one plate medu vada: the entire South Indian was served one at a time with one bowl of sambhar and chutneys . We had to ask the waiters again and again for serving plates and bowls for the same . Later we ordered veg sandwich : that was really good, 2 plate club kachoris : awesome taste, 2 plates jalebis : my friends loved it , 3 orange juice: the taste was rather stale and awkward and didn't go well with waiter when we complaint . He took our juices away inconsiderate of providing a fresh one or being apologetic for giving the unwanted . We placed the order in package which you have taken out as offer for which we are going to pay but learn to respect our orders and revert or communicate as to what happened to the juice .please keep a tight check on your waiters as they are draining down the reputation of the resto .

being a Salt Lake resident, i had often seen Fly Kouzina from outside but never had the urge to visit it. Then in a post about themed restaurants on facebook, i came across this and had been wanting to go since June 2015.
But either he was busy or so was i. This went on until today.

and Boy, i must say i actually had a nice time.

On entering, we received a warm welcome and were shown our seats.

Then we were handed boarding passes with our names printed on it....after all we were flying ;)
The windows exhibited visuals of taking off-flying-landing and that did seem cool.
He and i have been friends for 14.5 years and today we went to celebrate that.
Being a Bangalee and a non-vegetarian, i never go to Veg-restaurants and hardly ever veg-dishes.
This was my first experience at a vegetarian restaurant and i loved it. We had ordered Lasagne De Verde and Risotto Alle Verdure.
both tasted really good and was in ample quantity.
The service was good and staff were really nice.

had a really nice time....looking forward to take my younger sister there.

What Fly Kouzina lacks in cuisine, it covers that up with its thematic airplane interiors and great service. The vegetarian outlet has tried hard to,bring variety in the many vegetarian dishes, but they are sometimes too similar. The taste is quite nice though. The seating arrangements, interiors are that of the interiors of a flight. The servers are dressed as flight crew. We are also handed boarding passes to make our experience enriching. I specially enjoy their mocktails like Virgin Mojito, Iced tea, Ginger Ale in Green Apple punch. Given a vegetarian restaurant, it is quite above average and I definitely enjoy going there.

It's an aeroplane theme restuarant. The interiors are quite attractive but the foodie that i am only good food can make me happy. So lets get down to the review. We had ordered Paneer Lababdar which was quite delicious but the Malai Kofta was a big dissapointment as their kofta was too hard and the gravy totally bland. The nan's were soft and even their veg biryani was quite different from normal veg biryani preparations. So that means either you will love it or hate it. Their is one major problem that i feel a lot of other visitors would be facing is that their ac vents are right over your head which does not allow the food to be hot for longer duration. The nan's and the side dish became cold in no time. The ac over my head was so chilling that i was literally trying to finish off my food and run out of the restaurant. The management needs to do something about this or else be prepared to have Thanda Khana. The average cost for 2 people would be around Rs.1000.

A theme restaurant to begin with, something that I have been waiting for so long. Good interior designed to match an airplane. Attendants were dressed like cabin crew. Food was amazing. We had ordered for 2 mock tails along with crispy chilly baby corn. And for main course ordered for garlic Naan, butter Naan, cheese Naan, stuffed kulcha along with daal makhni & paneer lababdaar. Food was hot and well made.  Service was good. I'm going to go back for more :-)

Fly Kouzina boasts an aeroplane theme. You sit inside a flight, beside small windows where you see the clouds passing by. But that's where the theme ends really. While we couldn't help but discuss how much more they could do with this theme, the food by itself was very satisfactory. We ordered a mixed bunch of mocktails; I recommend the virgin colada and mint lemonade, both safe and awesome choices. The crispy potato was a tad coarse as it usually tends to get but the malai paneer tikki soothed our disappointment. Beautifully soft, it came with a great cashew based chutney. 

Main course comprised paneer lababdar, dal makhni and breads. No complaints with anything here. The pudina paratha was especially good. Fluffy yet light, a total winner. We ended with deep fried icecream which came looking a boiled egg and also tasted too eggy. It's definitely an interesting dessert but it wasn't for me.

Be ready to shell out Rs.800 approx per head. But again, I was pleasantly surprised by how good most of the food was.

At times one feels to skip writing a review for a particular eatery as nothing gets one excited! Anyways...so as the name suggests, this place has two types of decor - one with a normal seating arrangement with some airplanes hanging from the ceiling and some pics of airplanes on the walls and the other seating arrangement has a look of passenger section of an aircraft. Now I chose the second one and here is the experience:
1. Seating - Table for four is little cramped up for four.
2. Decor - pretty decent but the excitement dies once you see it for real.
3. Service - Slow as snail.
4. Food - Better than average places but breads just ruin everything else.
5. Staff Behaviour - The lady who welcomes you in has a happy appearance but others are like - They are forced to serve the customers.
6. Others - Portion size needs a bit of improvement; Billing is slower than service; Too much noise from kitchen and it becomes unbearable with the noise of a full house on a weekend evening.
This place definitely needs a push up but I guess packed houses generally don't bother about the quality improvement aspects.
Try to visit on a weekday for a peaceful and decent pure veg meal.

This place is really good. It's not a big place, but not too small. It has a wide menu, I like the Italian and the North Indian. The ambience is good. The staff is well mannered, and trained. The place has the typical Kolkata North Indian taste, which is good. Its not too expensive. It would cost around Rs 500 per person (with a mocktail/soup). People should try this place. It has a family environment. All in all, a thumbs up to this one!!

Had there been MINUS marking I would have given that as well. In today's time the one thing a customer wants is a good place which provides good food and service. But the STAFF at this restaurant is very very ARROGANT and INSULT you on your face. When I entered the restaurant and spoke about certain online discount which I was to receive the staff there said that the same was available however post dinner they did not provide the same and after being asked the staff started misbehaving and when I said I would be posting it on zomato..this man at the counter started laughing...I don't care about the discount but this behaviour is not accepted. In the age where all the restaurants follow a friendly trend with their customers.. I did not find any such thing in this restaurant...

Just loved the place.. Starting from the automated gate opening system, to the non-flight sitting area, to the flight model. Flight model is just super awesome. The aisle, the seats, windows. They also have screens on every window, with videos exactly like moving plane. Menu has lot many varieties (for me being a vegetarian). Would take away one star only because its a pure vegetarian (though good for vegetarian families) n as they don't have alcohol menu.

The first thing that would strike you in this restaurant is the decor.. It is very well designed and it gives you a feel of an aircraft and I totally loved the decor.. When I entered the restaurant a lady welcomed us who was very cordial and professional. But other than her the entire service stuff need proper training as from the time of taking order to serving the food it was all messy and I would like the management to look into it.. In fact I ordered 2 Virgin Margarita mock tail and the service personnel dropped almost half of it on the table and he was not even apologetic about it. We ordered cheese balls , schezuan rice and shanghai potato the food was good but I won't give it much priority cause I was really disturbed with the kind of service I was offered.. But for the ambience I would recommend everyone to give it a try..

I happen to crash fly kouzina with my wife and her friends for dinner. It is amazing to see rishi's efforts materialise in a fashion which personifies his life. Entrepreneurship difined by ones life brings out the true quality and helps serve in manner which is fun and engaging. Rishi is exactly doing that! I won't review on the food and ambience because I am his friend and my words will not be taken on an unbiased note. But about rishi I must say you taught me that success is a step by step process and not a giant leap. You are always in my heart and pen!

3.5 stars predominantly because of the unique theme & decor; details have been taken care of. Food is just average & nothing empressive that'll call me back. Tried #KadaiPaneer, #DalMakhani, #TandooriRoti & #ButterNaan and kadai paneer was the better one among the two. Breads & dal makhani needs improvement. #Tea is served in more than necessary quantity & tastes strong. Staff is well trained & friendly. Owing to the taste of food, I'll call the restaurant's menu a little overpriced. Worthy of one time visit only, just for the experience.

If someone serves me well. I will obviously rate them good. obviously very nice thematic ambience as picture show. You will get a total aeroplane experience here from menu to inner decoration and all things. Now the main thing. Food. I directly started with main course lesagne al verde it was a cloud 9 moment to taste it. If you are not habituated with continental add little sprinkle salt and oregano they provide you over it. Also you use little olive oil if you require. Sweet and sour cottage chesse dish was pretty good. Nuce ounch of pineapple and orange falovour it had in it. Cottage chesse quality was very good. Schezwan fried rice was just better than my expectation. Fried ice cream was very good. But i expected something visually more attractive. Tuti fruti ice cream was totalky worthy of its price value. Good taste. Lots of fruit flavours in it. Virgin sex on the beach mocktail was good but you may also like to try other mocktails. Staff behavior and service was good. Totally money worthy. Highly satisfied.

One of the best themed restaurant in kolkata...
With amazing food and the best crew members...
Supportive staff.
The only thing I wasn't satisfied with was the richness and thickness of thw soup, I disliked the soup that I ordered. Except that everything was amazing and I love the boarding pass in my name that they gave me...

I loved this place. I went there for lunch and reached there quite late. Yet they managed to serve us what we wanted to eat and everything straight off the stove. We ordered a minestrone soup, paneer makhani, palak corn and kulcha. everything was superr yummy. Also we were extremely hungry so the food tasted even better. The palak corn was not too good. However everything else was awesome. I loved the concept of the restaurant and have kept the boarding passes as memories. Definitely recommend this place and will surely visit again! :)

First thing that you will notice when you enter the restaurant is its ambience which is worth noting.Being a themed restaurant it was a different and nice experience ,the seating too was very comfortable.!Now coming to how the food was, in soup we had ordered Minestrone soup which I very much loved and was the favourite part of my meal.!In starters paneer tikka was average and in the main course we ordered for Dal Makhani,Kofta,Kashmiri Nan and Masala Kulcha.!Overall food was above average and there was nothing much to complain.! However in the service department,partly may be because it was a sunday and there was a lot of rush, but i found that the staff were in a lot of hurry to pick the plates up even before the meal was over.! So this was one minus point. I also think there can be few more varieties in their menu.! I found myself having hardly any choices in starters and main course as far as Indian in concerned.!Overall it was a different experience without having a very big pinch in the pocket,with good quality food.

The hype for this flight simulation restaurant was too high to meet the expectation..but it didn't disappoint me..went for the dinner..food was good..but service is slow as its a big restaurant..ambience is different.. So i feel everyone will definitely board this flight at least once to get the feel..but make sure u sit in the inner section which is a replica of a flight.

It is a paradise for people finding it difficult to find food vegetarian food in Kolkata. This restaurant was displayed as the first option in the list of veg restaurants near New Town.

About the food. I had Veg Lasagna with Garlic Bread which was one of the better Lasagna I have had. I ordered sex on the beach which was okayish. They charged me close to 500 for these two, which although is on the higher side, but if you are planning to spend a quite and peaceful evening, then the place is recommend. 

Ambience: Ambience is highly subjective, more specifically in places which have airplane like restaurant. The staff was polite and courteous.

Good experience overall.

The unique thing about the restra is its theme. A good attempt to give a feel of dinning in an aeroplane. Staff is courteous. Food is good but prices seems a bit on the higher side. Issuing a Boarding pass in the name of the visitor is the most attractive part of it. Overall the experience was good.

This place was creating a lot of ripples on the Salt Lake news waves with it being aeroplane themed and all, but being a Bong, i kept procrastinating as it was a purely vegetarian joint.
I ended up going there with a friend on one sultry afternoon because we were bound by rites to have vegetarian that day. I should have visited the place earlier as i totally fell in love with it.
First coming to the theme. It is a brilliant concept with self opening doors and the interior totally like a commercial airliner. They even provide you with boarding passes. The waiters and staff are all dressed up like airline personnel. The windows have screens which play the sequence of a plane taking off, in air, and landing seen through a normal aeroplane window. Its quite an audacious concept but they have effectively pulled it off.
Coming to the food, we went for continental and ordered a Risotto alle Verdue, a Lasagne and a Penne Alfredo Pasta. We also ordered a Virgin Sex on The Beach to go along with it. The Pasta ans Risotto were very nicely done with the right amount of flavour and texture. The lasagne was a bit of a let down as the ingredients did not work together properly. The virgin sex on the beach also failed to excite us. But a very fulfilling experience all in all.
Definitely recommend this place for a romantic dinner. But definitely call and reserve a table as the place is inevitably crowded on weekends.

Haven seen this restaurant quite a long time back and good reviews from friends this one was on top of my list.Last Saturday finally I went here and I regretted not coming here much before..The ambience is quite good(4.5/5),the staff is very courteous and helpful (4.5/5),the concept of dis place is quite unique.And last but not the least the food was amazing.In very few places do we find all the dishes up to the mark and so tasty at the same time. (5/5) We had ordered Lasagne vegetarian,chilly babycorn,Crepes,Mixed sauce penne pasta and a revival punch.And all were so yummy that you actually have more plates of each of them anytime.So perfectly cooked and not an indegrient a bit more or less..A must place to visit with family or friends or even for office meetings over lunch/dinner.

Went to this place after a reference from one of my friend. Pure veg restaurants r increasingly in number in the city. This one stands out. Brilliantly themed. Service was like super fast , had dined in almost all good restaurants in kolkata never came across such fast service. You place your order and d food wud b on the table at blink of ur eyes. Dis place wud b on my wish list every time m in saltlake. Just a glitch, make sure if the item is in the menu, u hv it ready to serve to ur guests, like makhani paneer was not available one more item was not der. Do make it a point.

What an absolute delight! Apart from having a detailed airplane theme complete with a boarding pass, moving images of clouds that can be seen out of the window etc., this place has amazing food. We started with veg seekh kebabs and spring rolls, both quite tasty - spring rolls were better but. Then for main course we had veg chow-mien which was pretty great too. The ginger apple mocktail and mango shake are really recommended to try!

Definitely looking forward to another visit!

Welcome aboard to a high flying dining experience . with people giving equal importance to ambience and food , this place lives up to the expectations on both parts .the ambience was quite nice and made up in to an air craft . the seats were not as cramped as it would be in a normal air craft . people would be queing up just to take a seat in the air craft ambience , despite of seats available in the outer section . this itself shows how important the decor is for a restaurant . I also liked the various write ups about air planes on the coasters and the menu .coming to food ,  we ordered limited food as we were only 2 of us , but all the dishes were upto the mark. We had spring rolls for starters , they were crisp on the top and flavourful with the stuffings.  For main course we stuck to north Indian , alu do pyaza and black dal both were rich in flavour . the quantity of the food is also decent and are reasonably priced.  Based on limited food that I ordered I feel rest of the items would be equally good . would definitely want to visit again and try other dishes.  On a landing note , dont forget to take your boarding pass .

Conveniently located on the main road. The best part about the place is the ambience! True to its name, the flight style restaurant is a much welcomed change! We sat in the flight area (there is a separate lounge area, with a larger seating capacity). The decor deserves a big thumbs up! The "digital" sky seen through the windows give it a realistic feel. To begin with the food- For starters, we had penne pasta done in mixed sauce, paneer tikka and vanilla shake. For mains we had malai-matar ki sabzi with masala kulcha and lachha parantha. Hot gulab jamun was served for desserts. We were happy with the starters, though felt the portions could be more. For mains the paranthas were a bit greasy though tasted fine. The lachha parantha was crisp and better of the two breads. Gulab jamun was yummy! The staff was very polite. We were also given a boarding pass which enhanced our dining experience. The place is slightly overpriced. All in all, it is the perfect place to spend quality time with loved ones!

Hi. I have been to this place many time. this review is just a genuine suggestion:
First of all coming to the ambience. Its simply fabulous. Actual feeling of an air craft. i would rate it 11/10.¬†
Coming to food:
North Indian : Starters are flavourful. nicely assorted variety available. In main course Kali dal is simply amazing and mouth watering. Other vegetables are also nicely prepared. Quality of rice is top notch. Rarely i get such good quality rice.
¬†Italian: ¬†I have not at all satisfied with your Italian range. Specially Pizza. Being a pizza lover i have few suggestion
1.Please add more variety in toppings such as sundried tomato, peeled tomato, dry mushroom and green olives.
2. Also quality of cheese is just not upto the mark. I didn't get taste of parmeshan or cheddar. Only mozrella is been added that too of lower quality.

Service: You guys need to train your staff to handle rush. As a spectator i noticed, few of your staff simply rome around without actually doing any work Please Please Please work on your service.

Would love to rate you 5/5. If you improve your italian range and service. Hope to see some changes in my next visit.

Cheers!!

Fly Kouzina is a vegetarian outlet with a aeroplane theme decor. The decor is what drove me to try this place out. I was glad I did. The decor is fantastic, innovative, detailed and   fun. It adds a different dimension to your dining experience. The staff here is very polite, extremely observant of your needs and quick to response. They are so much into the theme of the place, you even get "boarding passes" from them! The window of the plane has moving images of an entire plane experience from take off to flying to landing. These kept the children onboard engaged n Happy. The seating is very comfortable, imagine business class plane comfort n being high rise chairs you get your privacy too. Coming to food. We ordered veg sweet corn soup, beg spring rolls, tandoori roti and paneer pasanda. All food were if good quality. Sweet corn soup was like knorr though so that's a minus. The spring rolls were fantastic with the momo sauce. But the star of the day was those dry fruits stuffed paneer triangles in white gravy of pasanda. Lovely, simply lovely. Visiting this place I got good food but great ambiance!!! One should definitely try out for themselves.

FLY Kouzina, stands by its name. This themed restaurant will take you on your flight to good times. The intricate details that make it look like an aeroplane, are commendable, specially the moving-cloud-screen shaped windows. Plus points for the boarding pass and the manager dressed up with a co-pilot badge.
However, if you are a group of more than 5-6, or if the restaurant is full packed, then you won't be lucky enough to get a table inside the aeroplane in which case you have to settle outside the jet plane,which will take away the charm of the plane!

About the food- we ordered Paneer Makhani, Dal Makhani and Malai Kofta, all of which were good. For breads we ordered Cheese Naan and Masala Kulcha, which could be worked upon as regard the stuffing. Jeera rice was decent.

Prices are on the higher side. Service was prompt and staff were courteous.
Given the location, it would be better if they come up with some promotional deals to have us visiting again!

Wanted to visit this place since a long time and finally visited it this Saturday and I was definitely not disappointed. It's a themed restaurant with the decor of an aeroplane. The ambience was just great . From the quirky coasters to the cutlery, everything looked impeccable.
They have a vast menu which ranges from Indian to Chinese to Italian to Thai . The staff was very courteous, efficient and informative.
Now coming to the food , the baby corn was nice. The spring rolls were okay , I found something lacking in them. We had ordered chilli garlic noodles , which was not at all spicy and could have been better. Along with the noodles we ordered Kung Pao Veg which I liked a lot. Then we had ordered La Verde Pizza which I thought was amazing. Then we ordered the crepes which I would recommend others to order. It was simply amazing. The crepe was prepared in both red and white sauce and the combination was amazing.
The quantity of some of the dishes could have been more. The prices were also okay.
Having said all this , this place worth a try. I would love to visit it again and try some of their other dishes.

Well Fly Kouzina,  i heard about this from one of my frnd who was very happy with its ambience and food, so i decided to celebrate my birthday dinner there.... Well basically the restrnt is divided in two parts, first part has full ambience of an aeroplane but if you are going with more than 6 people as was in my case you hv to settle for second part( whose atmospehere is very normal) which basically has larger dining table or else you hv to sit seperately in first part.... Now coming too food, well its vry good no doubt... Only thing is that it will make big hole in your pocket( vry expensive)... So if u dont hv problem with that nd u r going with 3-4 people then you can catch fly kouzina flight without ny delay...

The best thing about this place is the decor. It is unique and you almost feel like you are in a flight! We ordered paneer tikka and baby corn for starters, five spice fried rice and Manchurian gravy for main course. The food was perfect, specially the rice. We also tried the risotto there, which was also good. Highly recommended for veggies :-)

My experience here was a rollercoaster.  Went with my family to celebrate my grand parents anniversary. Everything was planned and reservations were made to avoid any delay or hassles. We reached on time, but we had to abjure our table in the airplane zone because of an unbearable stench. It was a huge turn off. Another group of ladies were seated next to us with 3-4 childern who were raising hell. All the commotion was a huge turn off to begin with. However, things improved as we started ordering food. The rissoto and the babycorn potato starter were well known picks here. Everything about the food was just right. We particularly enjoyed the dal makhni in the main course. Service was also prompt and courteous. All of us were happy in the end with our choice of place for the evening, mainly because of the way food tasted. Some areas to improve would be better spacing and maintenance. The theme isnt sufficient, they need to uplift the ambience to provide a more exquisite dining experience. Ps- Vegans will love the food. We ended up overeating :P

Visited the restro last night for dinner and waited for 1 hour. Ordered Tomato soup which was completely ¬†sour as if a lemon was squeezed and was cancelled on request. Ordered paneer tikka platter which was not marinated and cooked. Fresh lime soda was at room temperature. Service was very poor. Food quality is not worth of the price.if i look at the interiors as flight, it was preety good tried.

Finally, after reading the review and listening from my friends I boarded Flight "fly Kouzina" on Sunday. It was super crowded and they don't take reservations on weekends. They have two segments 1) the normal table & chairs 2) the fight concept based. It's a new concept in town. Talking about food we ordered briyani, dal makhani, risotto, chana, yellow dal, tandoori aalo, broccoli Mali, breads and for desert walnut brownies with ice cream, Virgin mojito, fresh lime. It was a family night out. Food is decent. I personally liked the service, inspite of being so crowded they were managing good.

A great place for vegetarian food! 
Courteous staff. Prompt service. 
Nice ambiance though we didn't sit in the airplane section as we were 7 and those seats are for a maximum of 4 people per table. 
Best dishes were the risotto and crepe. Loved the schezwan baby corn as well. Paneer tikka was average. North Indian was decent but the breads deserve a special mention! 
The Ginger Apple Punch is a delight! 
All in all, a good place!

The ambience is what stands out! Done in a way that the moment you enter the place you will feel like entering an aeroplane. A revisit to made it utterly dissappointing, the attitude of staffs has changed from the last time I visited. My lunch was ruined bad... Ordered for a paneer tikka, the marinade and paneer smelled stale. For maincourse the cheese naans were hard and the malai kofta was too sweet, even though koftas are sweet this one seemed more like a dessert. With passing days improvements are expected, not downfalls.

The ambience of this place is the first thing we should talk about.! The ambience is very nice and very different. When you're entering the place, you'll feel like you're entering an aircraft. The area with the airline theme is nicely done, the seats, the ceiling, the windows with moving pictures showing the view from a certain height, the flight landing, the wings.! Very nice.!
What can be changed is that the staff should be dressed as those in an airline, or some lady staff dressed like an air hostess. That would make the place more like it.!
Half of the restaurant does not have this ambience which makes it quite unfair for those who couldn't get a seat inside.!

The food was good, the service was also good, and my overall experience was nice.! May look forward to visiting again.!

The food was exquisite. Service was a bit off and several items on the menu were not available. But what we had for lunch was sublime. The thai noodles salad was too spicy for my taste. The veg clear soup was fragrant and fresh. Pretty dandy ambience and awesome food. Plan to go there again sometime.

Excellent restaurant. Food is just wowww. I never though of going to a veg restaurant and return back with a big smile. Yummiest veggie foods i ever had, this restaurant offers. The theme is also very nice. You will get a feeling that you are sitting inside a real aeroplane. I have deducted 0.5 because of its lack of car parking facility and a little over pricey but as compared to the quality of food these factors are negligible.

Among the few themed restaurants in Kolkata, this one is the latest addition. It sure looks great once you're inside but that's the dead end for positives about this place.

Although I'm not a veggie but thought of trying it our as the person with me couldn't have non-veg that day. The food was just about ok but the biggest turn offs about Fly Kouzina is their service. They have more than needed people on the job and almost all of them lacks the expertise needed to run a place that looks this good.

They are not courteous on most of the occasions and the management needs to look into the matter if they want to carry on with a good reputation.

I would recommend this veg joint and would like to visit again provided the attitude towards customer changes for good.

The restaurant seems to be catching up and is having a good response.  Probably that has gone into their head. Two of us went there and wanted to sit on a table of 4 since the restaurant was mostly empty. The waiter insisted us for sitting on a table for two but we sat on a table for four since the table for two didn't seem comfortably placed. The manager then loudly asked the waiter in front of us why have you made them sit on a table for four. He said that we sat there forcibly.  The manager tried us to shift again but we told him that we would not like to change. Finally he agreed but told the waiter in front of us to serve the food quickly to us so that we leave as soon as possible. 
we were shocked by the arrogance with which the manager spoke and decided to walk off from the place.
I have read lot of praise about the food but I would not like to go to a place where people don't know how to behave properly.
Will not recommend the place to anyone and I don't think they can go a long with such arrogance.

As usual, you have to wait for a while to get into the restaurant.....but once u enter, it seriously gives u a taste of a flight journey.....the apetizers were really delicious along with the mocktails.....what has to be questioned is that the amount of tax applied to per dish is way too much.....apart from that a delicate experience to a vegetarian restaurant.

A well themed restaurant where you feel to be sitting inside a flight. Interiors was well done with the concept of flight. I found the restaurant over staffed and the old saying of spoil of broth applies. The place is really well made and is quite welcoming. Nice and clean environment. New fruit in the basket of veggie lovers. Should work more on quality of service. Food was really good and stomach filling. We had ordered: sweet corn soup, aloo bharwa, crepes, Virgin Mojito.

Food Quality: Very Good.
Ambience: Super cool business class.
Service: Great.
Price: Reasonable but NOTE that they include 5% Service Charge + Service tax + Vat + Amount of food, so you end up paying 20% more on actual amount. Our Food price was 772 and end up paying Rs.974. So Rs.202 tax :O :( ¬†SO DONOT PAY TIP EVER in here.
Parking: Main road side, Safe enough.
Over all 4 out of 5.

Saltlake area never leaves a point to surprise me witj restaurants..
As the name suggests it has a full ambeiance of a flight..the window at the table sidehas an illusion of the clouds which was an attraction.. the ambeiance was quiet soothing and calm...
We had a family birthday dinner...
For starters we ordered panner tikka babycorn and an italian crapes..
All were quiet satisfactory and upto the mark..
Main course we ordered mix sauce pasta which was a bit cheesy bt the taste was fine 
Panner butter masala and dal makhini was very yummy..malai corn was not that a wow..
Breads were fine nicely cooked and not burnt..
So all in all the food was quiet tasteful to the tongue..and the service was avverage as the waiters were a bit novelist as they were bit confused and in a haste. But they were helpful..
So I would nt mind visiting this place again..

Mmm. I did love the zomato-recommended Risotto Alle Verdure and Dal Makhani. The Virgin Sex on the Beach was really a treat to the taste buds. Loved the atmosphere and the theme- c'mon! You really feel like you're in mid air. My sister even suggested everyone in the group to put their mobiles on flight mode- great excuse for no interruptions in family time. The staff was very courteous. I'm sure however, that I'd have rated even higher if they had all the desserts available. Better luck next time?

A pure veg reaturant was a must needed for north kolkata.This restaurant in salt lake is small and cosy.
Interiors: well done with the concept of flight.A Totaly new theme in town.
But sitting arrangement is a big problem if you are more than 4 in no.
As we were 5 of them,seating was not at al confortable.Table was even quite smal to fit in at the cutlery.
Coming to the food: dal makhni,kofta,panner butter masal,kulcha,naan..all tasted yumm to my tastebuds.
Service: Was jst average.
Recomend: a must visit.

Was looking for a good vegetarian restaurant. Heard from a colleague about this place. Yes rite from the entrance you feel you are actually entering an airport.
The interiors and decor really gives you the feel like you inside a commercial jet.¬†
I was there with a friend . we had visited the place for lunch. We ordered Tandoori platter and a Rissoto ¬†. Order serving was quick and food was really sumptuous .¬†
What took us by surprise was the detail with which the management had worked on decor. The windows had LCDs placed with cloud animation on . Really like this place. ¬†We do not have much fully vegetarian restaurants here at salt lake its really a good and viable option.

Review of second visit:
Called them an hour in advance for a table booking, but had to make may requests to get a table in the theme section. This was the only bad part. They don't give tables to couples easily in the theme section. Food was perfect (also the reason why I have increased the rating). JAIN food available. Very reasonable. Approx of Rs1200 for 2. Risotto and Pizza Verde a must try(personal choice). If in a group or with family, will suggest - one should go. Couples, book you tables in advance and demand strongly, you might just get lucky.

Review of first visit:
Really dunno how the food is, but an extremely arrogant attitude by the he manager. We were 2, reached the restaurant at 7.35pm, with no waiting queue outside and more than 8 tables empty, they refused to give us a table in the theme section - saying its Sunday and they only have tables for 4 or more people. It was a total mood spoiler since we went there all the way from Bhawanipur. They asked us to come on any other day besides weekend so as to get a table in the theme section. SO A STRONG SUGGESTION FOR COUPLES, THINK TONS BEFORE GOING HERE.

It was super exciting . When I entered the door automatically opened so I new that it was an extraordinary start. The think I didn't like was the staff welcoming the guests . They did not understand anything and were constantly arguing. But the best part is the ambience which almost resembled the inside of an aircraft. The appetizers to start with were delicious. The quantity was good. The service was bit slow. The mocktails were good. Food options were nice. The main course was mouth watering the waiters on the other hand were courteous. It is a new experience for the whole family. Must visit.

Went there with my family. Lets start with the negatives first. It is a pure vegetarian restaurant and surprisingly, they prepare very few items without onion and / or garlic, which is a staple requirement of many vegetarians. I found the restaurant over staffed and the old saying of spoil the broth fit well. Service is just not up to the mark and the waiters looked pretty much clueless about what's going on. Food was just about average. We tried the lasagne, which was loaded with cheese and all that one could taste of it was the cheese. The other items were north Indian, which too lacked subtlety. Lets talk about the positives.. The ambience was great, I liked the theme of being inside a plane and I took a photo on instagram which actually fooled some of my friends (It's a score if silly things like this make your day). The mocktails were nice. The appetizers we ordered were also quite decent.

Went there last Sunday with my family. Not matter how different the interiors are, the quality of the service was horrible. After we had prebooked the table, they made us wait for 45 mins and then alloted us half the table. 17 of us crumbled up and sat on a 10 seater sofa. It was really uncomfortable. Moving on, we called for 2 starters which took them more than an hour to serve. We had placed the order for dinner along with the starters at around 9pm and was served at 10:45pm. To add to our anger, They did not inform in advance that pindi channa was not available. While serving the dinner, they got us 2 plates of pindi chana out of 4 portions and said this is all we can serve.! If informed in advance we could cancel or change our order. Also There was no sync in the service. They would get the rotis and serve dal after 20 mins. There were particular waiters who were standing and watching TV and when asked to serve water gave us disgusting looks. No matter how nice the food and interior is, the quality of service will result in an overall pathetic experience.

Though it is mentioned that "reservation required" on Zomato but after calling the reservation number I was told by Mushtaq (he attended to my call) that they do not take reservations on the weekends.. 

We had to wait for a good 40 minutes before we were allotted a table. The service was slow, lack of staff, cutleries were missing from the table that was laid for the 6 of us.

Also, proper arrangements were not made for people who had to wait outside. Apart from a couple of chairs the remaining guests were standing. 

I would not recommend this place to someone who is looking for a good place, with good service and prior reservations. The food was also not to great.

Great work coming up with a theme like this, guys! 
Although, yes, the staff seemed a little amateur to handle waiting guests (a clear-cut logistics problem) and to handle reserved bookings too. 
The food was above average. Their chocolate shakes are really good. The soup selection was decent. We had also called for a pesto pasta, but an overdose of cream and cheese diluted the entire taste of pesto. The Caesar salad was again overloaded with mayonnaise. The risotto and the lasagne were good, but again, way too creamy for a subtle and refined taste. And they should get the pizzas on their menu soon.. 
A good place for a family dinner for vegetarians, it is highly recommended primarily for the ambiance; you don't easily get to eat good food in a domestic flight nowadays at decent rates and good portions! Just make sure, you reserve a table before simply landing there. And parking can be a problem on weekends, the restaurant being on the main road.

I visited the place with my family after hearing a lot (good) about it. I would have given my experience today a negative rating. I had to wait for around 15-20 mins (which i would say is quite normal, especially when its a holiday). I entered the resturant as around 9:15 PM, placed my order for starters and soup. It was on my table within very decent time. Liked the service at the first go. Now comes the really thing, at around 9:55 PM when i wished to place my order for main course, had to wait for more than 30 mins, remind 3 people about it, but no answer from no one. "NO ONE ACTUALLY TOOK OUR ORDER". A person comes to my table tells me, "i'll be back in 2 mins", he does come back but only after 5-10 mins just to repeat his statement of 2 mins, comes back again, repeats the same. After enough waiting me n my parents had no choice but to ask for the bill n return home half appetite.

This resturant is good, but has a lot to learn. They have a decent sitting arrangements but immensely lack on serving, courtesy and ability to handle rush. I really had a bad bad experience and top of it all, they spoiled my and parents mood for dining out, today.

We went there on a Saturday. It was crowded, but the staff was humble and courteous. The seating in the airplane section is quite congested. We were 7 and the seats are comfortable for 4 people and not 6. They do not have any chair with backrest. So sitting on a bar stool for the entire course of meal was a torture for the 7th person. The table also cannot take the cutlery arrangement for 6-7 !

The service was a slow but I give them the benefit of doubt because of the rush. They were literally running around.¬†
Coming to ambiance, definitely a new concept and sufficient attention to detail has been made. (However, the uniform is not at all theme based)

Food was good, portion size was sufficient for 4-5 people. We ordered tomato soup which was different than the norm and tasted delicious. Indian food was quite decent, especially the dal makhani. The wait enhanced our hunger to relish our meals even more.
We even ordered spagetti aglio olio and everyone loved it.

All in all a good experience. Will visit again but in a smaller group :)

We went for lunch at Fly Kouzina. The service was really slow and we had to wait half n hour before our order was served.
The minestrone soup was good. The paneer makhni was decent but the dal tadka was tasteless and so was the masala kulcha. Overall the food was okay. 
The staff was courteous and the ambience though novel had a pecuilar smell.

a hair turned up from my fiancee's portion of risotto...i was like its not a hair but she cleaned it to make it clear to me...i called up the managers shantanu khan(so called pilot) and copilot tanmoy nag (unsure whether they have given me right names). To my utter surprise they went inside the kitchen n came back to me n said it wasnt inside the dish as it would had been saucy ...i was pissed off n as i was explaining to him chef turned up with the new dish n the manager wnet off without apologising or showing any interest...i asked the copilot to bring the bill...i hubly request the owner mohit harlalka(again unsure if m correct o not) to groom the management team properly....cctv cameras are working i guess u can have a check whether dish had hair o not. Disappointing it was. Bad choice i took.

Date of visit :24/4/2015 at 9.55pm second  seat from the kitchen towards the left if u walk towards the kitchen

Kolkata is becoming awake to the need of vegetarian society. Where patrons are looking at ambiance as much as quality of food. Fly kouzina is giving a welcome respite from monotonous ambiance we find in every other restaurant. While service was good. Quantity served was also good and becomes pocket friendly for family outing. Enjoy change.

I went on my husband's birthday with my family. I had made prior reservation for 11 persons. To my dissapointment when I reached there they offered us three separate tables. Just imagine one family gathered together to celebrate sitting in three sections! The worst happened when the staff told me that they had already communicated this to us that we will get 3 different tables. Why would I go to such a place if this had been told by them? They were not ready to accept the fact that they did not say anything to me about the seating. Infact I had called twice. Finally, we left that place and went to some other restaurant:) Worst service and hospitality!

This is pure joyride, a totally different yet so good place, as soon as i stepped in i was feeling ok this should be good, but what happened after was so so good, make sure you book your table for hassle free experience, we started with starters like paneer tika which was very soft and in its pure taste, in the main course, i thought to test it with dal and it was the clear winner, later on we ordered shahi paneer and chana masala, chana masala had a very authentic punjabi touch while shahi paneer was perfect! A really fantastic place if u r looking for something new and delicious, take this flight and enjoy the joy ride! Kudos to management for the concept and service!

Automatic doors opening the way they do at the airport, dining area and seating designed like the inside of an airplane, and they even give you a boarding pass with your name and phone number in the end - certainly,¬†a lot of thought has gone into ensuring that Fly Kouzina provides an authentic in-flight experience; and two thumbs-up for that.
Their menu had a cool and innovative layout (a 10 on 10 for the creative categorisation of the food) and had a lot of variety. In one word, it was - impressive.¬†

Their Tandoori Broccoli Malai deserves a special mention. It's a delicious little piece of heaven and a must-have (simply reviewing it is making my mouth water). The Singapore Noodles and Virgin Sex on the Beach mocktail were great too.¬†High - C was too tangy; seemed like their version of fresh lime soda but wasn't a very good version. ¬†

The service of this place was absolutely terrific and the servers were such polite and courteous people.¬†
It was a great experience and I would love to dine again.

A nice theme based restaurant. The ambience is pretty nice based on an aircraft theme. However we could not grab a seat in the interiors where its based on a flight cabin so we had to sit outside where its like a normal restaurant. Food was very nice, with a special mention of Caesar salad which was just amazing. The only thing is its made in a small area which makes it inside a lil conjusted. Over all a good experience!

Fly Kouzina is a multi-cuisine restaurant located at AD block in Saltlake. Interiors designed like inside of a flight. Nice and clean environment with friendly staff. We ordered kadai Subz, dal makhani and breads. Portions were sufficient for 2-4 people. Kulchas did not have good stuffing. Dal was ordinary and mix veg was so so. Overall experience with food was very average. Giving 3 out of 5 only for ambience, innovative theme and cleanliness. Ok for one time visit.

Read great reviews about this place, but on trying it turned out to be quite a disappointment. On weekends they do not take reservations, however we reached quite early and got a table. However, we were a group of 6 adults with a kid and the table we were given was quite small and actually meant for a group of 4. Please make sure to take a table in the outside area of the restaurant if in a big group. The concept is agreed different with the effect of clouds and everything. However, I hated the seating arrangement, which is quite congested. Esp for weekends, since its a very small place and is new and hence running full, was very very noisy with kids crying and felt like a fish market.

We order for a veg lasagne which turned out to like a gratin and not how its supposed to be. The other items like crepe and north Indian food was quite average. Pocket pinch- Not to expensive. An average of Rs.450 per head!!

+.5 for the courteous and humble service.
The vicinity near to city centre gives us option to try a new place to dine.
Do try the restaurant's special starter like Aola bharwa tandoori and also the white sauce spaghetti pasta.
The Indian food are pretty good.
+.5 for the AEROPLANE ambience. 
I would suggest that adding dress code followed in the flight would further enhance the dining experience.
Overall another dining abode for vegetarians \/

A brand new and different theme made me try out this place! And it turned out to be a great experience for me and my friends!! The menu card is very beautifully done with unique names that tantalizes you to try them out one after the other. This particular soup called Mushroom Cappuchino caught my eye and I wasn't disappointed. The soup stock was so well made, one of the best mushroom soups I have had! It's a very convenient and healthy option for people looking for pure vegetarian options. Ambience and hospitality are remarkable! 
I had a happy and tasty flight! Did you?

There is a fresh feeling of this new restaurant.  Divided into two sections. One with family tables to accomodate large groups. And another section, which we chose, with the layout of the seats of an airplane, has tables for 4 on either side. An economy class ride with better space and comfortable seats. The led installations on the windows give the feeling of the vessel enroute. The ambience is great. About the food, I must say, its pretty good. We directly jumped to the main course without any delay. We tried paneer makhani, dal makhani, a mix veg dish, tandoori roti, garlic naan and butter naan. Food was good and served hot. Hospitality was good. A good experience. Fly high!

I had dinner here with my family few days ago and I must admit it is by far the best vegetarian food I have eaten in a long long time. What I loved most was the fact that the food was not very oily or heavy, something that is generally associated with restaurant vegetarian food. Another thing that I liked was the use of natural ingredients, for e.g: Sweet corn soup had real corns and vegetables instead of canned processed corn. Similarly the chilly paneer had real chunks of paneer instead of rubber chewy something coated and deep fried in corn flour that you would get in other restaurants. Their Italian fare is mouth watering and definitely their highlight. Overall the food is of high quality and definitely the ambiance is unique. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and would visit again and again!

We tried a north indian assortment of dishes and i highly recommend the dal makhani there. Will be visiting again soon !

A smashing experience is how I'd describe my visit to Fly Kouzina. The owners have ensured the presence of all the key attributes to a perfect restaurant i.e., great food with diverse cuisines, homely albeit classy ambience, well-behaved staff and voila - parking space as well. Particularly loved their mushroom soup and sex on the beach. I also sent my family later who said they had a great time at the restaurant ‚Äì coupled with the fact that there is an additional comfort around the restaurant serving only vegetarian food. Was reading some of the reviews and given the personal attention to each of the feedbacks, looks like Fly Kouzina is off to a flying start. Proud of you, co-pilots - Mohit and Rishi ‚Äì keep it up!!!

Pls do not visit this restaurent on Friday, Saturday & Sunday. They make sit 6 people in 4 seater sofa, which makes no space to even move the hand & if you are two or three they wont allow you to seat in the aircraft section.

The manager of the restaurent Mr Alam has no Knowledge of hospitality. They just by any means want to maximise there profit without providing the hospitality to there customers. They make there customers sit like cows and even misbehave with them.

Went to this restaurant yesterday, Very poor and slow service and highly overpriced menu. Even a small bottle of mineral water costs Rs 70, if you taken into account their various taxes. (They also charge a service charge of 5% besides the usual VAT and service tax, as if the high rates were not enough and the management would also like to grab the tip one could have otherwise given to a poor hapless waiter.)

For a seating capacity of around 80, it seems only a very small number of service staff¬† is there. We had to wait for about half an hour outside and almost one hour inside for us to be served. Pathetic service!

The food is highly fatty and one feels bloated. I think there is an attempt to sell despite what it may do to your stomach.

The hand washing facility is inside the toilet which is small and unhygienic. 

Overall,¬† a very bad experience! would not like to go again

As regards food, an attempt is to make it tasty with high fat content. It is full of fat and one feels so bloated and full despite having a small amount.

The name printed boarding pass at the entrance gives very personal touch and connect with the restaurant. The menu has a wide range of options. We ordered for Dal makhani, paneer and Naan. The dal was excellent and the Naan was crisp and hot. The service was good too.

Overall a very good experience.

Keeping in line with their one of a kind theme, Fly Kouzina recreates the same level of hospitality that one would receive at its actual counterpart. The much needed pure veg restaurant offers an assortment of delicacies, a special mention for their lip smacking risottos. Thank you to all the stewards and hostesses there for ensuring that i choose to fly with then soon enough!

Finally Saltlake Gets a new much needed pure vegetarian restaurant. The Theme of the place is something really seen for the first time in Kolkata; Aeroplane Themed :) My last 2 visits to this place has been par satisfaction. My taste buds were always satisfied and have always left the place with happy stomach and heart :) I will recommend this place to all my friends.
The place is also good for a private party for around 35-40 people
Kudos To the owners for bringing in such Good Concept

Finally a good vegetarian multi cuisine restaurant in salt lake.. Had organised 2 parties there.. The waiters were very co operative and helpful. The owners themselves stood there and were looking to our needs. The food quality was superb. All my guests were happy and appreciated it. We have always left with a happy filled stomach and smiles on our faces!!!

15 Reviews with an Average of 4-4.5 surely seem the place to be... I even heard a friend of mine going there 5th time. Knowing her I surely want to be there... Hopefully won't have to wait like she says but it's worth the wait :) Kudos to You fellas...

Waiters do not know how to talk to customers. Istead of clarifying any doubt , waiters are rude, insulting  there customers,  behaving improperly. Worst restaurant visited ever in terms of etiquettes.

This resturant may look like an aeroplane, but it surprisingly serves mostly tasteless vegetarian food and is horribly expensive. Only the pasta is moderately tasty, but the chowmein is utterly tastely. So if you are a non-vegetarian and don't want to spend too much, please don't go !

Well to start with there ambience it was excellent the airplane interior was something different for Kolkata people but a group of 5 or more have to sit separately
Food was good but very expensive and the quantity was not upto the mark the serving bowls looked only bigger in size but not in quantity 
And as far as service is conserned one should not conclude anything from a baby of ten day

I went here yesterday with a group of 3 frnds. It is based on the flight theme (they issue u a boarding pass) . we Had Italian. Tomato soup,risotto,crepes,babycorn.. Food was good with sufficient quantity. Food tasted well.we al liked it. However many items from d menu card were not available. The staff said that's bcoz thev opened up recently (16.1.15). Very soon they wil have al d food available. So if anybody wants to eat Italian (pizza again not available) den u can check this out..we liked Wat v ate. The staff were courteous,gave personal attention. Thumbs up.

I went here again on 3.4.2015.. I must say the portions have reduced. The taste remains the same for Italian but the portions have certainly reduced..

Salt lake required some theme restaurant which was different from the " run of the mill " type and it is at last there - superb ambience which is so pleasing to the eye and excellant food - loved the risotto nd am sure other dishes too would be as good. Waiting to get back there. Good luck nd keep it going ????????????????????????
