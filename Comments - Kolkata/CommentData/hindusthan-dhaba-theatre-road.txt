Been here for a friend birthday treat...  I was so excited to try this place but was highly disappointed with the food served here...  At first serving time is very high,  had to wait so much...  Ordered Chicken Tandoori ( it was not properly cooked,  pathetic) Chicken Bharta ( doesn't look like a bharta,  never had such bharta anywhere)  Chicken Kadhai ( it was good)  Butter Nan ( just ok)  Masala Kulcha ( average)  

I would never recommend to visit this place to anyone...  I crave for food,  no matter the ambience is really good but bad food really disappoints me...  Me and my friend left almost all the dishes unfinished...  It was a bad experience :(

Situated on Theatre Road above Annaras. The decor is quite basic. The only interesting element being the truck setup at the cash counter.
We had landed at a rather odd hour so only ordered starters and fresh Lime sodas
~ Paneer Hariyali Tikka- it was good but not great. The mint chutney was nice .
~ Babycorn Crispy - tasted ok but not very crispy 
~Nazakat Aloo- Was average. 
Overall the place wasn‚Äôt very impressive for me. The food wasn‚Äôt bad but there‚Äôs scope for improvement. Although if you want a quiet secluded place you could give it a try.

We had to appear for our bio-metric appearance at the nearby Jasmine Tower and were really hungry so decided to explore the area a bit. There are many street side eateries but we wanted to have a seat and relish. Hindusthan Dhaba was a rather surprise find. It's on the first floor of a building and we never expected such a huge crowd. Since we were in a hurry, we asked our server to help us and he recommended their dhaba chicken special - chicken curry topped with cream and omelette. For bread we ordered garlic and butter naan.¬† We cleaned it up with a masala coke mocktail. The food was heavenly in taste and serving time very quick on request. On my next visit to Kolkata, i will take my whole family here. Minus tips, the bill was around Rs 500 for 2 people.

Hindusthan Dhaba is the best if you are going for North Indian food. They are really good in North Indian dishes and will amaze you with their food. The price is even reasonable and won't affect you much. The last time I went, I had Kebabs which were damn soft and flavourful. You will feel the kebab melting in your mouth every time you take a bite... ‚ù§

Value for money food.
Great quantity.
Good taste.
We ordered chicken bharta along with three types of nan: plain, garlic and butter naan. And soda shikanji. Since we were just two people and the quantity was abundant, we couldn't try the other items. Chicken bharta wasn't their best dish but it was satisfactory. The bill was just around 400/- Going to visit again to try out the other dishes very soon!

Very nice place I must admit.. quality Punjabi type food at affordable prices..we were a group of 10 people and the manager was good enough to offer us the sofa(with cushions :3) type sitting..we had  Murg de Achhari and Tikka kabab(not sure about this.. forgot the exact name :3).Both were very tasty.We had their famous Vanilla blue lagoon with 7 up(2)  which was a hit too.In main course we ordered Cheese nun,cheese garlic nun,lachha paratha, tandoori rooti,masala khulcha and 3 types of chicken preparation 2 of which were Chicken Lajawaab& Chicken patiala.(name of the 3rd I dont remember  but it was suggested to us).All of them were pretty good.. chicken Patiala came with a unique egg coating which I loved.Quantity was decent..while the starter had 8 pieces of chicken..main courses had 6.
Service was moderate and Ambience &decor were cool. Will visit this place again :)

Chose this place to celebrate a birthday of our friend and have North Indian lunch along with.The waiters assisted us in arranging it beautifully with the birthday songs being played by them.They seemed really helpful.
Mostly,we were able to surprise our birthday boy.
Next to food,we were 5 of us and accordingly different food we opted.Started off with blue lagoon drinks,chicken clear soup,chicken pahari kebab,makki d roti,cheese garlic naan,stuffed naan,chicken kolapuri and chicken lajawab we ordered.Chicken kolapuri was spicier than chicken lajawab but both satisfied us.Cheese garlic naan needs special mention.
The ambience was soothing enough and spacious with large seats and a royal touch.The reception is attractive with front face of a truck.But the service seems little bit slower.
Price was appropriate and pocket-friendly.
Overall it fulfilled our needs to fullest.

Food was good.
The kebabs here are soft and extremely well absorbed with spices giving you a finger licking good feeling. 
Amritsari special kulcha and chicken kolhapuri was extremely good 
Kulfi isn't good and is not at all recommendable.
Overall 4/5!

The place is on the Hungerford road crossing . The ambience and decoration was very elegant . I ordered murgh archari tikka - well cooked, quite spicy and juicy.
Butter tandoori roti - soft and  freshly made 
Chicken kolhapuri - spicy , semi gravy and chicken was tender and perfectly cooked 
Kulfi - a round shaped kulfi which is cut into 8 pcs and not too sweet but good in taste.
Coming to service and behaviour both were more than satisfactory. I would love to visit the place again to enjoy the typical pujabi food and atmosphere.

The name gives you a proper North Indian feel and the word dhaba suggests authentic good food, which to my experience wasn‚Äôt so. Firstly, the service was really slow even though there was no crowd. The food tasted nice but wasn‚Äôt served cooked hot, which was a disappointment. The breads were amazing though. I‚Äôd rate the resturaunt 4 but -1 for the freshness of the food. 

Do try this place out as it is nice but make sure you mention to your server that you‚Äôd appreciate some hot food. 

Overall - MIGHT visit again.

Visited this restaurant a couple of days back with a few of my friends. It was my first visit to this place. To be honest I was not expecting such beautiful decor inside when I walked in. Hindusthan Dhaba deserves highest marks for look and feel.

Coming to the service, I felt like this restaurant is a bit understaffed. The servers were putting their best feet forward to serve their customers but they were struggling. But the service was good. They were changing the TV channels according to our demands as we were going back and forth between two La-liga games.

Coming to food, this restaurant has a big menu. We ordered

üçé Murg Achari Tikka

üçé Murg-E-kalimirch

üçé Murg keema masala

üçé Chicken laazawab

üç™ Butter Tandoori Roti

üç™ Butter naan

Mugh Achari Tikka was the star here. It was hot, it was spicy and had right amount of tanginess to it. Undoubtedly a great dish. If I had to rate this dish, I would give it 5/5.

Murg-E-kalimirch is a less spicy kebab. It was juicy, it retained moisture in the middle. A good dish without a doubt. (3.5/5)

Murg keema masala was an average dish taste wise. Is a good dish to have with rotis or paranthe.(2.5/5)

Chicken laazawab was again a great side dish. It had a silky gravy which was spicy and tasted really nice. The chicken pieces were well cooked. Contained 6 big chunks of chicken. (4/5)

Coming to the butter tandoori rotis, they were nice. Not a lot to talk about it. But the naans disappointed me a bit. It was very thin and a little too crispy for my liking.

Overall, this is a very good restaurant. It offers a lot of items to choose from. Great decoration adds to the dining experience. Would love to come back here and try other items. Recommendation from my side.

This place is right on theatre road. The entrance to the restaurant is a bit shabby. The interiors of the restaurant were very ordinary. Coming to the food, we ordered 2 kinds of starters:one portion of chicken tikka kebab and one portion of chicken seekh kebab. The kebabs were excellent. They were soft and juicy specially the tikka masala kebab were out of this world. For the main course we ordered masala kulcha tandoori butter roti, chicken lababdar and butter chicken. The chicken lababdar was on the spicier side making it a bit difficult for people with low spice tolerance and the butter chicken was made slightly sweet which we didn't expect cause butter chicken is meant to be more creamier and butter laden. Overall the experience was ok. My suggestion is that if you want to try out kebabs only you must check this place out.

Located on the busy Theatre Road, this Dhaba has a calm and relaxed ambience. The staffs are well behaved and courteous.

The service is extremely slow. We went for lunch and came out by the evening. There is approximately a wait of 35 minutes after an order is placed. We were famished and the late service was a big turn off. After such long wait we expected the taste of the food to be impeccable, but to our dismay that wasn't the case.

‚Ä¢ fish fingers were very basic. It was small in size with a thin piece of fish and a thick coating of bread crumb.
‚Ä¢ chicken butter masala was extremely liquidy. The masala should have been thick and rich with butter. But to our disappointment the gravy was liquid and the taste was decent. There was no sign of butter or cream as garnish.
‚Ä¢ tandoori chicken was soft and succulent. It was worth eating it. 8 pieces of well marinated and cooked chicken legs and breast was finger licking good.
‚Ä¢ fish chilli crispy was ordinary. The fish pieces were dry. It seemed that the fish wasn't fresh.
‚Ä¢ sweet lassi was extremely tasty. Thick and creamy. One glass was quite filling. It is worth having the lassi.
‚Ä¢ mutton biryani was a big disappointment. The rice was not basmati rice. It was short and fat. The taste was anything but biryani. It was red in colour unlike a biryani. The mutton pieces were soft but the taste of biryani was not close to one. It was more like a pulao.

On a whole the food was above average. The ambience is good and family like. But the service was extremely slow. After placing an order there is a wait of approximately 20 minutes. I hope they see into the service and taste of food.

Rating the Dhabas never been more keen one until we met the Hindustan Dhaba. The flawless architecture of the interior, the formidable table decorations are the one possible reason for the attraction. We decided to have "Chicken fried rice" , "Chicken butter masala" and "Plain naan". It served in an authentic Punjabi style. The quantity of chicken in chicken fried rice was good though it didn't taste so well. Coming to the butter chicken, it was delicious as hell. The melting butter over the chicken was delightful! The Naan was also light and soft. The supplements served (pickle, onions, salads) were also tasty! The staffs were also well mannered. No doubt I would say that it's a 'must visit again' kind of places.

An absolute delight to have dined here.
Visit if :
You are looking for Northern flavours not Bengali ones.

*chicken kadhai *veg amritsari *veg patiala *garlic naan *biriyani *lassi

Preparation was very good and flavours were authentic. All the gravies tasted different which is an issue now a days where every dish has the same gravy. Also the owner (the man with a turban) was very helpful and kept an eye that all guests are having a good time and orders were reaching on time. Sadly I forgot to ask his name. He also suggests what you can order. 
Am going to revisit when in park Street because it's pretty pocket friendly as well.

The guy was extremely happy with the kind of chicken they use. It was tender and juicy and all the qualities of the kebab was preserved. Would visit the restaurant myself in a week. Let's hope that they can give me the same satisfaction.

During the Puja‚Äôs I had visited this place and naturally it was packed. We were a group of 10 so we took the largest table. 
The service was a bit slow which was expected due to the rush but the waiters and the owner himself was very kind and took care of every need or complaint. 
The starters were great. I enjoyed all the kinds of kebabs we ordered. Main course was satisfactory. 
Recommended items 
 Afghani murgh , chicken tikka and chicken butter masala. 
Disappointed with the murgh Bharta.

One of my favorite North Indian dine out places in Kolkata! I come from Jaipur, but each time i do, i make sure I eat here at least once. The nazakat aaloo, the paneer butter masala, and Indian breads, i love it all! All the best! Please open another branch in or around Salt Lake!

Ordered chicken biryani and chicken chilly. The chicken in the chilly chicken was stale with rotten smell. The rice in the chicken biryani ware of  colored rice with much oil.Total waste of money. Very much disappointing. Request  Zomato  to take up the issue with the restaurant and with warning. If no improvement then the restaurant  should be removed. As consumers we trust the listed restaurants. You should not break the trust

Located in theatre road, this place is ideal for mughlai lovers. Ambience, food, and service are equally good. One should definitely try the kebabs and garlic butter nun. The chinese items too are proper in taste and flavours. 
Considering the taste and quality of the food, the price is reasonable. One can visit this restaurant even when he's brokeüòÇ.

It's in theatre road. Though the entrance is not so impressive, once you enter the restaurant you'll surely change your mind. Decor is mostly wooden with dhaba like feeling yet very neat and clean. The front portion of a truck is customised to make the cash counter. Staffs are well behaved and polite. 
We ordered non-veg thali. It consists of butter naan, chicken butter masala, pulao, raita, rasgulla, kaali daal and alu gobi, papad. All the items are very tasty and sufficient for one and we had some mocktails and the only ice cream available was blind love, which I think they made blindfolded because it was a blunder. Mocktails were average.

Located at the junction of hungerford street and shakespeare sarani,this place is a great place for people loving north indian cuisine. The ambience is good, not great, but its neatly setup with a decorated false lorry counter, which is very strange but looks very cool and goes well with the ambience and cuisine. The waiters are very decent and courteous.
Coming to the food, even though they serve chinese food too, but i would recommended going for the standard indian dishes as these are not only good to tast, but the quantity they provide for such a reasonable price is really impressive. Their kabab starters are really tasty, specially the reshmi kabab served in a layer of cloud eggs, which not only looks great but tastes very good. Their butter chicken and chicken bharta are good to taste and must fall under the 'must haves'. Of their indian rotis, the lachha paratha, aloo paratha and masala kulcha deserves slecial mention.
Overall its a great place to visit with family and friends and its very reasonable.

It was an awesome experience with Hindustan Dhaba. Location of this restaurent is very good. The ambience was very nice. The restaurent is well decorated and you will get a dhaba type feelings.I have tasted Fish Ajwani Tikka, Amritsari style Chicken Biryani.Biryani was completly different compared to kolkata biryani. But it was very nice. You should taste this biryani.

This restaurant was on my wish list for a long time. Then i visited the place twice. They serve authentic Punjabi food. First time I had nun with chicken patiala. Second time i had biryani. Food was delicious. But the biryani here tastes different. Quantity was good too. Prices are very pocket friendly here. It doesn't look like a dhaba though. It is decorated with wooden furniture. The ambience is nice. Good service. If you crave for Punjabi food I would definitely recommend this place. üòä

A surprisingly bad experience with respect to the food taste and quality. We ordered home delivery of chicken biriyani and butter chicken. The biriyani looked and tasted like saffron rice polao and was nowhere near the biriyanis of Arsalan or Royal or Shiraj. The rice tasted ok but the chicken peices were not cooked properly. They were chewy and hard. The butter chicken gravy tasted great, but unfortunately not even a single peice of chicken could be eaten because all the portions were hard uncooked and did not blend with the gravy. The chicken peices were made tandoor first then dipped in the gravy, even so they were unchewable. Expected much better food given the 4.2 rating in Zomato. Total waste of money.

Well don't go by the name...
It doesn't look like a Dhaba... totally a premium restaurant feel..wooden interior...!!
Humble staff...
Delicious food... totally value for money....
They serve the best cheese garlic naan I've ever had..
Too much cheese naan cooked with love...
Crispy Baby corn was a but let down.. wasn't what I expected... Toffu Chilly Milly, a paneer dish cooked with all greens...it was also delicious...the chilly punch was just amazing.... Kachai Veg it was also amazing...all sorts of veggies cooked together... little burnt vegetable Flavour was mouth watering...
Amritsari Kulcha & Dal Makhni which is I think is their signature dish..was a let down...lacked the punch...needed some more flavors... And never ever by any chance order the red blood mocktail..it was the worst decision of ours...
Otherwise all the delicacies we're mouth watering..and delicious... Way too much than one can ask for..!!
Totally worth your money..and Worth giving it a try..!!
One of the major let down was that they had a special limited menu for Puja.. because I wanted to order more thing from their regular menu..!!

For the past 5-6 months in Kolkata, I had seen this restaurant multiple times but never got a chance to visit it. Today was the day when I finally ended up at this place with 3 other friends of mine.

The location can be easily located. The Restaurant is on the first floor. Once you enter the restaurant, you would love the ambiance. You will find a proper touch of a Punjabi dhaba from the cash counter to the people serving the food.Since we went early so got the table pretty easily.

Coming to the food, we ordered Full butter chicken, dal makhani, paneer butter masala, garlic naan, stuffed kulcha, lachha parantha and tandoori roti. The service was quick and we didn‚Äôt have to wait for long. 

The food i must say was delicious. Food served was hot and once u take the first bite, You get the proper Delhi type flavour. Breads were soft and well cooked. 

I must again say that even though The place was almost full still the service was quick. Full marks to the taste and the service. The starters looked yummy too but couldn‚Äôt order. 

Coming to the price, the rates were pocket friendly. A north Indian restaurant offering such good quality of food at this rates is hard to find in Kolkata. 

Overall experience was great. The complete staff was quite friendly. If you wish to have a north Indian meal, just don‚Äôt think about any other place and directly go to this place without any second thought. This place will definitely not disappoint you. Looking forward to visit this place again.

The place does not have a good feeling at all.  As soon u reach the 1st floor ull find garbage in front of u which is a big turn off. 

Thumbs up -  Am sorry to say but nothing is good about the place.  The ambience is bad food was just OK service was pathetic ( it could be due to a big family,  close to 15 odd people,  were having dinner at the same time. ).  We had ordered for a full North Indian dinner but neither there was any presentation to it nor any taste to it. 

Thumbs down - everything.  I seriously feel that dishes are over charged. They should look into the food taste and presentation. Kebabs should be accompanied with mint chutney and onions. Train the staff to attend to customer requirements and also look out for the missing things on the table. 

It can be a better place if few things are fixed.

Karchitor North Indian food served here...went there with a group of friends during durga puja..as expected,the place was a bit crowded but we got our seats easily. The service was a bit slow owing to the puja rush..but take my word it was worth the wait.we ordered achari paneer Tikka for the starters which was nicely prepared,the masala papad was same as everywhere else. Main course consisted of butter chicken, paneer makhani and Kali dal along with tandoori roti..the paneer makhani was very nicely prepared and it melted in the mouth.my friends told that the chicken item was also very delicious..the highlight of the place is that despite being located on a posh locality and serving great food,it is quiet light on the pocket,infact it's cheap.. all n all a great place to have North Indian food..

This is a huge restaurant on the Theatre Road/ Shakespeare Sarani Road and I was eager to know what is the USP of this place. We visited this place on a Wednesday night and found that only one more table was occupied; the entire restaurant was empty. Except the Billing section which is themed as a Truck's front face, no other part of the restaurant has a catchy resemblance. This place usually bustles up in the afternoon and is busy for online deliveries.

We started with the Veg Crispy and the Paneer Achari Tikka. The former is a crispy roll cut into pieces with vegetable fillings. The Paneer Tikka was not upto the mark.
We ordered Tandoori Roti, Kadai Paneer and Kofta for our main course which was satisfactory in taste. The USP of this place is the price tag which is very reasonable and the quantity served is enough for three person. However a better taste will surely bring in more business than usual.

This place was on my wishlist from quite a long time and atlast we visited it... We were expecting a long queue infront the restaurant but fortunately it was empty & we got our seats.. The place is big enough with dim light & soft panjabi songs playing in the background. The staffs are well mannered but little late in taking and delivering orders. There was also a special menu card for the Puja days.

We ordered for Chicken Sheekh Beo for starters..this is the best which i loved.. it was well marinated with a cheesy flavor & anyone can fall in love with this dish.. In the main part, we ordered for Makki di Roti, Masala Kulcha with Mutton Sulemani. As i love panjabi foods, i loved Makki di Roti...it was crispy. Mutton Sulemani was spicy with 5pc of mutton... it went well with both the breads.

For moctails we ordered Electrical Blue & Black Currant with pepsi...both were good.

One thing which i didn't liked that they dont accept Rupay cards & as i have no other cards or cash, I have to find an ATM to withdraw cash. If they dont accept certain cards they should mentioned it... This was the one which dissapointed me but foods are awesome.

Our pocket pinch was rs 1330, a little expensive !!!Shrea Ghosh

Such a good beautiful place. I went there with my fam in Durga Puja Saptami evening. 
Foods are up to the mark. We ordered Pindwali Bhattida murgh in starter. Laccha paratha with Murgh Anarkali and Mutton-E-Badsahi. And done with Blue Logoon. 
But the drawback is service was too slow we had to wait minimum 30minutes after getting the table.

This is actually a Pure North Indian restaurant. The biryani they served is not a Kolkata‚Äôs biryani is style. Please do not expect that. Bengali Dishes like Chicken Kassa is not so tasty. Rather they add a North Indian flavour. Other North Indian and punjabi foods are good. Decors are also good. Behaviours of stuffs are good.

So popularity but worth nothing the food omg least expected and the tandoori tooti ewwww ewww ewww these were like chapatis and when asked the Punjabi owner he said Bengali logo ko aise hi pasand hai patli patli i was like wtf.... Because i am from north and i now how original tandoori rotis are like you can hardly eat two and here i ate 4 tandoori and 1 naan and nan here was even worse than tandoori roti.. We waited for 45 min for our food being serve. Soo pathetic after writing this i'm changing my 2.5 review to 1. He can fool innocent Bengalis but not me :(...disappointed

1 panner tikka (starter)
1 crispy babycorn (starter)

The rates are reasonable and the food taste's great.
I would recommend this place and am soon going there again.

After a busy work schedule ,I wanted to have a good lunch with my team during Durga puja.I searched zomato and found this dhaba nearby.Taking help of google map and Street vendor reached the place at theatre road or Shakespeare sarani.It is situated in the first floor of a building and there entry gate design is quite attractive.The moment I entered the dhaba,it was clear that this is not a typical roadside dhaba.A well decored place with wooden tables and comfortable wooden chairs with cushions.We ordered Chicken tamdoori,Jeera rice ,Chicken patiala,Chicken banjara,tandoori roti and some mocktails of 7up and thumbs up.Chicken tandoori was one of the best I have ever had.The jeera rice was very tasty,chicken banjara was sweet in taste but its good if you have it with tandoori roti.Jeera rice and chicken patiala is a good combination.All the staffs and waiters was well behaved and serving of food took 15-30mins due to puja rush.I liked the food and will visit again.If you visit the dhaba,kindly please notice the cash counter,and check out their innovative idea.

The place was empty when me and my friends reached there. The place is nothing like a dhaba, feels like some good restaurant with the wooden decors and all. However, the cushions are very dirty. That's one minus point. Me and my friends ordered jeera rice and chicken kohlapuri. 2 plates of jeera rice will well suffice for three medium eaters. 
The jeera rice was the best I had till date. 
Chicken kohlapuri came in red spicy gravy with 6 pieces of chicken. The chicken preparation was also up to the mark.
The staff were courteous.
Overall a pocket friendly place which serves good food.

The worst food I ever had. According to the zomato  the chicken biriyani is one of the best selling items. But I had the worst biriyani in my life. The whole thing was red and there was no flavor of biriyani at all. If they are selling this kind of biriyani in Kolkata, the restaurant should be closed.

Extremely unsatisfied with the quality of food. Never try out the Biriyani. Its awful. Same goes for the Chowmein. If you don't at all have an option you may try out the Rice items. The Indian dishes both Veg and Non-veg almost taste the same. You will hardly be able to differentiate. Awful experience.

No taste in the food at all.
Ordered sweet corn soup and it was smelling.
Crispy chicken was satisfactory.
Hara bhara kabab was satisfactory too but a bit bland.
We ordered one veg and non veg thali which was tasteless. 
Chola puri's puri was hard. 
And in drinks we had ordered jeera soda and shikanji. Maybe roadside sodawalas make better than them. 
Sheer disappointment! 
Overrated place.

The taste of the food was not at all up to the mark. Having an overall rating of almost 4.3 I was really dissatisfied with the quality of food served.¬†

We ordered Kadhai Paneer, Dal Makhni, Tandoori Roti & Fresh Lime Soda. The taste of the food was below average to say the least and fresh lime soda seemed more like a cold water with few drops of sweet lime.¬†

Even though the restaurant was not crowded, the taste was bad service was very slow.

Hindusthan Dhaba is a nice & ever dependable food stop on NH2.Now they have upped the shutters at Shakespeare Sarani,very near to the Camac Street crossing.Maintaining the typical dhaba feel they have a menu card that is really long offering Indian,Mughlai,Tandoor & Chinese dishes.We started with a lovely Virgin Mojito.Azwani mahi tikka was tasty & low on masala.Then came the Mutton biriyani & the signature Banjara gosht.Biriyani had a distinct taste & the amount was sufficient for 2 persons with four chunks of meat.The courteous staffs & prompt service made the whole experience more palatable.Balle balle for this one!

Oishik purchased a nearbuy combo offr for us. These includes fresh lime soda, chicken tikka, butter nun, dal makhani, jeera rice, chicken butter masala, vanilla ice crm. These all r punjabi style food.  All of these were garnished perfectly. Taste wise dal makhani was awesome . Rice nd chicken butter masala was also good. Starter was okay type. Quantity was good enough for us. 
  All through they project a professional image with their food quality, staffs, ambiance...
Highly recommended..

So, finally managed to go here. The food was good. And the service was quick. 
This branch is on theatre Road. We ordered a tandoori Chicken Tikka, which was well cooked and tasty. Laccha Paratha was ok ok. I liked the Butter Kulcha more than the Laccha Paratha. Chicken Patiala was not upto the mark.Lastly, we ordered a Lassi. Lassi is a must when you visit a dhaba.

Got this deal on Nearbuy & after seeing their high rating, No way I would've missed the deal. This branch of Hindusthan Dhaba is on Theatre Road. Big banner holding on the building will make it easy to identify & the dhaba is located on the first floor.

Ambiance : This place doesn't actually looks like a Dhaba but the ambience is quite decent. Wooden chairs with cusions are comfortable, tables & table decorations mathes the theme. Warm white lights lit the place while music playing in the background makes the mood. Simple, sophisticated & premium is the perfect keywords for this place.

Staffs and Management : At the time of visiting very few service guys were present but they treated us very well. They were well behaved & well dressed. But the service was bit slow that maybe due to limited staffs present at that time.

Foods : Coming to the foods, this was the menu of the deal.

Cold Drinks : We started with Sprite served in a glass with a straw. Simple but was must at that time to kill thrust & jump into their foods.

Chicken Tikka Kebab (3.5/5): There was six average to big sized pieces of Chicken. It was red spicy, well cooked & garnished, but don't know why it was wet on a side. However it still tasted very good. They served enough green chatney & salad with it.

Masala Kulcha (2/5): Thin but big this Masala Kulcha was bit dried inside & oily outside. It felt like fried roti but with their excellent Dal Makhani it felt yummy.

Dal Makhani (4/5): Served in a bucket I just fall in love with their Dal Makhani. Buttery smooth taste of it was pampering the tastebuds & then melting in the mouth. Just the right amount of spices & well cooked pulse made it just perfect for trying it with Kulcha. Quantity served was enough for two people. Its a must try over here.

Jeera Rice (4/5): Although I am not a fan of Jeera Rice still I need to agree their Jeera Rice was something different. A distinct flavour made their rice so special to taste & maybe for the same reason it is listed in loved foods. Perfectly cooked high grain rice was making it taste much better but the quantity could have been better.

Chicken Masala (3.5/5): This dish came with 4 medium sized chicken pieces & dark gravy served in a handi that looked delicious. It was much spicey than I thought but went well with Jeera Rice. Chicken pieces were well cooked just the flavour of sliced ginger on top was bit higher. Portion served was good.

Vanilla Ice Cream : Pretty simple scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream but definitely a must have after this heavy meal.

Pricing : Foods are not really expensive here, so I will call it a pocket friendly Dhaba.

Conclusion : Not the purest Dhaba style food you can expect but surely you will get homely made good quality food with good portion. Nice ambience, wonderful service, great food & price, Hindusthan Dhaba offers it all.

I've recently been to this place. I wasn't sure if going here is a good decision or not as I hadn't heard much about the place. But it turns out to be a good surprise. The food is impressive. Everything tasted good but paneer tikka in particular won my heart. Not much of noise or anything. Decor is also simple. Just one thing that could've been better is the service speed. It's quite slow. I went on a weekday and the place wasn't much occupied yet the service was very slow which at a point disappointed me. Apart from that everything else is great.

This is one of the finest dine out restaurants in Kolkata. The ambience and the food is just awesome. We ordered Veg Makhni Masala, Mutton Kasa and Chicken Do Pyaza along with tandorri roti. 

Veg Makhni Masala: assorted paneer, carrot, mushroom, beans and peas cooked in tomato and onion gravy was just awesome. 

Mutton Kasa: I dont eat non veg but my friends said it was the best they have ever had in their entire life. So, you might wanna try it next time you go there. The gravy they said was finger licking good.

Chicken do pyaza: Well they didn't like it that much but it was okay.

Overall a pretty good place for both vegans and non vegans. Their price is also very reasonable. Highly
Recommended for everyone. You dont want to miss this one in Kolkata.

The setting of the restaurant is just like a dhaba..
Where the table is slightly down at ur knee level.. quite different from the normal tables..
It is slightly far from metro..it is almost the same distance from both the metro stations..maidan metro and rabindra sadan metro..
The food is awesome..but it takes a bit time to prepare the orders..so i would suggest to order the main course as early as possible..as they take time to serve..
The quality of the food is good..
The biryani is quite different from the normal biryani available in Kolkata..the side dishes have a great quantity..

I have been to this place thrice and would like to specifically mention the third visit.
We paid through dineout and so we were served complimentary soft drinks as well.
We ordered:
‚òÜMurgh Malai Tikka: The chicken was well marinated in Malai n spices. I liked the green chutney they served.
‚òÜButter Chicken: It was delicious, one of the best versions of this dish I've had. The quantity served in half plate was sufficient too.
‚òÜGarlic Naan: I love Garlic Naan and they made it really light and flavoured.
‚óãTheir service always impresses me, the waiters are very courteous and efficient.
‚óãAmbience is charming. The dhaba gives a cultured and feel good vibe! The white cushions upgrade the charm.
I would love to visit them again. Their other dishes are good too although I'm yet to try the Chinese items.

Ordered the pepperoni pizza and spaghatti Carbonara which got delivered to me after 1 hr 20 mins and the pizza was stone cold and the carbonara full of salt after calling and complaing the restaurant manager called back and said it was the fault of Zomato for collecting the order late n delivering it late and he would replace the carbonara and not the pizza so my rs 600 goes down the drain. Anyways so finally i agreed and i get my replaced Carbonara with some hope, and it failed again basically they dont know how to make Carbonara it tastes like spaghetti with milk n herbs.
i would never recommend any one to order from here.

We needed seat for 12 and a great arrangement was done. The decor looks royal. Servicing is fantastic. They are courteous and suggest well the quantity required for so many people. Crispy chilli corn is a hit hit for starters along with lime soda/ masala soda. The nan was not up to the mark as I felt it was too oily and more like a paratha but the chicken bharta and chicken kolhapuri is yumilicious making me stop whining about the nan. Pocket pinch: Within three thousand. A warm and cozy place to have good lunch within budget.

This restaurant opened its doors in October 2016 . the restaurant has become very much popular in such short span of time . This dhaba  won THE RESTAURANT AWARDS 2017,East India Edition.This place gives the perfect dhaba feel and the truck shaped counter just adds to the ambience of the place .

The staff is very welcoming, polite , helpful and informative . By far the best staff I have come across.This place provides the authentic taste of Punjabi flavours which ensorcells the taste buds . Their menu includes Chicken Patiala ,a dish which is served in this restaurant only in kolkata .Other most loved dishes include Chicken Banjara ,Murg Masala ,Tadka-e-Murg,Butter Chicken ,daal makhni ,Paneer jhalfrezi and shahi paneer.

This dhaba is mostly crowded ,yet the management is so efficient that there is no hassle . The customer needs are always put first in this restaurant . The servers and the manager makes sure that customers are well provided and welcomes the feedback.

The pocket pinch is decent and the food is worth every penny or maybe more .One of the best dhabas in kolkata. A must visit for a food lover or people wanting to try out traditional Punjabi food .

Food quality is beyond the criticism.
We have ordered chicken tandoori Banjara.the item is well decorated and the pieces are mouth watering to see..the biryani was totally different tasted than the Kolkata style biryani.. garlic chicken was also good.but the most lovely dish was chicken banjaara..it was served very hot as it came direct from the kitchen..the dahi's flavour added with the gravy made it something special.also pocket friendly and highly recommended

Location : Close to the Pretoria street and Shakespeare sarani crossing,this eatery stands tall on the right hand side.
Ambience : The perfect dhaba feel embraces right after stepping in.The truck shaped billing counter only adds to the Punjabi feel.The staffs are very welcoming,well mannered and informative.
Food : Authentic punjabi flavours hit the tastebuds in such a way that makes you plan your next meal at this place,already.The thaali containing two pieces of nun smeared with a dollop of butter,a medium sized bowl full of non-spicy,desi ghee tossed kesari pulao loaded with fresh veggies and paneer chunks,a portion of each-super yum mixed veggies with paneer,creamy daal makhani,a spicy paneer dish,mixed raita,papad and rasgulla - didn't only win over,but also was really light on pocket ! üòá
The two chicken dishes that we ordered - chicken bharta (shredded chicken in a buttery gravy) and chicken do pyaza (4 chicken pieces with bone,cooked in a onion-tomato-chilli based gravy) were equally delicious.
A plate full of baby onions,an awesome pickle and fresh green chillies were served by side.
Overall,a 10/10 restaurant.

We ordered 2 thalis and soup
The thalis menu looked appetizing since they were offering a lot, despite very affordable price. We made a few changes in the items to be served which was accommodated by the management after repeated requests.
The food was served very quickly.
1. Creamy tomato soup- very little salt and pepper. It was too sweet. Bread crumbs can be increased.
2. Thalis were too oily. Butter naan, and pulao served was very very oily. The sabzis included dal makhni, Chana masala and panner, which were very average, so was the jaggery rassgulla.
3. Despite being located in a posh area, the ambience is seriously pathetic. The view outside, the entrance, everything spoils the mood.
A lot can be done to improve the food quality.

The food is ok not out of the world, it is like 10 other restaurants in city will server same taste.
Honestly it is not that great that it should be rated 4 plus.
Chicken starters were same as all other places same goes for chicken main course dishes.
Dal makhani was too very average it could have been cooked better.

I wanted to visit a north Indian restaurant for my birthday and selected this due to its good reviews.It is situated in Shakespeare Sarani.You have to walk towards Kala Mandir from AC Market.You can spot it on your right.It is situated on the main road so you can easily locate it.

It's a Punjabi themed restaurant.It looks and feel punjabi.The attendants welcome you in their Punjabi attire and charm.The seating is comfortable.If you are a fan of punjabi music you are going to love it.The service was quick and the waiters were cordial and helped us select the starters

Coming to the food now we ordered lassi,Tangri kebab,malal kebab,Chicken biriyani,Naan and Butter Chicken
Lassi was nothing fancy here.It wasn't bad but i have had better lassi than this.

Tangri kebab had a different feel and taste to it.It was stuffed with cashew and other dry fruits but it did maintain the smokey flavour i expected it to have.I haven't tasted something like this before.Try it if you like to experiment with food.

Malai kebabs were plain and bland it had a rubbery texture and we were thoroughly disappointed with it.Not at all recommended

Chicken biriyani.It was Hyderabadi biriyani and i liked it.it was spicy yet sweet and had small chunks of meat just as I like it.If you are bored of The Calcutta biriyani,this will give your taste bud a must needed change.Highly recommended

The naans were soft and buttery.Nothing more to write about it.

The showstopper here was the butter chicken.It was soo creamy and sooo good.The chicken was soft and tender.It did go perfectly with the naan.A must try here.

Overall I was happy with my decision to come here.If you are looking for some great  punjabi food,this is the place to be.Just don't order their malai kebab.Cheers.

Location : Close to the Pretoria street and Shakespeare sarani crossing,this eatery stands tall on the right hand side.
Ambience : The perfect dhaba feel embraces right after stepping in.The truck shaped billing counter only adds to the Punjabi feel.The staffs are very welcoming,well mannered and informative.
Food : Authentic punjabi flavours hit the tastebuds in such a way that makes you plan your next meal at this place,already.The thaali containing two pieces of nun smeared with a dollop of butter,a medium sized bowl full of non-spicy,desi ghee tossed kesari pulao loaded with fresh veggies and paneer chunks,a portion of each-super yum mixed veggies with paneer,creamy daal makhani,a spicy paneer dish,mixed raita,papad and rasgulla - didn't only win over,but also was really light on pocket ! üòá
The two chicken dishes that we ordered - chicken bharta (shredded chicken in a buttery gravy) and chicken do pyaza (4 chicken pieces with bone,cooked in a onion-tomato-chilli based gravy) were equally delicious.
A plate full of baby onions,an awesome pickle and fresh green chillies were served by side.
Overall,a 10/10 restaurant.

We ordered 2 thalis and soup
The thalis menu looked appetizing since they were offering a lot, despite very affordable price. We made a few changes in the items to be served which was accommodated by the management after repeated requests.
The food was served very quickly.
1. Creamy tomato soup- very little salt and pepper. It was too sweet. Bread crumbs can be increased.
2. Thalis were too oily. Butter naan, and pulao served was very very oily. The sabzis included dal makhni, Chana masala and panner, which were very average, so was the jaggery rassgulla.
3. Despite being located in a posh area, the ambience is seriously pathetic. The view outside, the entrance, everything spoils the mood.
A lot can be done to improve the food quality.

The food is ok not out of the world, it is like 10 other restaurants in city will server same taste.
Honestly it is not that great that it should be rated 4 plus.
Chicken starters were same as all other places same goes for chicken main course dishes.
Dal makhani was too very average it could have been cooked better.

I have been to hindustan dhaba twice... The amritatsari kulcha and masala kulcha are very yummy.. Paneer da masala is having authentic taste of punjab.. Dumb aloo is too delecious... Don't go for paneer lababdar as it was not at all lababdar with very less amount of cream and too spicy... The owner is very humble.. The service is a bit slow but that is worth waiting..

Mughlai starters are really good and mughlai main courses as well except Biriyani. And another dish which really blown away our tastebud,  is chicken schezwan fried rice. We also tried mixed noodles which was not up to the mark but that murg lajawab and garlic cheese nun was remarkably awesome ‚ù§

Went there with my friends on my birthday a few days back. Located on the first floor with one side looking out on the main road(Shakespeare Sarani), this place has all the one would get when they go into proper punjab styled Dhaba. With it's wooden inside decor and soothing lightings, this place is a treat to eyes. As for the staffs and services, this place is the best at these two... That's what I think in my four year stay in this city. In food section, We ordered Chicken Tandoori Banjara as starter, Chicken Banjara and Chicken Lazawab with Laccha Paratha and Tandoori Roti a starter. We also ordered some fresh lime soda too.  The food tasted awesome and that flavours were yum. Plus the price tag is also very economical.  I'll surely visit this place again. 

(P.s.- I also Uploading a picture of the cake prepared by my friends

Their USP is affordable dhaba food in an expensive area that has a dearth of such joints in terms of the price point. However they fail to deliver on taste. The food was heavy and greasy and no where even close to the tasty dhaba food we are used to. Rush hours don't justify average food quality.

Pocket friendly place, a great ambience, decent serving and a well-to-do menu to select varieties sets the place apart in an area like Theatre road. We ordered a variety from both the chinese and the north indian dish.

The combination of masala was lipsmacking and it has the trend to maintain the same in all the dishes we had. It's a thereby recommendation to visit this place and try your options out to certain the same :)

During my stay in Punjab for 3 years I had the pleasure of digging into hearty Punjabi food laiden with desi ghee and butter. Strictly not for the faint hearted.  I was in search for such delightful Punjabi food in Kolkata till such time I visited this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon.

If you want great tasting rustic authentic Punjabi khana then this is the place to be. Of course they have toned down on the fat keeping the flavours intact. 

The interiors are decent. Air-conditioned. Seating comfortable.

I went with my family. We straight away ordered the starters and got so carried away that we ordered the following one after the other.  Mushroom tikka, tangri kabab, fish ajwaini tikka and murg malai tikka, murg pahari tikka and a sweet chicken soup for my grand son Adi. All the kababs were juicy and succulent. 
After that we did not have much room for the mains. So ordered Punjabi dal, mutton Rogan Josh and roti/ naan.  The dal was phenomenal. As they say in Punjab, you can judge a eating joint by the taste of the slow cooked dal. We found the owner Mr Jitender Singh Chahal and his son to be friendly and integrating with the diners. That makes all the difference.
Best of all.. the bill was much less than I expected. 
Highly recommended.

I visited this place today for lunch after my class with some friends. We ordered paneer tikka masala and butter roti, the roti was soaked in butter and i love it and paneer tikka masala was top-notch. Yellow dal tadka is of only 89 bucks and i like it very much and veg schezwan rice was too much spicy and i love spicy. Sorry folks couldn't take many pictures because the food was too much good and i was busy in eating, licking all my fingers still. By the way the big guy is the owner. Humble and down to earth guy. Bhaiyaaji tussi great ho. The service can be improved though.

After a long walk from the maidan metro station amidst heavy shower, when we entered in this restaurant a cosy feeling covered us.
The decor and ambience was a retro one...
With punjabi bhangra music, wooden tables, comfortable couches it can be a pleasant experience for the peevish foodies also.
Now coming to the dishes. We had had there Chicken Tangri Kebab, Vegetable Polao and Mutton Golbaari.
The kebab was just ecstatic. It was filled with stuffings and served with pudina chutney and salad. The taste was so unique, that it can be relished for a long time. The vegetable polao was a bit different from the normal taste. As an unaccustomed foody of the dhabas this taste did not impress me that much but it was nice to have. Mutton golbari was a different type of preparation with thick greavy. It was nice to eat though.
But I would like to urge to the restaurant management, so that they could increase the amount of the main dishes (like pulao etc) then it could be a happier destination for the food crazies.
Overall, with nice ambience, good food quality and within the budget range Hindusthan Dhaba can be considered as a Must Go destination for the food lovers of Kolkata.

I bookmarked this place when I saw on Facebook that it has won the award for the restaurant serving best North Indian food in Eastern India. After seeing that post I was eagerly waiting for a chance to visit this place. I am a big fan of North Indian cuisine n frankly saying after visiting so many places in Kolkata I never had lip smackingly good North Indian food. God answered my prayers and Hindustan dhaba came to rescue. This place is located on Shakespeare sarani very close to kafe Bindaas. They should put up some board coz it located on d 1st floor of a building n one can easily miss it.
The interiors of this place is very good. We went on Sunday evening at 7.30 and quite surprisingly this place was almost empty. 
Comming to the food we ordered Pahari tikka for starters and it was quite ok not upto the mark I had more expectations.
For mains we had chicken biryani, butter chicken and roti. The mains really upped the level it was fabulous.
The chicken biryani was not the regular kolkata biryani it was served without potato and it was really very yum I was carving for spicy biryani from a long time.
Butter chicken was the best butter chicken I have had in Kolkata really loved it.
Overall experience was very nice only they took very long time to serve the food.
Would definitely visit again.

I have fallen for Punjab as a whole it seems after a bite at this place... Great food... Has the capabilty to lift ur mood with their amazing food.
For starters, we had, Tangdi kebab-- This is definitely going into my list of some of the best starters I ever had... The chicken was succulent and juicy... It seemed to come straight out of heaven... It had a tinge of ghee which lifted the texture to a whole different level... Highly recommended!!
For the mains, we went for,
Chicken bharta-- The only reason I deducted half a mark from my rating... It was not as packed with flavours as u wud expect from a minced chicken dish...It lacked the spice which we look forward to in a Punjabi dish.
Chicken lababdar-- Please have this if u are at Hindustan dhaba... A brilliant preparation with the right amount of spices with perfectly prepared chicken... This dish really took me to the moon and back...
Butter naan-- The naans were good enough and thin which is how I prefer them to be... However would have liked them to be smoother in texture.
As to the ambience, it is well enough for a family meal and the staff is courteous and helpful... As to the pocket pinch... It is one of the most pocket friendly places in the city vis a vis the quality of food they serve... A must visit place without a doubtüòä

The restaurant is extraordinary in all aspects : food,service and especially ambience. Very reasonable price. Ordered butter nan, tandoori roti lachha paratha which were decent but the quality and the quantity of the chicken butter masala ordered were just fabulous. Took murg kabab as starters which were quite delicious. Overall a perfect place for punjabi food lovers. Highly recommended.

Visited last Sunday with friend. First timers will be little confused about entrance but don't worry, Darwan Ji guide you to the right place.

Quite atmosphere with spacious decoration and lovely Punjabi background numbers make the ambience superb. We ordered Steame Rice with Chicken Kolapuri & Bhetki Masala and Masala Chaas as beverages. Rice was normal in quantity & quality, Chicken Kolapuri(6 Pcs.) & Bhetki(4Pcs.) portion & size was Good. Also the taste was spicy & delicious. It's cost us 800/-
I recommend Hindusthan Dhaba for good food & cozy ambience. You can surely go with your family & friends.

This place was in my wishlist for a long long time.. finally decided to visit it on the eve of rath yatra 2k17.. 
 
Location:- Near the very popular Arun Tea Stall.. Right on the Shakespeare sarani.. its a one way road so may be bit problematic..

Ambience :- Top Notch..üëçüëç A guy dressed in punjabi style guided us through the lift to the 1st floor where the restaurant is located... The comfy chairs with Soft cushions were a sigh of relief..üòç

Service :- The staff were very polite and courteous.. The service was excellent.. 

Food :- 

STARTERS :- 1) Chicken tangdi kebab :- It was simply lip smacking... The tangdi pieces were soft with keema inside it used as stuffing.. The best tangdi kebab I have ever had... (5/5)

2) Chicken Malai Tikka :- another must try dish over here... The pieces were very tender and juicy.. With Malai over it.. whoaaa... simply delicious..

Main Course :- After having the starters we were near about full.. yes the quantity was huge...‚ò∫

We ordered two chicken biriyani.. The biryani was quite different from the usual kolkata style biriyani we have... No aloo but the taste was great.. With 3 small pieces of chicken..üëçüëç A little bit spicy though.. and the quantity was huge.. more than enough for 2..

The biriyani was accompanied by chicken lababadar... The aroma of the dish will simply blow you out..üòç The gravy was simply amazing.. A must must try dish...

So today I went to this place which was recommended by my friend who came across this place in zomato wanted us to try. Located in somewhere near bk market, it's a nice family restaurant which serves authentic north Indian and Chinese food. Since we were a bit done with cafes we tried to eat something dhaba style and this is one good place. The ambience is quite good,calm and peaceful. And the service is good too. We were attended well and taken care of. Coming to the food we ordered a normal lassi, tandori murg kebab, murg malai tikka for starters and chicken biryani, butter naan and butter chicken masala. The tandori murg was one of the finest kebab I have actually had, it's just a bit heavy and filling. Murg malai tikka was soft and tender and tasted good. Now coming to the biryani, well it was nothing like the Kolkata biryani that we get to taste everywhere with aloo in it. But if you want to try something else, it's a good option. Spicy and full of flavour but without an aloo. You can ask for one if you want though. It was cooked in Punjabi style and was similar to Hyderabadi style. The butter chicken was average. Kebabs are simply the star of the menu. The quality as well as quantity is good. A good place to enjoy north Indian with your family.

Visited the place on a fine Sunday evening. Really easy to locate, however, the restaurant was on the first floor. The ambience was superb and somewhat peaceful, a perfect place for romantic and family dinners. The decor was kinda traditional. The staffs were super cordial. [5/5]
In starters' we ordered mushroom tikka and chicken tandoori tikka. Quantity was ample and the dishes were really spiced the toungue to a gentle slope of higher expectations. The main course comprised of punjabi dal tadka, a perfect blend of lentils & best of Indian spices; veg makhni masala, paneer and mixed vegetables savoury to the core with a spread of butter; chicken lababdaar was kinda exotic in it's taste; plain naan and zeera rice(rice I felt could have been prepared better, nonetheless wasn't a disappointment either). For the dessert we ordered kulfi, well, one of the very few places who actually have preserved the authenticity of the same.[4/5]
Well, the quantity and quality of the servings and the the overall behaviour of the staff do actually draw a happy face for the customers visiting the place.

Ambiance: absolutely beautiful! Comfortable chairs, innovative pleasing decor, soft Punjabi music in the background.¬†

Servers/Service: very courteous and friendly. Our server had a lovely smile throughout. They know their menu well so you can ask them for any suggestions. They are very attentive.¬†

Food:¬†
Lip smacking, authentic Punjabi food. They do offer Chinese too but I can never think of any other cuisine in a dhaba except Punjabi so we tried out a couple of Punjabi dishes.

We ordered the following:

1. Tandoori Chicken Tikka: loved every bit of it. Juicy, tender chicken with the right amount of spices.
2. Butter Kulcha: Delicious!
3. Chicken Banjara: loved the sweet creamy gravy. The sweetness was the right amount and did not overpower the dish so brownie points for that.
4. Tadka Dal Makhani: cooked beautifully. It is a spicy dish so more than me, my fiance loved it!
5. Masala Chaas: very refreshing. Loved it!

Pocket Pinch: Rs. 909/- (including taxes)

Apart from the food being delicious, they offer a good quantity which definitely gives a value for money.

This place is on my 'must-visit again' list for sure!

Getting a perfect Punjabi dhaba feel is something you'll rarely find in Kolkata, Hindustan dhaba contents our need and lived up to our expectations.

It is located on theater road near Arun tea stall. There is a mysterious way to reach the first floor of authentic Punjabi flavoursome dhaba. You enter and see a half structured truck, people with turban and hear some amazing Punjabi tracks which will make you groove.

We ordered fish fingers for starters. Chicken patiala, chicken methi malai and chicken amritsari with Indian breads like tandoori butter roti,butter naan and garlic naan for the main course. Needless to say, all the bowls of food were exquisite and impressive.

If you Want to visit the place which gives the perfect flavour, ambience and quick service, must drop in here. "Hindusthan dhaba di shaan vakhri"

Hindusthan Dhaba is one of the famous punjabi dhaba of Kolkata located in Theatre Road.The ambience is really cool and classy with sophisticated furnitures. In starter we orderd Chicken Tangri,it's just wow,lipsmacking item,chicken were soft and tasty. Dal Makhani was pretty good with Masala Kulcha. In main course one should try their Jeera Rice with other preparations instead of biriyanis. Jeera rice was excellent.Chicken Bharta is highly recommended.In drinks,you can try Fresh lime soda.Rates are standard with prompt service.Highly recommended place for Dhaba Lovers.

Another fine punjabi food joint in kolkata.
Really pleased to visited this place.
The decor, the service, the food everything is joy.
Ordered chicken tangri, jeera rice, veg pulao, chicken patiala, chicken lababdar and masala kulcha.
Chicken tangri is one of the best kebab I have ever had, stuffed with keema and little crispy, little spicy.
Both chicken dishes were good. You will get the perfect taste if you try chicken patiala with masala kulcha.
Pulao was somewhat little bit deprived of salt. Otherwise all the food items were delicious.
Last but not the least I am little disappointed with the lassi they serves. Though the lassi is no doubt good at taste but it was served warm.

Coming to the food they serve north Indian as well as Chinese cuisine. The taste was good but the quantity was a little less according to me.

Overall no disappointments and would definitely visit again.

Last Sunday me & my friend went there. We took d deal of 4 course meal @ 549/- from Nearbuy. It included..
Welcome Drinks (2) (We chose Sprite)
As Starters:-
Chicken Tikka Kebabs (6 pcs)
Followed by the main course:-
Chicken Masala, 2 Kulcha
& Dal Makhani and Jeera Rice
& In desert:-
2 scoops of Vanilla Ice creams

Now coming to the food, we r actually quite satisfied with the quality. The Chicken Masala was yummy!! Kulchas were really tasty, Dal Makhani was not upto the mark according to me. Jeera Rice was good, quantity was low but the quality made up for this.

Regarding the ambiance.. it was nice, somewhere a dhaba type feeling is there due to the music, staffs are really well mannered, and service they are providing is good.

So overall it was a good experience.. üòä

Manoj (staff)  the attendant who served the food explaining everything properly,  amazing food,  wonderful quantity,  very very well behaved staff,  but the only thing is that the gate keeper down stairs should help people to locate the dhaba. The onion kulcha was very delicious and even the paneer peshawari.  Well the masala papad with cheese was also special.

Finally you don't have to hit the highway for dhaba food anymore. You can get dhaba food right here in this theatre road joint. I visited the place with two of my friends and we ordered tandoori murg, chicken kolhapuri, butter naan, garlic naan, tandoori roti and masala shikanji. The food was delicious and the staff was equally courteous. The ambience was great with comfortable and spacious chairs. I'll be visiting this place again. Keep up the good work!

Located by the side of the road on the first floor of the building, Hindustan Dhaba is one the place where u eat with no regrets.
Just on entering you will be greeted by a huge truck shaped reception. The place is not that big. 
Service was a little slow, but I have no complains on the food quality.
The chicken to the kulcha everything was just fine.
This is a place to go for safe dining, as in when you don't want to experiment much and want really good food.
M rating it 3.5 because of no uniqueness.

Location: theatre road at the crossing just before shakeseare sarani police station on ur left

Decor and ambience: as the name suggests, a dhaba feeling but with a urban touch, perfect for family outings

Food and menu: Indian and Chinese are their cuisine and they peak equally at both, we tried butter naan, murgh butter masala, biryani, fried rice, garlic chicken, fresh lime, etc. I loved the mixed fried rice and garlic chicken and the nelt in the mouth butter naan, pretty sure they will score good with all the dishes beung offered

Staff and service: quick service and courteous well mannered staff

Located near to Maidan metro, in a convinient location.
Ambience - This place surely gives you a 'Dhaba' ka feel. The decor is beautiful. They were playing the matches so the guys were even more happier. üòã Seating arrangements are great. Quite spacious !

Food - Had Fresh Lime Soda (sweet), Masala Kulcha, Butter Kulcha, Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Lababdar, Mixed Fried Rice, Schezwan Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken.

*Fresh lime Soda was done good with desired amount of sweet.
*Kulchas were great.
*Mixed Fried Rice & Schezwan Rice was good, too.
*Though Biriyanis were different to taste than what we perceive, but it was good.
*Out of all, I loved Chicken Lababdar. The pieces were soft. It was a lil spicy which i just loved. üòç

Service - Very courteous staff. Well informed. Hospitality was also commendable. ‚ù§

So everyone please pay a visit here. I am sure you'll ‚ù§ it. üòç

Food quality was so so. Tangri kabab was good, pahari tikka was bad, amritsari kulcha was average, chicken lababdar was decent, kulfi was good. Pricing was pocket friendly, overall not so great..

Truly, a favourite joint for North Indian cuisine. This pocket friendly, albeit diet breaking restaurant is filled with North Indian goodies. However, of you have Chinese favouring companion, The Dhaba ensures you have it all under one roof. The food is delicious, the staff friendly and the ambience truly relaxing. 
Love the truck shaped counter, that adds an authentic Dhaba feeling to the overall experience.
The butter chicken is gorgeous and has a drooling fan in me.
The quantity of food against the prices are really justified, so if you are looking for a value meal you won't be let down.
The kulfi is a must-try during summers.

I ordered from Hindusthan dhaba today through zomato. Order was Tangri kebab and tandoori roti. The order was delivwred on time but the Chicken was RAW and Uncooked. I requested Zomato to pass this feedback to the restaurant so that they can get it corrected. I understand from Zomato that the restaurant refused to replace. Just poor service and food quality. I spent my money on bad food. My suggestion to all is Not to order from this restaurant online.

Ambience is awesome and clean.Foods taste great. 6 pieces of chicken tikki..2 kulcha ..sufficient amount of rice with dal makhni and choice of chicken. They will also give 1 achar, 1 chutni..2 cold drinks of your choice and ice cream. Service is really good like a standard 3 course meal (finger bowl is also provided)

What else do you want in Rs.550??

After seeing pretty great reviews, decided to order food from the place. Since I was alone, I ordered just one dish-Chicken Patiala and it was more than enough for me. The taste was pretty decent. There were a lot of chicken pieces, but all of them had very little chicken on them. Plus, the chicken was not cleaned properly at all- it was really dirty. ¬†Would definitely not order again from here. I hope the dining experience isn't this bad at the restaurant.

North Indian Cuisine at its very best !!! Starting with the interiors and decor , Hindusthan Dhaba scores high with a good ambience and perfect lighting ... Now the food, I would say I had one of the best Chicken Tikka Kabab till date ...It was juz Yum. What followed was Kulcha , Dal Makhani , Rice  & Chicken Bharta... Neither of the food dissapointed with Bharta being the Top Notch.The desserts were pretty good too. With good decor and great food, its a must visit.. 
(P.S:- If you are visiting it for the First time , buy a Little/ Nearbuy Coupon for Hindusthan Dhaba)

I went there along with some friends and ordered chicken malai kebab which was juicy and succulent. Then we went on to order chicken biriyani, lachcha paratha, chicken patiala and murgh tikka masala. All of the items were extremely tasty, especially the biriyani. Will visit soon.

This restaurant is newly opened and is very easy to locate. It's on Shakespeare sarani and on the first floor above Anna Ras.
The restaurant is quite big with big comfortable chairs and the place has a nice feel to it.
The staff is friendly and helpful.
We ordered the masala chaas and fresh lime soda as drinks‚Äã. The chaas was delicious and highly recommended and the fresh lime soda was good too.
For starters we had murgh Irani and murgh Pahari tikka. The murgh Pahari tikka was marinated well and succulent and we loved it. The murgh Irani was good too but not as good as the other.
For mains we had Dal makhani and chicken do pyaza with Rotis and naans. The Dal makhani though highly recommended by most people on zomata was a let down and didn't meet our expectations. The chicken do pyaza was okay too‚Äã though a tad bit sweet and nothing to write home about.
But the ambience of the place is good and the food is good too. It is a good North Indian restaurant in the area.

We bought some vouchers from Nearbuy for this joint. It was Indian lunch for 2 @INR 549. It consists of 2 welcome drinks, one starter, chawal, assorted breads, dal makhni, one main course & two scoops of ice cream in dessert. The food joint was randomly chosen but believe me its really good. I have opted for Chicken Tikka kebab in starter, Kulcha in breads & Chicken bharta in main course. 
This was the best chicken tikka kebab I have ever had. It was very tender with right proportion of spices. Chicken bharta was also good and very tasty.

Now the ambience was nice with a Truck cabin as billing counter & nice punjabi songs in background.
The staff were really nice and courteous.

Overall its a 4.5 star experience & totally recommended

Nazakat Aloo daal roti was my simple order and it was nicely made except Nazakat aloo didn't feel fresh and my pineapple raita was a a bit too sweet with syrup or maybe vanilla ice cream.. having said this.. food all over wasn't that bad. Daal tadka was nice. Service was very good maybe because I was the only other guest.. however if I compare food and service with the price then they are doing a pretty decent job.

Randomly elected this one and we were not deprived at all. Went through nearbuy at very reasonable cost, had a combination of Chinese and Indian. Ambiance was stupendious, just as a dhaba look like. Foods were served in sequence and the staffs were very modest and courteous. Foods were adequate and very delicious as well. Mostly I want to share this one,  One of our friends felt sick in the restaurant and the manager immediately took action; instructed his staffs to bring medicine & they arranged that at once and our friend got relief. 
So this story,  we gonna keep it in mind forever. I'd like to recommend everyone to get a taste of Chinese or Indian whichever you like at very nominal cost. 
Again would like to thank your entire team for their endeavors.

Recently been to this place with friends for lunch. Located in Theatre Road very near to famous Arun Tea Stall. Lovely wooden decor and an essence of typical punjabi style interior and ambience. The staff had been really polite and courteous. Entrance is a little problem otherwise everything is perfect. 
Food was delicious, prices are very reasonable.
Quantity,quality both were equally good. Only problem was that we had to impatiently wait for the food for quite some time. We ordered..
For starter- Murg Pahari Tikka was yummilicious. Juicy,filled with spices was melting in mouth.
For main course- Garlic cheeze naan, 
Chicken biryani,
Chicken Lababdar which was a shredded chicken recipe, tasty enough, filled with spices but would not recommend to try since its shredded.
 Chicken Biryani was very different and tasted very unique.Literally loved it. 
Overall it was a wonderful experience,would love to go back again and try other varieties of authentic punjabi dishes.

I am a huge fan of your Special thali. I have to say it has been the most gratifying thali experience I've had so far.
But I am pretty disappointed with the food that was delivered today. So I had ordered Yellow dal tadka and Paneer Peshawari. 
Both the dishes were very average. Yellow dal tadka still tasted the way we make it at home. But Paneer Peshawari was a greater disappointment. It didn't taste the way it should have cause probably it wasn't made the way it should have. I was expecting a white gravy rich with almond and a little sweet in taste. But instead it was a red gravy, extremely spicy with no trace of almond or saffron that is originally used. Your version tasted more like Paneer butter masala.

So, I didn't enjoy either of the items today. But having tasted your thali and been impressed by your packaging and service, I will definitely come back/order again. Here's hoping my next experience with you isn't bad.

This was a long awaited food destination as because it is a dhaba and I love dhaba food. The food didn't let me down as well. A very comfortable place to be in, gives you the 'at-home' feel. A very friendly staff to take care of you from the time you enter to the time you leave the place. A budget friendly restaurant with amazing food.

We were around Indian Museum area during late afternoon hours when suddenly my hunger genes urged for some delicious buttery punjabi food and thankfully zomato came to our rescue. The nearest punjabi restaurant was Hindusthan Dhaba in Theatre Road. My eyes popped out seeing a whooping 4.4/5 Rating. I just had to have my lunch here.

We headed to this place. The stairway was obnoxious but as soon as we entered the restaurant, the ambience surprised us. Golden accessories and neat and tidy seating arrangement was actually quite pacifying for the eyes. The chairs were a tad bit uncomfortable for my father but everything else was great.

Jotting below our experience with the food!
1) Chicken Manchow Soup @Rs.139.00 (3.75/5) : This was a zomato suggestion and my brother being an urdent lover of soup just had to order it. Now, chinese soup with a touch of punjabi is always great to the taste buds, isn't it? The quantity of the soup was great with ample amount of chicken bits. The soup came with a portion of thick fried noodles. Ah! Enjoyed it!

2) Crispy Chilli Babycorn @Rs.199.00 (3/5) : The portion was STUPENDOUS! A portion of crispy chilli babycorn can easily serve 4 people as a starter. Everything about this dish was good except for the fact that the babycorns weren't as crunchy as it was supposed to be. Maybe just a bad luck.‚òπ

3) Chicken Tangdi @Rs.299.00 (4.75/5) : 4 lagrge chicken leg pieces marinated with Reshmi tikka masala, stuffed with chicken keema and then tandoored to perfection. Wow! What an oustanding dish! The chicken was perfectly cooked and well charred on the outside. Smoky, tasty, juicy, all at the same time. One word - Tremendous!

4)Chicken Biryani @Rs.189.00 (4/5) : A really flavourful and fragrant hydrabadi-cum-punjabi biryani topped with fried crispy julienned onions. The biryani had no aloo (üò≠) but the taste made up for that missing part. The biryani had 3 solid pieces of soft and juicy chicken. A plate is more than sufficient for one.

5)Chicken Patiala @Rs.249.00 (3.85/5) : I expected a buttery, smoky and creamy concoction and what came in was slightly different and it did not disappoint me. A lavishly cooked smokier and more rustic version of chicken butter masala encased in a blanket of omlette. Yes, you heard it right! The whole thing was wrapped up by a thin but large plain omlette. I would have rated it a 4/5 but sadly the omlette needed salt, hence it had no taste whatsoever. Other than that, the chicken doused in the gravy was mouthwatering.

6)Mutton Goolbari @Rs.239.00 (3.9/5) :I was pretty suspicious about the name because all I ever knew was Mutton Golbari is a delicious bengali preparation. On further inspection, we got to know that this was the Punjabi Version and when it reached our table we knew that it wasn't even close to the Golbari Mutton we are used to having. Lusciously cooked tender goat meat immersed in a smokey tomato-ey thick gravy. The taste was different but very pleasing indeed. The dish wasn't spicy but was rather a wee bit on the sweeter side.

7) Laccha Paratha @Rs.49.00 (3.75/5) : The laccha paratha was wheat flour based and pretty light. The layers were distinguishable and went pretty good with the side dishes!

8)Tandoori Roti @Rs.19.00 (3.75/5) : Tandoori Roti was good too and the plus point was that it wasn't very dry.

9) Kesar Koolfi @Rs.49.00 (4.25/5) : We wanted Koolfi with rabdi but they were out of stock of rabdi so we just went for kesar koolfi (That too without falooda.üò≠). The koolfi was made in-house and was pretty darn good. Grainy and creamy at the same time. Loved it!

We paid a total of Rs.1858.00 including a 14.5% Vat output I.e.Rs.235.00 and 3 bottles of mineral water @Rs.25.00 each.

Experience at a glance :
‚Ä¢Food - 4/5.
‚Ä¢Ambience - 4/5.
‚Ä¢Staff Behaviour - 4.25/5.
‚Ä¢Value for money - 4.5/5

Hence, rating this amazing place with a 4.2/5!

What a place! Stupendously outstanding experience altogether. :)

A must visit!

Wonderful ambience accompanied with such beautiful interiors. Punjabi songs playing in the background pumps the mood right when you walk in. Staff and waiter are very courteous and friendly. The whole area is wonderfully designed. Compact yet feels spacious. Food is absolutely awesome. Sumptuous amounts of super tasty food items is their specialty. Very affordable rates. This is one of my favourite places to have North Indian food in town.

This restro is one of my favorite in terms of north indian food. Went there twice and ordered murg malai tikka, cheese naan, masala kulcha,biryani and mutton do pyaza with chicken banjara. First came the kebab which literally melted in my mouth the chicken was so soft and tasty. Its better than the usual reshmi tikka kebab. After the starters the main course was served quite late. But the wait was worthwhile as everything was so lip smacking good. The cheese naan was nothing but awesome. The biryani was spicy not according to my taste. The chicken and mutton both wear good. For desert we ordered kulfi and that too was delicious. Our total bill was somewhat near to 1100/- with tax. Moreover this is my fav budget friendly north indian restro. :)

As the name sound hindusthan dhaba it was not good at all. Went there with few of my friends as we entered the place it was full packed up with some few table left so we got the table. Ambience of this place is good enough. Staff were not properly audible we need to repeat our order thrice, food pickup time was good enough they took around 15 to 20 mins to bring our order. 
Laccha partha which they bought was not at all good it was fully burned, channa masala and dal makhni  was pathetic aloo do piyza was so so. 
Ordered for cucumber salad which was not there in the menu though the staff told us that they will prepare for us, they bought it after we had completed our main course. I told the staff to get a finger bowl for me he took the rice bowl and was going to serve me. 
This place would not be recommended by me at all and seriously staff here are not probably audible. Would like to rate this place negative if i would had that option.

Yes, I don't regret coming here. How could I've missed this place for so long! It was a great experience. The food- BEST! I had Indian cuisine and it was 'muaaaaaah'! They have lip smacking finger licking food here. Oh yes the service too was great. Felt ROYAL! üòé
Highly recommended. Take your family, go alone, take your girlfriend! Just visit this place for once. You'll fall in love.

Hindusthan Dhaba - A great dhaba maintaining hygiene and serving quality food.¬†
=====
Location & Intro:

Located very near to Arun Tea Stall. Same building where the next level was located. It is also located on the first floor.¬†

I had been hearing a lot of good things about this place when one day my family wanted to dine in late in the night so we went here. My father has been to their Hindustan Hotel in Burdhwan area and had positive feedbacks. The ambiance is well decorated with truck and has photos of freedom fighters on all its side. Being an Indian and Punjabi myself, i feel proud of such places. The staffs were all properly dressed in the uniform and the hygiene was quite properly maintained. They currently have two outlets (another at College Street) which is operated by the Owner's Son who is quite a courteous guy and genuinely takes care of customers who visit their outlet.¬†

The prices of the a la carte have been kept very reasonable and the quantity served in such prices is adequate.¬†
=====
What I ordered:

‚óã Murgh Irani Kebab - I have had kebabs at many places but this kebab was succulent, good on quality and quantity and piping hot. I absolutely feel in love with this one when i took the first bite. It was well presented and had quite a touch of garlic to it. #highlysuggested #musttry

‚óã Dal Makhani - Presented nicely and quantity was adequate. Absolutely loved this one as well. It was again piping hot too. We punjabi's love hot food. ¬†#musttry

‚óã Butter Chicken - It was excellent and was very good on quality as well as quantity. The chicken was succulent and it was smoky hot. We were full by the time we finished eating all of these dishes. ¬†#musttry

‚óã Tandoori Roti - The Roti's were just fine.¬†

It was in my bucket list for a very long time. Hindustan dhaba is situated on Shakespeare Sarani. The place offers the authentic punjabi atmosphere with quite classy decor. The food is great. We ordered Paneer Tikka and Chicken Pahari tikka for starters. Both were equally good and tasty. For main course we had peas pulao and chicken patiyala. Peas pulao was very light and delicious and chicken patiyala was mindblowing containing thick gravy which holds both the white and red gravy with perfection and also have a omlette with it. Loved the food, loved the ambience. Staffs are very attentive and friendly, price is reasonable and quantity is good. This place is a must try, dil will must say hadippa! :P

It is Very tough to locate the restaurant first of all we were kind of lost before entering into the dine in place the ambience was average their billing desk was a nice front portion of a truck ( to maintain the punjabi and dhaba style connection i guess.) here the food is not that much great. It is a newly opened restaurant and in my opinion their serving amount is not proportional in case of every dish, sometimes they serve more gravy less chicken and vice versa. We have ordered tomato soup chicken banjara , makki di roti , palak paneer, dal makhni and lassi is must for the punjabi joints. Last but not the least their price point is on the higher side in comparison to what they are giving. One time visit recommend

Initially had order for food to my office, and it turned out to be very good. The chicken bharta was indeed very well prepared. Decided to visit this place whenever possible, and finally could go there today for lunch. The ambience was really good, the 'dhaba' feel was there. The staffs were very courteous. The food, (tried mutton badshahi and butter tandori - the extra calories never really bother me) again was really good. They dont overdo things as far as their food is concerned. Really impressed.
Just to add, quite pocket friendly.

Special mention-live match screening
Staffs- friendly . He clicked 2,3 good photos of us.Thank to him.
Orders- we want to taste variety to dishes.. We were a group of 13 crazy and super foody public
Starters- chichen lasuni kabab one veg kebab and another kebab,i forgot the name.. Kebabs are tremendously good,juicy and delicious. Specially the dhania pudina chatni. Regular sized kebab pieces.
Main course- 5 different chicken dishes.. But butter chicken was the shows topper.
Cheese nun were awesome but the cheese stuff were not evenly distributed. The veg sahi polao was good too.
New restaurant in town. All the best to them

'Hindusthan Dhaba' is the main branch of Hindusthan Hotel,which is located at Durgapur Expressway (NH-2) near Gurap,Hooghly district.'Hindusthan Dhaba' is located at crossing of Theatre road & Hungerford Street.It is situated on the 1st floor of building.I'd been there last sunday for my birthday lunch with my lover.Ambience is good,Many seating arrangements are here.Atfirst we ordered here half plate 'Tandoori Murgh' with 'Masala Thums Up' & 'Fresh Lime Soda'.After 10 minutes they served ¬†'Tandoori Murgh' with salad & pudina chutney.They give 4 pcs chicken,taste also good. 'Masala Thums Up' & 'Fresh Lime Soda' both are tasty.Then we ordered ¬†'Laccha Paratha','Amritsari Special Kulcha','Masala Nun' with 'Chicken Patiala','Green Salad' & 'Roasted Papad' as main course. 'Chicken Patiala' was little sweet,coated with fried egg & under the egg it was 6 pcs light & sweet red gravy.'Amritsari Special Kulcha','Masala Nun' were good but Laccha Paratha was ¬†bad.Price was reasonable.

Awesome ambience, awesome food quality. Even the proportions were good. And the best part about it- the place is freakishly cheap for the services it provides. The only turn down was that the service was slightly slow but the food more than makes up for it. And the Punjabi music in background is great too. Loved the experience and would definitely recommend this place to anyone n everyone..

Dropped in at this joint for a titbit break. And the experience has been really nice. We just ordered a Chicken achari tikka and sweet lassi. The tikka was really soft and succulent and portions were generous. But the lassi takes the cake. I am going back soon just for this drink. Filling , thick , and refreshing. With the heat setting in fast this is highly recommended. The staff is extremely courteous and the food tastes very fresh. Only suggestion is to perhaps install a signage since the entrance is a bit confusing‚Äã.For everything else it's a üëç.

Visited this place with family. Was recommended by my colleague. Had fish ajwain tikka..tandoori roti..veg amritsari..veg pulao..murgh lababdar..rasgulla..malai kulfi..butterscotch icecream. The spice quotient was on the lower side, good for those who avoid oily and spicy food. Staffs were very cooperative. The location of the outlet is the usp of the place. Out of all, murg lababdar and kulfi were mindblowing. As the staff mentioned, the kulfi is prepared in their kitchen only and it's one of their specialities. Recommend this place to all food lovers! Il definitely visit again.

Have been there twice. Once late in the afternoon dying to have something delicious. Couldn't be at a better place that this. Located exact at the theatre road hungerford street crossing, this place serves one of the best Punjabi cuisines in town. 

Amritsari Kulcha is the go to dish for anyone who loves kulchas. The place is quite large and comfortable. The varities of food items are also very nice. I haven't tried the non veg dishes until now. But going by the experience of the earlier two meals. I cannot wait to grab a hand on that too. 

Do visit for lovely north indian food.

An unorthodox place, with a dhaba feeling. The music is typical Punjabi folk and rocks, adding to the environment. Recommended for family and friends hang out. Not very costly. Value for money is satisfactory. 

The food could be a bit more spicy, to match up with their theme. The service could be faster (maybe because I went on a Sunday). They are yet to mature as a professional restaurant.

The place is located at a 5 minute walking distance from kala mandir. Theatre road has one way traffic travelling in different directions during different times of the day, so pay attention to that factor. The decor is quite royal and the staff attentive enough. We were a big group and they provided extra chairs and made arrangements for us. Coming to the food,

1. Murg Malai Tikka- 8 succulent pieces of boneless chicken in thick, decadent malai. Seared and cooked to perfection, the dish was the highlight of the lunch for me. The waiter warned us that the kebab might be a little sweet. However I found this dish perfect.

2. Chicken Tandoori Tikka- Spicier than the malai version, even this dish had the perfect balance of flavours.

3. Veg Seekh Kebab- Ordered for our vegetarian friend, this tasted better than my expectation. Prominent taste of peas overpower you. However the shape of the kebab is kind of unfortunate(refer to picture)

4. Vegetable Pulao- The portion size is enough for one person with a healthy appetite. Light and fragrant, this was a good choice

5. Cheese naan- Each naan was divided into three parts and served instead of the usual two halves. This division and unskilled hands I suspect lead to unequal division of cheese in the naan pieces. A few dry plain pieces spoiled my mood.

6. Veg amritsari- Basically they put every vegetable known to mankind into this dish. Paneer clubbed with peas clubbed with mushroom clubbed with, you name it and they had it. Surprisingly, this still tasted quite good.

We got a little adventurous while ordering the sides and basically ordered everything that sounded fancy. Lazeezdar, lababdar,ajooba chicken- all of them met our expectations. Proving that old is gold and some dishes don't need fancy names to stand out was the butter chicken. The chicken methi malai was another good choice, provided you have a sweet tooth like I do.

I cannot remember the bill amount as the birthday guy and girl took care of it. Definitely coming back for more.

Visited the place yesterday for celebrating a friend's bday. The decor was really good, an essence of royal Punjabi culture.. the music was also some typical Punjabi songs  affirming the atmosphere. We had chicken and mutton biryani.. the quantity was way to great. And unlike other outlet the biryani tasted very different which i like of course. Most importantlythe biryani needed no side dish because it was so juicy and spicy itself and full of meats. Mutton biryani had 3 pieces of meat which surprised us. Chicken and mutton curry were really good as well. I wanted to rate it 4.5 but the mutton could be more soft, neverthless i enjoyed being there. They chargedonly VAT nt service tax. Overall my experiece was so good.

This place is amazing and beyond description. Right from the decor and ambience to the courteousness of the staff and the food quality, everything about this place will have you spellbound. Located in Theatre Road near the Belle Vue Clinic, we (a group of 9) decided to give this place a visit after having kept it on hold for a long time. We had Crispy Babycorn and Chicken Crispy for starters, followed by Tandoori Roti, Kulcha (both Plain and Masala), Plain Naan for main course and Chicken Bharta, Chicken Kolapuri and Chicken Patiala as side dish. If you think the Chicken Kolapuri was great, the Chicken Patiala would have you entranced having three different layers of pure delight! The place is quite friendly for the pockets as well.

This place is 5 minutes from kala mandir, on the left hand side of the ongoing traffic. Most people would not be able to tell you where it is so you need to trust Google maps.
The interiors are well decorated and Punjab themed. Although some tables are really wobbly. The staff is pribably the biggest plus point of the restaurant-I have seldom seen waiters and workers smile this much and this genuinely. Very polite people.
Coming to the most important part the food. Its nothing special. The menu has the same old dishes and the food is pretty average. Basically like bollywood. But considering the price point I'm not too disappointed.
Visit this place if you just want to dine out for a change, but not somewhere too fancy.
P.S. -When in doubt try butter chicken.

A restaurant in Park Street area: pretty good for such a posh area. My review is based on the following:-
 1]AMBIENCE: Just as expected considering the 
                           place. Very close to St.Xavier's College.
                           It's not open on the road type but an                         
                           entrance leading into the building and     
                           into the restaurant. The interior is 
                           beautiful and typically North Indian.
 2]FOOD: Its the main focus here and is completely 
                  and totally delicious. I had tried the veg. 
                  thali , butter nan with mutton Rogan Josh.
                  I found the main attraction as the thali -
                  all a good variety but nothing any less tasty.
                  Not much to say about the nan or the
                  mutton as both are common in all respect
                  in almost every decent restaurant.
 3]SERVICE: This is particularly what I feel is nice. 
                       Quick and proper service was provided.
                       I am not sure how it is on Sunday cuz I
                       went there on a Tuesday. Plz comment 
                       on that point if u visit on a Sunday.
4]PRICE: It is all decently‚Äã priced. Not over or under 
                 but exactly the right price.

The restaurant is located right Camac street khosla electronics on the 1st floor. 
The decor has a touch of royalty with wooden interiors. Waiters dressed in Pathani kurtas and very well mannered. Service is prompt. 
Food is great as per the reviews here. We took Chinese bhel and veg seekh kebab for starters. Both were good. 
For main course we chose paneer jhal farezi n another veg dish.  Both tasted almost same which was disappointing. 
The breads were all good. 
All in all was a pleasant experience.
Will visit back.

Conveniently located, this is a Dhaba that provides excellent food at really affordable prices.
The interiors are simple, clean and cosy.
The service very good with waiters at your table every time you need them.
Coming to the food.... It was great.
The murgh e kalimirch was a perfect starter.
The butter chicken done just the way it should be done. The nuns and rotis were soft and not charred for a change. The do piyaza was good but the chicken felt a bit undercooked.
The cherry on the cake was the Rabri and kulfi... Absolute delight.
The place remains open till midnight....And I was informed about their second eatery  coming up at mg road.
Multiple visits assured!

I had ordered a thali few days ago and my experience was great but when I ordered it again today the quality was not even average....it was aweful.
The mix veg had no salt.dal makhni was tasteless the pulao had granules of sugar n salt which were not even mixed properly.nan was chewy.Even the raita was not like last time.The entire money was wasted as coluld not eat the tasteless food.
More over had ordered methi chicken along wit it whose container was not closed properly n the entire gravy had fallen on the thali .
I had to return the chicken to zomato.
I wanted to give them bulk order after the first experience but not now as they are not keeping up the same standard.

Located at the junction of Hungerford street and Shakespeare Sarani, this restaurant has a typical Dhaba-type interior decoration. The attendant warmly welcomed us and offered the seat.
The menu came and we had a lot of dishes to choose from. In Starters, we has ordered Prawn Chilli and Murg Irani which took nearly 15-20 minutes to arrive. The Prawn Chilli was exceptional and succulent while the Murg Irani had a dominant spice - Kalimirch in it. I loved the Prawn Chilli more than the Irani. Meanwhile we placed our main course which was Laccha Paratha and Chicken Patiala. This was served very quickly. The Chicken Patiala had a layer of omelette on top and the tender, juicy chicken was an absolute blinder. However, the Laccha Paratha looked somewhat like tandoori nun. Nevertheless, the food was awesome and the price was equally matched. This entire menu was of Rs 1100.

On zomato it shows cost for two is Rs. 500 however I feel Rs. 700 - 800 would be the correct estimate for two people. I would request the management to update this on their zomato website.

Looking forward to an another visit on Bengali New Year. Cheers!

After hearing a lot about it from one of my friend I finally went to this place. The restaurant is quite difficult to access as it is in deep corner of a building but the ambience is awesome. Comfortable, stylish, calm and feeling of an urban dhaaba. BUT BUT BUT the main part of a restaurant is food. As per the price tag the quality of food is not up to the mark and also the quantity is so little that you need two plates of every dish to full yourself. I am talking about an average boy weight 65 kg. Of course for girls the quantity is okay. I can have better food in comparatively low price.

It has been a wonderful evening at Hindusthan Dhaba, But it has been started with such nightmare. We had reached Dhaba around 7.30 P.M. and they came to take our order at 8.15 P.M. Till then we were drinking water and water. Due to their short staff they were taking orders very late.
We had ordered Murgh Achari Kabab and crispy chilli babycorn as our starters and it was awesome. and all late order taken and shortstaff problem has been nullified by those starters.

In main course we had ordered Masala kulcha, Paneer jharfareji, murgh keema Masala, Chicken Patiala and Panner sechzwan Rice.
Every Dish was awesome and perfect . no body can complain about their food quality. The pieces of chicken was soft , juicy and succulent.¬†
I have to say that i had never tasted such a perfect panner dish anywhere.
last but not the least as dessert we had ordered ¬†kulfi with Rabdi and it was perfect finish for a perfect dinner.¬†
You must reach there once and must taste the dhaba flavour.

A place which can be recommended only to the Enemy ...Along with my 5 friends I visited the place last night...first of all we had to wait for half n hr for water, den after atleast 5 calls one waiter came to say that your order will be taken after another half n hr...after struggling for atleast 1 hr we ordered starters like Paneer Tikka and Baby Corn which was BABA CORN...In the main course we ordered Paneer Lababdar and Punjabi Dal Tadka which were horrible ! No salt...in Breads, Amritsari kulche SPECIALLY...after having a bite I could just say this  'MAIDA KA LOTHA' !! lastly no finger bowls despite asking for finger bowl...Waiter came with only two bowls for six people...God knows what was in his mind...worst experience ever!!!

One of the worst dinner places to go to will surely be this. My 1st Sunday after nearly 2 yrs in Kolkata was utterly sabotaged by this fantastic place(pun intended). From the shabby starters to the overcooked breads to finally the undercooked curries, this place is a receipe for taking a revenge on someone. Do use it wisely! üòâ

I am writing this review out of utter disappointment. On 26/02/2017 I visited Hindusthan Dhaba along with my friends. This place had made a good buzz in the city and had rave reviews on Zomato. Thus my expectations out of this place were upbeat & I'd presumed to be served well. Unfortunately the place failed to deliver on all fronts. The flavour was absent from the food and it was unappetizing on a whole. The service was super slow and the staff seemed lost. For starters we had babycorn and paneer tikka kebabs, for the main course we ordered both veg and nonveg dishes along with variety of breads. Tbh everything brought to our table was rubbish & barely edible to say the least. I'm neither revisiting nor recommending this place to anyone!!

We ordered many items but none had salt even leave alone the taste . Worst food iv ever had . Dont believe the good reviews , it will b a huge mistake. Specially don't b der on a sunday , ull regret it the most , coz they can't handle if der are more then a few customers. Aditya Sharma Vivek Jaiswal Abhishek Agarwal

We booked for a table of five over phone, we were pleased to note they had seat reserved for us. The ambience is very soothing. The decor was good too. Finding the outlet was easy too, as we just followed straight into the Theater Road.
We were hungry so we went straight to main course. We ordered Tandoori Roti and 3 Side-dishes Murg Methi Malai, Murg Kadhai and Murg Da Bharta. We were absolutely glutton, finishing off 23 Rotis. I have to admit that the Roti's were not up to the mark, atleast not of a Dhaba, could have been better. The chicken preparations were finger licking. The waiters are very friendly and the service was moderately fast.
We had eaten to our fill so choose to drop down on the desserts. The menu was not inclusive of tax, still 1250 bucks for a pack of five is a fair enough deal.

yes,finally visited hindusthan dhaba!
after reading the reviewss in zomato andthe rating of 4.5-5  given by almost everyone, was eagerly  waiting to give it a visit.
and yes I totally agree  with others in the list,this definitely  is one of the best destination for punjabi/ north  indian food lovers! 
the interior looked classy yet cute! those  big wooden chairs with coushons,jhharbatis,and that mini truck inside in were too cool!
now coming  to the food,we ordered butter tandoori roti,patiala chicken,paneer lababdar! they tasted  heavenly! 
and most importantly the staffs there were very warm and courteous!  loved everything about it, though  the entry gate was bit confusing and hard to find.

Easy to locate this place as it is on the same footpath of Chappan Bhog. More than the food I was really impressed with their owner, Mr Singh who was really helpful. Chicken tikka kebab and Hara bhara kebab were delicious and so was crispy chilli babycorn. Mix veg was prepared were well. Chicken masala was ok,  could have been better. Both kali dal and dal fry were also good. I feel their service was a tad bit slow but then it was ok as their food was really good. It was a treat from my wife and my side, to our family members and they really loved the food. A great place to visit!!!

I simply lovved the dhaba!! I had a great time here. The food was delicious, the ambience and interior was fab and the service was speedy and satisfying! I hopped for the thali since I hadnt tasted one for a long time but my friends ordered butter chicken, garlic chicken and chicken reshmi kebab and we absolutely loved it. After a very long time I had no 'recommndation' to make. However i do feel that the place is a bit small but the food and ambience makes up for it. Over all i had a great "dhaba" experience. A must visit restaurant if youre near and even when you are not!

Hospitality is good and the staff is courteous. However, their speciality Dal Makhani was lacking the Punjabi Makhani - Melting in Mouth falvour and seem to be a regular Kaali Dal. However, chicken pieces were tender and tastes good. Disappointed with the serving of rasagullas as it was fridge-cold.

Ordered online for the first time from here, only by seeing the rating higher than that of other popular dhabas. The food was bad. 

Chicken bharta, the chicken was flavor less and seemed to be undercooked. 

Chicken tikka masala, was slightly better but certainly not as the other older (and cheaper) dhabas. 

Dal makhani was fine. 

Ratings decieved me or probably my expectations went higher seeing the ratings. Lesson learnt. Hope the food improves with time.

I don't know from where to start but in brief I must say it was truly a great experience. I had two nearbuy coupons for North Indian combo and went this place today with my friends for having lunch. Firsty, I have a suggestion for the restaurant authority as the location is a bit tricky as well as the entrance of the restaurant is also confusing, they must put up a sign board at the entrance of the building which would be easier to find the restaurant main entrance in first floor for the new comers. Now coming to the food journey, I must say it was a perfect tummy filled lunch. Our today's menu included,
STARTER: Chicken tikia kebab
MAIN COURSE: Chicken masala with Jeera rice & Kulcha with Dal Tadka
DESSERT: Ice cream and Gulab jamun
COLD DRINKS: Pepsi
All the item tasted pretty good. The starter was the most yummy dish of the day with perfect smokey flavor. The kulcha was perfectly crunchy and it was very much well going with the tadka dal. Jeera rice was also good with perfect balance of flavors. The gravy of the chicken masala was superb and last of all both the desserts tasted divine.
The ambiance was beautiful. The decor had a traditional touch and the whole dining place was beautifully arranged. The service was prompt. The behavior of the staffs was worth mentionable. Overall we all were very much satisfied with this place. Definitely coming back to taste more.

This place has a surprise to the people who might have been here. The ambience was amazing. U cant judge anyone from ouside, this place is exactly same. After going there, I realised its must visit place and most beautiful than shown in Zomato.
We ordered chicken tikka in starter; chicken labadar, chicken butter masala, butter naan, amritsari kulcha, meethi lassi and gulab jamun. Food was amazing, would rate 4.5. In terms of ambience i would give 5 out of 5. The dress code of waiter was unique as in totally punjabi style. All the staff members were very polite and warm-welcoming. After u  checkout, they also ask u abt the food and ur suggestions too. 
Its a must visit place.

If there any option to give 10 star, I'll definitely give them that.. :)
I went yesterday night with my friends.. it's fantastic restaurant..
If you want a Punjabi dhaba ambience, this restaurant definitely fulfill your that demand.. :)
Food is outstanding..
And the main part is flavour and taste.. They are maintain complete authenticity of Indian foods..
We were ordered in, Starter- Murg Malai Tikka..
Texture of chicken was really creamy and perfectly tender..
Main Course- Chicken Biryani, Masala Kulcha, Butter Chicken Full and Veg Raita..
Chicken Biryani was completely different in taste. Exactly like Punjabi style.. It was served with three pieces of chicken and Raita.. No potato pieces in it like Kolkata Biryani..
Taste was soulfully fantastic.. :)
Masala Kulcha was really flavourful.. It was stuffed with masala potato mixed.. If you are a fan of roti or kulcha then it is a must try.. :)
Butter Chicken was heavenly lip smacking.. I would never had this type of awesome butter chicken ever..
It's basically tandoori chicken cooked with spices and butter.. The proportionate of spices, butter and cream was exactly what you want to have in butter chicken.. :)
Though Biryani served with a small bowl of veg raita but I still ordered a veg raita with it..
Dessert- Gulab Jamun
It was served with 2 pieces of gulab jamun in one plate.. It was completely homemade.. Very soft and mouth watering sweet..
Only one thing, when you give your order the food serve little bit later.. You have to wait some more time to fill up your tummy.. ;)
This is the only cons I find..
And the staffs are very good.. Their behaviour is so much friendly.. :)
Now the rating part,
Food- 10/10
Ambience- 10/10
Staff- 10/10

An amazing start up by a budding student entrepreneur, Hindusthan Dhaba at Shakespeare Sarani is on it's way to attaining and establishing some serious long term glory. The high rating on Zomato is justified by it's immaculate decor, great service and authentic Punjabi food. Not the typical Dhaba ambience, yet the large spacious layout with elaborate furnishings and perfect lighting makes this place comfortable and stylish it's own unique way. Went for the Irani Kebab.It was a bit too salty but tasted good. The Butter Chicken was absolutely authentic and perfect. Great quality and quantity. The cheese naan was filling and delightful too. Friendly staff and good service made the experience really worth it. Definitely recommended for people looking for an affordable punjabi meal!

Well I visited this place on 26th Jan with my sister and Dad. Let me put my review bit point wise
1. Spacious place with nice wooden decor and very good ambiance.¬†
2. Staffs are very well behaved and service is just awesome.
3. I have ordered - Chicken Achari Tikka, Tanduri Promphet, Cheese Garlic Nan, Plain Kulcha, Tandori Roti, Chicken Kolapuri and Mithi Lassi..¬†
Cheese Garlic Nan, Achari Tikka and Chicken Kolapuri are just too good in taste and quantity is also sufficient. Where as Tandori roti and Promphet can be better. But my overall experience are just mind blowing and will definitely want to revisit the place with family and friends.

Keep serving us better :)

The restaurant was well decorative and staffs were extremely well manerd especially their manager visit us and welcome us very well as we were the first time visitors to their restaurant, so ambience was perfect. Now coming to food we had chicken tikka kabab as starters, masala kulcha, dal makhani, chicken tikka masla, jeera rice, soft drink and gulab jamun. Every dish we tried that day was too delicious and even gulab jamun was also very good and home made hot gulab jamun was served.. So overall had a nice experience please go visit and try out

Me and my friend visited this place after our college fest for having dinner. We were accompanied to the dhaba by one of the waiters. Entering the place, we were just mesmerised by the interiors. They have a seating for 2, a seating for 4, a seating for 8, you tell the amount of seats u want and they will provide it to you. The counter has been converted into the front part of the truck. We ordered masala kulcha, aloo do pyaza, and kadai panner. The masala kulcha was brilliantly stuffed and gave quiet a competition to balwant and jai hind. Coming to the sabzis, they were average, tasted just ok for filling our stomachs. The waiters were also good on servicing. And already I have mentioned that the ambience was brilliant. Overall it was a nice experience, a typical family kind of dhaba which one should visit if they are near theatre road.

Try out Sarso Ka saag and Makai Ki roti.. 

I had veg food so cannot comment about non veg food.

Entry to this place is no so good, but the ambiance inside is good.

They take booking so if you have a large group, book your table.

One of the best dhaba food i have had in calcutta. The place is located near shakespeare sarani police station. The sitting arrangement is comfortable and spacious. However, it is difficult to locate as the front gate remains closed most of the time and you have to take the side building entrance round the corner.  It is ideal for punjabi and northern indian cuisine. They offer a variety of indian breads from tandoori roti to makai di roti to misi roti to different types of kulcha and naan. We tried out 2 varieties of naan and butter tandoori roti. The cheese garlic naan isto die for. It is the best variety of indian bread i have had so far. Butter nan and butter tandoori roti were also good. Coming to the main dish. We decided to try out chicken kolhapuri and we were pleasantly surprised in a good way. The rustic flavours of the gravy was excellent. It had a sweet and spicy taste..a spicy dish were you encounter pockets of sweet aftertaste. The chicken were rightly cooked and were big in pieces. One plate contains 8such pieces which is enough for 3 indian breads. The staff of this place is quite congenial and behave very politely. All in all a must visit dhaba if you are looking for a dhaba taste and ambience.

If your looking for great quality food at a very reasonable and affordable price you've come to the right place. The interior gives a nice dhaba wala feeling and the Manager's truck is pretty cool. Even a group of 8 can easily dine together. Their playlist is also amazing. And they play a lot of good punjabi songs. Service is fast and the waiter also recommends you what goes well with what. I ordered a chicken biryani as I was sightseeing the whole day day and was really starving so I skipped to the main course. I ordered a coke too but the waiter recommend a lassi. Trust me guys you definitely wanna try that lassi. It was amazing. The chicken biryani was an Audhi style north indian biryani. It was topped with cheese. As son as you eat it you'll experience so many different flavors. The biryani is a must have if you're a biryani love like me. Mr. Debashish (waiter) speaks very good English so if you're not from around here no need to worry about any communication issues. The Manager ( Mr. Sankar) is a really nice guy and feel free to talk to him if you have any issues.The food is great, the decor is slick, the service is nice. In a nutshell, the place is awesome. And If you're in theater road do check this place out you'll love it. Thank you guys for the wonderful, flavourful experience. :)

This place has quality food at dhaba prices. The place is spacious with ample seating capacity. Interiors are sober and nothing is forcefully decorated. Service was quick and humble. For the starters we tried veg kebab platter, having assortment of paneer, babycorn, mushroom, alu and dahi kebabs. Manchow soup and sweet corn soup,  both were good. For main course we tried chana masala, dal makhani and malai kofta. Malai kofta was amazing but dal makhani was a bit disappointing. It lacked taste though the color and texture was good. Cheese garlic kulcha , lachcha paratha, garlic naan and butter naan, all were good. Had an amazing dhaba-style dinner at very pocket friendly prices.

On New year's eve, when we were struggling to find a decent place for dinner, this place came to our rescue, thanks to zomato. Conveniently situated on Shakespeare sarani, it was hardly crowded on the last day of the year. 

Coming to the food...
We ordered crispy baby corn, chicken tangri kebab, chicken lababdar, chicken patiala, and plain nun. 
Each and every dish they served were very well cooked and simply awesome. Staffs were very friendly. Decor was nice. 

This is a newly opened restaurant, i guess. Not many people are aware of it. 
A definite must-visit place... :)

The entrance was not so good and it rather looks like an office entrance. The resturant is in the first floor. But, as soon as you enter inside, it is a different world altogether. The ambiance is very good and so are the staff and the overall decoration is also very nice. Now coming to the food....top class. The price is cheap and the quantity is quite good. Looking at the place from outside, you will not have the slightest idea of what a fantastic place it is. Full marks from me and surely will come back again and again.

Hindustan Dhaba is located in Theatre Road, and can be easily located. The Dhaba is in the first floor. The place is big and has been decorated well. I had ordered a Kebab Platter and a Lassi. All the kebabs were perfectly cooked. The service was fast as well. Will be going back definitely.

Okay. First of all, it is the best Dhaba in Kolkata. Located near the heart of the city at Shakespeare Sarani. The amazing ambience adds another flavour to the foods served. The staffs are very professional, very honest & very polite. The foods served were very good in taste & prices as well. It is a very pocket friendly restaurant. We ordered Chicken Achari Tikka Kabab, Lachcha Paratha, Tandoori Butter Roti, Chicken Kolhapuri & Butter Chicken. All of them were very good at taste. Would like to refer my friends & colleagues & would like to go again & again.. And I have one suggestion for the management authority of this restaurant. If Biriyani is added to the menu, it will be a perfect place!

After checking zomato,we visited this place yesterday.we ordered chicken ajuba,chicken patiala,chicken methi malai,pomfret tandoori,masala kulcha,stuffed nan & jeera rice as main course.they served quick ¬†and service was very good.but we felt there was not any difference between ¬†patiala and ajuba tastewise. patiala and azuba both were 4pc dishes but at first they told us about 6pc, that was little bit confusing from their side. Then we ordered lassi and chaas....good ambience with cheap food..sorry for not uploading any photo(too much hungry).

It is always pleasure to have punjabi dishes when you are craving for some Indian food. Newly open Hindusthan Dhaba is one of great restaurant to have finger licking North Indian dishes. Last night I went there with my friend for having dinner.
First we ordered Fresh lime sweet and salty and it was very refreshing with surprising pocket friendly budget.
Next we ordered Chicken malai tikka kabab for starter.Must try it.chicken was very gooey and moist.And addition of Malai makes this kabab heavenly tasted.
Next we took Butter nun nd Patiala chicken.But this chicken dish depressed us.Though name of this item sounding interesting bt it tasts very average.It was actually omlet wrap chicken.but chicken was hard and combination of omlet wrap makes this dish tastes odd.otherwise Food was very high genic.And best part of this resturent they maintain their food quality very well.They never compromise with quality.And this feature makes food more tasty and fresh,and healthy.

Ambience of this dhaba style resturant is very sober.All the staffs are good.Though it is very pocket friendly but they never compromise with their food quality.so mustly recommended.

Visited this restaurant on my friend's birthday. The food is cheap and nice. Though this is a common feature among the Dhabas, but the decoration doesn't actually make it one. Located near ATS, it is one of the best food I have had at this pricing. Ordered the Hindustan Special Thali. It was great and cheap. Not only this, it was enough for meal for 2. At the price of Rs.180, it was the best deal one can get.¬†

This has all of a sudden become the most frequently visited food joint by me. Great quality and relevant prices. I have always been a fan of food joints being run by Sikhs but this outlet is great. Ordering breakfast, is almost 3 days a week. Omelet served is excellent. Other vegetarian dishes are rich and taste great. Ordered thali last night which was amazing. Should stick to existing prices and it would become really popular.

I had checked into Hindusthan Dhaba with not much expectation but the boy, was I surprised! 
Hindusthan Dhaba, a place tucked in one of those posh lanes in Calcutta- Theatre Road. A couple of minutes walk from A C Market and a few minutes from Mumble's Lab, Hindusthan Dhaba is a place that would surprise your tongue and leave it tingling for more. 
The service is impeccable. Not only are your needs taken care of by the waiters but the manager checks on you and makes sure you're having an enjoyable meal. 
Everybody here is so friendly. This includes the accountant too. The ambiance is warm. And the food even warmer and nicer! 
My friends and I ordered a couple of breads- I ordered Tandoori Roti and they ordered Butter Naan. Can not complain. Both were executed and made with diligence. 
With these, we ordered Chicken Laazvab. The name of the dish certainly did stick by its name. The item came with an omlette and six chicken pieces. Accompanying them were both red and white curry. One word- delicious!

Today I gave my birthday treat at this amazing place located on Shakespeare Sarani Road. Its decent ambience with wooden interior, punjabi music in the background, and comfortable sitting arrangements lightens the mood and the body. The service is really nice, and the people are really humble and friendly and keep advising you and take proper care. Coming to food, we ordered Chilly Chicken and Tangri Kebab for starters. Chilly chicken was DELICIOUS!! Tangri Kebab was also tasty and had a nice stuffing in it. (Tangri Kebab takes some time to prepare fresh, so be patient) .For main course we ordered Bytter Chicken, butter tandoori roti , and Panner butter masala. The curry of both the items was so tasty I could have them even if my friends wouldn't spare a piece for me. Chicken was tender. For drinks we ordered lassi, because its a punjabi restaurant, and mind you , IT WAS GREAAAAT !!.
Concluding don't let the word "Dhaba" make you think this isn't a nice restraunt. With its decent prices , helpful staff and, tasty food it is a worthy choice. Hands Down. Thanks guys for making my treat so good, hope to visit again. (I know I don't click nice pics)

Dined here after looking up restaurants through zomato. The entrance to the Dhaba is not great per se. but once you go inside, you will soon notice that the ambience is great. The wood work on the walls and the truck replica as Manager cabin clearly works well with the Dhaba style which the owners have tried to achive. The seating is comfortable for groups as well. As you are seated, you will be greated by very polite, well mannered and friendly staffs who guides you properly through the menu. The dishes, presentation, ambience, background music etc are great.

Suggested foods: Tangri Kebab, Crispy chicken, Tandoori Butter Roti, Chicken Butter Masala, and Lassi.

Ambience: Punjabi Dhaba

Pricing: Moderate

Service: Fantastic

Accessibility: Easy, on the road

Food Style: Dhaba Style, Continental, Chinese

Located right in the heart of the city, easily approachable but the ascent to the restaurant through the corridors of the building is non appealing. Nevertheless, once you enter you realise you have entered a place without walls and all that you see around is wood and wood and wood. 

Seating is not really comfortable, there isn't much room under the table but the table are good enough to accommodate the number of seats desired. 

Owned by a father and son duo who also own another one in the highway have just brought down the same menu and the prices into this place which makes the food bill look rather cheap against its direct competitors like Azaad hind and Jai hind. With the feel of a proper restaurant it's yet another notch better than the rest. But for its few shortcomings and in my opinion, competition steals the show for car service. In a restaurant structure, you expect alcohol too with superb Punjabi North Indian style meal. 

Come to the point and the quantity of the starters is huge. The portions of the main course is nice and the taste is wow. I simply loved the food here and the brilliantly low BILL!!! Engage the owners in talking if the restaurant is empty, I met the older gentleman and he was great to talk to. Pleasant Man!!!

It came as a surprise from my foodie friend, √Äb ƒÑnkur BƒÅgchi . At first I was doubting as to how the food will be, but the moment I entered the ambience blew off my mind! Such comfy couches and cushions!
And then the food...
The tandoori chicken was absolutely fabulous!
And I ate almost 80% of it!!
And then jeera rice and chicken patiala!
Aha! These were heavenly and we could not finish off with them since the quantity was huge considering our stomach.
Hats off to you guys!
Please quickly start your dessert section.
I am eagerly looking forward to it!‚ù§

Fully Punjabi style restaurant serving great food. Hindustan Dhaba welcomes its guest whole heartedly, at the very entrance of the restaurant you will receive a warm welcome. A stair leads to the first floor where the restaurant is situated.
Royal style sofas and wooden interior looked good.
Coming to the food. This place serves fantastic food without any doubt.
Took the Fresh lime Sweet and Salty and it was fantastic. Sweet and Salt perfectly blended to complement each other.
Then I took the Chicken Malai Tikka Kabab. This is a must try here. Chicken was soft, juicy and succulent. With Good amount of Malai topping above this Kabab tasted brilliant.
Then at the main we ordered Butter Naan and Chicken Patiala. I was upset with the Chicken dish. Chicken Patiala wasn't good enough. Hard Chicken. Smell of egg with which it was wrapped didn't work out well. Though the owner assured me that they are working on it. Still I won't recommend this until I try this again.
This place is one of the perfect spot for North Indian dishes. Service was excellent. The waiter took care of us very well. And the price is very reasonable.

I had heard about this restaurant from my friends, visited it on Sunday morning, tried their Amritsar kulcha and channa and their tandoori aloo and Gobi paranthas, the food was outstanding, served piping hot the service was good and the waiters were courteous. Over all the ambience is good , with a warmth, and it is easy in the pocket. I have been here on a few occasions earlier there kulcha and channa are excellent.
Last night tried their chicken Bharta it was a disappointment . As it had minced chicken or keema, the chicken Banjara was excellent, nice succulent pieces of tender kebab.

Went to Hindusthan Dhaba on a Sunday afternoon. Though this place is not too old but it has surely gained some popularity. The restaurant was about 40% full.¬†

The interior is nice. Decor is tasteful and not overdone. Seating arrangements are comfortable.

We ordered:

Fresh Lime Soda Sweet & Mixed: Both were served in room temperature as we desired. The Sweet one was okay but somehow the Sweet and Salt was not up to the mark.¬†

Tangri Kebab: A good dish to order. It was stuffed with minced chicken and tasted great. We quite liked it.

Prawn Golden Fry: Little crispy outside (have it as soon as it is served) and juicy inside, the prawn dish was pretty well prepared and served with a red chilli sauce. Liked this too.

¬†We decided then to taste some Chinese food and ordered:

Chicken Fried Rice: Average. Could have been better.

Fish Chilli : Again, average. Much scope of improvement.

Service: The staff were courteous.¬†

Serving Time : Long. 15 minutes minimum for 1 dish.

Price : Absolutely reasonable.

Menu : Should have been more elaborate. There are not ¬†many choices. ¬†No Dessert and ¬†Beverage options too.

Its situated right in Shakespeare sarani.. The interior decor is good.. Nice and tidy... The staffs are very good.. Very polite... Funky punjabi songs are on the background... We ordered chicken tangri kebab.. It was awesome... The stuffing inside amazed me.. one negative point... Some blood was present of the chicken inside.. On the main course we ordered butter tandoori roti and chicken laazvab... The rotis were hard... Ordered butter nun which was good... The chicken was also okay okay type.. Not something extraordinary... Ordered mozito and lime soda.. But same like its predecessor it lacked the spark.. I think they should up their standard.. Also we talked about the 4pm to 7pm offer of 20% discount but didnt get it.. Sort of deception from either zomato or the restaurant... Overall not so good experience.. Will not visit again

The restaurant is located at Shakespeare Sarani. The interiors are bound to give you some positive vibes. Upbeat Punjabi songs were being played in the background. ‚ù§ One of the staffs courteously guided us to a suitable table as there were seven of us. The service was quick. We chose to order Chicken Malai Kebab, Blue Lagoon, Lime Soda, Veg Pulao, Haka Noodles and Chicken Manchurian. The delicacies were absolutely lip smacking. I am quite impressed with the both quality and quantity of their food. Two glasses of Cola were provided as complementary drinks. Well, yay to that. :D Keep up the good work guys!

We visited here for the second time and trust me thia place is heaven for chicken lovers even veg lovers. U get a punjab's special feeling through the taste of the food. This time we ordered Chicken Crispy as a started which was kinda baby corn but chicken and tastes amazing. Chicken Lababdar was kinda buttery gravy , less spicy but the yummiest. Then comes the Chicken Kolhapuri.... This was the king of the noon. chicken lovers ans spice lovers you should order this .. This is spicy and most tasty dish.. !
The veg dishes includes , Kulcha , Paneer Masala also gave a zing to our taste buds. 
The staff here is very good & very polite . Ambiance is the best ..made me feel like I m nt in kolkata..smwhere in Punjab. !!
Thankyou Hindusthan Dhaba for such an awesome outlet opening in kolkata.

We went to Hindusthan Dhaba for dinner last week. We had Chicken Tikka Kebab in starter and in our main course we had Naan with Dal Makhni and Rice with chicken masala. All the items was really good and tasty. Coming to food quality and quantity both are good and sufficient. I will mark this price range as average. Now Interior decoration is really good. Service took some time¬† but still its OK. Its a feels like "Royal" Dhaba. Just one negative point is there that they don't have any parking facilities. Overall I liked it and I would like to visit here again.

Hindusthan Dhaba is a mixed bag. Certain dishes are good, others, most definitely not. And it was evident right from the platter that we ordered for starters. The paneer, mushroom and babycorn were fine, and the aloo was amazing. Remaining items on the platter was just OK. 
For main course we ordered paneer butter masala, mix veg and black Dal. The paneer and Dal were decent, but Jhal Farezi was outright bad, and best be left skipped. The service is good, and the pricing is reasonable. Overall, give this place a try.

Brilliant! Brilliant! What an incredible experience visiting this place was. From the food to the decorations to the overall ambience, this place impressed me at all fronts. Kudos!

Tried the Non-Veg Khazana and Chicken oil fry for starters. The Non-Veg Khazana is a platter comprised of different Kebab dishes such as Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Achari Kebab, and the likes. It was presented very well and the different Kebabs were tender and adequately juicy. The Chicken Oil fry was deep fried chicken with caramelised onions and capsicums and of course, some extra oil on the inside. It was delicious.¬†

For the main course, we had Chicken Kolhapuri which was spicy and really hard-hitting on the tongue, Chicken Laazvab which had a fine balance of spices, and Chicken Ajuba which was, well, an Ajuba¬†(a wonder). All the dishes had ample rich gravy which was more than enough for our group of five. All this chicken was accompanied by Masala Kulcha which was very well done.¬†

The ambience is stellar. The chandeliers, the yellow tinted atmosphere, the wood portraits, the Punjabi songs, everything adds to its beauty. And all of this on a very moderate budget. Life can't be better for the lovers of North Indian cuisine.¬†
This is a proud addition to the North Indian food circuit in Kolkata. Worth your money.

Located this HIDDEN GEM, which serves mouthwatering North Indian cuisine in copious amount at probably the most reasonable price in the particular area.Getting to business right away, we had crispy chili babycorn for starters and was crispy enough to captivate my taste buds.For maincourse we ordered Paneer tikka masala-hot n spicy, Dal makhni was creamy and perfectly flavoured, Aloo Dum,to my surprise was bland and dull. 
If you feel you deserve a meal, long overdue, in abundant quantity at very decent prices drenched in authentic North Indian flavours..... HINDUSTHAN DHABA serves you right!!

Finally I got hold of a delightfully good and authentic Punjabi restaurant with a pleasing decor to give the feel of a posh dhaba in Kolkata. The food was undoubtedly great and left me without a reason to complain for any dish they served.
Twice more was I delighted by the excellent behavior of the host (proprietor) who is an young man just out of college.He came across as very gentle and polished and now has left we craving to visit there more often.Loads of blessings to the young entrepreneur so that he could retain the quality in days to come at the price offered. I am left without a choice but to rate a PERFECT 5¬† which is also my first ever 5 for any restaurant ¬† (5/5 for its food and 10/5 for the excellent host and the customer satisfaction ).

Discovered this place on zomato few days back and in little app found today a coupon on rs 499 for 2ppl of 4course dinner. We buy it but nt sure abt the food and their taste.. 
Its location is easy to find. Just above to annaras.
When we enter the restro u will amaze with their decoration. Its simple with classy touch.
They are too sofisticated and the owner itself is young like us and very humble nice t meet him.
Now come to food it is vri veri yum all the item their in th coupon is too yumm nd enough sufficient fr 2.
Hope to come again to try more dishes.
Thank you fr such lovely eve:-)

Despite being a tad difficult to find don't let the 'dhaba' tag fool you. The food is DELICIOUS and the service makes the meal even better. The 23 year old proprietor personally makes sure everyone is comfortable and shares his philosophy behind starting the establishment and his ambitious expansion plans.

I had a very refreshing lemon soda an extremely tasty vetki masala and a perfectly cooked chicken banjara. And the entire meal was pocket friendly to the Tee. 

Despite an upset stomach and promises to myself to go easy on the food I ended up asking for another roti or two (albeit guiltily).

A definite visit for those who want quality on a reasonable budget.

Discovered this restaurant on zomato and immediately planned to give it a try the very next day. It took some time to understand where this place actually is. So, for people unaware of this area like me, this place lies on the top of Annaras or near SXC back gate.
Now the first thing that I noticed was the ambiance. Superb! This not a 'Dhaba' but a perfect restaurant. Very nicely decorated and super comfortable seats.
I wanted to have the butter chicken masala but unfortunately that wasn't available so we tried out the Chicken-do-pyaza with butter tandoori rotis only as we were only two of us. The chicken gravy was mind-blowing. There are so many more recipes that I want to try. I am definitely come again soon. Hope to get butter chicken next time.
____________________________________
On my 3rd visit, I had Crispy Babycorn and a Thali. Crispy babycorn was crispy enough and tasted wonderful. After that we had the thali, the quantity and quality of the food provided was no doubt perfect, but it had some flavour of North India missing in it. We liked every bite we had but that's the only thing that disappointed us.

Ordered for paneer tikka and spring roll for starters which was really nice but the main course(north indian) was poor. Dal makhani, aalu do pyaza, kadai paneer and the breads were below average. Both fresh lime sweet and fresh lime salt tasted like a glass of sour soda. I hope they work on it.

Perfect Punjab da dhaba experience. Ordered Mutton Roganjosh, Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala with Roti. The taste was fantastic. The meat was well prepared with minimal oil; spices were generously added however. The decor and ambience is also quite classy, unlike a standard dhaba. So it is the best of both worlds: sumptuous dhaba food with classy ambience. A must visit for foodies.

Went there with 3 other people without prior booking but got a table as soon as we reached there (but it is strongly advised to pre-book one ). We ordered 2 chicken items and a paneer item, all of which were good. But service is somewhat a problem as our order was served late. But all in all was a pleasant experience. I expect the service to get better as the time progresses (since it is a really new restaurant).

This part of the review is about the second visit we had to this place. Nothing seems to be changed. The food continues to be good and the service continues to be pathetic. It took almost an hour for our order to arrive. Some concessions can be made owing to the New Year rush. But a restaurant of this stature should be able to handle the expected rush.

I have been trying food in almost all good restaurants of Kol and many times I have wondered if there was any restaurant that score 5 out of 5 in all parameters. Well, this is the one !! I took lunch here today and I must say that it exceeded my expectations. Here is what I feel about it -

Ambience - though the name says Dhaba, but the decor and ambience give you a very fine dining feelings. Vey spacious, chairs are comfortable, lighting is perfect, no extra sound....perfect for a get together.¬†

Food - awesome north Indian food.¬†
Veg sheekh kebab - if you are a veggie, you can try this awesome dish. Very good quantity and taste.¬†
Paneer la jawab - this is indeed la jawab. I have tried this dish in other restaurants as well. This one here is much better than them

Tengri kebab - this one will blow you away. 4 jumbo chicken legs staffed with yummy staffing - too much to resist ! This is the best of them all,
Butter chicken - very nicely cooked and delicious.¬†
Their assortment of bread with tandoori roti and naan were lip smacking.¬†

Staff - very nice and polite staff. They add to the experiencePrice - oh yes, all this comes at a very low price. We two ate like anything and still the total was under 1000 bucks.¬†
Great food, great quantity and low price.¬†
This restaurant has it all,

A ¬† sure recommendation from my side.¬†
Keep up the good work gentlemen - your restaurant is going to be a hit !!

Starting from decor to the ambience it is a perfect mood raiser. Courteous staff and polite owners play a vital role and assist you in your orders.
We ordered butter chicken which was ultimate and pure punjabi in cuisine
chicken patiala...It looks as well as tastes heaven
amritsari kulcha is a must try

And ah the most important point, this place is very pocketfriendly... great job Mr.Singh... shall visit again and again....

Last week my family was at Kolkata and we have been to " Hindustan Dhaba " several times been a Punjabi I must say that an young talented entrepreneurs has given his very best to design lovely ambience with sweet Punjabi songs and serves fabulous Punjabi cuisines.
Me my wife and mostly my son enjoyed the food we have been there several time and every time my son used to order " Paneer Tikka ", for me I can't forget the taste of hot and delicious Manchow soup with main course Dal makhani with butter nan ended with lovely coffee. 
Owners of the Dhaba are basically rooted from Amritsar Punjab so you can get the north Indian taste / cuisine must not miss " Amritsarri Kulcha" very best to the young talented Mr. Singh thanks for your hospitality.

I've been here thrice already for the love of north indian food. Quality and quantity is what they strike a balance at . For the price of a dhaba what they are providing is fine dining. My favourite till now is the achari paneer tikka which is to die for. Besides that the tandoori aloo paratha and chicken haryali kabab were good as well. The next time I went was for breakfast. The chola batura was really filling and sumptuous for the rate they are providing it at. Pocket friendly place for  gourmet north indian food is what I may describe it as. The ambience is very pleasing. The hospitality is totally on point. Will surely visit again!

F****ing Awesome!

I have been to many North Indian Restaurants but this place is the best. 
It opened recently on 25th of September. 
I went their with a close friend of mine. 
Order North Indian cuisine which included:-
1) Butter Chicken 
2) Chicken Tangri
3) Butter Nan
4) Rice
5) Fresh Lime. 

Food was amazing without a doubt. 
But what made it better was their AMBIANCE AND SERVICE. 
When I entered their lavish restaurant it made me feel that prices would be high but to my surprise it was EXTREMELY reasonable. 
Now talking bout their service, there was a guy named VIKAS who made it more special. 
His service made it unbelievable!
5/5
Will I go back there?
YES YES YES YES

We ordered for chicken 65, chicken tikka masala, kulcha and butter naan.
Chicken 65 was average 
Chicken tikka masala was superb 5 on 5 am definitely going here again.

Being a dhaba in theatre road makes this place stand out. It has excellent ambience. Calm atmosphere. No hookah or alcohol. One can go with friends or family , it will surely give one a great time. The food tastes yum and doesnt burn a hole in your pocket. Just a few changes are required. This place will soon be one of the best restaurants in Theatre road due to its unique concept and great food.

Revised review after second visit-
The service this time was good. Saw a lot of improvements. Tried the dal makhni and it was amazing! The veg tandoori khazana was a brilliant order! The spring rolls were surprisingly tasty and gives me a thumsup to their chinese soon!
Veg jal farezi and paneer banjara were both really tasty! 
Really happy to see this place improving! Btw, their breakfast menu looks tempting!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A dhaba in theater road was tempting enough to visit this place. Hindustan Dhaba is the new kid on the food block going Desi with a dhaba model. With restaurants buzzing with new themes, exotic concepts and food/cuisine, Hindustan dhaba goes easy with a fuss free concept of roti shoti!
I happened to visit this place on Navami with my friends. The interiors will please you and so will the hospitality of the owners who are very warm and welcoming.

The interiors are done in wooden textures to give a very family dining experience. The white cushions against each chair is a good idea. Personally loved the interiors which the owner has done himself.

The cuisine is north indian, tandoor and Chinese. We settled for north Indian. Ordered for the following-

1) Alu do pyaaza: was the servers recommendation. Honestly, the dish failed to impress us. A lot of flavors were missing and I feel they need to rework on it.

2) Paneer tikka masala: it was different from the other places since the smokey tandoori flavor was missing from the dish. But it tasted delicious.

3) Dal makhni: the best item of the evening! Slow cooked, perfectly smoked and buttery dal! #recommended

4) kulcha and garlic nan: both good and tasty

5) Masala thumsup: though not on the menu, they obliged to our request to make this. It was Ok.

SERVICE: well things get difficult from here! Our order took 50 mins to arrive after repeated requests. The Paneer came in after half the meal was over. The served only 1 masala thumsup when we ordered for two! The other came in when we had washed our hands, so we returned it.
The service was extremely disappointing and painful for a hungry soul like me!
The management was apologetic but I guess we can't be too hard on them. They have just opened a 2 weeks back.

An encouraging extra point from my end, because right now Hindustan Dhaba gets only a 3/5 from me.

Would recommend a visit after a few days, so that they are settled in and a tad bit more organized!

Best wishes to team Hindustan Dhaba.

When you go to HD you are not only served with exceedingly delicious food in an almost royal ambience but also greeted wonderfully by the people there. Let me tell you this tummy satiating experience doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. The truck like looking cash counter adds a lot of oomph to the place, definitely makes you think of Punjab in some way! :)

Went to the Restaurant for the celebration of a successful event at St. Xavier's with 15 colleagues of mine for dinner. What amazing Dal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala. Fast services and delicious food at great prices.  
All the Best.

Best quality at pocket friendly prices. A touch of royal ambience which makes it look more like a restaurant rather than a dhaba. Food is delicious.

Congratulations hindusthan dhaba for getting 4 star reviews within a stipulated time of opening

Been there today afternoon with friends as its a new addition to the city of joy. 
Now this is a completely new concept as in its a dhaba but in an ambience of a restaurant.. 

Interiors will give u a royal feel.. The cash counter is just WOW!! Like are you kidding man? In a trucküòâ

Now the food. 
We ordered butter nan, butter roti, chicken butter masala, chicken Manchurian, chicken do piyaza and Crispy chicken..

All the foods were yummmmmmmm!! Really..

So don't just sit back and read my status.. Go dre nd dig in.. üòÇ

That's all folks until next time.. :)
