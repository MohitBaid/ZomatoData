Its a very small outlet located quite inside and far from the main road. I guess how many are still missing out of this superb sweet shop. Located just before the Binayak Enclave of Sinthi More. they make some fine range of sweets with some delicious taste. We had a party at home so we ordered Sweet Curd "Misti Doe" and Rasgullas. And to be very honest myself and everyone just become a fan of their misti doe, it was so amazing with the taste. Rasgullas were not far behind and they were also quite decent. I hope in future this place will come handy.

I didnt even know this sweet shop was there on zomato then would have reviewed it long back. This is situated between Benicolony and Binayak Enclave. This is one of the best sweet shops in sinthee more area. Have been buying sweets from this shop since i was a kid. I and my family literally cannot survive without eating sweets from this shop each day everyday. Their speciality - misti doi, rosogolla, chamcham, singhara, nolen gurer rosogolla, pantua, lord chamcham, talshash sandesh, chocolate roshogolla and langcha.

The best part of this shop is their famous misti doi and I am sure people will agree that the best misti doi is found here! Apart from misti doi, their sandesh and special chocolate sweets are just marvellous... This place is my all time favourites!❤
