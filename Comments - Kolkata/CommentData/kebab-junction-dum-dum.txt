A small food joint located near private road. It serves chinese and kebabs. The kebabs are decent though nothing very special. The service is late and the staff not really professional. The price is cheap and the quantity is good.

Had ordered food from here. The delivery was quick. But the food was not very good. The naan was hard and chicken butter masala tasted very ordinary.

I liked the food. And would definitely order the next time. But would not like the same delivery boy as he called me later on and disturb me.

We got take away from here last Tuesday. We had ordered an achari tikka kebab and Reshmi kebab. The  achari was way too tangy while the Reshmi could do with a little more of spices. The kebabs were made okay though.

I ordered a plate of tikka kebabs around 12:30 pm and it didn't even reach me by 2:00 pm. Horrible service. When I called them up they were quite careless. Worst experience ever!
No good service. I ended up cancelling the order.

Dumdum has emerged to be a food zone over the years since many revolutionary food giants of the country have stepped in. But it was always a trouble to get quick table or delivery in rush. Kebab Junction has not only met the expected quality but also made life easy by on time delivery. They are extremely serious and open in accepting feedback and bring necessary changes in services if required. Being a Biriyani buff, I must recommend their biriyani and other delicacies as well. Enjoy food. All the best.

I ordered the chicken biriyani and mutton biriyani today for the first time from the resto certainly because of the low price than others. After having the food delivered on time I must say that the resto is the good competitor with the similar restos.The qty is really sufficient for one and the biriyani is worth your tastebud. Will order other items definitely.

Before ordering from here I thought, as there was no ratings,  how good it would be but thought lets try this food joint. I did not have much expectation from them but I'm very satisfied with the food quality and taste. I ordered tandoori chicken (gravy), kulcha, butter nan. Food was tasty. First of all price is reasonable, secondly its tasty and third point is they delivered before scheduled time. Though I did not like the butter nan, it was like paratha but keeping in mind the price (â‚¹25), I'm pretty much satisfied. I will order again from here and would suggest every one to try once. I'm sure you'll like the food.
