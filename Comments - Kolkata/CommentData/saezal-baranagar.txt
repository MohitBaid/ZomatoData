Ever wondered how your KFC chicken can get replaced? Yes this joint has a number of starters
And dishes which will beat the other session and make you fall in love with the food.  So hurry, try it out today. Don't miss the bite.

Almost a delivery only place, has 2~3 chairs in the name of seating. But if you avoid that fact, this is a heavenly place for chicken lovers. Close your eyes and order the cheesy chicken wrap. The perfect combination of cheese and chicken and the super soft and supremely tasty wrap, melt in mouth experience. I don't like the cheese balls, too pale for my taste. If you are in Dunlop, hungry and want a filling joint which is light on pocket. You won't be disappointed. This is our favourite place for after college snacks.

Have  been there  a couple  of times.  A great  place  if you are looking  for fried  chicken  at a cheap  price. Stuffs  are very  well behaved. Surprisingly  I found  the food to be more  tasty  than KFC.  Must  visit  for all living  in and around  baranagar  area as well as chicken  lovers. You can also try crispy  fried  fish.

Located at Dunlop, in a prime location, just beside the new upcoming metro subway. Sells fried chicken items including wraps, popcorns, nuggets and burgers. They change the oil every two days and even deliver to nearby locations. Though I would like the to offer some soft drink as well because it goes well with the menu. Otherwise its a nice place to have a quick snack.

Highly satisfied! The chicken items they serve gives a good competition to the kfc ones.Have ordered their crunchy golden chicken several times..have tasted their max items like chicken strips,fritters,nuggets, burgers, wraps and also their special cheese balls..I am also very much impressed by their customer service,their behavior,way they treat the customers. The only thing they need to work on is their delivery time for home deliveries.They need to increase their  man power which can easily sort out these issues

I was pretty much excited when I kind of discovered this outlet just by sheer luck. I was returning from some work, when I came across this place, located in the corner of the Dunlop market on the road.

It is pretty exciting to see new joints being opened near the places you live in. I've been staying in the hostel for the last 4 years or so, and I can appreciate how much a cheap and nice food joint can be in such a life.

Being located very near the college, we tend to go in groups after classes or used to order from the hostel pretty regularly at one point of time.

However, it is amazing, how in such a small time and some popularity, joints like these tend to disappoint you. Their services while delivering drastically went down while the food served has been pathetic at times. I've been served overcooked french fries or burnt chicken wings on quite a number of occassions, which were not suitable for eating at all.

If you haven't been here, and live nearby, you can eat from here. You can try the chicken burger or chicken wings or strips or pops. The wraps they serve here isn't actually a wrap but is kind of a cross between a wrap and a roll, but costs more than it actually should. Don't go for their cheesy burgers as they cost a lot more than the actual burgers while I didn't find much difference between the two.

They have increased the prices on their foods after pujos and it's been a long time since I have ordered from here, and I don't guess I will be unless I here superlatives about this place again.

In the area of Dunlop we need one shop for some variety snacks. Saejal made a great job for such thing. I often go to this place and order some wraps and fries. Fish wrap and molted cheese chicken ball are my favorite among them. Great place for snacks. They are very reasonable. One thing I didn't like that is their service. You guys should work more professionally

Most of the items on the menu tastes great. And another great thing is that the prices are really reasonable. It is a good alternative to KFC for persons like me as KFC oultet isn't placed near our houses. Looking from the point of view of price to food ratio, it is really a great place. One major drawback is that the space is really small. So I preferred ordering the food through zomato. The service was quite great too. Within 45mins I got my order. The delivery was swift and prompt that eased my convenience. The delivery guy didn't had any change so as a polite gesture he gave me a coupon. It was very nice of him to do that. Well I'm quite impressed with this place and their servicing.

I ordered 3 cheese chicken burgers and French fries. The delivery was real quick. The food was still hot, French fries were not soggy,the burgers had ample amount of cheese. The only negative about the food , (according to me) was their use of chaat masala in the burger as well as french fries. It kind of disbalanced the taste. I will make sure that next time I am ordering food from this place I tell them to leave out the chaat masala.

Though it is located at Dunlop more, The store location is a big backlog. You have to sit outside of the store without any table arrangement and no inside sitting available, also construction work always going beside there which makes difficult to have food outside of the shop. Takeaway is better option if you want to have food here.
FOOD TASTE is not up to the mark.
Try if you have no other option available.

Situated just beside Baranagar station this is a take away counter which has become immensely popular among fast food lovers. I have heard good things about their chicken cheese balls, so tried it. It took a little bit of time due to the rush. But the food was a real winner. They pour ample amount of cheese within chicken balls. They give ketchups in the package which is a very good thing. P. S. I will expect better packaging next time.

I was passing by this new food joint around 9:30 PM en route home last week and tried their chicken cheese burger. It was real good. This place is a welcome break for people around Dunlop who have long awaited for good fast foods and had to always bank on Chinese or Bong-fav fried items (read "chops"). The place is small and ideal for takeaways. I liked their fast service as I was really hungry and had to juggle my burger with my office call. I want them to also add beverages to their menu cart as sodas go hand in hand with their platter list.

UPDATE: SAEZAL did the sweetest thing Ever. They accepted their mistake about delay in delivering and apologised by coming down to my place and presenting me with complimentary chicken cheese balls which tasted amazing. Attached the pics too. Loved the fact the owner made time to apologize and do the delivery himself. Such commitnents towards your business is commendable. I really hope Saezal goes a long way!! Best wishes. I wl definitely order more from this place. 
I really like the kfc (cheap) alternative, but the problem and downfall of this place is their delivery system and the way they pack the products. I had to wait 2 hours for delivery and when I got the products it was all cold and soggy. Please improve your delivery and packing system.
PS:
My phone was available all the time. If your delivery boy had at all called me I would hv gt a notification later if I was busy on my phone or my phone was switched off. None of it happened, cause I had got a super fast delivery first time I ordered, so I was patiently waiting for a call from you guys. This was the second delivery and once before I had ordered a takeaway and I do appreciate desi brands like Saezal. So kindly investigate properly. Cause I didn't get any call from your delivery person.

The burger is average but the chicken cheese ball is a winner. melted cheese will spread in your mouth on the very  first  bite..

Saezal, a place you should must visit if you're fan of fried chicken. They have a clean menu no shit just a simple menu. The fried chicken tastes very close to the KFC's fried chicken. Now coming to the pros and cons of this place.
Pros-
1. Very simple and tasty menu.
2. Polite staff.
3. KFC's competitor.
4. Have home delivery option.
5. Have happy hours from 12:00-4:00 for students only.

Cons-
1. no sitting available.
2. Sometimes delay in delivery.

Food: 4/5
Hygiene: 5/5
Decor: 2/5
Staff: 5/5

Overall: 4/5

Ps. I have a personal problem if the owners gonna read this I have a request. I'm one of the customer who visited the first day of your shop and I'm still a regular customer. I used to love the cheesy chicken burger lately but now you guys don't make it fresh now it tastes awful. You guys used to make the best burger but now you just make it early and put it in microvave and serve it to the customer. I don't know why you started doing this but now I don't prefer eating your cheesy chicken burger. If you can just make it like old days and I'm sure people will love it and you can ask your old customer and think about it.

The order : Spot on.  Got it within an hour.  Earlier than the expected delivery time.  
The food : 
Cheesy Chicken Burger : Was okayish.  Not very great.  The taste was slightly bland.  
Cheesy chicken Balls : A generous layer of chicken coating,  enclosing a Cheesy,  gooey core.  This was way beyond my expectations.  And I absolutely loved it.  Very reasonably priced at 80 rupees for 4.  
The Chicken Bucket : Taste was similar to KFC,  if not better.  A thumbs up for this one too.  
French fries: Tasty,  but quite unlike the Mc D French fries that fries are synonymous with.  I didn't like it much because of the excess dose of chat masala on top.  
Recommendation  : Good option for people living in Baranagar area who'd  been craving for  a clean,  hygienic fast food joint since long.  You should definitely try this out!

I will definitely give 5 stars rating to all of them. It's mainly a takeaway counter. Staffs are very polite and helpful. They also take orders over phone. Food quality is awesome, almost 1:1 equivalent to KFC.... Service is also very swift. No doubt one of the best fried items chain. Loved it.

Located right below dunlop bridge on the main road, my first wish would be ah! Hope they had a sitting place. They have excellent systematic payment and food giveout system and the hospitality is top notch for a take away as such. The cleanliness and hygiene would put any regular roll and like shop to shame. Coming to the food the molten cheese balls were perfect with a stashed chicken layering and cheesy inside. The chicken popcorn very very similar to any branded one aka KFC. Quantity is best at the price. 
Luckily got to seat to and enjoyed their very best.
Its gonna develop in to a gem at this price and service.
Great experience!

People who are so much crazy for Burgers can have it from here.. It is just near the Baranagar Railway Station and at the back gate of Rangoli building..They made the burger just like KFC.. Best for evening snacks.. Good behaviour of the workers and owner.. The food is very much tasty and fresh and very reasonable prices.. They always try to do something new and better which came as a best outcome. Recently I have heard about their new recipe Paneer balls and I have tasted it as a sample and that was mind-blowing..

** Location = Rangoli Market, just beside the Dunlop AC market back gate.¬†

** Brief = The people in and around baranagar area craved for a burger and crispy chicken joint and even though not upto the mark of KFC or Burger King, but still they serve a great purpose. Their cordial behaviour is also a plus point.

** Ambiance = Its mainly a take away counter, but 4 chairs are there in case you want to have food therein.

** Things tried = Chicken Burger, Chicken Cheese Burger, Cheesy Chicken Wrap, Chicken Winglets, Chicken Strips.
Each of the items are value for money and very tasty, the chicken winglets and chicken strips are very much like that of the infamous places. Although the wraps are not much upto the mark.

** Purse Check = Rs. 300/- would be more than enough for 2 people.

**Overall = The place is good, although a bit of repair work is going in and around Dunlop Bridge for the Metro Station, and once it will be done, the look of the place is definitely going to improve. Cheers, keep up the great work.

Has been a wonderful experience. Plus point being near to my residence, so could drop in whenever needed. Have been munching their burgers and Chicken items - the latter being on par almost with KFC's standards. Can do better with the French fries - inconsistent frying at times makes the fries go too much crunchy.

Good food, enthusiastic staff. Works for students or anybody looking for really affordable yet filling stuff. The burger could have a bit more of lettuce just to add a sharp crunch. Decent delivery.
Especially life saving when you got the munchies.

Visited the place thrice. Ordered crunchy chicken, egg cheezy wrap, cheezy chicken burger and french fries.
Pros: 1) Pocket friendly
2) The proportion is quite large and plenty. French fries were plenty, the crunchy pieces are big.
3) The taste of the food for the french fries and wrap and crunchy chicken was good. The burger was a bit too salty.
4) In all my reviews I give the service and behaviour of the staff a major attention. The behaviour is very good, helpful and friendly. Makes up for the delay they do in serving
Cons:
1) Takes much time in serving even though quite many people work there
2) No sitting arrangement.
3) Since it serves fries, they should start serving cold drinks too. 
P. S I didnt order the french fries... The owner gave me free of cost to while away the time waiting for my order... So yay!!

Today I got molten chicken cheese balls,crunchy golden chicken and cheesy chicken wrap home delivered from this food joint and couldn't wait more to give a review..the taste of the cheese balls was the best, still lingering in my mouth..then comes the golden chicken which was just like KFC.. Both these items were awesome! but the wrap wasn't good..they could try to make something like shawarma which would do better than wrap I guess..

good fried food... if you come to have a burger after watching the picture on their leaflet then the burger won't be as u expect bqz the burger doesn't have thick chicken patty as they show on their leaflet...bt the burger tastes very good for 50 rupees... the crispy golden chicken is worths a little more than it's price so that is a must have if u visit this place...bt the popcorn...umm...that will be a little waste of money...

The food is quite cheap and does not taste that bad. But the reason for this 2.5 is that they delivered the food 1 and half hours late!! The owner apologized later though and said that they had an overflowing demand of orders and that they have only one delivery man. But they could have mentioned that they have a problem in delivering food at the moment. We had ordered chicken burgers, cheesy chicken burgers, veg burger, French fries, Chicken winglets and veg cheese balls. They had packed the dishes well. I can't tell if it was the delay or the original taste but the burgers tasted bland, it felt like it had no spices or sauces in it. They were a major let down. The cheese balls were the best of them all. The chicken and the french fries were good enough. The entire order was for 5 people and it came upto around 650. But I don't think we'll ever order from this place again.

I have tried chicken strips and French fries here. But tasting only these two items I got a very good impression about this outlet. Food tastes really good and price is very reasonable. No extra charge is levied on the menu price. It is a very small outlet, so you will only little space to eat over here but you can take away or can call for a delivery. I will definitely suggest to try this one.

@1st Oct - Please update the price chart....

Delicious food, efficient home delivery, but quite affordable! It's new but it's already giving KFC a run for its money. I really liked their fried chicken and french fries. You couldn't ever imagine earlier to get this sort of tasty fries and fried chicken at this cost. Tried a chicken burger as well, which was decent. I was pleasantly surprised with how good their food actually tasted.

A small joint retaining the essence of kfc's fried chicken whilst being extremely pocket friendly and cost efficient.  Even their cheese-chicken burgers taste somewhat like a zinger at half its price. :)                  only downside - they don't offer combo's YET .

The cost and food goes hand in hand. Quality wise and quantity wise this is how fried chicken should be, they can bring in some more items in the menu for foodies like us to try out. I don't think they will have much competition even if KFC comes to the locality, cause surely they won't be matching the cost factor.

I had kfc like fried chicken at many places but I was not satisfied with the quality, so i was sceptical to try this... But the fried chicken here just blew it away... Tastes just like kfc and most important part is u have to pay what's written on the menu... No taxes or anything extra.. I had ordered 8 pc bucket which tasted like heaven... The staff were really polite and professional... I really do look forward to visit this place again and try their other dishes... Keep up this good work Saezal.
