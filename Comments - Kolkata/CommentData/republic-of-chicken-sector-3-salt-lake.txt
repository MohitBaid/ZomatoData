This restaurant serves two kinds of roasted chicken, herb roasted and stuffed honey roasted. Both are pretty good !! The quantity is good. It also serves other ready to eat dishes but someone who wants to have good roasted chicken, this is the place to look for.

Republic of Chicken is a take away  eatery located at Sector 3, Salt lake. It mainly sells poultry products and fish items. It sells raw chicken and fish too.

Ambience is nice with no sitting arrangements. 

Tried Chicken 65 & Chicken mini Kievs. Chicken 65 was above average. Chicken mini Kievs was good and yummy.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

A nice place for chicken lovers.

যারা মুরগির মাংসের নামে পাগল হয়ে যান তাদের জন্য স্বর্গ । এত ধরনের জিনিস মিলবে যেটা কল্পনাতেও আসে না । চিকেন ললিপপ আর চিকেন ৬৫ মেরেছিলাম ,  সুন্দর লেগেছিল ।

Have been there for a couple of times. Have tried out their hot dogs and chicken kebabs. Frankly speaking the chicken was too much processed and the flavours were bland.

I personally don't  like there frozen items  except the mini chicken kievs.But their  stuffed honey roasted chicken is just awesome.They also have a herb roasted chicken option which sells out by 7.30.They also offer lots of ready to eat options.Do not try there dimsums and shami kebabs.It is a complete waste of money.

Situated on HA block, quite close to Anjali Jewellers showroom and Anindita island, this outlet specializes in poultry products e.g. eggs , different cuts and raw and semi-processed chicken treats. But they do have a wide variety of veg and non-veg ready to cook and ready to eat stuff. The feather in the crown is the herb roast chicken which is slow cooked in an oven in their premises with olive oil and oregano. They also have limited mutton, fish, prawn and vegetable deep freezes. With eat in (standing), take away and home delivery options truly a boon for poultry lovers in the area.

I loved this place! They have spread across the city in such a sort period of time that it's quite commendable. The beautiful chicken roast gets roasted in an oven outside the shop! The outlets sells packaged nuggets, sausages. They also sell raw fish and chicken.

This is located just beside VIP sweets in HA Block. This is not a restaurant to eat at. Rather they have their own brand of processed foods.
In case you want to sit and eat , then they will prepare it and serve it to you.

Though there are no such tables and chairs to sit and eat still they managed to arrange chairs for four of us to have food.
We ordered one plate of Chicken strips, one plate of Chicken popcorn,one plate of Chicken Ajwani finger and one plate of Chicken sausages.
Out of all these the best one was the Chicken strips and the rest was ordinary.
Chicken ajwani fingers were the second best. This tastes similar to tandoor preparation.
Chicken popcorn appeared like chicken balls to us.
One plate of chicken sausages had large quantity and we really struggled to finish it off. I found this preparation to be very ordinary.

Note:: This is not a place to sit and eat. Rather take it home,prepare it and have it.

I have a mixed impression about this place. Speaking of ROC, this is a fairly new brand which has come up with multiple branches all over Kolkata. They are mostly famous for their quick-bite chicken preparations which you can have right inside the store. 

They sell raw chicken and fish as well, if it helps for your daily need. I have tried Herb Roasted Chicken, Kievs, Sausages and Chicken Nuggets from here. The Kievs were especially nice with ample amount of cheese. What I didn't like were sausages and nuggets. I like my sausages fried, unless I am having a hot-dog. This was served to me, by probably baking it and hence it lacked decent flavors. the nuggets, although, there wasn't anything wrong with it, didn't stand up to my expectations. I am mostly  used to the Chicken Nuggets by Venkys or the ones served by McDonalds.

If you are looking to come over here, you can find it located near Shiraz at Sector 3 between Anindita Island and GD Island! Perhaps, a decent alternative of not to have fry chicken delicacies at home but rather have it done by someone else!

You can get lots of different types of ready to eat chicken dishes here and most of them are really delicious. There are no seating arrangements here so basically it's a take away joint. I really like the roasted chicken they serve on weekends, that should be tried if you're a chicken lover. 
Also the raw chicken, fish, lobster etc. available here is pretty fresh and of good quality.

Quite decent. Actually its really difficult to do something bad with chicken!!! And they don't disappoint you. They have a number of outlets around the city. This outlet is in Sec-3, Saltlake, Near State Bank Of Travancore.  I had the below items over my 2 visits in the restaurant - 
Chicken sikh kebabs, Chicken 65, Chicken shish taouk & from quick serving starters section  - chicken salami, smoke chicken breast.
Food - 4/5,
Decor-3/5, service - 3.5/5.

Dedicated wholeheartedly to the existence of chicken, Republic Of Chicken is one of the most different outlets I've seen. Never saw so many different preparations of chicken anywhere else and everything tastes quite awesome. The place is small, no seating arrangements but still this place rocks.

They do offer raw chicken, prawns (all sizes) and fish which is fresh most if the times. A nice place to try a variety of preparations you might not find anywhere else.

I really like this place. I've always used it as a takeaway joint and don't think have ever asked them to heat/cook something for me. I've likes their stuff every time.

The decor inside is like that of a takeaway joint, in my honest opinion. The upside is that its clean and normal.

The food is brilliant. I don't think its overpriced considering the other places we eat in. I like their nuggets and mini kievs. In fact apart from the usual chicken routine recommended by me in other reviews, I would urge you to try their veg/cheese mini Kiev. The stuffing melts in your mouth. I love that.

I'd recommend this place for birthdays and parties held at your house as long as you have the urge to fry the items.

Great place.

their chicken hotdogs are good for a quick snacks.. immediate roasted chicken are good too which is available in the late afternoon/ evening.. but it has to be consumed soon otherwise gets chewy.. till date no complain abt this place.. prices are reasonable.. we expect them to offer Wraps veg/ non veg, Raw Mutton and Pork too.. they are keeping raw fishes..

The list of delicacies is endless and they are all so tasty! Biryani and herb roast are must haves. Hot dog is cheap and really good. 
Very clean and the staff very courteous. They home delivered on time even on a rainy day. Kudos!

ROC has a huge collection of frozen ready to eat meats, kebabs, and fish fillets. 
One must definitely try their ready to fry chicken mini kievs and heat & eat mutton sheekh kebabs. 
The chicken nuggets are quite juicy and chicken salami has nice flavours. 
The herb roast chicken was mouth-watering.
The best part is they deliver at home in less than 15 minutes of placing an order.

Tried their Smoked chicken breast and loved it . Home delivered.
Also loved the Herb roast chicken .
Deliveries take place in no time.-- 45 minutes within salt lake . Highly recommeneded if you want stuff tasty and quick and hot to reach home in time.
Will surely reorder the two and try the other items too.

For people who like to organise parties at home, this palce can come in very handy, processed cuts of meat, save time and energy. They have a decent range of chicken cold cuts which can be very helpful in salads i had chicken seekh kebabs and the dimsum which was decent for an easy meal. 

they also have processed sea food like basa fillet steaks, cleaned and deveined prawns 

the grilled/roasted chicken looks very tempting... will try it soon.
