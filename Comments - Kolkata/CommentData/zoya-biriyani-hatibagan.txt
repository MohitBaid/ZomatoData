Ordered their special mutton biryani. The rice was disappointing. It was dry,with no flavour as such. Even the off white colour looked unappealing. But the aloo was perfectly cooked and spicy,and mutton was tender and huge in portion as well. Never had such a bipolar biryani before. They need to work on their rice and it might be worth its price.

If you eat biriyani at low cost,plz visit here... I tried mutton biryani & chicken chap.Not much oily and spicy with a quite good quantity of rice & a super mutton piece along with a piece of potato.. price is really pocket friendly. I shall surely visit here again.

The taste is good....price is ok too and quality maintained during puja! But quantity I think should be increased (don't know if reduced during puja).

Location near Hedua 

Now days Kolkata have lots of street cheap biriyani shops.. 

This joint comes under this category I won't say they make worst biriyani. 

The price which you are paying for it, I like it worth it can't complain.

When you are dried up and you want have biriyani try this out.  I am sure it won't disappointed you just keep your mind aside and stop comparing with big fish in the market. 

Adios

They are making good biriyani now. I hope they keep up with the quality. Previously, the quality had deterioted. But they have started making quality biriyani again.

I expected better from zoya after reading all the reviews but in that range 'sangam' (little less than zoya rather) near jorabagan is much much better in taste.. alu of the biriani was the only thing I liked, rest was tasteless being honest

Cheap biryani has become a common thing here in Kolkata,but sometimes you have to compromise with the taste and quality.Of all the cheap biryanis I have had in Kolkata I found Zoya's biryani to be less oily and that's what makes it a remarkable one!! Being an avid biryani lover it's a difficult thing for me to judge a biryani though but all I would say is they genuinely provide good quality at less price!!

One day going towards my office for night shift when passing through Hatibagan, I decided to get their cheap Biryani for dinner. Actually I noticed this shop before, located near to Hedua Park opposite to Blossom just beside the Petrol Pump but didn't got the chance to try. Nowdays this kind of cheap biryani shops are increasing in every lane of the city with different names, so competition is much higher too.

Alu Biryani was well cooked & very spicy. A big potato piece was there, that was also well cooked. Rice quality wasn't very high but it was rich in taste. Mixing it up with their Chap was making it extreamly hot & spicy. Quantity was average.

Chicken Chap was extremely oily & spicy. After having it acidity is for sure. However a huge chicken piece in it can make you greedy. Although it could have been softer. Enough gravy rather say spices & oil was there in a plate.

All this was enough tummy filling even for a person like me. The best part is within only Rs. 100-150 someone can actually have lunch or dinner & also fulfill the cravings of Biryani. Yes this biryani shop definitely looks very cheap & some people may not like to dine at all. But the truth is if they focus on dine ultimately they will end up by increasing the price & decreasing quality & quantity. It couldn't get better than this, atleast for this price point.

Its a small restaurant wid verry few seating arrangement...too congested to sit n have...But as I stay in this area n a student, I really prefer Zoya a lot... Specially d 'aloo'... It tastes unusual... u dont even need chicken or mutton to enhance d taste of d biriyani,d spicy 'aloo' does it all... d cheap n best biriyani in dis area...Sometimes we have to wait for chicken biriyani,as we have to hear 'didi khatam ho gaya,chicken aa rha h,thodi der ruk jaiye'..u'll alwez get fresh biriyani here... But I didnt like d mutton biriyani, I puked out all after having it...

Foods are good and price rate are really cheap. So it could be affordable for everyone. The quantity and quality are really nice. I think if  the infrastructure may be developed then it will be more famous.

It is a local Biryani shop like many others in North Kolkata. I have eaten Biryani of few local Biryani shops of North Kolkata but Zoya is one of the worst places. Their Biryani is cheap but it lacks taste. I will never have their Biryani again & I won't recommend anyone to have Biryani there.

Was returning from late night Movie show at 11pm, couldn't find anything on road except this store opened up at 11 at night. Took Chicken Biryani and Chicken Chap. Biryani and Chap both were good at Rs.70 and Rs.40 respectively.
Biryani which wasn't much warm due to the odd timing, still tasted good. Quantity was also fine for an adult.

I cannot believe they have zoya biryani on zomato. Being a student at bethune, zoya biryani was always my buddy whenever I felt that biryani craving during recess. And I must say the quality is decent enough, considering the fact that they charge only 70 for a plate of chicken biryani!!

I love their biriany very much.. Spicy and don't have that much scent... if u are a biriany lover like u should definitely try , u can't get that tasty biriany in just 70/ all over hatibagan.. But they don't have proper sitting arrangement...if they should add some rumali roti or partha kind of things I would more happy..

While walking through Hatibagan I spotted this Biryani outlet. It was almost 9.30 and almost all adjoining shops were closed by then. I did not wish to cook again so wished to have a pack of Chicken Biryani from here. I found that it was fairly popular from the people's interaction. There are only 5-6 chairs for people to dine in. So its better to take away. And now coming to the real thing - Biryani. It totally dissatisfied me. No proper texture of Biryani. The potato was too salty. The rice did not at all taste like the so called Biryani. The chicken too was not soft and wasn't tasty. Overall the experience was quite poor. For such a Biryani outlet in Hatibagan area, my thumbs are down. Anyway you can surely opt for it if you don't find any other place to quench your tummy at late night!

Just problem is that they don't have seating arrangements. I have been there many times and found the food satisfied. They serve different varieties of rolls, momos & shawarmas. But their egg roll is the best so far I've tried.

This Biriyani centre gets a lot of orders from our residence,or whenever someone has a birthday,or a mood to treat.Good food,except that the take-away is not ample in quantity.The veg-biriyani is not upto the mark.Plenty of scope for improvisation.Chaap is satisfactory.Overall-average
