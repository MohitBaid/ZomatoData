Food quality is absolutely pathetic for the very first time I had to throw away half of the food items which was really very disappointing.

I would request ZOMATO operators to kindly remove their name from their aaap so that other users like me are not suffered.

The place is not nice to sit and eat. It's a better option for a takeaway or if you are comfortable to eat in your car. The food is phenomenal with the original tastes of every Indian item. It's very reasonable and doesn't pinch the pocket even if you eat at the tummy's fullest.

I ordered food from here last week and malai kofta was on the recommendation list.First of all please remove it from the recommendation list.It tasted awfully bad.I don't really throw food but i actually had to throw it because no one could eat it.The quality of food here is definitely bad.I am unhappy with the service as well.

This place changes owners very often and hence its name. Originally the ben fish of laboni island, this place now caters to the non bengali segment of salt lake. But as we know, pure vegetarian places like this have very little to offer in terms of variety. The 3 and a half points are only for cleanliness and effort

Situated near Labony Salt Lake sector 3 as the name suggests this place is a veg kind of dhaba you can say of some sort.... We ordered for a Paneer Tikka (Haryali), Paneer Tikka, Aloo Tandoor, few butter nans, Dal Fry and Dal Tadka.
 
   Well the butter nan was well made. It was not burnt up and was ok to eat. Similarly the Dal Fry, Dal Tadka was also ok but somewhere I found that it was missing that touch. The starters were something that was really a turn down. The Aloo Tandoor still somehow made it to the good list too but the Paneer Tikka and Paneer Tikka (Haryali) was really bland. The juiciness was all gone and what we were left out with was like dried up sponge balls marinated with some spices. 

 The service on the other hand was more or less fast and prompt. Take away or home delivery can be a better option from this place. A "value for money" place as well.

 Word to the management will be that the place needs more improvement. Service was ok but the food needs a little more work done to it.....

Well, after a nice experience at their Bangur branch, I targeted their Sector 3, Saltlake branch. We headed for a dinner into this dhaba-styled food outlet – they serve pure veg cuisines only, mind it – they are the “Veg” dhaba!

Modest seating arrangements have been made, simple chairs and tables and a simple temporary roof!

We became excited when we noticed a great deals of kebabs hanging in meathooks inside the kitchen. We started off with paneer tikka kebab – 6 pieces – which was served with cold mint chutney along with some salads. It was pretty well roasted and high on taste – full marks for presentation!

Next followed spinach corn – which was topped with a layer of butter – and was yet light and fine on taste. Since we were looking forward to a light meal, we ordered the plain simple tawa chapatis – which were fine!

It is indeed noteworthy that they do not use any cutlery and all food is served in disposable plates and foil containers! Unfortunately, that day, they had a refrigerator break-down and hence, could not provide any cold drinks. Even the mineral water was served at room temperature.

Hygiene of the place however requires redressal.

Service is nice and ambience of the fine – typical dhaba-types, so, walk in for a typical dhaba-type experience!

It's a neat and clean food stall near Labony Island in Salt Lake. The food is pretty expensive keeping in mind that it serves only vegetarian items. The quantity can be increased. The taste is mediocre and can be improved as well.

Whenever I have a craving for food and need to order online without having to strain my wallet, this is the first place I think of. Its comparatively near my home and food gets delivered in 30-40 mins via swiggy and serves no onion and no garlic food as well. The biggest reason for choosing is the food quality, quantity and taste, all of which are amazing and that too at such low prices. Their malai kofta and masala kulcha is too good and a must try, and rest of the dishes are pretty good as well. Have already ordered around 5-10 times and would continue to do so in the future as well. Kudos to the team of Veg Dhaba, keep it up.

They don't use onion and garlic but still manages to cook absolutely delicious food. Ordered via swiggy so can't comment about the environment & ambiance but the food I got was truly lip smacking. ordered masala kulchas, malai kofta, kashmiri alu dum, paneer pakoda, chana masala. All the items were delicious and price was extremely pocket friendly. Really loved the food & btw the food was delivered within 45 mins, had no issues with delivery timings also...

Didn't expect the food here to be this good. Had the dal makhani & chana masala here and both were really delicious. The butter naan & masala kulcha specially were great in taste, soft & delicious. They also made my chana masala onion free so it's a good place for those who prefer jain food. The prices are so moderate, it was a really good experience. Looking forward to visiting many more times.

The address has changed now though. It's located near ATI, Salt Lake, Sector 1.

If you've been to Bangalore, you must have had Gobi Manchurian. It's one of my favorites and I've been looking all over Kolkata for gobi manchurian that comes even close. So when I saw, this place had gobi manchurian in their menu, I wasted no time ordering in. Also ordered Jeera rice and dal makhani. Well, the gobi manchurian was not as good as expected, but it wasn't bad either. The Jeera rice was pretty good. Dal makhani was a letdown. But overall, if you look at the prices, you won't be disappointed. Good value for money.

I was looking for pure veg outlets in and around Saltlake who delivers food home and came to know about this food joint. We ordered ALU paratha, kashmiri ALU dum, Gobi Manchurian and veg garlic fried rice. The prices are very reasonable and the food has a homely taste to it but I found the kashmiri ALU dum very basic like a normal ALU dum. But overall the food quality was pretty decent. For negative feedback I would say that they take  lot of time to deliver the food

Saltlake Veg Dhaba is a branch of bangur veg dhaba. This food joint is more popular for its home delivery. We ordered malai kofta, dal makhani, masala kulcha & mix veg polao. Our order was delivered within 30 minutes and all the items were hot. Malai kofta was amazing, dal makhani and masala kulcha were good. Mix veg polao was OK type. 
Overall good place to order food for home delivery. Pocket pinch is not much. Highly recommended.

The portions were served generously. Food was very tasty and being a paneer lover I loved that they served decent chunks of paneer. All in all a total paisa vasool dinner. Great job 👍
