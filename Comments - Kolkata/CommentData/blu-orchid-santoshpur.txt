This a new place the popped up in one of the food ordering apps and like usual me, I went ahead trying my luck and I must say I was not disappointed. The manchow soup was light but full of flavours, though I thought salt was a bit on the higher side. The Kronjee crispy chicken was good but not crispy but the schezwan noddle was just yummy.

Soup & starter quantity is the only reason for holding back that 1 star..will be ordering today to try some other items.

Editing my last review: I'd commented on the food being salty, and the owner called me to apologise and offered to deliver another portion. I wasn't at home the second time, but my parents were, and they received the same order as before - mixed wonton soup, and dry chilli chicken. They were extremely happy with the food and with the politeness of the delivery exec. Looking forward to ordering more!

Blu orchid is a new outlet in town that promises to serve authentic chinese cuisine at your doorstep.So we decided to try some of their lip smacking dishes. Here is a glimpse of what we ordered-. 1.Blu Orchid Special Soup -The name itself suggests that something special is on your plate.This soup was very light and flavourful with lots of shredded chicken and shrimp.
                                                                ...

The latest Chinese joint which delivers to Kalikapur is the best thing that could happen to the area. We lack decent Chinese options in that area and what more would you want if you could get Tangra style Chinese? 
It comes homely neatly packed in a box to keep it hot! The packing would certainly please you :) 
My favourite among everything was the threaded fish... I've ordered it thrice by now and I could never manage to get a picture of it, try it to believe it.
The fried rice was really yum and went very well with soft and delicious hunan fish. 
The Szechuan noodles I had with melt-in-mouth chilly paneer was too good.
A satisfying meal, would be on my top ordering lists!

2.	Mixed Cantonese Noodle (4.0/5.0) – This is gravy noodles with Cantonese style. The noodle came in two different container where one container contain noodles and other one contain gravy. The noodles were fried and crispy in nature and the gravy was cooked perfectly with mixed non veg items. Just take the noodle into a bowl and pour the gravy over it and add sprinkles of pepper and you are ready to have it.

3.	Chilli Chicken Dry (4.25/5.0) – Deep fried mid-sized chicken pieces tossed with soya sauce and lots of onion and capsicum and served it in dry way. Perfect starter item, if you like any spicy dishes as a starter.

4.	Threaded Fish (4.25/5.0) – Six pieces chicken strips with thin noodle layer were deep fried. The item was crunchy from outside but juicy and soft from inside. Dip it into the tomato ketchup and you are ready to go.

7.	Hunan Prawn (4.5/5.0) – Big sized prawn cooked in a spicy gravy. Little tangy flavored this dish is perfect accompany with any types of non or mid spicy rice or noodles.

We also ordered some of their combo items also, which includes –

1.	Veg Hakka Noodles with Schezwan Chicken (4.0/5.0) – Good portion of noodles were served with 4 pieces of chicken. Noodles were fine but the chicken had lack of chilly flavor.

2.	Veg Fried Rice with Garlic Paneer (3.25/5.0) – Good portion of rice were served with four big pieces of paneer. Rice was full of veggies but the paneer gravy was too sweet in flavor. The garlic touch was absent into it, need to improvise it.

Apart from the good food, they also provide you sufficient no of cutlery & the food packaging was too good. After packing it was wrapped with plastic sheet to prevent the leaking of any kind of liquid. Overall it was a good dining experiences and definitely place my order again from this 
joint.

Delivery outlets now a days are gaining the favorite spot among the people who loves to hangout & eat at their place. Where Zomato online and Swiggy are working hard to reach the food at your doorsteps it is even harder and tough job on the heads of the Food Delivery Joints to maintain the Food quality and service. Not even the food but the packing has also been an issue with so many delivery outlets. Keeping all this things in mind the order was made from this very place which is a new addition to Santoshpur area.
Blue Orchid is a food Delivery Joint that came in the limelight for their outstanding food with amazing packing and quick service. They are new so the menu is also very friendly and made according to your taste buds with some very affordable prices. (Prices are Inclusive of taxes).

List of ordered food was too many but i want to mention those which i personally liked.

1. Garlic Prawn Dry : Cant say No to prawn. There are hardly anyone who can resist this and denies this to eat until the person has a problem. Fried Prawn with the taste flavors of garlic was rocking the table.

2. Konjee Crispy Lamb : Even after the crispy lamb was little cold but the crisp and crunch didnt left it out. This was surely a nice one.

3. Non Veg Combo : To be mention not only they serve in the Ala Cart menu but you also have the liberty to choose combos from their menu. And this combo included Veg fried Rice with Chilly Chicken Gravy. The gravy complemented the rice excellently and the chicken was soft and juicy. Recommended. Price is very fair according to the quality and quantity, Enough for one person.

It was a beautiful bright day and the food made it even brighter.

Blu Orchid is a home-delivery joint serving delicious lip-smacking chinese food. Recently order some food from this joint at my friends house. Now i loved the way the packaging was done- contained in spill-proof containers. What amazed me was that everything was inclusive of gst and that they didn't charge any extra amount for containers and delivery- nowadays something which we hardly find. So definately a good gesture from their side. Now coming to the food, each and every item was just awesome. We had:
Starters:
Chili Chicken(Dry)- beautifully cooked chicken. The spicyness was really balanced perfectly.
Konjee Crispy Chicken- this was just yummm yumm and yummm
Threaded Fish- A must try worthy dish. A beautiful dish i have to say. Crispy layer outside and soft fish inside- what a combination. Its absolutely heavenly. Highly Recommended.
Garlic Prawns(Dry)- beautiful succulent tender prawns. The garlic wasn't overpowering, just the right amount. 
Main Course:
Mixed Hakka Noodles and Mixed Fried Rice:
Both tasted great. The quality and quantity of both were commendable. 
Hunan Fish: the gravy was delicious and the fish was soft. Though it was a little bit spicy but i loved it. 
Ginger Chicken- beautifully cooked chicken in a ginger based gravy. The flavour was balanced perfectly. 
I loved their food immensely and so did my friends as well. We are planning again to order more from here. This joint is just wow.
Oh yes, heard that they also provide a 10% discount as well. Definately gonna order from this joint.

So the Blu Orchid is here to satiate all the sudden Chinese food cravings when you're feeling too lazy to eat out. An exclusive home delivery joint which has opened its doors in the Santoshpur area seems promising as their food is not just reasonably priced but of premium quality and quantity. I got an opportunity to taste few of their delectable items :

• Blu Orchid Special non veg soup (5/5) : A lightly spiced, warm brothy soup full of prawns, mushrooms and veggies is just the perfect appetizer for winters.

•Threaded fish (4/5) : White fish fillets coated in rice noodles and deep fried. Crispy and good to taste.

•Dry chilli chicken (3.5/5) : Just the perfect Calcutta style chilli chicken with the right amount of chillies and bell peppers. This was passable.

•Mixed Garlic Fried Rice (4/5) : Full with veggies and shredded chicken, prawns and eggs, this one tasted really nice.

•Mixed Hakka noodles (3/5) : Wok tossed hakka noodles, tasted okay.
•Mixed Cantonese noodles (4/5) : Another good item, this was the perfect gravy noodles for the winters.

•Hunan Prawn (5/5) : The showstopper of the menu, well cooked medium sized prawns in hunan style gravy. This came as a total surprise to me.

•Combo 1: Veg fried rice with garlic Paneer (3.5/5)
•Combo 2 : Veg hakka noodles with schezwan chicken (3.5/5)

The packaging was sturdy and they provided ample amount of disposable cutlery which I found pretty great as it comes handy when you're in a hurry or just don't want to indulge in doing dishes for the day. The whole spread was quite filling, and I'd surely order from here soon again.

3.Threaded Fish-Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside,this tasted absolutely amazing.Succulent fish covered with thin noodles and deep fried. This is a must try dish.
4.Mixed Cantonese Noodle-This dish was sent in two@ different containers,one consisted the noodles and another one was the gravy so that you can add the gravy  according to your need.This dish was okayish and i  felt that it was a bit bland.
5.Mixed Garlic Fried Rice-Rice was good with chicken and prawn but it lacked the flavour of garlic.
6.Mixed Schezwan Noodles-Noodles tossed in schezwan sauce ,a bit spicy but tasted good.

Ordered Mixed Cantonese Noodle, Honey Chicken and Prawn In Chilli Oyster Sauce for home delivery today. The delivery was prompt and the food arrived hot. The packaging is attractive. And above all, all the three dishes tasted really delicious. Reminded me of the Tangra restaurants. Very reasonable price. Happy to have such a good outlet for home delivery in our locality.
