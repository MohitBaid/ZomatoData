Well this place located in Quest mall, Ballygunge is a great place to dine in specially for college studs like me. This place have a good variety to order from. Specially I love their soups and side dishes.
I would recommend you to try their hot and sour soup and Hakka noodles.

This place has been my all time favourite. Their chinese delicacies are something which i love. My most favourite dish is the chicken momo. I visit this place quite often for the momos. Now coming to other dishes. We ordered  crispy chilli babycorn , pan fried chilli fish qnd crispy fish in chilli honey sauce. The crispy fish in chili honey sauce was the best. For the main course we ordered mixed fried rice , mixed  hakka noodles , panfried noodles. They were equally good. Side dishes were chicken Manchurian and szechwan chicken. The experience was very good .

Its one of the most important food station at the quest mall food court. However the quality and the quantity has to improve immensely. Very popular one it has to pull up its socks. Having said that the menu is diverse and pretty nice with great combinations.

I would humbly ask the owner of the place to have a check on the employees picture that i added along with the review. His attitude very disrespectful arrogant and putting off. Upon asking him questions about the combo he showed an attitude as if we as customers are slaves to him. I asked him for a softdrink " bhaiya coke hai fountain se denge to check karwa dijiye flat nai hona chaiye." He replied " fountain hai flat hi milega lena hai kya ?" I didn't want to upset myself asking him bout his name or saying anything to him. I asked him " combo me kya hai?" He replied " combo khatam hai" they have big boards of combo placed multiple places on the counter. I felt like kicking his balls out of his mouth but didn't want to create a scene in public place. I want you to enquire on this incident.

Good Chinese but as per food court standards the prices are a little on the higher side. I had ordered a pan fried chicken noodle. Taste is very good and so is their presentation. Service is quite fast if there isn't much of a rush. Only one suggestion incase they can incorporate is that they should have more variety of Thai cuisine like phad Thai and Penang  a curry cause do serve Thai red curry and Tom yum soup. Incase you eat here you should not miss their momos. They are excellent. My experience in a nutshell : satisfying!!

Everyone loves Chinese food, which is why every food court has one. QCourt's Chinese kiosk is by China South, where I dug into a plate of Pan Fried Noodles. It tasted very different from the "gravy chow mein" that we all are used to. The noodles were coated in gravy with subtle flavours, and the dish was loaded with diced chicken and exotic veggies. I also tried the Chicken Momos, which were quite meaty, and served with two dips. Overall, the food here is not the typical ketchup-dipped Indian Chinese mess.

This is the only place in the QCourt which serves Chinese. I tried the two signature dishes - Steamed Chicken Momos and PanFried Noodles. The momos were served in a closed basket. This was unlike the paper boxes in which the other kiosks in the city serve momos. There were six momos in the basket, which were served with a spicy tomato ketchup and coriander chutney. The momos were very juicy and the stuffing of minced chicken was quite generous.

The Pan Fried Noodles had chicken chunks along with veggies like broccoli, zucchini, cauliflower, bell peppers, etc. I loved the mild flavour of the noodles and the juicy veggies. One can have it with or without any side dish, as per requirement. The portion size is perfect for a single person.

Every mall food court has a Chinese food kiosk, there is nothing out of the box in that. Also these kiosks share a weird similarity in their quality and quantity standards. It's hard to distinguish between them actually. Unless you come across some place which operates at a level that's a notch higher. Recently I came across 'China South' at Quest Mall food court and I realised that a food court eatery serving Oriental dishes can also blow your mind away!!

Their menu is not about Indian style Chinese cuisine, in fact it is totally different from that. Here you get a hint of typical South East Asian cuisine. On this visit, we played a bit safe though and ordered for Steamed Chicken momos and Chicken Pan Fried noodles. Next time I am sure to atleast try out their Chicken Sui Mai! 

Coming back to what I tasted, the chicken Momo's were served in typical bamboo basket/steamer which is only found in proper restaurants in Kolkata and you won't get this at any mall food court in the city. Along with that a spicy tomato sauce was served (not really a red hot garlicky momo dip I was looking for) and a coriander dip. The steamed momos were simply out of the world!! They were literally fantastic. They were extremely juicy and soft, with flavourful minced chicken, onion, coriander, garlic filling. I just felt that the filling can be made a tad more generous. But still I will come back to this place for these steamed momos. The chicken Pan Fried noodles was also very well prepared and had loads of diced exotic veggies in there like zucchini, broccoli, red and yellow bell peppers, etc. Overall a filling and comforting meal in the end that truly pleased our poor souls!

The service is pretty prompt out here and keeping the quality in mind, the prices are reasonable. I would rate this place 8.5 out of 10 and a big thumbs up from my side. After a long time I am impressed so much with a food court eatery, and that too in Kolkata! Surely do give it a try! 

Cheers!

Chinese eating restaurant's isn't anything of a difficult task these days to find them.However how much authenticity does a place holds up too in general eyes,probably the least and unknown ones.Now forget about restaurant's to do that part for a while and let's look at an different kind which works well too. The food counters of mall aren't any thing less in giving you what you want in the most fine way.China South situated at the food court of Quest Mall,Q Court is a place to visit to get those lip smacking oriental delicacies.I was invited here by First Idea Pr and i was involved in a tasting session which had Chicken Steam Momos and Chicken Pan Fried Noodles.To be real quick here on my verdict i would say the noodles had something not very impressive but just a good eat. The noodles were loaded with veggies and chicken pieces stir fried.Moving on to the Momos ,they were definitely juicy and full on delicious. I loved how the steamer basket looked loaded once it was open unlike other places which gives an eye wash .
Do try out even other takes from this place as a lot of options you get for satisfying the Chinese eating crave in you and ofcourse do try the ones i ate too 👍

They serve good chinese food.
What i liked the most here was the non veg mongolian they serve.
You can pick and choose vegetables as per your preference and they make it according to your taste.

Also the crispy chilli baby corn that they serve is satisfactory.

Having stayed in Delhi for 6 years, I always have craving for Crispy Chilly Potato. So I went ahead and ordered and I was disappointed.  It was very spicy,  there was a lot of green chillies and it was actually quite tasteless.  The noodles was quite bland too. The service was extremely slow and their billing machine stopped working and we had to just stand for 10-15 minutes staring.  They also don't announce that the order is ready or give time.

A great place in Quest Mall food court for Chinese lovers. It has a good spread on offer. I have eaten here twice. The food is delicious and so is the quantity. My favourite here is the Toss it up bowl as it gives you the choice of rice / noodles , the protein you want to choose, the veggies and also the way it should be prepared. 

I love their hot garlic sauce , it's moderately spiced and saucy with springy freshly made noodles. It tastes awesome and quantity is sufficient for 2. 

The pricing here is also quite reasonable. Would love to be here again.

A over hyped food joint located in Quest mall. The staff members are well behaved. After reading some of the reviews, I had a mixed feeling about this place and thought of checking it out. 
I had ordered Red Thai Curry, Green Thai Curry and Chicken Momo. 

Though only 6 pieces in quantity, the taste and quality of the momos were good. 
Red Thai Curry and Green Thai Curry were totally bland. I don't expect them to be spicy or something but they lacked every bit of flavouring. 

I have tried authentic Thai cuisine in many great places but these Red and Green Thai Curry were nowhere close to their taste. 
Needs improvement.

Tried veg Mongolian with lots of vegetables , wheat noodles  and sweet and spicy sauce.  The quantity was sufficient for 2 people.  The taste was simply amazing a must try for all the Mongolian lover. The only problem was with the choice of vegetable,  very limited,  there was no broccoli, mushroom or tofu .  people who prefer wheat over maida , nice place to eat for a change!!!

Should've reviewed it earlier..i wonder.. the best eating option of the all.. tried the non-veg combo meal.. you can choose between rice/noodles.. the quality and quantity are both worth the money.. its enough for 2 people and for starters you can have the crispy chili babycorn.. its meant to excite your taste buds..

Wonder why I never rated this place! Possibly the best eating option inside the quest food court. They serve Asian food and have a well planned menu!
I love their toss it up which is their rice or noodle bowl with veggies and sauce.
I go for noodles with garlic or schezwan sauce and a variety of veggies!
The portions are really good!
Also like their rice and side combo and their mushroom momos!
The food tastes amazing here!
The only negative is the rude staff who I tried to avoid on my visit at this kiosk.

A pretty good stop at the quest food court!

Had ordered a veg manchurian and veg fried rice as take away form this place yesterday evening..firstly they took a very long time to pack n gv d order dat too aftr making cpl of reminders..secondly d packaging was so badly done of d manchurian dat all of it spilled out of d flimsy foil container coz d paper lid was not attached firmly..thirdly d rice was raw which was shocking since they had taken so long to gv it..huge disappointment coz had paid 325/- for d two things which is certainly not cheap..quantity of manchurian was too less in comparison to rice..a special mention to d person manning d counter for being a little rough in his dealing towards me..he was more busy gossiping with his cook rather than pay more attention to his customers n orders i felt..wil not visit again.

Visited this place with my family.
We ordered some momos, we liked the way it was served.
Tough the taste of the momo was not up to the mark, we were expecting better.
It was dry from inside.

This belongs to my favourite among the many corners of Quest's food court. They do make amazing and delicious SiuMai and the pocket pinch is quite low. Among the range of SuiMais they offer I found their Prawn Suimais to be the best. Service is a little slow, but as Quest food court doesn't have much option for foodies China South is quite a relief for most of us.

Location: situated on the 3rd floor of Quest mall in Ballygunge, food court. 

There is no point of discussing about the interior designing as it is in food court so i will directly talk about the food and the service.

Food and the service: the lady behind the counter was actually very polite. However, i am very much disappointed with the food that they had served us. Being a chinese myself and moreover, a chef who is specialised in chinese cuisine, i was very much disappointed with the taste. It wasnt even tasting like a fusion of indo-chinese, but to be very brutally honest, it was terrible. The only reason why i decided to eat here was because my friend wanted to try it out but my guts told me not to. I should have listened to it.
We ordered:
• chicken siu mai: this one is the most disappointed dish of all. Not only was it small ( i think they made siu mai for cats, not for humans ), it had a very strong smell of fish. I just had one and decided not to have it any further. 
• mixed szechuan noodles: this one had no taste. I had to use the sauce provided for siu mai for more taste. Lack of salt as well.
• crispy fish in chilli honey sauce: it said crispy so i expected it to be crispy. Also, it said chilli so i expected it to be a little spicy. It was too sweet but it was much better than siu mai and noodles.
I also asked for cold mineral water. Maybe the lady forgot and gave me room temperature water, which i had to later exchanged.

Never gonna eat here again.

This is located in the food court of the quest mall.
The fusion of food makes the taste irresistible.

Toss it up veg
You get choose from noodles,spaghetti and to choose from the different veggies from broccoli,peas,corn ,baby corn,cabbage,chives,paneer,peppers and lots of more veggies seasonal.
And the final part they have three types of sauce in which they will toss up up noodles with the veggies.
Choose your favourite.
And trust me it's amazing.
Their are other dishes to try upon but go for this if u love noodles when ever u will visit Quest Mall.

Tried the non-veg combo meal from here.
Wantons were okay but very very little filling.
The Hakka noddles were not that good.
I found the vegetarian main better than the non-vegetarian main.
They have introduced wok to choose the ingredients yourself according to your preference now.

A great outlet to enjoy some really delicious authentic Chinese food, China South is located in the food court of Quest mall. The momos, sui mais, appetisers and soups are palate pleasing. The noodles, rice and main dishes are tasty, fresh and well made. Thai food is also available here. 
A unique service is the Toss It Up. You can choose your own toppings and sauces for a tasty stir fried hakka experience. This is the best place to eat in Quest. Service is quick and courteous. When you are hungry and pressed for time then a visit to this place can cheer you up.

This is the Asian food counter at the Quest Mall food court.

We took the 
toss it up veg : we chose flat noodles in sweet chilli sauce with fresh seasonal veggies. The turnout was yummy bowl of sweet chilli noodles perfectly cooked and tossed. Mushrooms were not available in the vegetable options for the toss it up. If that was there it would be perfect.

Crispy chilli baby corn: The baby corn was good. Some pieces were tasting a bit uncooked though.

Veg sui mai and momo: the best thing about these were the way they were served in cane steamer baskets. They were quite nice and fresh.

The food was really good but there was an issue with the staff at the counter. They both saying ask her or him to take the order in quite an unpleasant way. Would prefer better behaviour from them as despite good food my experience was not pleasant.

Located at food court in quest mall.......i. Went for dinner with a friend .
Ordered a plate of chowmin , chilly chicken and momos.
The quantity of chowmin is far from suffice for two person where as the pocket pinch is 170-180 
Even the chilly chicken wasn't enough for the price paid. 
Taste wise was okay nothing great . 
I will never go back.to that place . 
Price is exorbitant with comparison to the quantity and taste of food which is as normal as the food from a local joint .

This outlet is located at Quest mall food court. We wanted to have some spicy Chinese dishes so tried this outlet as there are very few options available at this food court. We had ordered spicy and crispy chicken. It costed Rs289 for one plate. When it arrived we were happy to see the quantity. But the happiness did not stay for a long time. It was nothing but spicy and crispy chicken without any chicken in it. The sauce was terrible. It had only three tastes- sour sour and sour. Horrible food!!

Fast service, belly warming food and good Asian flavors. China south is one of the busiest outlets at Quest Mall and for right reasons too.

Recently tried their schezwan hakka noodles, chilli chicken and sweet and spicy crispy chicken. While the first two items thoroughly pleased our tummies in the middle of a hectic shopping spree, the last one heavily disappointed.

Apart from that from that little bit of disappointment, the meal was satisfying.

This one is placed at the food court of QUEST MALL,Syed Amir Ali Abenue.
As with all other mall food courts,thus one also doesnot have any dedicated sitting arena,but you can grab a cozy corner on a sofa at the lounge area and feel quite comfy as the buzz of this food court is pretty nice.
This stall is small and menu is limited but I dined here quite a few times and it definitely beats most of the chienese eateries in Kolkata hands down.
I ordered chicken steamed momos,pan fried chicken noodles and schezwan chicken dry yesterday during my latest visit.And the momos are as usual soft,tender and juicy accompanied with a spicy and tangy momo sauce.The flour wrap of the momo is also not thick rather its thinner and that adds to the experience.The only hitch is the price is on the higher side condisering there are only six small sized  momos in one portion.
Pan fried chicken noodles has exotic vegetables like brocoli,red and  yellow capsicums and pokchois and garnished with boiled chicken sttips nd one can easily guess this is the most popular item on the menu since you will find most of people having this dish on their tables ! The noodles coupled with spicy schezwan chicken dry make a great combo.The schezwan chicken dry was also good and the chicken is tender and not super oily for a welcome change.Also the schezwan chicken came with the right amount of red chilli hotness,not over spicy as few of the other 'authentic' and popular chienese joints ☺.
Overall food is tasty and nice,ambience is OK but pricing is on higher side considering its not an individual dining restaurant but part of a mall food court and it has self service still a hefty service charge is billed.

People can misunderstand this place as just a mere food counter in a food court of a mall , but , it is way more than that . First of all it is in the food court of quest mall and is probably the best food court in kolkata and this place serves the best chinese food compared to other food counters at any mall . The only problem is it price which are a bit too much for a food court . Dont expect anything of a proper restaurant quality , after all it is just a food "counter" , but expect to be the best among the food "counters" .

This is located in the food court area of the Quest Mall which not only serves authentic Chinese food,  but also Mongolian food through the selection of your choices for veggies,  meats,  sauce and other spices . Although they could not manage to get an original huge size Mongolian tawa, but I appreciate that the cook tried his best to bring out the taste of authentic Mongolian noodles - which is a must try.

Authentic chinese joint in Quest mall at an affordable price. One of the best presentations i have ever seen for chinese dishes. Be it momos or hakka noodles or panfried noodles the garnishing is tempting enough to make you go crazy for those dishes. Less oily and less spicy food , full of yummy veggies makes the dishes lipsmacking and healthy. Quality of food is excellent.. A must try @ quest mall . Only thing that stops me from giving a 5 star is that , more chinese dishes should be included and combos , if introduced would surely win the crowd.. Apologies for not having any photos, as i was too busy cherishing the meal.. ;-)

Every time I visit Quest mall, I definitely go to this place. It is situated in the food court area of the mall. Veg noodles is my favourite but yesterday I tried their Veg momo, which was very authentic and tasty. It was very soft and just melted inside the mouth. The price was the only factor which bothered me (140+tax) for 6 pieces. Otherwise the experience was awesome.

Pleasantly surprised by this outlet in Quest Mall's food court. Good food and decent presentation which almost made me forget that I wasn't in a proper restaurant. We had the steamed Chicken Momo which came in its own basket. It was very light and just what we wanted. The Nonveg tossup was a customised dish where one could choose the type of noodles, meat, veggies and sauce. And it tasted just right. The crispy potato was also good though a bit too salty for my liking.

I had ordered stir fried Vegetables and they were made really bad n were absolutely raw,wen I gave my feedback to them n told them to make it properly he literally yelled at me saying this is how it is made and we won't do anything. I was over the phone as I had sent my staff to get it for me n kaushik Chatterjee told me come here n talk. He is a disgrace to the food chain as communication skills r the most important in any customer service Industry.

Located on 4th floor of quest mall in the food court. The place serves authentic Chinese food. I ordered for chili potatoes and vehlg noodles. Both were yummy. The chilli babycirn was crispy n tasty but mushroom momo. However it was nit good. I deduct points for two reasons... firstly it was crowded and they had shortage of manpower and secondly they were unable to serve some items.

One of my favorite Chinese joint. I have visited uncountable times.
Location: food court of quest mall.
Food: I love their mixed panfried gravy noodle. Juz amazing.
The momos they serve are equally good. Momos comes in a bamboo momo maker box.. Hot and juicy.
One special item is 'toss it up'. You can mix your choice of noodls or rice with toppings in your favorite sauce. It can be great if u choose wisely.
All foods are delicious and will give a awsum feel good factor if u r a Chinese good lover.
Portions are also quite good.
Price is relevant for d quality of food.
Overall experience: staffs are helpful. They serve with good hygiene. Unlike other food court stall their cutleries are of fine fine quality. Theirs a small view through the kitchen which is equally clean. Overall nice experience. @I will keep visiting.

Took take away here. 'Toss it up' make your own noodles- amazing, not because it was my choice, but quantity as well. Hakka noodles and fried rice were your usual ones, didn't disappoint. Manchurian balls were nice though gravy could have been better. Spring rolls were really oily. Chopsuey was a let down . the staff repacked to my liking and heated it well enough that even after 20 mins in an AC car, back home we didn't have to heat it before eating

Located in the Food Court of Quest Mall, this China South outlet is quite well of its kind. 
Last evening me and three of my friends were hanging out in Quest Mall as I had some shopping to do. After all shop-hopping, we decided to had some food. I was on my cravings for Momos. Found China South, and had ordered one plate of Veg MoMo and a plate of Chicken Momo. 
Coming to the food, the Momos were served in jute baskets with a banana leaf inside. The Veg Momos were round dumpling-shaped. The Chicken Momos were normal regular shaped. Along with the momos were provided a red sweet-spicy chutney and a green chutney which were good taste enhancers.
The momos were quite decent emough in taste, juicy, chicken and the veggies were well cooked and soft. Tasted well overall.

A mall can not survive without a Chinese food outlet and for Quest, it is China South. It may be a food court outlet, but you would be surprised to see what they can give you in fifteen minutes- be it a plate of simple steamed dumplings or a full combo meal.

Location: food court, Quest Mall. A bit away from Frozen Yogurt.

Food: combo meal here would be a wiser option than availing items individually.

Combo meals come with:
*a portion of vegetable salad.
*steamed rice- fluffy and light.
*main course- soya sauce smothered in your choice of protein
*wanton
*soft drink of your choice

Management: staff here is more or less helpful. Service is fast. Pretty much what you would expect in a food court joint.

I always attempt to eat here whenever I'm visiting the quest mall food court. I always have their crispy chilli baby corn due to the intense garlic flavour in it. This time I tried a non vegetarian toss it up and chicken momos. The momos were cooked and shaped well, but the filling was less in quantity. The toss it up was also good , with schezwan sauce , but it was a bit sweet and was not really spicy. The prawn and chicken in it were overboiled , so the chicken was rubbery and prawns were too soft. The fish was cooked well. The prices are elevated for a normal food court , but the food is good and worth a try.

Food court was always crowded but they still manage to serve you good quality Chinese in reasonable time. Must say they made brilliant quality hygienic and delicious Chinese cuisine and affordable price. We ordered toss it up veg in rice with added all the vegetables and medium spicy sauce. It was perfect in all the manner. Price was affordable, quality was superb, quantity of rice and vegetables are large and most importantly taste was brilliant. Must say i never had this quality rice bowl before. It was mouth watering and heavenly delicious. We also tried crispy chilly babycorn which was crispy and very tasty but need tobe little more spicy. Superb experience here. Must try place. Highly recommended for toss it up.

A decent budget friendly eating joint in the food court of quest mall.I had toss it up noodles with a mix of schezwan and hot and garlic sauce teaming it up with sweet and sour chicken on the side. The noodles were amazing and very healthy with so many veggies and on the other side I found the shredded sweet and sour chicken to be a little overcooked and burnt which made it very hard and too chewy. All in all, food is decent and it has the must try noodles where one bowl of it can serve two people easily.

A nice budget restaurant located on the food court of the Quest Mall. Have been here for a couple of times. Service is prompt and food tastes good. Since this is the only Chinese option in Quest Mall, unless you want to go for an expensive restaurant inside the mall this one is big time crowd puller.

One of the many Chinese Restaurants spread all across the city, the only edge I can think of for this joint is the wonderful location which is at the Food Court of Quest Mall. 
After a nice shopping day, it's nice to go to the food court and have the option of trying Chinese food amongst the many other variety of options available. 
However, the food here to is just nice. There is barely any dish that can be given a noteworthy mention. I have tried the Drums of Heaven, which was a nice dish. It had good flavours but nothing wow about it! 
Then we had the Pepper something Prawns and Chicken Fried Rice. Again, the rice was nice but it definitely did not have me going crazy about it. 
Perhaps the nicest of the lot were the Prawns. I love prawns so I really won't complain. Plus the flavours worked quite well together. 
I haven no idea why I bother to order American Chopsuey. Not that it wasn't a good dish, I just don't like to eat sweet while having savoury. The Chopsuey had a nice taste but it just didn't go down my throat after being halfway through. 
So all in all, the place is an okay dining option and since the prices are acceptable (maybe a teeny bit high if I be too critical). I would recommend this place but only if you are through with the other places at the food court.

Food courts at shopping malls never impressed me much as they are too pricey and serve average food. This one at Quest mall is no different to the others, much more expensive if not anything else. This review is just for one item they serve, very aptly named- Toss It Up!
The dish consists of rice or flat noodles tossed in a range of veggies and non veg items of ur choice and served hot right out of the wok. My favourite is the non veg variant (obviously) where u get ample amount of fish, chicken and prawn all tossed together with rice along with veggies of my choice. All the goodness in one bowl and quantity sufficient for two (or one very hungry soul).
It is a better version of mixed fried rice. Added advantage of customising it to your liking. No side dish required. Recommended.
P.s.: I have had Chicken drumsticks here also. Good in taste but too small in quantity.

It is the only Chinese joint in Quest mall food court. It serves average food with exorbitant prices. Toss it up seemed to be a new option with lot of choices. It was visually deceptive, though the taste dint meet my expectations. Despite my clear instructions for the food to be medium spicy, it turned out to be extremely spicy. As a result, my friend suffered an upset stomach. The good thing was the quantity as one portion can easily suffice two. The dish was abundant in veggies, chicken, prawn and fish. Had the sauce been good to our taste bud and stomach, i would have given far better rating.

I have always ordered their chicken pan fried noodles. Though I am very fond of the taste of their pan fried noodles, I feel disappointed as they dont include mushrooms in this dish. Pan fried noodles should have ample pieces of babycorn and mushrooms in it. I didnt get it why they avoid putting mushrooms in the dish. I have heard that the suimai here is very tasty. Planning to try it on my next visit. Quantity provided is quite less when the price is taken into consideration.

Visited this outlet today and as usual, the service staff was extremely rude. He didn't care for queues and acted like he doing us a favour by taking the food orders. I didn't care much for his snotty attitude  (he should be reminded that the place serves mediocre chinese food from a hole in the wall, not delicate french food from an upscale restaurant ) and thus took my business elsewhere. Mall management should take note and upgrade the service quality.

Though not a full fledged restaurant but still this place runs like a pro on the third floor of Quest mall. Food is served nice and hot which is especially good. I have been there with my love and have enjoyed their food. Menu is very limited though. On every visit i land up ordering the same old stuff as there's not much choices. But even with the limited menu ppl still enjoy their food. Prices are neither too steep nor too reasonable given the quantity of the noodles. I would suggest them to increase the quantity a tad bit so that ppl will not feel the pinch of paying that much and get fully satisfied with the quantity and quality of food. Rest there's nothing much to say as the tables are all common for everyone.

Very disappointed with this outlet situated in the food court of Quest Mall. The service was too slow. Moreover they had numbered orders but didn't seem to be following it which was very irritating. When we ordered the going number was 22 and we were happy because we were 25  thinking we needn't wait for long. Oh! How mistaken we were! They came to 24 and skipped 25. Went up to 30 and then came to our number 25 without any explanation! There is a glass pane and one can view a part of the kitchen and see the chefs at work. Cleanliness and hygiene was maintained. The food too was not up to the mark....schewan Hakka noodles was too oily. The veggies too weren't good.

Supposedly the best place to order from from the quest food court. 
The momo's are a must try. They are great. 
Drums of heaven were also good. Loved the sweet corn soup. The pan fried fish was too dry. 
Not much to say about the ambiance but the service is very fast. A full course meal will take them 5/7minutes to prepare. 
Thumbs up.

I guess the common item ordered from their menu is the noodles. Me and my mom had their MIXED HAKKA NOODLES in the evening. Thank God we didn't have it for lunch or dinner cos the quantity is abysmal, especially for 235/-.

Not that the quality was any better. Excessive use of oil; and the prawns were not clean.

Sad to see that food court outlets of posh malls only keep their prices considering the crowd and pay no heed to the quality.

Will reluctantly try other items later on hoping to have a better experience.

The chicken rice was not good. It was only rice and just that.... You need to look hard for tit-bits of chicken... :( (I am  a chicken lover.. So the obvious disappointment)
Coming to the Schzwan Chicken- it tasted like someone has prepared the dish with a few pieces of shreded chicken, on a bowl of water containing maggi tastemaker and tomato sauce. Ohh... It also had a few pieces of what we Bengali's call gandharaj lebur pata!! :D
And don't even ask how much such disappointment to my taste buds cost me. :(

Mixed schezwan noodles and sliced chicken on black bean sauce..... the noodles was great... but the chicken was little salty.... staffs are very well behaved.... service as pretty fast.... pocket pinch was high.... next time I will try there " Toss it up" for sure....

Hi friends , I would like to share an experience with an employee of 'Quest Mall ' . This young man aged between 25- 30 years who calls himself the manager of the food court spoke with such rudeness to a lady that too a senior citizen over a complaint of the pathetic food served by 'China South ' a unit of Global Kitchens (Kolkata ) LLP. It's a shame that 'Quest' is employing such I'll mannered people who fail to be courteous and respectful towards customers forget customers towards people the age of their parents. This man argued with the lady and mentioned that he din care if she went to the consumer forum to complain about the food. I am mentioning this to ask everyone to stand against bad behaviour. We might have turned old but we at no cost hav lost our dignity. One should not be too proud of the position one holds treating a human being well is all that matters. Learn some manners young man.

Also plz dnt parcel anything from china South d food is too salty waste of money.

Very good food and very fresh food and Chinese food not the typical masala Indian Chinese food. The chicken mom's are really good its filled with chicken and not onion. The price is a bit high for being a food court type food but I would still go back and pay cause its top quality food and they don't sting on the proportions. Keep it up China South.

The chicken rice was not good. It was only rice and just that.... You need to look hard for tit-bits of chicken... :( (I am  a chicken lover.. So the obvious disappointment)
Coming to the Schzwan Chicken- it tasted like someone has prepared the dish with a few pieces of shreded chicken, on a bowl of water containing maggi tastemaker and tomato sauce. Ohh... It also had a few pieces of what we Bengali's call gandharaj lebur pata!! :D
And don't even ask how much such disappointment to my taste buds cost me. :(

Good place for having Chinese food in the food court... its very tough to maintain consistency for a kiosk like that on such a busy food court.... they decorated the kiosk pretty good.... I have there foods before and I liked it.... today I ordered for take away.... Mixed schezwan noodles and sliced chicken on black bean sauce..... the noodles was great... but the chicken was little salty.... staffs are very well behaved.... service as pretty fast.... pocket pinch was high.... next time I will try there " Toss it up" for sure....

Hi friends , I would like to share an experience with an employee of 'Quest Mall ' . This young man aged between 25- 30 years who calls himself the manager of the food court spoke with such rudeness to a lady that too a senior citizen over a complaint of the pathetic food served by 'China South ' a unit of Global Kitchens (Kolkata ) LLP. It's a shame that 'Quest' is employing such I'll mannered people who fail to be courteous and respectful towards customers forget customers towards people the age of their parents. This man argued with the lady and mentioned that he din care if she went to the consumer forum to complain about the food. I am mentioning this to ask everyone to stand against bad behaviour. We might have turned old but we at no cost hav lost our dignity. One should not be too proud of the position one holds treating a human being well is all that matters. Learn some manners young man.

Also plz dnt parcel anything from china South d food is too salty waste of money.

Very good food and very fresh food and Chinese food not the typical masala Indian Chinese food. The chicken mom's are really good its filled with chicken and not onion. The price is a bit high for being a food court type food but I would still go back and pay cause its top quality food and they don't sting on the proportions. Keep it up China South.

Went for shopping at Quest Mall and some exchange. Not planning for a lavish and luxurious eating out, we decided to go to the food court which is conducted by the Global Kitchens. Had tried their food earlier but didn't take photos to put up a review. It's an average rated Chinese restaurant. The 'Toss It Up' they serve is the best part of their menu. We tried it. We went for the non veg bowl. We ordered a mixed bowl with chicken, fish and prawns in mixed sauce. It is cheap compared to the one available at the Kolkata Airport. But the prawns were a bit stinky. And the vegetable options are less than those available at the Food Boulevard in the airport. The taste was good otherwise. We also took a plate of Crispy Prawn Pepper Salt. The prawns were crispy, there was ample amount of pepper. But I think they forgot to put in some salt. So, it was okay. It's not a must visit place but when you don't want to spend thousands at the other expensive eateries in Quest, this is what comes you to rescue. Happy Dining! :)

The food was quite oily. The prawns starter I ordered was undercooked. Fish was good. Crispy chicken starter was too chewy. I ordered the do it yourself rice in black bean sauce. It was too oily and there was no balance in its flavours. They themselves mentioned that black bean sauce isn't very good at their place. Overall it was a disappointment.

This joint in Quest Mall is good. The food is good.. Courteous staff... Price is little high but quality is there.... I had visited the place many a times and have always had there Toss it up (Mongolian) they keep all veggies n all look fresh... I was shocked to see that they don't serve fried noodles with Manchow Soup... On asking about the same the staff said as the noddles become soggy they have stopped serving... I mean how can fresh fried noodles become soggy...

But during the weekend when theres too much chaos the quality of food seems to go down. Today i had babycorn and Chicken Siu Mai .. Ive had this in the past as well .. But it was a complete disappointment .

Situate in the food court 4th floor of Quest mall, this one serves delicious Oriental dishes, their menu is quite good and among the various combinations of noodles and stir fries available, the best among the lot is The " toss It Up" combo where one can select his her choice of veggies, sauces and rice/noodles!  The staff is quite fast and over all the taste is quite savouring!

Situated in the food court  of quest mall. In quest mall there are only 2 options for Chinese food this one and other Yauatcha, if you don't want to spend a lot of money in Yauatcha then China south is the only option. When we see any restaurant in a food court, general impression this must be very regular. But this restaurant is different. It can compete with lots of Chinese restaurant in city. I am really impressed with ingredients they are using. Suimai are freshly prepared and taste was just amazing. Make my noodles with black been sauce was very good. Chicken pan fried noodles was very good too, they used almost all exotic vegetables available in india. We also ordered pan fried chilli fish. The fish was very fresh but this item was little higher side of salt.

I would surely visit this restaurant again when not in a mood to spend my money in Yauatcha 😉

I have just tried one dish from this place and it simply won my heart. Crispy fish in chili honey sauce is a must try from this place. The fish was fresh, not stinky, crispy from outside and soft from inside. It melted in my mouth. The sauce had generous amount of honey to balance the taste. Overall it had a nice hot and sweet taste. Not the typical taste that we get to taste from most chinese food joints. Really impressed.
I am so looking forward to try other dishes from this place before I leave Kolkata.

When you are just up for some quick chinese food in Quest Mall, China South is the best option. you get a variety of food items here and though I have dined just two times from the China South I really liked their food. Once we had the steam chicken momos which they serve in these bamboo baskets which was really cute 😁 then when we tasted them they melted in our mouths so yummmy. The other time we had a combo meal the options were different, where we chose noodles, fish in mains ,salad, a chicken appetiser and coke and because the bill came above 500 they gave us a choclate pastry free as dessert. We were so happy for the free dessert and the fish was really good.

If there was a momo heaven on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this!!! The most succulent, tasty, dripping of butter both on the outside and inside, large and filling momos I have ever tasted. I don't remember how an authentic Tibetian or Sikkim momos taste like... But this has been taken to another level! I could eat these momos everyday...my whole life!!! I almost become a greedy gluttony child when I stand in front of their shop and see the chefs preparing the momos from the glass pane looking through the kitchen. My cousin and I are it's biggest fans and shamelessly we stuff our faces with two plates each of sheer bliss!
The pan fried noodles are good too... So are the other side dishes... All in all I could live off that oozing chicken momo! I wish they would include pork momos and side dishes as well!

Located in the food court of Quest Mall and perhaps the only outlet offering south east Asian cuisine(Chinese/Thai) in quest mall. Though Quest also hosts the popular luxury Asian restaurant "Yauatcha" on 5th floor. But in a pocket friendly sense"China South" stands out among the crowd and is frequented by the foodies with Chinese cravings.

We all know how much We(Calcuttans) love and swear by Chinese foods and this fact is proven by the uncountable number of Chinese restaurants located like mushrooms in every nook and corner of the city.
But when it comes to Chinese and other south east Asian cuisine there is much more to look out for rather than those conventional dishes like-(chilli chicken, Manchurian, Hakka/greavy noodles and fried rice). Chinese is a vast and distinguished cuisine and has a lot more to offer to our pallete.
This is where "China South" tried to capitalize and has been their USP, which is working out pretty well.
They offer a decent and voluminous variety of Chinese and Thai dishes.
Ranging from the conventional and evergreen ones like- Manchurian, chilli chicken, rice, noodles etc; to sumptuous salads and enticing appetizers like drums of heaven, paneer chilli rolls etc; to succumbing main courses like- salt & pepper chicken, chicken in black bean sauce, red Thai curry chicken, sliced fish with mushroom and Chinese green, three treasure vegetables, american choupseys, stir fried exotic vegetables.
"Momos", another vastly popular dish in Kolkata is also served by them, but with sheer dedication. The momos are freshly prepared after placing the order and are served in a circular wooden casserole. The outer coating of their momos are so light which let's you see the fillings/stuffings inside. It is damn sumptuous and succulent from the very first bite and does really pampers your taste buds.
They also let's you choose and assemble your main staple(rice/noodles) according to your choice and also let's you choose your favorite- veggies, sauces, toppings and the MODE of preparation (pan fried, saute, tossed) which is named as "Toss It Up". Something which I personally enjoyed doing. It let's you experiment with your dish and helps you enjoy your favorite Chinese dishes with a different and interesting twist of taste.
Along with ala carte menu items, they also have attractive "meal package" options both for veg and non-veg at attractive rates, which let's you unwind your Chinese cravings without having to make a hole in your wallet.
The portions served by them are sufficiently decent enough for a famished soul.
Just beside the cash counter, is the "Kitchen" covered with transparent glass, which let's you peep at the complete procedure of preparation of your ordered dish, all the way from the Wok to your table.
The chefs in the kitchen are fabulously experienced with tremendous culinary expertise which oozes out reflects on every dish prepared by them.
The staffs behind the counter are also very courteous and leaves no stones unturned in satisfying your every query and manages the crowd quite smoothly.
Overall "China South" is one of those rare places in Kolkata serving authentic "Gourmet" Chinese and Thai cuisine in an affordable rate.
So if you have a weakness towards Chinese food and would like to enjoy some authentic Chinese dishes beyond those conventional items as I mentioned before but do not want to spare too much amount of money by visiting restaurants like(Mainland China, Chinoiserie, Zen, Pan Asian or Yauatcha) then "China South" is the perfect place for you to be.

The first time I tried this place I really liked it. I had gone for the toss it up thing. It was prepared really well with all my choice of veggies and sauce. I was so impressed. The quantity was really really good and I had to pay only 200 bucks. However, the quantity and price is having an inverse change. The quantity is decreasing and the price is increasing and somewhere round the corner I see the degradation in quality as well. I tried another dish too which was super bland. This place seriously needs to know where it is going wrong.

Okay so this place is also situated inside Quest Mall food court and is always always busy and crowded, people seem to like to their food a lot. Being the only place inside the food court which serves South East Asian food people can't get enough of it. 
Their set Chinese meals and their steamed momos are good to taste but honestly I have had better, they are nothing out of this world. Compared to the other places inside the food court this one is definitely more expensive than the rest but what I really really really really dislike about this place is their STAFF. They are rude, obnoxious and have this "we care a damn" attitude. 
Once my cousin and I were about to order and my cousin suddenly changed her mind about the dish she was about to order and asked for something else the person behind the counter who was taking the order actually went ballistic like a psycho! 
He actually chided us and asked us to make up our minds! 
What the hell? What kind of attitude is that? Only because my cousin instead of a meal asked for something else he was like "lady make up your mind and be fast", he was supremely impatient. Even when our order was ready, he said it would take 15 minutes and we came back after the designated time so again he was showing temper regarding why we didn't check back earlier because supposedly the food was lying on the counter for sometime. 
If  people like this run a place I am sorry I can't imagine to give good rating to a place even with decent food. 
Doesn't work for me. Not recommended, there are better places to eat in quest mall, skip this one if possible. Really bad service, the management should be embarrassed about their staff.

I was having some Chinese cravings and so thought of trying out the food here. I had ordered chicken momo and I just had no complaints at all. The momo was served in a basket. It was very tender, the skin was nice and thin. I actually loved the taste. Their are very few places that make good momo and trust me this is one of them. The wait time is about 10 minutes.

This is a small outlet in the food court at the quest mall. I do not know where the restaurant is. However that's not required, this is a good enough joint. Coming to the food, the soups are nice. The price will stump you, but only initially, as I think the quantity justifies it. Another good dish with them is their toss it up. It lets you select from noodles/rice, choice of veggies and sauces. Basically freedom to choose what you'd put in you version of noodles /rice. It's brilliantly made, once you've chosen your ingredients. The sauces are all on the spicy side so pls avoid it if you're not comfortable with it. Beyond that the main course and the noodles are good. Then again I'd like to reiterate that the prices are steep and the quantity tries to justify the price. It is a part of the food court and its good enough to sit and have food there. The dimsums, I hear are good. Since I've not had them so I'll not be able to get more accurate than this.

Have a great meal. Enjoy!

It's a must try for Chinese lovers......
I've tried its mushroom momos which are served in a  bamboo steamer....
The noodles' quantity is less but the taste is very nice.
It's specialty is the no. Of choices of the type of noodle, sauces, veggies. Which is different!

Not upto the mark at all. We went for the non veg combo which included choice of fried rice/noodles, prawn wafers, chicken manchurian, a veg item and a glass of pepsi. The food was very oily and the taste of the less oily items was not good and we really had difficulty finishing the food. Definitely over priced. The portions were not too great either. Very disappointed.

This restaurant is a part of the food court in Quest Mall. The food is pretty good here. If you come here, dont try the conbos. I did not like it. Its very average. Something which u will taste every where. The chicken in the combo is pretty bad.
I tried the "Toss It Up". This is what they call the Mongolian style of cooking noodles. You can make it ur own way. They ask u ur choice of vegetables, along with ur choice of sauce( hot garlic/ Szechuan). You can keep it vegetarian, or add chicken, prawn, egg into it and make it non veg. The Veg is 250 and non Veg is 310. This is really filling for one. 2 people can share along with some side dish.
Combo costed be 350. It is sufficient for 1.
Cost of 2 people : 660 ( including tax).

Affordable and surprisingly  delicious for a food court outlet.The momo's,suimai and the crispy chicken starter are really good.The chicken in black bean sauce is yum,do try it.Cant vouch for the vegetarian menu but the non vegetarian fare is worth it.Minus points for non availability of certain dishes on crowded days and the limited menu.Plus points are the good service,efficiency of staff and being easy on the wallet.

First time trying dining in the food court of Quest mall, being a chinese lover, went straight to china south. 
Half the menu not available at 7:30pm. startled.managed to order crispy chicken, chopsuey, hakka noodles, and fried rice. 
Crispy chicken was tooo crispy to find any chicken while chewing. Disappointing. The chopsuey was good and wholesome and had lot of veggies and hicken , the only highlight. The chicken hakka was too spicy unnecessarily and we found it a bit under-cooked. the fried rice was too plain , not much veggies, only chicken bits with spring onion and loads of pepper salt, killed the taste. Had heard it was good but beg to differ. next time in quest i will stick to chilis again :)

Just visited this place yesterday- on Christmas. So, yes, I am taking into account that it was very crowded, there was a long queue but I was not happy at all. Waited for 15 mins to place my order. When my turn came, I was told that they dont have a Veg combo available, then i asked for Veg Pan fried rice that was unavailable too. I asked for "Toss it up" and was told that it will take 30 mins. So finally, I settled for Veg Schezuan Noodles. They came merrily after 20 mins and were not upto the mark. Also, the person taking the orders was not too polite- very offhand attitude.  So a bad experience over all.

The only thing i've tried is the "Toss It Up' where they literally toss up whatever ingredients you choose. There are 3 types of noodles to choose from , around 10 types of vegetables which include mushroom , baby corn, sweet corn, peas, beans, carrots, tofu , spring onions, onions, shallots, cabbage, lettuce, chillies etc. You decide how much you want of each thing. Its a lot of fun putting it together as well. The best part is you can choose to add chicken, fish and prawns as well. ( if you opt for the non vegetarian option). There is a selection of 3 sauces which you can choose from this includes- Black bean, Chilli Garlic and schezwan. All the goodness comes at the nominal price of Rs 275 or so and it can be comfortably divide among two friends. (no side dish required).

The dough.. The filling.. The greasing of that olive oil.. Well its juz amazing.. U get stuff like that in mainland china.. U seriously dnt expect dat from a kiosk in a mall.. It was worth it.. We ordered spring rolls and drums of heaven.. The sauce was pretty good in drums of heaven.. But the spring rolls.. Errrr.. Was likely.. I mean when u deliver momos like that.. U bring up expectations.. But it wasn't up to the mark.. There was more oil inside than the filling.. Needs to be balanced.. Sooo.. I wud give it a 4.. As it also pocket friendly..

Enjoyed it very much along with the dips served.......but equally the chicken hakka noodles was a total disappoint. The taste was totally bland. The serving time was okay.

The con side of Durga Puja is: If you are stuck with a stipulated budget, it is very hard to find space in a descent restaurant without losing all your sweat off!!Hence I came up to the quest mall and was delightfully surprised!! The food court is very cozy with international standard decor, numerous seats where you can sink in and spacious at the same time! China South was targeted to please my taste buds and it did a commendable job! My order was Drums of heaven and to my surprise though it is just a food counter at a mall, the food served was perfect! The taste was perfect and can give any descent restaurant a healthy competition! I would like to suggest this place to the fellow readers!

Never expect the food from food court to be as good as the proper restaurants but the food court of Quest turned out to be a little better than scm! 

Had a combo non veg meal from China South yesterday. Ignoring the initial disappointments of a 30 minutes wait even though they claimed a 10 minutes wait initially and the 'mistake' of noodles even though we ordered fried rice, the food is not bad otherwise. 

The wantons and vegetarian side dish were delicious. However, I did not exactly like the chicken in szechwan sauce very much since it had a little overdose of salt.  A did not complain though. The proportions are generous. We had no choice in aerated drinks and all they served was Mirinda. I think it is the Puja time rush that caused the glitches. 

Not bad at all otherwise.

In 3rd floor in Quest mall. You can see the kitchen - i liked the momo/dumpling setup. Momos and siu mais were good. 
These items are in mega demand, we just got the ones in the last lot for that moment. The next customers would have to wait, the chef announced :)

Fried rice was ok... and the noodles was just done. Nothing to try again.

Fish with chinese veg tastes good.

willl try for momos again..

A lovely place to catch Chinese food....i went to this place on a Saturday after my mom's office and chicken Hakka noodles,sweet and sour crispy chicken fry ,a Chinese soup and a Thai soup. The chicken fry was awesome, the sauce being great. The Chinese soup was tasty but the Thai was disgusting as it was just a reduction with lots of lemon grass with weird tasting mushrooms. The noodles were seasoned well unlike some noodles but it had very less quantity of chicken bit a lot of egg.
It is a good place to catch being under budget. We ordered three noodles,two plate fries,and two soups which was enough for 4 people costing us 950

Well,I have rated this at 3.5 as I havn't tried much of their food.
But overall I am in love with their non veg toss it up,this has been on my list in my recent visits to the mall.Some might feel its a little overpriced,but the food makes up. However,on different days the amount of noodles and your choice of add-ons might differ drastically depending on the person serving it for you. That is a real letdown because some times they take so much of noodles in the bowl that little space is left for the rest and you might end up with a lot of noodles with little add ons into it. Other than this their sliced fish with mushrooms and chinese greens tastes really good and is served piping hot. Hope to try out the other items on their menu soon..

Taken food from there twice..since again..I love Chinese food :D
Its a food take out counter at Quest Mall Food court. 
First time I ordered for Mixed Hakka Chowmin. The presentation of food was really nice and then the taste was really good. I liked it .
Today I ordered one Chicken and capsicum Szechwan Momo platter. It was steam one. Though I am not much of Momo fan because I can't distinguish between types of momo very well...specially the steam ones.
anyway..it tasted good...but I loved the way they served in a bamboo covered container with a banana leaf.Wow ! I mean wherever I at least had momo..they never gave in such fashionable manner. I gave all my points on the presentation. ha ha ! But anyway...cost was Rs. 150 for momo and Rs 150 for chowmin also... Its definitely worth it.

Happy eating guys ! :)

I went to this place with my mom and two of my Aunts. we had chicken noodles with sweet and sourcrispy fried chicken and two soups... A Thai soup and a Chinese hot soup.......
Pros...
1. Nice noodles with thick strands and good amount of chicken and other veggies and egg too.....
2.I recommend everyone who goes there to try there hot and sweet crispy chicken. they are so yummy that you will that it's better than tangra's Chinese.....
Cons
1. the Thai soup tasted  like plain Bengali chicken curry's diluted version with overpowering lemon grass and raw broccolis and mushrooms
2. our was a bulk order and it took more than 25 minds to get the order
Overall it was as good dining experience and Pocket friendly... The bill for 2 soups, 2 chicken noodles, 2 sweat and sour crispy fries and a parcel of one noodles was only 966

The service is really quick and even the parcels have a huge quantity.

I had ordered two Egg Noodles to be packed, and the quantity is HUGE. If you order one plate, make sure you have skipped a meal beforehand. There's nothing extraordinary about the noodles, though it is really tasty and the noodle strands are a little thicker than you usually get and yes, another plus point would be the absence of tons and tons of cabbage leaves, which is usually a "staple" in Kolkata's Chinese. The Szechwan Noodles were very hot and I won't recommend it to people who aren't used to chillies. I have also tried the Sweet n Sour Crispy Fried Chicken, which is just awesome. At 150 bucks, it is worth your expectations. The moment I put a spoonful of the Kurkure-like strands of chicken, there was a burst of sweetness and sourness, one after the other. Add to it the succulent shredded chicken. Pure bliss. Enough for a meal. My friends had tried out the Mango Chicken, which they said was a total wastage of money. 

Wish to visit this place more frequently in the coming months...

China South is my absolute favorite when it comes to dining in Quest Mall. The rates are surprisingly low and the food was  good every time. I have tried chicken lollipops, different types of noodles, dim sums, soups. Only was disappointed a bit with the non veg combo, which was served cold and they could have done better job at compiling it. Apart from this this food stop can't be better. The best place to eat after shopping in the mall. I would definitely recommend to try this spot

The other day I happened to pack a Chicken Hot n Sour Soup and was very pleased with the taste while we sat home consuming it. Based on it, I recommended the place to my wife for lunch this afternoon. We decided to try the Non-Veg combo meal and as it sounded good, we ordered two, one with rice and one with noodles. Food was served rather quickly, since they have it already in stock.

Soon everything just turned on its head. The meal consisted of:

1. Two Chicken Fried Wantons. Just passable, served almost cold. Hardly any filling. Vague slightly creamy taste.

2. Two Prawn Papads. You cannot really go wrong with these.

3. Khimchi. It was as good or as bad at it can be. No comments.

4. Pepsi. Small serving. Reasonably okay in taste in terms of strength.

5. Veg Fried Rice / Chow Mein. The Chow was not up to the mark at all. Very tasteless, and probably been made long back. The Fried rice seemed fresher, and had a buttery taste, but did not quite have the Chinese flavour to it. Add to it it contained corn and peas!!! I mentioned it to the chef and his excuse was it was the demand. If they give in to such silly demands so easily, they don't earn my respect.

6. Vegetable Manchurian. This tasted like crunchy uncooked vegetables were just dipped in a sauce and served. The sauce was quite cornfloury, and had oil and some spice. Bad news!

7. Chilly Chicken. Three chicken pieces in gravy, The gravy was once again very watery and distant to the taste. The chicken, though not spoilt tasted weird... never had chicken batter fried in that manner. It was not right.

Almost all of it was served not hot enough. I made a noise and they reserved it, with much of the stuff still on the colder side. I suppose their a-la-carte items would taste better.

Another surprise was the bill. They charge a 5% service charge. Never seen that in a self service place, I questioned them about it and they said it was as decided by the mall authorities. Must check the other stalls.

All in all a pretty bad experience. Not worth the Rs 225 charged per meal, especially when you consider the quality. Watch what you eat here.

So my review is depending absolutely on the spring roll I ordered when I was in quest mall. 
The spring roll was crispy and the veg fillings were great as well. And ah, the plate they used was pretty too ! :D
The staffs serving at the counter are polite and humble too. 
The menu is pretty decent absolutely diff from what the usual food courts provide.. A little deeper and more Chinese if I may put in. 
I really wanna try out their main course dishes too! Really looking forward to it! <3

Most tasteless food. Definitely not a good place to visit if you want good food. The quality is absolute rubbish, but the plus point ( as if it matters when the food is rubbish) the staff is extremely polite and helpful.

Ordered rice, fish and dimsums. Saw orange chicken and got really excited. Sadly after I ordered it I wished I hadn't seen it. Maybe its me, but when ever I think orange chicken I think shiny glistening crispy balls of joy coated with orangey  goodness. We got boring chicken in orange marmalade gravy. Sigh. The rice, the fish and the dimsum were nice. The fish was really nice. but sigh, all I remember was the sad orange chicken!

ChinaSouth – A good kiosk to order Indo-Chinese food when planning to visit the food court of Quest Mall, Park Circus. 
===================================================================
Brief: 

I had been to Quest today with one of my friend and had ordered a corn capsicum momo as a starter and planned to move on to other food kiosks to try different other dishes too. As I am an ardent lover of Momo’s or you can call them dim sums, I love to try out various places in Kolkata to get the right one for myself. 
===================================================================
Food: 

I had just ordered one plate veg corn capsicum momo. The momo was served in the Bamboo steamer the usual one and had banana leaf below the six hot, melting, sizzling, steaming, mouth watering, jaw dropping and smoking momo.  As I picked up one of the piece, it was greased in a lot of oil. However, it was tender on the outside and smoky hot inside with specially heating corns. I dipped it in the spicy sauce, which they usually serve with the momo and darrnn!!!! It was amazing. So vegetarians, you can try this momo if you are bored of the usual Momo’s, which you get in the various shops/kiosks in the city of joy. I loved their preparation. The momo cost was 125 bucks. I think as per the mall standards, its okay. However, just a little request from my side would be to just decrease the oil content used for greasing. 
===================================================================
Pros: -

o	Outstanding Momo Presentation.
o	Reasonably prices as per Mall standards.
o	Impeccably Hygienic. 
o	Momo quantity was fair enough. 
o	Momo quality was good especially the skin of the steamed Maida was too soft n thin. 
o	Indian taste friendly. 
o	My momo got ready in 10 minutes. Promptness of Service is seen right here. 
o	Served Hot.

Cons: - 
o	The pieces were much on oil. However, very tasty. 


===================================================================
Summary:

Momo presentation 4/5
Momo quality 4/5
Momo quantity 4/5
Taste 4/5
Hygiene 4/5
Hospitality 4/5
Value for money 4/5
===================================================================
Conclusion: 

Will definitely give it a visit again because I am quite impressed with their Momo’s. Coming back for more. :-)

After trying out au bon pain we squared on to China South for some chinese starters. We ordered the Chicken Pepper and Salt and Prawn Tempura. It took around 10 mins to get them readied. The chicken prep was a stir fry with onions and the proportion of salt was on the higher side. Even then it tasted yummy. The prawn tempura served with a sweet sauce was tasty. I would have liked a hot combination to go with it. However, I am not sure if they were supposed to be crunchy, which it was not. Good for a tryout.

We had gone there a month back, when Quest still had that novelty factor retained. 
From what I remember we had ordered 
1. Some black pepper and salt chicken 
2. Exotic vegetables 
3. And a bowl of chow ( once again the name I have forgotten) 
The food, quantity, quality all were up to the mark. The person who attended us was very friendly and helpful. Usually in these types of places attached to the food court, it's self served and you have to bring the food yourself. He insisted that we sit and our food was served 10 minutes later. 
All of them tasted well. The chow was a bit too spicy though, and the chicken had a particular sauce which, let me put it this way, was not exactly my type, but overall tasted well. The exotic veggies too were well done, perfect combination of salt and spice. 
Pleasant experience in a nut shell.

recently paid a visit here.. the ambience is so-so.. just like any normal food court.. we ordered drums of heaven apart from the regular non-veg combo.. the drumsticks was nice enough though the quantity was on the lower side but that is again considerable if we look at the price. The sauce was well made and spice was just perfect! Well.. on the non-veg there's nothing special to mention.. though wartons was good r crispy and the sauce of the chilli chicken was well enough. kimchi and the fried rice lacked a little taste. But on the whole had a nice experience. Would certainly visit it again..

Ok ! had I known that they a stir fry counter option I wouldn't have ordered the combo meal the other day . But none the less I have no complaints from the combo meal . The portion are generous and I liked the hot garlic chicken given .. The Manchurians were soft but the sauce was So-so . the wantons were perfect. very crisp and not at all oily . The kimchi was nice as were the hakka noodles . 

The prawn crackers were not of a good quality probably they should use another brand . Just a suggestion that if someone does not want cold drink with the menu they should give an option of taking mineral water too ... also a diet variant would be appreciated. 

next time I am here ... will surely try the stir fry . and also the dim-sums

Having read good things about this place, decided to try it out after starting our eating session at au bon pain. This is the go to destination for Chinese food at Quest mall. We ordered the Chicken Pepper and Salt and Prawn Tempura. The food arrived fast enough. Now, I haven't had Prawn Tempura before but from what little I know, they are supposed to be crispy on the outside. Right ? Well, this was not....this point aside they tasted quite good, nice and simply done. The dip served with it was on the sweeter side and I wish it would have been more spicy. The Chicken Pepper Salt , on the other hand, was really good....basically a stir fry with onions, it was yummy by itself. I could have a lot of this dish ! Overall, this place is definitely worth a shot. :)

China South at the Quest Mall is perhaps the best food outlet in the Food Court at the moment. We had visited for dinner and ordered Chicken Spring Rolls which were very nice and the Chicken Momo with Exotic Vegetables.... did not find any exotic veggies in it but really liked the flavor of the momo's. For the mains we ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles and Chicken in Orange Sauce.... the Hakka Noodles with a portion size enough for two if you have starters which we did but only good enough for one if you don't was the only area where I feel they could improve. The dish of the day for me was the Chicken in Orange Sauce which was excellent. Juicy succulent chicken in a lovely orange sauce which was delicious but had slight sweet and citrus undertones which I loved. Overall had a great meal with all the above costing approx Rs.650/= including a large bottle of mineral water and a small cold drink which I thought was pretty good value. Hope they continue to maintain the quality.
Update : Visited this weekend and tried the Prawn Pepper Salt.  Well made and Tasty.

I have tried the chicken and exotic vegetables momo n it leaves u asking for more.. The chilli chicken and the Hakka noodles too is really nice.. The non veg combo gives u an opportunity to try several things in a platter.. Good food n reasonably priced n service too is quick..

went to quest mall with a friend of mine and decided not to have anything heavy.so we made two to three rounds of the food court and ended up ordering at china south only 1 non veg combo.
PROS-chilly chicken was decent not too good
             the veg gravy sort of was okayish type
              i liked the noodles the most
             there were also other side dishes
             not expensive at all it cost me just 225+taxes
CONS-i think the the other side dishes were not good but just a waste.
              i can't find any other cons
                                 that's it.it is worth giving a try...........

I was at Quest Mall and was not too keen on going to Au Bon Pain, so decided to head for something Chinese. Got the hot and sour soup and mixed chow mien. Both were very tasty and fresh, and I especially liked the soup a lot. Sauces are laid on one side, and you can take what you need in small bowls and add to your food. Overall, good start!

Comfort Chinese Food @ China South - Food Court of Quest Mall, Kolkata ☺

A hectic work day with no real time for food interval or even food munchings, ends up with a movie (pre purchased tickets) at a popular shopping mall.

You are in the mood for some hot comfort food and not the usual nachos, popcorns, patties etc. that are available inside the movie theatre.

Q: What do you do for a quick bite in the 10-15 minutes that you have till the movie starts? 

Ans: You aim and attack the right food counter at the food court silly! What else? Where else will you get hot food at such short notice?

We went through somewhat similar routine and emotions few days back. Given to our the then existing urge and appetite, we zeroed in on the China South counter and ordered a plate each of Veg Szechwan Hakka Noodles and Vegetable Manchurian. 

The whole process of buying the cash card, placing the food order, receiving the food order, and getting the balance refund on cash card took 10-15 minutes. In the next 10 minutes, two of us managed to consume our share of food, parcelled the leftover food which was good enough for one person (better to give it to someone than let it go to waste) and raced to plop ourselves on the comfortable cushioned seats of the Inox theatre!

Both the eatables arrived in big egg shaped white melamine bowls with portions good enough for three people. The noodles were infused with the usual onion, carrot, capsicum and spring onion choppings, and the manchurian came with enough soya sauce based gravy. Both the items tasted nice.

It needs mentioning that the China South staff were kind enough to give us a disposable aluminium foil container to parcel our leftovers. They did not even charge us for that.

Pricing:
Veg Szechwan Hakka Noodles: Rs. 170/-
Vegetable Manchurian: Rs. 175/-

Dec 2013:

A new Chinese cuisine entrant into the city, this one has opened as a food counter in the food court of the Quest Mall. Food here is hygienic, tasty and relatively less oily. Momo lovers will specially like it. Not only is this fast gaining popularity dish available in multi options (both veg and non veg), it’s also served in a cane basket which keeps it warm till the last bite! That simple basket provides an altogether different kind of dignity to this street food. Sauce served alongside is also different than what is generally available with momos. Instead of tasting more of chilly, it tastes rather sweet! We opted for mushroom momos and they were great.

We also ordered a veg. combo meal and spicy chilly potatoes. The meal consisted of fried wantons, saboodana papad (don’t know what they call it in Chinese), sweet & sour cabbage, chow mein, paneer cubes in soya gravy, mixed veg and soft drink. All the items were good. Chinese cuisine is enjoyed best in tranquility and silence. So, somewhere the high hum drum of the food court acted as a hindrance in the complete enjoyment of the taste buds.

I tried their mix veg momo. They presented it well in a bamboo steamer basket. The texture of momo was good and that was the only thing I liked. But the filling did not taste good. The mix veg was basically cabbage. They need to work on their filling. Also the size of the momo looks ok in the picture but was actually small. Overall did not have a good experience. Not worth spending 140 on mix veg momo.

This place has been my all time favourite. Their chinese delicacies are something which i love. My most favourite dish is the chicken momo. I visit this place quite often for the momos. Now coming to other dishes. We ordered  crispy chilli babycorn , pan fried chilli fish qnd crispy fish in chilli honey sauce. The crispy fish in chili honey sauce was the best. For the main course we ordered mixed fried rice , mixed  hakka noodles , panfried noodles. They were equally good. Side dishes were chicken Manchurian and szechwan chicken. The experience was very good .

I would humbly ask the owner of the place to have a check on the employees picture that i added along with the review. His attitude very disrespectful arrogant and putting off. Upon asking him questions about the combo he showed an attitude as if we as customers are slaves to him. I asked him for a softdrink " bhaiya coke hai fountain se denge to check karwa dijiye flat nai hona chaiye." He replied " fountain hai flat hi milega lena hai kya ?" I didn't want to upset myself asking him bout his name or saying anything to him. I asked him " combo me kya hai?" He replied " combo khatam hai" they have big boards of combo placed multiple places on the counter. I felt like kicking his balls out of his mouth but didn't want to create a scene in public place. I want you to enquire on this incident.

Good Chinese but as per food court standards the prices are a little on the higher side. I had ordered a pan fried chicken noodle. Taste is very good and so is their presentation. Service is quite fast if there isn't much of a rush. Only one suggestion incase they can incorporate is that they should have more variety of Thai cuisine like phad Thai and Penang  a curry cause do serve Thai red curry and Tom yum soup. Incase you eat here you should not miss their momos. They are excellent. My experience in a nutshell : satisfying!!

Everyone loves Chinese food, which is why every food court has one. QCourt's Chinese kiosk is by China South, where I dug into a plate of Pan Fried Noodles. It tasted very different from the "gravy chow mein" that we all are used to. The noodles were coated in gravy with subtle flavours, and the dish was loaded with diced chicken and exotic veggies. I also tried the Chicken Momos, which were quite meaty, and served with two dips. Overall, the food here is not the typical ketchup-dipped Indian Chinese mess.

This is the only place in the QCourt which serves Chinese. I tried the two signature dishes - Steamed Chicken Momos and PanFried Noodles. The momos were served in a closed basket. This was unlike the paper boxes in which the other kiosks in the city serve momos. There were six momos in the basket, which were served with a spicy tomato ketchup and coriander chutney. The momos were very juicy and the stuffing of minced chicken was quite generous.

The Pan Fried Noodles had chicken chunks along with veggies like broccoli, zucchini, cauliflower, bell peppers, etc. I loved the mild flavour of the noodles and the juicy veggies. One can have it with or without any side dish, as per requirement. The portion size is perfect for a single person.

Every mall food court has a Chinese food kiosk, there is nothing out of the box in that. Also these kiosks share a weird similarity in their quality and quantity standards. It's hard to distinguish between them actually. Unless you come across some place which operates at a level that's a notch higher. Recently I came across 'China South' at Quest Mall food court and I realised that a food court eatery serving Oriental dishes can also blow your mind away!!

Their menu is not about Indian style Chinese cuisine, in fact it is totally different from that. Here you get a hint of typical South East Asian cuisine. On this visit, we played a bit safe though and ordered for Steamed Chicken momos and Chicken Pan Fried noodles. Next time I am sure to atleast try out their Chicken Sui Mai! 

Coming back to what I tasted, the chicken Momo's were served in typical bamboo basket/steamer which is only found in proper restaurants in Kolkata and you won't get this at any mall food court in the city. Along with that a spicy tomato sauce was served (not really a red hot garlicky momo dip I was looking for) and a coriander dip. The steamed momos were simply out of the world!! They were literally fantastic. They were extremely juicy and soft, with flavourful minced chicken, onion, coriander, garlic filling. I just felt that the filling can be made a tad more generous. But still I will come back to this place for these steamed momos. The chicken Pan Fried noodles was also very well prepared and had loads of diced exotic veggies in there like zucchini, broccoli, red and yellow bell peppers, etc. Overall a filling and comforting meal in the end that truly pleased our poor souls!

The service is pretty prompt out here and keeping the quality in mind, the prices are reasonable. I would rate this place 8.5 out of 10 and a big thumbs up from my side. After a long time I am impressed so much with a food court eatery, and that too in Kolkata! Surely do give it a try! 

Cheers!

Chinese eating restaurant's isn't anything of a difficult task these days to find them.However how much authenticity does a place holds up too in general eyes,probably the least and unknown ones.Now forget about restaurant's to do that part for a while and let's look at an different kind which works well too. The food counters of mall aren't any thing less in giving you what you want in the most fine way.China South situated at the food court of Quest Mall,Q Court is a place to visit to get those lip smacking oriental delicacies.I was invited here by First Idea Pr and i was involved in a tasting session which had Chicken Steam Momos and Chicken Pan Fried Noodles.To be real quick here on my verdict i would say the noodles had something not very impressive but just a good eat. The noodles were loaded with veggies and chicken pieces stir fried.Moving on to the Momos ,they were definitely juicy and full on delicious. I loved how the steamer basket looked loaded once it was open unlike other places which gives an eye wash .
Do try out even other takes from this place as a lot of options you get for satisfying the Chinese eating crave in you and ofcourse do try the ones i ate too 👍

China south is situated in the food court of Quest mall.
They serve good chinese food.
What i liked the most here was the non veg mongolian they serve.
You can pick and choose vegetables as per your preference and they make it according to your taste.

Also the crispy chilli baby corn that they serve is satisfactory.

This was unlike the paper boxes in which the other kiosks in the city serve momos. There were six momos in the basket, which were served with a spicy tomato ketchup and coriander chutney. The momos were very juicy and the stuffing of minced chicken was quite generous.

The Pan Fried Noodles had chicken chunks along with veggies like broccoli, zucchini, cauliflower, bell peppers, etc. I loved the mild flavour of the noodles and the juicy veggies. One can have it with or without any side dish, as per requirement. The portion size is perfect for a single person.

Every mall food court has a Chinese food kiosk, there is nothing out of the box in that. Also these kiosks share a weird similarity in their quality and quantity standards. It's hard to distinguish between them actually. Unless you come across some place which operates at a level that's a notch higher. Recently I came across 'China South' at Quest Mall food court and I realised that a food court eatery serving Oriental dishes can also blow your mind away!!

Their menu is not about Indian style Chinese cuisine, in fact it is totally different from that. Here you get a hint of typical South East Asian cuisine. On this visit, we played a bit safe though and ordered for Steamed Chicken momos and Chicken Pan Fried noodles. Next time I am sure to atleast try out their Chicken Sui Mai! 

Coming back to what I tasted, the chicken Momo's were served in typical bamboo basket/steamer which is only found in proper restaurants in Kolkata and you won't get this at any mall food court in the city. Along with that a spicy tomato sauce was served (not really a red hot garlicky momo dip I was looking for) and a coriander dip. The steamed momos were simply out of the world!! They were literally fantastic. They were extremely juicy and soft, with flavourful minced chicken, onion, coriander, garlic filling. I just felt that the filling can be made a tad more generous. But still I will come back to this place for these steamed momos. The chicken Pan Fried noodles was also very well prepared and had loads of diced exotic veggies in there like zucchini, broccoli, red and yellow bell peppers, etc. Overall a filling and comforting meal in the end that truly pleased our poor souls!

The service is pretty prompt out here and keeping the quality in mind, the prices are reasonable. I would rate this place 8.5 out of 10 and a big thumbs up from my side. After a long time I am impressed so much with a food court eatery, and that too in Kolkata! Surely do give it a try! 

Cheers!

Chinese eating restaurant's isn't anything of a difficult task these days to find them.However how much authenticity does a place holds up too in general eyes,probably the least and unknown ones.Now forget about restaurant's to do that part for a while and let's look at an different kind which works well too. The food counters of mall aren't any thing less in giving you what you want in the most fine way.China South situated at the food court of Quest Mall,Q Court is a place to visit to get those lip smacking oriental delicacies.I was invited here by First Idea Pr and i was involved in a tasting session which had Chicken Steam Momos and Chicken Pan Fried Noodles.To be real quick here on my verdict i would say the noodles had something not very impressive but just a good eat. The noodles were loaded with veggies and chicken pieces stir fried.Moving on to the Momos ,they were definitely juicy and full on delicious. I loved how the steamer basket looked loaded once it was open unlike other places which gives an eye wash .
Do try out even other takes from this place as a lot of options you get for satisfying the Chinese eating crave in you and ofcourse do try the ones i ate too 👍

China south is situated in the food court of Quest mall.
They serve good chinese food.
What i liked the most here was the non veg mongolian they serve.
You can pick and choose vegetables as per your preference and they make it according to your taste.

Also the crispy chilli baby corn that they serve is satisfactory.

Having stayed in Delhi for 6 years, I always have craving for Crispy Chilly Potato. So I went ahead and ordered and I was disappointed.  It was very spicy,  there was a lot of green chillies and it was actually quite tasteless.  The noodles was quite bland too. The service was extremely slow and their billing machine stopped working and we had to just stand for 10-15 minutes staring.  They also don't announce that the order is ready or give time. 
Service 1/5
Food 2.5/5
Value for money 3.5/5

A great place in Quest Mall food court for Chinese lovers. It has a good spread on offer. I have eaten here twice. The food is delicious and so is the quantity. My favourite here is the Toss it up bowl as it gives you the choice of rice / noodles , the protein you want to choose, the veggies and also the way it should be prepared. 

I love their hot garlic sauce , it's moderately spiced and saucy with springy freshly made noodles. It tastes awesome and quantity is sufficient for 2. 

The pricing here is also quite reasonable. Would love to be here again.

A over hyped food joint located in Quest mall. The staff members are well behaved. After reading some of the reviews, I had a mixed feeling about this place and thought of checking it out. 
I had ordered Red Thai Curry, Green Thai Curry and Chicken Momo. 

Though only 6 pieces in quantity, the taste and quality of the momos were good. 
Red Thai Curry and Green Thai Curry were totally bland. I don't expect them to be spicy or something but they lacked every bit of flavouring. 

I have tried authentic Thai cuisine in many great places but these Red and Green Thai Curry were nowhere close to their taste. 
Needs improvement.

Wonder why I never rated this place! Possibly the best eating option inside the quest food court. They serve Asian food and have a well planned menu!
I love their toss it up which is their rice or noodle bowl with veggies and sauce.
I go for noodles with garlic or schezwan sauce and a variety of veggies!
The portions are really good!
Also like their rice and side combo and their mushroom momos!
The food tastes amazing here!
The only negative is the rude staff who I tried to avoid on my visit at this kiosk.

A pretty good stop at the quest food court!

This belongs to my favourite among the many corners of Quest's food court. They do make amazing and delicious SiuMai and the pocket pinch is quite low. Among the range of SuiMais they offer I found their Prawn Suimais to be the best. Service is a little slow, but as Quest food court doesn't have much option for foodies China South is quite a relief for most of us.

Location: situated on the 3rd floor of Quest mall in Ballygunge, food court. 

There is no point of discussing about the interior designing as it is in food court so i will directly talk about the food and the service.

Food and the service: the lady behind the counter was actually very polite. However, i am very much disappointed with the food that they had served us. Being a chinese myself and moreover, a chef who is specialised in chinese cuisine, i was very much disappointed with the taste. It wasnt even tasting like a fusion of indo-chinese, but to be very brutally honest, it was terrible. The only reason why i decided to eat here was because my friend wanted to try it out but my guts told me not to. I should have listened to it.
We ordered:
• chicken siu mai: this one is the most disappointed dish of all. Not only was it small ( i think they made siu mai for cats, not for humans ), it had a very strong smell of fish. I just had one and decided not to have it any further. 
• mixed szechuan noodles: this one had no taste. I had to use the sauce provided for siu mai for more taste. Lack of salt as well.
• crispy fish in chilli honey sauce: it said crispy so i expected it to be crispy. Also, it said chilli so i expected it to be a little spicy. It was too sweet but it was much better than siu mai and noodles.
I also asked for cold mineral water. Maybe the lady forgot and gave me room temperature water, which i had to later exchanged.

Never gonna eat here again.

This is located in the food court of the quest mall.
The fusion of food makes the taste irresistible.

Toss it up veg
You get choose from noodles,spaghetti and to choose from the different veggies from broccoli,peas,corn ,baby corn,cabbage,chives,paneer,peppers and lots of more veggies seasonal.
And the final part they have three types of sauce in which they will toss up up noodles with the veggies.
Choose your favourite.
And trust me it's amazing.
Their are other dishes to try upon but go for this if u love noodles when ever u will visit Quest Mall.

A great outlet to enjoy some really delicious authentic Chinese food, China South is located in the food court of Quest mall. The momos, sui mais, appetisers and soups are palate pleasing. The noodles, rice and main dishes are tasty, fresh and well made. Thai food is also available here. 
A unique service is the Toss It Up. You can choose your own toppings and sauces for a tasty stir fried hakka experience. This is the best place to eat in Quest. Service is quick and courteous. When you are hungry and pressed for time then a visit to this place can cheer you up.

This is the Asian food counter at the Quest Mall food court.

We took the 
toss it up veg : we chose flat noodles in sweet chilli sauce with fresh seasonal veggies. The turnout was yummy bowl of sweet chilli noodles perfectly cooked and tossed. Mushrooms were not available in the vegetable options for the toss it up. If that was there it would be perfect.

Crispy chilli baby corn: The baby corn was good. Some pieces were tasting a bit uncooked though.

Veg sui mai and momo: the best thing about these were the way they were served in cane steamer baskets. They were quite nice and fresh.

The food was really good but there was an issue with the staff at the counter. They both saying ask her or him to take the order in quite an unpleasant way. Would prefer better behaviour from them as despite good food my experience was not pleasant.

Located at food court in quest mall.......i. Went for dinner with a friend .
Ordered a plate of chowmin , chilly chicken and momos.
The quantity of chowmin is far from suffice for two person where as the pocket pinch is 170-180 
Even the chilly chicken wasn't enough for the price paid. 
Taste wise was okay nothing great . 
I will never go back.to that place . 
Price is exorbitant with comparison to the quantity and taste of food which is as normal as the food from a local joint .

This outlet is located at Quest mall food court. We wanted to have some spicy Chinese dishes so tried this outlet as there are very few options available at this food court. We had ordered spicy and crispy chicken. It costed Rs289 for one plate. When it arrived we were happy to see the quantity. But the happiness did not stay for a long time. It was nothing but spicy and crispy chicken without any chicken in it. The sauce was terrible. It had only three tastes- sour sour and sour. Horrible food!!

Fast service, belly warming food and good Asian flavors. China south is one of the busiest outlets at Quest Mall and for right reasons too.

Recently tried their schezwan hakka noodles, chilli chicken and sweet and spicy crispy chicken. While the first two items thoroughly pleased our tummies in the middle of a hectic shopping spree, the last one heavily disappointed.

Apart from that from that little bit of disappointment, the meal was satisfying.

This one is placed at the food court of QUEST MALL,Syed Amir Ali Abenue.
As with all other mall food courts,thus one also doesnot have any dedicated sitting arena,but you can grab a cozy corner on a sofa at the lounge area and feel quite comfy as the buzz of this food court is pretty nice.
This stall is small and menu is limited but I dined here quite a few times and it definitely beats most of the chienese eateries in Kolkata hands down.
I ordered chicken steamed momos,pan fried chicken noodles and schezwan chicken dry yesterday during my latest visit.And the momos are as usual soft,tender and juicy accompanied with a spicy and tangy momo sauce.The flour wrap of the momo is also not thick rather its thinner and that adds to the experience.The only hitch is the price is on the higher side condisering there are only six small sized  momos in one portion.
Pan fried chicken noodles has exotic vegetables like brocoli,red and  yellow capsicums and pokchois and garnished with boiled chicken sttips nd one can easily guess this is the most popular item on the menu since you will find most of people having this dish on their tables ! The noodles coupled with spicy schezwan chicken dry make a great combo.The schezwan chicken dry was also good and the chicken is tender and not super oily for a welcome change.Also the schezwan chicken came with the right amount of red chilli hotness,not over spicy as few of the other 'authentic' and popular chienese joints ☺.
Overall food is tasty and nice,ambience is OK but pricing is on higher side considering its not an individual dining restaurant but part of a mall food court and it has self service still a hefty service charge is billed.

Though a place that sells food over the counter, this isn't to be underestimated. I found this place by accident. The Chinese food tastes pretty authentic. I find the "Toss it up" options to be the most economical ones. The monos are on point. Must try !

People can misunderstand this place as just a mere food counter in a food court of a mall , but , it is way more than that . First of all it is in the food court of quest mall and is probably the best food court in kolkata and this place serves the best chinese food compared to other food counters at any mall . The only problem is it price which are a bit too much for a food court . Dont expect anything of a proper restaurant quality , after all it is just a food "counter" , but expect to be the best among the food "counters" .

This is located in the food court area of the Quest Mall which not only serves authentic Chinese food,  but also Mongolian food through the selection of your choices for veggies,  meats,  sauce and other spices . Although they could not manage to get an original huge size Mongolian tawa, but I appreciate that the cook tried his best to bring out the taste of authentic Mongolian noodles - which is a must try.

Authentic chinese joint in Quest mall at an affordable price. One of the best presentations i have ever seen for chinese dishes. Be it momos or hakka noodles or panfried noodles the garnishing is tempting enough to make you go crazy for those dishes. Less oily and less spicy food , full of yummy veggies makes the dishes lipsmacking and healthy. Quality of food is excellent.. A must try @ quest mall . Only thing that stops me from giving a 5 star is that , more chinese dishes should be included and combos , if introduced would surely win the crowd.. Apologies for not having any photos, as i was too busy cherishing the meal.. ;-)

Every time I visit Quest mall, I definitely go to this place. It is situated in the food court area of the mall. Veg noodles is my favourite but yesterday I tried their Veg momo, which was very authentic and tasty. It was very soft and just melted inside the mouth. The price was the only factor which bothered me (140+tax) for 6 pieces. Otherwise the experience was awesome.

Pleasantly surprised by this outlet in Quest Mall's food court. Good food and decent presentation which almost made me forget that I wasn't in a proper restaurant. We had the steamed Chicken Momo which came in its own basket. It was very light and just what we wanted. The Nonveg tossup was a customised dish where one could choose the type of noodles, meat, veggies and sauce. And it tasted just right. The crispy potato was also good though a bit too salty for my liking.

I had ordered stir fried Vegetables and they were made really bad n were absolutely raw,wen I gave my feedback to them n told them to make it properly he literally yelled at me saying this is how it is made and we won't do anything. I was over the phone as I had sent my staff to get it for me n kaushik Chatterjee told me come here n talk.

Located on 4th floor of quest mall in the food court. The place serves authentic Chinese food. I ordered for chili potatoes and vehlg noodles. Both were yummy. The chilli babycirn was crispy n tasty but mushroom momo. However it was nit good. I deduct points for two reasons... firstly it was crowded and they had shortage of manpower and secondly they were unable to serve some items.

This outlet is located inside the food court of quest mall. I had been to this outlet a few months back. They offer a variety of combos, elaborate momos, a few choices for main course. I had their nonveg combo. It was good, even more so coz I was expecting less from a food court outlet. But the portions were less.

Went for watching a movie in the Quest Mall than we decided for having lunch from here.... It is situated on the 4th floor in the food Court.... We tried there Chicken Momo n take away dishes were Mixed Szechwan Noodles n Slice Chicken in Black Bean Sauce.... Presentation of Chicken Momo was very good.... I think their momo serving procedure are very hygiene .... Taste wise Chicken momo was good too, but take away dishes were not up to the mark... They served very prompt...Cost are okay as compared with other food courts...

One of my favorite Chinese joint. I have visited uncountable times.
Location: food court of quest mall.
Food: I love their mixed panfried gravy noodle. Juz amazing.
The momos they serve are equally good. Momos comes in a bamboo momo maker box.. Hot and juicy.
One special item is 'toss it up'. You can mix your choice of noodls or rice with toppings in your favorite sauce. It can be great if u choose wisely.
All foods are delicious and will give a awsum feel good factor if u r a Chinese good lover.
Portions are also quite good.
Price is relevant for d quality of food.
Overall experience: staffs are helpful. They serve with good hygiene. Unlike other food court stall their cutleries are of fine fine quality. Theirs a small view through the kitchen which is equally clean. Overall nice experience. @I will keep visiting.

Took take away here. 'Toss it up' make your own noodles- amazing, not because it was my choice, but quantity as well. Hakka noodles and fried rice were your usual ones, didn't disappoint. Manchurian balls were nice though gravy could have been better. Spring rolls were really oily. Chopsuey was a let down . the staff repacked to my liking and heated it well enough that even after 20 mins in an AC car, back home we didn't have to heat it before eating

Located in the Food Court of Quest Mall, this China South outlet is quite well of its kind. 
Last evening me and three of my friends were hanging out in Quest Mall as I had some shopping to do. After all shop-hopping, we decided to had some food. I was on my cravings for Momos. Found China South, and had ordered one plate of Veg MoMo and a plate of Chicken Momo. 
Coming to the food, the Momos were served in jute baskets with a banana leaf inside. The Veg Momos were round dumpling-shaped. The Chicken Momos were normal regular shaped. Along with the momos were provided a red sweet-spicy chutney and a green chutney which were good taste enhancers.
The momos were quite decent emough in taste, juicy, chicken and the veggies were well cooked and soft. Tasted well overall.

A mall can not survive without a Chinese food outlet and for Quest, it is China South. It may be a food court outlet, but you would be surprised to see what they can give you in fifteen minutes- be it a plate of simple steamed dumplings or a full combo meal.

Location: food court, Quest Mall. A bit away from Frozen Yogurt.

Food: combo meal here would be a wiser option than availing items individually.

Combo meals come with:
*a portion of vegetable salad.
*steamed rice- fluffy and light.
*main course- soya sauce smothered in your choice of protein
*wanton
*soft drink of your choice

Management: staff here is more or less helpful. Service is fast. Pretty much what you would expect in a food court joint.

I always attempt to eat here whenever I'm visiting the quest mall food court. I always have their crispy chilli baby corn due to the intense garlic flavour in it. This time I tried a non vegetarian toss it up and chicken momos. The momos were cooked and shaped well, but the filling was less in quantity. The toss it up was also good , with schezwan sauce , but it was a bit sweet and was not really spicy. The prawn and chicken in it were overboiled , so the chicken was rubbery and prawns were too soft. The fish was cooked well. The prices are elevated for a normal food court , but the food is good and worth a try.

Food court was always crowded but they still manage to serve you good quality Chinese in reasonable time. Must say they made brilliant quality hygienic and delicious Chinese cuisine and affordable price. We ordered toss it up veg in rice with added all the vegetables and medium spicy sauce. It was perfect in all the manner. Price was affordable, quality was superb, quantity of rice and vegetables are large and most importantly taste was brilliant. Must say i never had this quality rice bowl before. It was mouth watering and heavenly delicious. We also tried crispy chilly babycorn which was crispy and very tasty but need tobe little more spicy. Superb experience here. Must try place. Highly recommended for toss it up.

A decent budget friendly eating joint in the food court of quest mall.I had toss it up noodles with a mix of schezwan and hot and garlic sauce teaming it up with sweet and sour chicken on the side. The noodles were amazing and very healthy with so many veggies and on the other side I found the shredded sweet and sour chicken to be a little overcooked and burnt which made it very hard and too chewy. All in all, food is decent and it has the must try noodles where one bowl of it can serve two people easily.

One of the many Chinese Restaurants spread all across the city, the only edge I can think of for this joint is the wonderful location which is at the Food Court of Quest Mall. 
After a nice shopping day, it's nice to go to the food court and have the option of trying Chinese food amongst the many other variety of options available. 
However, the food here to is just nice. There is barely any dish that can be given a noteworthy mention. I have tried the Drums of Heaven, which was a nice dish. It had good flavours but nothing wow about it! 
Then we had the Pepper something Prawns and Chicken Fried Rice. Again, the rice was nice but it definitely did not have me going crazy about it. 
Perhaps the nicest of the lot were the Prawns. I love prawns so I really won't complain. Plus the flavours worked quite well together. 
I haven no idea why I bother to order American Chopsuey. Not that it wasn't a good dish, I just don't like to eat sweet while having savoury. The Chopsuey had a nice taste but it just didn't go down my throat after being halfway through. 
So all in all, the place is an okay dining option and since the prices are acceptable (maybe a teeny bit high if I be too critical). I would recommend this place but only if you are through with the other places at the food court.

Food courts at shopping malls never impressed me much as they are too pricey and serve average food. This one at Quest mall is no different to the others, much more expensive if not anything else. This review is just for one item they serve, very aptly named- Toss It Up!
The dish consists of rice or flat noodles tossed in a range of veggies and non veg items of ur choice and served hot right out of the wok. My favourite is the non veg variant (obviously) where u get ample amount of fish, chicken and prawn all tossed together with rice along with veggies of my choice. All the goodness in one bowl and quantity sufficient for two (or one very hungry soul).
It is a better version of mixed fried rice. Added advantage of customising it to your liking. No side dish required. Recommended.
P.s.: I have had Chicken drumsticks here also. Good in taste but too small in quantity.

It is the only Chinese joint in Quest mall food court. It serves average food with exorbitant prices. Toss it up seemed to be a new option with lot of choices. It was visually deceptive, though the taste dint meet my expectations. Despite my clear instructions for the food to be medium spicy, it turned out to be extremely spicy. As a result, my friend suffered an upset stomach. The good thing was the quantity as one portion can easily suffice two. The dish was abundant in veggies, chicken, prawn and fish. Had the sauce been good to our taste bud and stomach, i would have given far better rating.

I have always ordered their chicken pan fried noodles. Though I am very fond of the taste of their pan fried noodles, I feel disappointed as they dont include mushrooms in this dish. Pan fried noodles should have ample pieces of babycorn and mushrooms in it. I didnt get it why they avoid putting mushrooms in the dish. I have heard that the suimai here is very tasty. Planning to try it on my next visit. Quantity provided is quite less when the price is taken into consideration.

Visited this outlet today and as usual, the service staff was extremely rude. He didn't care for queues and acted like he doing us a favour by taking the food orders. I didn't care much for his snotty attitude  (he should be reminded that the place serves mediocre chinese food from a hole in the wall, not delicate french food from an upscale restaurant ) and thus took my business elsewhere. Mall management should take note and upgrade the service quality.

Though not a full fledged restaurant but still this place runs like a pro on the third floor of Quest mall. Food is served nice and hot which is especially good. I have been there with my love and have enjoyed their food. Menu is very limited though. On every visit i land up ordering the same old stuff as there's not much choices. But even with the limited menu ppl still enjoy their food. Prices are neither too steep nor too reasonable given the quantity of the noodles. I would suggest them to increase the quantity a tad bit so that ppl will not feel the pinch of paying that much and get fully satisfied with the quantity and quality of food. Rest there's nothing much to say as the tables are all common for everyone.

I generally don't prefer food court meals apart from fast food, but the food court at quest looks pretty cool so I had to eat here. Was in the mood for Chinese, so decided to give this place a try. And seriously, it was a very satisfying meal indeed. Good, clean Chinese food. Maybe it wasn't too fancy or innovative, but that's not what I was looking for anyway.

Located in the4th floor of quest mall in the food court. Always a busy place for connoisseurs who have a liking for Chinese dishes. Ordered schezwan noodles and sliced fish in basil sauce. Tastes Authentic and apt presentation. Only drawback is the time they take to serve the dishes. Otherwise worth a visit and try the dishes. Tastes nice and pocket worthy as well.

So far one of the most delicious chicken momos after blue poppy service is a little slow but considering the footfall of the mall we can excuse it I hope they improve there menu a bit more and add some more dishes..

Very disappointed with this outlet situated in the food court of Quest Mall. The service was too slow. Moreover they had numbered orders but didn't seem to be following it which was very irritating. When we ordered the going number was 22 and we were happy because we were 25  thinking we needn't wait for long. Oh! How mistaken we were! They came to 24 and skipped 25. Went up to 30 and then came to our number 25 without any explanation! There is a glass pane and one can view a part of the kitchen and see the chefs at work. Cleanliness and hygiene was maintained. The food too was not up to the mark....schewan Hakka noodles was too oily. The veggies too weren't good.

Located within the food court of quest mall this chinese joint is making a name of itself being one of very few great options u get even in a food court..u donot get the ambience or the personalised care of a full fledged restaurant but who cares if they serve u good tasty food..the service is fast and its always bubbling with people..we had chicken hakka noodles and chicken capsicum momo..the quantity of the food is low but its tasty..the momos were really good..overall a good experience..

The quality of food they serve is not short of any other good Chinese restaurant in the city. 
Supposedly the best place to order from from the quest food court. 
The momo's are a must try. They are great. 
Drums of heaven were also good. Loved the sweet corn soup. The pan fried fish was too dry. 
Not much to say about the ambiance but the service is very fast. A full course meal will take them 5/7minutes to prepare. 
Thumbs up.

I guess the common item ordered from their menu is the noodles. Me and my mom had their MIXED HAKKA NOODLES in the evening. Thank God we didn't have it for lunch or dinner cos the quantity is abysmal, especially for 235/-.

Not that the quality was any better. Excessive use of oil; and the prawns were not clean.

Sad to see that food court outlets of posh malls only keep their prices considering the crowd and pay no heed to the quality.

Will reluctantly try other items later on hoping to have a better experience.

I find this place one of the best to have a meal within a budget when visiting quest mall.

I've tasted almost all the gravy preparations they offer. The rice and noodles are both yum !

I was personally very disappointed with this place. We ordered pan fried noodles( I expected something spicy and tangy) I got gravy chowmein( reason why at least some description would be given in a menu)
The chicken rice was not good. It was only rice and just that.... You need to look hard for tit-bits of chicken... :( (I am  a chicken lover.. So the obvious disappointment)
Coming to the Schzwan Chicken- it tasted like someone has prepared the dish with a few pieces of shreded chicken, on a bowl of water containing maggi tastemaker and tomato sauce. Ohh... It also had a few pieces of what we Bengali's call gandharaj lebur pata!! :D
And don't even ask how much such disappointment to my taste buds cost me. :(

Hi friends , I would like to share an experience with an employee of 'Quest Mall ' . This young man aged between 25- 30 years who calls himself the manager of the food court spoke with such rudeness to a lady that too a senior citizen over a complaint of the pathetic food served by 'China South ' a unit of Global Kitchens (Kolkata ) LLP. It's a shame that 'Quest' is employing such I'll mannered people who fail to be courteous and respectful towards customers forget customers towards people the age of their parents. This man argued with the lady and mentioned that he din care if she went to the consumer forum to complain about the food. I am mentioning this to ask everyone to stand against bad behaviour. We might have turned old but we at no cost hav lost our dignity. One should not be too proud of the position one holds treating a human being well is all that matters. Learn some manners young man.

Also plz dnt parcel anything from china South d food is too salty waste of money.

Very good food and very fresh food and Chinese food not the typical masala Indian Chinese food. The chicken mom's are really good its filled with chicken and not onion. The price is a bit high for being a food court type food but I would still go back and pay cause its top quality food and they don't sting on the proportions. Keep it up China South.

Went for shopping at Quest Mall and some exchange. Not planning for a lavish and luxurious eating out, we decided to go to the food court which is conducted by the Global Kitchens. Had tried their food earlier but didn't take photos to put up a review. It's an average rated Chinese restaurant. The 'Toss It Up' they serve is the best part of their menu. We tried it. We went for the non veg bowl. We ordered a mixed bowl with chicken, fish and prawns in mixed sauce. It is cheap compared to the one available at the Kolkata Airport. But the prawns were a bit stinky. And the vegetable options are less than those available at the Food Boulevard in the airport. The taste was good otherwise. We also took a plate of Crispy Prawn Pepper Salt. The prawns were crispy, there was ample amount of pepper. But I think they forgot to put in some salt. So, it was okay. It's not a must visit place but when you don't want to spend thousands at the other expensive eateries in Quest, this is what comes you to rescue. Happy Dining! :)

Situated in the food court  of quest mall. In quest mall there are only 2 options for Chinese food this one and other Yauatcha, if you don't want to spend a lot of money in Yauatcha then China south is the only option. When we see any restaurant in a food court, general impression this must be very regular. But this restaurant is different. It can compete with lots of Chinese restaurant in city. I am really impressed with ingredients they are using. Suimai are freshly prepared and taste was just amazing. Make my noodles with black been sauce was very good. Chicken pan fried noodles was very good too, they used almost all exotic vegetables available in india. We also ordered pan fried chilli fish. The fish was very fresh but this item was little higher side of salt.

I would surely visit this restaurant again when not in a mood to spend my money in Yauatcha 😉

I have just tried one dish from this place and it simply won my heart. Crispy fish in chili honey sauce is a must try from this place. The fish was fresh, not stinky, crispy from outside and soft from inside. It melted in my mouth. The sauce had generous amount of honey to balance the taste. Overall it had a nice hot and sweet taste. Not the typical taste that we get to taste from most chinese food joints. Really impressed.
I am so looking forward to try other dishes from this place before I leave Kolkata.

When you are just up for some quick chinese food in Quest Mall, China South is the best option. you get a variety of food items here and though I have dined just two times from the China South I really liked their food. Once we had the steam chicken momos which they serve in these bamboo baskets which was really cute 😁 then when we tasted them they melted in our mouths so yummmy. The other time we had a combo meal the options were different, where we chose noodles, fish in mains ,salad, a chicken appetiser and coke and because the bill came above 500 they gave us a choclate pastry free as dessert. We were so happy for the free dessert and the fish was really good.

If there was a momo heaven on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this!!! The most succulent, tasty, dripping of butter both on the outside and inside, large and filling momos I have ever tasted. I don't remember how an authentic Tibetian or Sikkim momos taste like... But this has been taken to another level! I could eat these momos everyday...my whole life!!! I almost become a greedy gluttony child when I stand in front of their shop and see the chefs preparing the momos from the glass pane looking through the kitchen. My cousin and I are it's biggest fans and shamelessly we stuff our faces with two plates each of sheer bliss!
The pan fried noodles are good too... So are the other side dishes... All in all I could live off that oozing chicken momo! I wish they would include pork momos and side dishes as well!

Located in the food court of Quest Mall and perhaps the only outlet offering south east Asian cuisine(Chinese/Thai) in quest mall. Though Quest also hosts the popular luxury Asian restaurant "Yauatcha" on 5th floor. But in a pocket friendly sense"China South" stands out among the crowd and is frequented by the foodies with Chinese cravings.

We all know how much We(Calcuttans) love and swear by Chinese foods and this fact is proven by the uncountable number of Chinese restaurants located like mushrooms in every nook and corner of the city.
But when it comes to Chinese and other south east Asian cuisine there is much more to look out for rather than those conventional dishes like-(chilli chicken, Manchurian, Hakka/greavy noodles and fried rice). Chinese is a vast and distinguished cuisine and has a lot more to offer to our pallete.
This is where "China South" tried to capitalize and has been their USP, which is working out pretty well.
They offer a decent and voluminous variety of Chinese and Thai dishes.
Ranging from the conventional and evergreen ones like- Manchurian, chilli chicken, rice, noodles etc; to sumptuous salads and enticing appetizers like drums of heaven, paneer chilli rolls etc; to succumbing main courses like- salt & pepper chicken, chicken in black bean sauce, red Thai curry chicken, sliced fish with mushroom and Chinese green, three treasure vegetables, american choupseys, stir fried exotic vegetables.
"Momos", another vastly popular dish in Kolkata is also served by them, but with sheer dedication. The momos are freshly prepared after placing the order and are served in a circular wooden casserole. The outer coating of their momos are so light which let's you see the fillings/stuffings inside. It is damn sumptuous and succulent from the very first bite and does really pampers your taste buds.
They also let's you choose and assemble your main staple(rice/noodles) according to your choice and also let's you choose your favorite- veggies, sauces, toppings and the MODE of preparation (pan fried, saute, tossed) which is named as "Toss It Up". Something which I personally enjoyed doing. It let's you experiment with your dish and helps you enjoy your favorite Chinese dishes with a different and interesting twist of taste.
Along with ala carte menu items, they also have attractive "meal package" options both for veg and non-veg at attractive rates, which let's you unwind your Chinese cravings without having to make a hole in your wallet.
The portions served by them are sufficiently decent enough for a famished soul.
Just beside the cash counter, is the "Kitchen" covered with transparent glass, which let's you peep at the complete procedure of preparation of your ordered dish, all the way from the Wok to your table.
The chefs in the kitchen are fabulously experienced with tremendous culinary expertise which oozes out reflects on every dish prepared by them.
The staffs behind the counter are also very courteous and leaves no stones unturned in satisfying your every query and manages the crowd quite smoothly.
Overall "China South" is one of those rare places in Kolkata serving authentic "Gourmet" Chinese and Thai cuisine in an affordable rate.
So if you have a weakness towards Chinese food and would like to enjoy some authentic Chinese dishes beyond those conventional items as I mentioned before but do not want to spare too much amount of money by visiting restaurants like(Mainland China, Chinoiserie, Zen, Pan Asian or Yauatcha) then "China South" is the perfect place for you to be.

I like this outlet pretty much. Located inside Quest mall, the food tastes good. I always make a point to order the crispy Chilli babycorn which is delicious. The combo is good and tastes great. Service is prompt.. In mood for Chinese, try this.

The first time I tried this place I really liked it. I had gone for the toss it up thing. It was prepared really well with all my choice of veggies and sauce. I was so impressed. The quantity was really really good and I had to pay only 200 bucks. However, the quantity and price is having an inverse change. The quantity is decreasing and the price is increasing and somewhere round the corner I see the degradation in quality as well. I tried another dish too which was super bland. This place seriously needs to know where it is going wrong.

Okay so this place is also situated inside Quest Mall food court and is always always busy and crowded, people seem to like to their food a lot. Being the only place inside the food court which serves South East Asian food people can't get enough of it. 
Their set Chinese meals and their steamed momos are good to taste but honestly I have had better, they are nothing out of this world. Compared to the other places inside the food court this one is definitely more expensive than the rest but what I really really really really dislike about this place is their STAFF. They are rude, obnoxious and have this "we care a damn" attitude. 
Once my cousin and I were about to order and my cousin suddenly changed her mind about the dish she was about to order and asked for something else the person behind the counter who was taking the order actually went ballistic like a psycho! 
He actually chided us and asked us to make up our minds! 
What the hell? What kind of attitude is that? Only because my cousin instead of a meal asked for something else he was like "lady make up your mind and be fast", he was supremely impatient. Even when our order was ready, he said it would take 15 minutes and we came back after the designated time so again he was showing temper regarding why we didn't check back earlier because supposedly the food was lying on the counter for sometime. 
If  people like this run a place I am sorry I can't imagine to give good rating to a place even with decent food. 
Doesn't work for me. Not recommended, there are better places to eat in quest mall, skip this one if possible. Really bad service, the management should be embarrassed about their staff.

It is in the quest mall food court. Their momo's r really good and flavorful and prepared fresh on order. They even have make ur own noddles system which is called 'Toss It Up' , where u can pick and choose the kind of sauce and vegetables and non veg u want ur noodle/rice to have.

I was having some Chinese cravings and so thought of trying out the food here. I had ordered chicken momo and I just had no complaints at all. The momo was served in a basket. It was very tender, the skin was nice and thin. I actually loved the taste. Their are very few places that make good momo and trust me this is one of them. The wait time is about 10 minutes.

This is a small outlet in the food court at the quest mall. I do not know where the restaurant is. However that's not required, this is a good enough joint. Coming to the food, the soups are nice. The price will stump you, but only initially, as I think the quantity justifies it. Another good dish with them is their toss it up. It lets you select from noodles/rice, choice of veggies and sauces. Basically freedom to choose what you'd put in you version of noodles /rice. It's brilliantly made, once you've chosen your ingredients. The sauces are all on the spicy side so pls avoid it if you're not comfortable with it. Beyond that the main course and the noodles are good. Then again I'd like to reiterate that the prices are steep and the quantity tries to justify the price. It is a part of the food court and its good enough to sit and have food there. The dimsums, I hear are good. Since I've not had them so I'll not be able to get more accurate than this.

Have a great meal. Enjoy!

Not upto the mark at all. We went for the non veg combo which included choice of fried rice/noodles, prawn wafers, chicken manchurian, a veg item and a glass of pepsi. The food was very oily and the taste of the less oily items was not good and we really had difficulty finishing the food. Definitely over priced. The portions were not too great either. Very disappointed.

This restaurant is a part of the food court in Quest Mall. The food is pretty good here. If you come here, dont try the conbos. I did not like it. Its very average. Something which u will taste every where. The chicken in the combo is pretty bad.
I tried the "Toss It Up". This is what they call the Mongolian style of cooking noodles. You can make it ur own way. They ask u ur choice of vegetables, along with ur choice of sauce( hot garlic/ Szechuan). You can keep it vegetarian, or add chicken, prawn, egg into it and make it non veg. The Veg is 250 and non Veg is 310. This is really filling for one. 2 people can share along with some side dish.
Combo costed be 350. It is sufficient for 1.
Cost of 2 people : 660 ( including tax).

First time trying dining in the food court of Quest mall, being a chinese lover, went straight to china south. 
Half the menu not available at 7:30pm. startled.managed to order crispy chicken, chopsuey, hakka noodles, and fried rice. 
Crispy chicken was tooo crispy to find any chicken while chewing. Disappointing. The chopsuey was good and wholesome and had lot of veggies and hicken , the only highlight. The chicken hakka was too spicy unnecessarily and we found it a bit under-cooked. the fried rice was too plain , not much veggies, only chicken bits with spring onion and loads of pepper salt, killed the taste. Had heard it was good but beg to differ. next time in quest i will stick to chilis again :)

Just visited this place yesterday- on Christmas. So, yes, I am taking into account that it was very crowded, there was a long queue but I was not happy at all. Waited for 15 mins to place my order. When my turn came, I was told that they dont have a Veg combo available, then i asked for Veg Pan fried rice that was unavailable too. I asked for "Toss it up" and was told that it will take 30 mins. So finally, I settled for Veg Schezuan Noodles. They came merrily after 20 mins and were not upto the mark. Also, the person taking the orders was not too polite- very offhand attitude.  So a bad experience over all.

The only thing i've tried is the "Toss It Up' where they literally toss up whatever ingredients you choose. There are 3 types of noodles to choose from , around 10 types of vegetables which include mushroom , baby corn, sweet corn, peas, beans, carrots, tofu , spring onions, onions, shallots, cabbage, lettuce, chillies etc. You decide how much you want of each thing. Its a lot of fun putting it together as well. The best part is you can choose to add chicken, fish and prawns as well. ( if you opt for the non vegetarian option). There is a selection of 3 sauces which you can choose from this includes- Black bean, Chilli Garlic and schezwan. All the goodness comes at the nominal price of Rs 275 or so and it can be comfortably divide among two friends. (no side dish required).

Well... To be very honest.. I wasn't in the mood for having a food court sort of lunch.. Cause u know.. Ive tried evry1 one of them.. And they all suck. But trust me.. Until i came across.. China South. I mean.. "Waaoowww".. Im a momo maniac.. And im very particular about it.. So i wasnt sure.. Whether they wud be able to cope up with the expectations.. But seriously.. Like waaaow.. The dough.. The filling.. The greasing of that olive oil.. Well its juz amazing.. U get stuff like that in mainland china.. U seriously dnt expect dat from a kiosk in a mall.. It was worth it.. We ordered spring rolls and drums of heaven.. The sauce was pretty good in drums of heaven.. But the spring rolls.. Errrr.. Was likely.. I mean when u deliver momos like that.. U bring up expectations.. But it wasn't up to the mark.. There was more oil inside than the filling.. Needs to be balanced.. Sooo.. I wud give it a 4.. As it also pocket friendly.. Unless they make those spring rolls tempting..

We relished the chicken momos very much. The containers in which the momos were served were really beautiful and attractive. Enjoyed it very much along with the dips served.......but equally the chicken hakka noodles was a total disappoint. The taste was totally bland. The serving time was okay. Surely, would like to give another visit over here just for the delicious momos.

The price being on the lower side, and sufficient quantity for a single hungry me, i always choose this place over any other eatery in the whole of quest mall. 
Also, their pan fried noodles is also one of the best!

The con side of Durga Puja is: If you are stuck with a stipulated budget, it is very hard to find space in a descent restaurant without losing all your sweat off!!Hence I came up to the quest mall and was delightfully surprised!! The food court is very cozy with international standard decor, numerous seats where you can sink in and spacious at the same time! China South was targeted to please my taste buds and it did a commendable job! My order was Drums of heaven and to my surprise though it is just a food counter at a mall, the food served was perfect! The taste was perfect and can give any descent restaurant a healthy competition! I would like to suggest this place to the fellow readers!

Never expect the food from food court to be as good as the proper restaurants but the food court of Quest turned out to be a little better than scm! 

Had a combo non veg meal from China South yesterday. Ignoring the initial disappointments of a 30 minutes wait even though they claimed a 10 minutes wait initially and the 'mistake' of noodles even though we ordered fried rice, the food is not bad otherwise. 

The wantons and vegetarian side dish were delicious. However, I did not exactly like the chicken in szechwan sauce very much since it had a little overdose of salt.  A did not complain though. The proportions are generous. We had no choice in aerated drinks and all they served was Mirinda. I think it is the Puja time rush that caused the glitches. 

Not bad at all otherwise.

In 3rd floor in Quest mall. You can see the kitchen - i liked the momo/dumpling setup. Momos and siu mais were good. 
These items are in mega demand, we just got the ones in the last lot for that moment. The next customers would have to wait, the chef announced :)

Fried rice was ok... and the noodles was just done. Nothing to try again.

Fish with chinese veg tastes good.

willl try for momos again..

A lovely place to catch Chinese food....i went to this place on a Saturday after my mom's office and chicken Hakka noodles,sweet and sour crispy chicken fry ,a Chinese soup and a Thai soup. The chicken fry was awesome, the sauce being great. The Chinese soup was tasty but the Thai was disgusting as it was just a reduction with lots of lemon grass with weird tasting mushrooms. The noodles were seasoned well unlike some noodles but it had very less quantity of chicken bit a lot of egg.
It is a good place to catch being under budget. We ordered three noodles,two plate fries,and two soups which was enough for 4 people costing us 950

Well,I have rated this at 3.5 as I havn't tried much of their food.
But overall I am in love with their non veg toss it up,this has been on my list in my recent visits to the mall.Some might feel its a little overpriced,but the food makes up. However,on different days the amount of noodles and your choice of add-ons might differ drastically depending on the person serving it for you. That is a real letdown because some times they take so much of noodles in the bowl that little space is left for the rest and you might end up with a lot of noodles with little add ons into it. Other than this their sliced fish with mushrooms and chinese greens tastes really good and is served piping hot. Hope to try out the other items on their menu soon..

Never expect the food from food court to be as good as the proper restaurants but the food court of Quest turned out to be a little better than scm! 

Had a combo non veg meal from China South yesterday. Ignoring the initial disappointments of a 30 minutes wait even though they claimed a 10 minutes wait initially and the 'mistake' of noodles even though we ordered fried rice, the food is not bad otherwise. 

The wantons and vegetarian side dish were delicious. However, I did not exactly like the chicken in szechwan sauce very much since it had a little overdose of salt.  A did not complain though. The proportions are generous. We had no choice in aerated drinks and all they served was Mirinda. I think it is the Puja time rush that caused the glitches. 

Not bad at all otherwise.

Taken food from there twice..since again..I love Chinese food :D
Its a food take out counter at Quest Mall Food court. 
First time I ordered for Mixed Hakka Chowmin. The presentation of food was really nice and then the taste was really good. I liked it .
Today I ordered one Chicken and capsicum Szechwan Momo platter. It was steam one. Though I am not much of Momo fan because I can't distinguish between types of momo very well...specially the steam ones.
anyway..it tasted good...but I loved the way they served in a bamboo covered container with a banana leaf.Wow ! I mean wherever I at least had momo..they never gave in such fashionable manner. I gave all my points on the presentation. ha ha ! But anyway...cost was Rs. 150 for momo and Rs 150 for chowmin also... Its definitely worth it.

Happy eating guys ! :)

I went to this place with my mom and two of my Aunts. we had chicken noodles with sweet and sourcrispy fried chicken and two soups... A Thai soup and a Chinese hot soup.......
Pros...
1. Nice noodles with thick strands and good amount of chicken and other veggies and egg too.....
2.I recommend everyone who goes there to try there hot and sweet crispy chicken. they are so yummy that you will that it's better than tangra's Chinese.....
Cons
1. the Thai soup tasted  like plain Bengali chicken curry's diluted version with overpowering lemon grass and raw broccolis and mushrooms
2. our was a bulk order and it took more than 25 minds to get the order
Overall it was as good dining experience and Pocket friendly... The bill for 2 soups, 2 chicken noodles, 2 sweat and sour crispy fries and a parcel of one noodles was only 966

The service is really quick and even the parcels have a huge quantity.

I had ordered two Egg Noodles to be packed, and the quantity is HUGE. If you order one plate, make sure you have skipped a meal beforehand. There's nothing extraordinary about the noodles, though it is really tasty and the noodle strands are a little thicker than you usually get and yes, another plus point would be the absence of tons and tons of cabbage leaves, which is usually a "staple" in Kolkata's Chinese. The Szechwan Noodles were very hot and I won't recommend it to people who aren't used to chillies. I have also tried the Sweet n Sour Crispy Fried Chicken, which is just awesome. At 150 bucks, it is worth your expectations. The moment I put a spoonful of the Kurkure-like strands of chicken, there was a burst of sweetness and sourness, one after the other. Add to it the succulent shredded chicken. Pure bliss. Enough for a meal. My friends had tried out the Mango Chicken, which they said was a total wastage of money. 

Wish to visit this place more frequently in the coming months...

China South is my absolute favorite when it comes to dining in Quest Mall. The rates are surprisingly low and the food was  good every time. I have tried chicken lollipops, different types of noodles, dim sums, soups. Only was disappointed a bit with the non veg combo, which was served cold and they could have done better job at compiling it. Apart from this this food stop can't be better. The best place to eat after shopping in the mall. I would definitely recommend to try this spot

The other day I happened to pack a Chicken Hot n Sour Soup and was very pleased with the taste while we sat home consuming it. Based on it, I recommended the place to my wife for lunch this afternoon. We decided to try the Non-Veg combo meal and as it sounded good, we ordered two, one with rice and one with noodles. Food was served rather quickly, since they have it already in stock.

Soon everything just turned on its head. The meal consisted of:

1. Two Chicken Fried Wantons. Just passable, served almost cold. Hardly any filling. Vague slightly creamy taste.

2. Two Prawn Papads. You cannot really go wrong with these.

3. Khimchi. It was as good or as bad at it can be. No comments.

4. Pepsi. Small serving. Reasonably okay in taste in terms of strength.

5. Veg Fried Rice / Chow Mein. The Chow was not up to the mark at all. Very tasteless, and probably been made long back. The Fried rice seemed fresher, and had a buttery taste, but did not quite have the Chinese flavour to it. Add to it it contained corn and peas!!! I mentioned it to the chef and his excuse was it was the demand. If they give in to such silly demands so easily, they don't earn my respect.

6. Vegetable Manchurian. This tasted like crunchy uncooked vegetables were just dipped in a sauce and served. The sauce was quite cornfloury, and had oil and some spice. Bad news!

7. Chilly Chicken. Three chicken pieces in gravy, The gravy was once again very watery and distant to the taste. The chicken, though not spoilt tasted weird... never had chicken batter fried in that manner. It was not right.

Almost all of it was served not hot enough. I made a noise and they reserved it, with much of the stuff still on the colder side. I suppose their a-la-carte items would taste better.

Another surprise was the bill. They charge a 5% service charge. Never seen that in a self service place, I questioned them about it and they said it was as decided by the mall authorities. Must check the other stalls.

All in all a pretty bad experience. Not worth the Rs 225 charged per meal, especially when you consider the quality. Watch what you eat here.

So my review is depending absolutely on the spring roll I ordered when I was in quest mall. 
The spring roll was crispy and the veg fillings were great as well. And ah, the plate they used was pretty too ! :D
The staffs serving at the counter are polite and humble too. 
The menu is pretty decent absolutely diff from what the usual food courts provide.. A little deeper and more Chinese if I may put in. 
I really wanna try out their main course dishes too! Really looking forward to it! <3

Ordered rice, fish and dimsums. Saw orange chicken and got really excited. Sadly after I ordered it I wished I hadn't seen it. Maybe its me, but when ever I think orange chicken I think shiny glistening crispy balls of joy coated with orangey  goodness. We got boring chicken in orange marmalade gravy. Sigh. The rice, the fish and the dimsum were nice. The fish was really nice. but sigh, all I remember was the sad orange chicken!

ChinaSouth – A good kiosk to order Indo-Chinese food when planning to visit the food court of Quest Mall, Park Circus. 
===================================================================
Brief: 

I had been to Quest today with one of my friend and had ordered a corn capsicum momo as a starter and planned to move on to other food kiosks to try different other dishes too. As I am an ardent lover of Momo’s or you can call them dim sums, I love to try out various places in Kolkata to get the right one for myself. 
===================================================================
Food: 

I had just ordered one plate veg corn capsicum momo. The momo was served in the Bamboo steamer the usual one and had banana leaf below the six hot, melting, sizzling, steaming, mouth watering, jaw dropping and smoking momo.  As I picked up one of the piece, it was greased in a lot of oil. However, it was tender on the outside and smoky hot inside with specially heating corns. I dipped it in the spicy sauce, which they usually serve with the momo and darrnn!!!! It was amazing. So vegetarians, you can try this momo if you are bored of the usual Momo’s, which you get in the various shops/kiosks in the city of joy. I loved their preparation. The momo cost was 125 bucks. I think as per the mall standards, its okay. However, just a little request from my side would be to just decrease the oil content used for greasing. 
===================================================================
Pros: -

o	Outstanding Momo Presentation.
o	Reasonably prices as per Mall standards.
o	Impeccably Hygienic. 
o	Momo quantity was fair enough. 
o	Momo quality was good especially the skin of the steamed Maida was too soft n thin. 
o	Indian taste friendly. 
o	My momo got ready in 10 minutes. Promptness of Service is seen right here. 
o	Served Hot.

Cons: - 
o	The pieces were much on oil. However, very tasty. 


===================================================================
Summary:

Momo presentation 4/5
Momo quality 4/5
Momo quantity 4/5
Taste 4/5
Hygiene 4/5
Hospitality 4/5
Value for money 4/5
===================================================================
Conclusion: 

Will definitely give it a visit again because I am quite impressed with their Momo’s. Coming back for more. :-)

After trying out au bon pain we squared on to China South for some chinese starters. We ordered the Chicken Pepper and Salt and Prawn Tempura. It took around 10 mins to get them readied. The chicken prep was a stir fry with onions and the proportion of salt was on the higher side. Even then it tasted yummy. The prawn tempura served with a sweet sauce was tasty. I would have liked a hot combination to go with it. However, I am not sure if they were supposed to be crunchy, which it was not. Good for a tryout.

We had gone there a month back, when Quest still had that novelty factor retained. 
From what I remember we had ordered 
1. Some black pepper and salt chicken 
2. Exotic vegetables 
3. And a bowl of chow ( once again the name I have forgotten) 
The food, quantity, quality all were up to the mark. The person who attended us was very friendly and helpful. Usually in these types of places attached to the food court, it's self served and you have to bring the food yourself. He insisted that we sit and our food was served 10 minutes later. 
All of them tasted well. The chow was a bit too spicy though, and the chicken had a particular sauce which, let me put it this way, was not exactly my type, but overall tasted well. The exotic veggies too were well done, perfect combination of salt and spice. 
Pleasant experience in a nut shell.

recently paid a visit here.. the ambience is so-so.. just like any normal food court.. we ordered drums of heaven apart from the regular non-veg combo.. the drumsticks was nice enough though the quantity was on the lower side but that is again considerable if we look at the price. The sauce was well made and spice was just perfect! Well.. on the non-veg there's nothing special to mention.. though wartons was good r crispy and the sauce of the chilli chicken was well enough. kimchi and the fried rice lacked a little taste. But on the whole had a nice experience. Would certainly visit it again..

Ok ! had I known that they a stir fry counter option I wouldn't have ordered the combo meal the other day . But none the less I have no complaints from the combo meal . The portion are generous and I liked the hot garlic chicken given .. The Manchurians were soft but the sauce was So-so . the wantons were perfect. very crisp and not at all oily . The kimchi was nice as were the hakka noodles . 

The prawn crackers were not of a good quality probably they should use another brand . Just a suggestion that if someone does not want cold drink with the menu they should give an option of taking mineral water too ... also a diet variant would be appreciated. 

next time I am here ... will surely try the stir fry . and also the dim-sums

Having read good things about this place, decided to try it out after starting our eating session at au bon pain. This is the go to destination for Chinese food at Quest mall. We ordered the Chicken Pepper and Salt and Prawn Tempura. The food arrived fast enough. Now, I haven't had Prawn Tempura before but from what little I know, they are supposed to be crispy on the outside. Right ? Well, this was not....this point aside they tasted quite good, nice and simply done. The dip served with it was on the sweeter side and I wish it would have been more spicy. The Chicken Pepper Salt , on the other hand, was really good....basically a stir fry with onions, it was yummy by itself. I could have a lot of this dish ! Overall, this place is definitely worth a shot. :)

China South at the Quest Mall is perhaps the best food outlet in the Food Court at the moment. We had visited for dinner and ordered Chicken Spring Rolls which were very nice and the Chicken Momo with Exotic Vegetables.... did not find any exotic veggies in it but really liked the flavor of the momo's. For the mains we ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles and Chicken in Orange Sauce.... the Hakka Noodles with a portion size enough for two if you have starters which we did but only good enough for one if you don't was the only area where I feel they could improve. The dish of the day for me was the Chicken in Orange Sauce which was excellent. Juicy succulent chicken in a lovely orange sauce which was delicious but had slight sweet and citrus undertones which I loved. Overall had a great meal with all the above costing approx Rs.650/= including a large bottle of mineral water and a small cold drink which I thought was pretty good value. Hope they continue to maintain the quality.
Update : Visited this weekend and tried the Prawn Pepper Salt.  Well made and Tasty.

The china south counter happens to be the best counter at the food court in quest mall.. The food here is very tasty n the quantity is large whic can be shared easily among two. I have tried the chicken and exotic vegetables momo n it leaves u asking for more.. The chilli chicken and the Hakka noodles too is really nice.. The non veg combo gives u an opportunity to try several things in a platter.. Good food n reasonably priced n service too is quick..

went to quest mall with a friend of mine and decided not to have anything heavy.so we made two to three rounds of the food court and ended up ordering at china south only 1 non veg combo.
PROS-chilly chicken was decent not too good
             the veg gravy sort of was okayish type
              i liked the noodles the most
             there were also other side dishes
             not expensive at all it cost me just 225+taxes
CONS-i think the the other side dishes were not good but just a waste.
              i can't find any other cons
                                 that's it.it is worth giving a try...........

I was at Quest Mall and was not too keen on going to Au Bon Pain, so decided to head for something Chinese. Got the hot and sour soup and mixed chow mien. Both were very tasty and fresh, and I especially liked the soup a lot. Sauces are laid on one side, and you can take what you need in small bowls and add to your food. Overall, good start!

Comfort Chinese Food @ China South - Food Court of Quest Mall, Kolkata ☺

A hectic work day with no real time for food interval or even food munchings, ends up with a movie (pre purchased tickets) at a popular shopping mall.

You are in the mood for some hot comfort food and not the usual nachos, popcorns, patties etc. that are available inside the movie theatre.

Q: What do you do for a quick bite in the 10-15 minutes that you have till the movie starts? 

Ans: You aim and attack the right food counter at the food court silly! What else? Where else will you get hot food at such short notice?

We went through somewhat similar routine and emotions few days back. Given to our the then existing urge and appetite, we zeroed in on the China South counter and ordered a plate each of Veg Szechwan Hakka Noodles and Vegetable Manchurian. 

The whole process of buying the cash card, placing the food order, receiving the food order, and getting the balance refund on cash card took 10-15 minutes. In the next 10 minutes, two of us managed to consume our share of food, parcelled the leftover food which was good enough for one person (better to give it to someone than let it go to waste) and raced to plop ourselves on the comfortable cushioned seats of the Inox theatre!

Both the eatables arrived in big egg shaped white melamine bowls with portions good enough for three people. The noodles were infused with the usual onion, carrot, capsicum and spring onion choppings, and the manchurian came with enough soya sauce based gravy. Both the items tasted nice.

It needs mentioning that the China South staff were kind enough to give us a disposable aluminium foil container to parcel our leftovers. They did not even charge us for that.

Pricing:
Veg Szechwan Hakka Noodles: Rs. 170/-
Vegetable Manchurian: Rs. 175/-

Dec 2013:

A new Chinese cuisine entrant into the city, this one has opened as a food counter in the food court of the Quest Mall. Food here is hygienic, tasty and relatively less oily. Momo lovers will specially like it. Not only is this fast gaining popularity dish available in multi options (both veg and non veg), it’s also served in a cane basket which keeps it warm till the last bite! That simple basket provides an altogether different kind of dignity to this street food. Sauce served alongside is also different than what is generally available with momos. Instead of tasting more of chilly, it tastes rather sweet! We opted for mushroom momos and they were great.

We also ordered a veg. combo meal and spicy chilly potatoes. The meal consisted of fried wantons, saboodana papad (don’t know what they call it in Chinese), sweet & sour cabbage, chow mein, paneer cubes in soya gravy, mixed veg and soft drink. All the items were good. Chinese cuisine is enjoyed best in tranquility and silence. So, somewhere the high hum drum of the food court acted as a hindrance in the complete enjoyment of the taste buds.
