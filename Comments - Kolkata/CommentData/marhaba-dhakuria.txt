This restaurant is located in the Dhakuria Road just opposite the Jodhpur Park Post Office. It looks a bit small from the outside. However, on entering the place I found it to have amole space which can comfortably house around 50 people at a go. Ambiance and decor of the place is very pleasing. Food is also delicious and amole quantity is maintained for all the dishes. Pricing is reasonable but it is much higher than what is mentioned in Zomato. A wholesome dinner for the two of us costed around 1300 bucks. Overall a enjoyable experience.

Found nothing extra ordinary. Taste of the food is very mediocre. We have tried Fish Finger, delivered with only tomato sauce (very ordinary) saying tartar sauce is finished (clock striking 7.30pm). Anyway we have tried mutton galawati kebab and chicken reshmi kebab which is not good, not bad type. Price is pretty much than the taste of the food. Mixed experience.

Marhaba located on Jadavpur beside tandoor park. Marhaba is a pocket friendly restaurant. Their sitting arrangements are good . Their staffs are very good with their behaviour. But they can't sarve as well as we want. They should be improve themselves. We ordered two egg fried rice ,one plate of sweet and sour Chicken and one plate of hot garlic chicken. Fried rice is really very good with its quantity- and quality. But the sweet and sour chicken is not so good because it's extremely sweet ,it contains with pineapple . And another dish is good but its extremely spicy . But if u r a foodie and want to try something new then I suggest plz don't order sweet and sour chicken. But overall marhaba is good for one time visit.

Nice and decent small food joint... Food quality is okay which does not pinch much because of it's reasonable pricing.... Biriyani could have been a lot better and moreover they couldn't serve more than 2plates to a group of 6.... Naan is either too chewy or too crusty which could have been better but the chicken makhani was gorgeous and delectable.... Irony being that some of their Chinese palates tasted much better than their Afghani or Mughlai which their name hints at... Overall good ambience, neat and tidy.... Perfect for small reunions, sudden dinner plans etc.

Ordered food from here last night for dinner. Didn't use any app, just called them for home delivery as we were practically 5 minutes away from the restaurant. They were REALLY late in delivering the food. We ordered at 9 30 and got the food at 11 45. Some guests had already left by then.
But, the quality of the food made up for the bad service. We had ordered a garlic butter nan, peas Polao, malai kofta, mutton roganjosh, chicken kasturi kabab, chicken tikka.
The nan and Polao was pretty good. I loved how the Polao was sweet and full of dry fruits and peas. The rice was also really fragrant. 
The kebabs were a tad bit stiff. The meat was not tender and it tasted a little bland.
The roganjosh was amazing. It had four pieces of delicate mutton pieces swimming in a rich, red gravy. It is a perfect accompaniment to the Polao. 
But, the star of the show was the simple malai kofta. It had  dome-shaped pieces of flavoured cottage cheese dunked in a light, fragrant white gravy. It tasted AMAZING.
The price is pretty reasonable and the best part is that they charge no tax.

Marhaba is located in Dhakuria. A newly opened restaurant which is bound to catch your eyes when you cross this place. Very elegantly decorated interior with well behaved courteous staff. The interior is something that totally impressed me. It's very spacious and comfortable. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken makhani,plain naan,malai kofta and tandoori roti. The service was quick and the quality of food was delicious indeed. The price is inclusive of tax. I also took away cheese steamed chicken momos for my roommate which was well packed and she found it delectable. I would really like to visit this place soon again.

Ambience was decent but food was not that good for the price. Shanghai noodles were described in the menu as being flat noodles with oyster sauce. Instead, the dish given was ordinary Hakka noodles with cashew. No oyster sauce or anything else, just ordinary Hakka chowmein with cashew. Lassi (sweet) was very salty. Probably won't be back.

Had dinner there on Saptami with my friends. The waiting time was not much. We had to wait a couple of minutes while they rearranged a table for 4 to a table for 6. The décor was minimal but elegant. Coming to the food, after some contemplation, we decided to order Indian. We ordered Reshmi kabab, Butter Chicken, Chicken Bharta, Butter Tandoori Roti and Mutton Biriyani. 

√Reshmi kabab- The kabab was very soft and very moist. It tasted really nice but the hint of that smoky flavour was missing and the pudina chutney didn't have that zing in it. 

√ Butter Chicken- The Chicken pieces were shredded in this dish.  The gravy was warm and creamy, a bit mild though. But tasted nice enough. 

√Chicken Bharta- This dish was good but definitely lacked the richness of spices that we normally expect from an Indian dish. 

√Butter Tandoori Roti- They were really the worst. The rotis were thin and hard and couldn't be torn easily. It looked like they had fried stale Rotis in oil. When told, the manager merely said that it was because of the AC which was not the case. 

√Mutton Biriyani- The Biriyani was delicious. The quantity was pretty good. 

Overall, we weren't very impressed by our experience. The bill was low too. 1280 bucks for the 6 of us. And they don't charge GST, which is always a plus point.

We went there to have dinner during pujas, ordered Mocktails and Noodles. The mocktails were good, but the noodles were overcooked and completely tasteless. We had to ask several times for ketchup and when finally we got it, we realised there was a hair in the food. I am not sure how it got there as we didn't notice it before adding sauce, so I am guessing maybe the sauce had it. Anyway, I I decided to not have it, and didn't say anything then as my friends were having their food and to point it out when it could have been just the sauce, would have made her throw up or something, so I keep quiet. She didn't add the sauce and her noodles had no traces of hair. but at the time of payment,, I did mention it had hair suggesting they should be more careful next time, to which the guy on the mocktail counter was nice enough to ask me to wait to see if anything can be done. But the supervisor was obviously not in a great mood, and he even said "olpo hoe eishob" I don't know what he means by that, but we excused it as we took it as one time puja rush mistake on their part. The supervisor obviously was having a hard time dealing with such a rush during peek time. The mocktail guy was called by the manager I guess, and he came back insisting we have one lemonade from his side. We feel bad thinking money will be deducted from his salary, to which he said no. It was a kind gesture of the restaurant. Anyway, my rating is purely based on my experience with the noodles, and can't say how they prepare their Indian varieties.

Visited this place today for a late Dashami Lunch. They serve Indian and Chinese food. 
For starters we had Crispy Chilli Babycorn. The amount was a letdown.
For main course we stuck to the Indian cuisine and ordered Tandoori Rotis,Chicken Bharta , Mutton Rogan Josh and a salad. 
The Mutton Rogan Josh had 4 pieces of decent,well-cooked Mutton,but the serving of Chicken Bharta was insufficient again.
Our meal for 3 consisting of 1 starter,2 main course dishes and 8 Tandoori Rotis brought our bill to Rs. 830. 
No additional taxes were applied to the prices mentioned in the menu!
Service was decent and hospitality very good as they quickly took necessary actions for sending a wrong item to our table.

Visited this place in the auspicious day of Saptami for lunch with friends after pandal hopping. Our first impression about this place is not so good because of misguidance by the restaurant staff. We visited this place around 1 pm and then it was closed. When we asked when they are opening they told us to come after 1.30 pm and as we followed their suggestions we were in trouble. The full restaurant was filled up within 1.30 pm and we had to wait for 1.30 hour to get a table as we were a group of 7 people. Anyway apart from this experience our food experience was not so extraordinary too. Our menu included,
Starter : Chicken Reshmi Kebab
Main Course : 1. Lababder Chicken
2. Chicken Makhani
3. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala
Staples : 1. Kashmiri Pulao
2. Mixed Fried Rice
3. Butter Nan
4. Butter Tandoori Roti
Drinks: Fresh Lime Soda
All the foods arrived one by one starting with the kebab followed by the main courses. The kebab served was pretty good in taste. Next coming to the Kashmiri Pulao it was a disaster. There was no proper flavors which a Kashmiri Pulao must have in taste. Quantity was very less for 1 plate pulao and can't be shared. Next coming to the mixed fried rice it was good nothing extraordinary. Quantity was enough for sharing between two people. Chicken Makhani gravy was decent in taste with shredded Chicken. Chicken lababder tasted also good with 4 pieces if Chicken served. Lastly Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was too much sweet in taste as if we felt eating payes. Definitely a big no for Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala here. Butter Nan and tandoori Roti were as usual. Fresh Lime Soda served was another disaster. They served the soda by adding excessive amount of salt rather than sweet as we mentioned while ordering. Though they changed the glasses later we had complained. Price was reasonable enough. No extra tax was added on our bill. So overall this place can be given a try. Better to visit on a regular day.

Marhaba is located in Dhakuria,just opposite of the petrol pump.The main attraction of it is the Kebab Platter,you can enjoy it with a group,but it can be better in taste.Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was tasteful with Tandoori Roti.My friends tried their Biriyani too,it was satisfactory.I am sure this restaurant can do much better in future by improving the qualitiy.Service was fair enough in a pleasant ambience.

This review comes fresh of from a visit for lunch. The staff gave a warm reception and took us to our seats. The decor has a contemporary feel to it and this kind of a posh feel i find in no other restaurant in Dhakuria. The food we ordered was a plate of Chicken Reshmi Kabab, followed by a Kashmiri Pulao and a spicy Mutton Rara masala to go with it.  We ordered a fresh lime soda and masala cold drinks. Firstly, found no taxes added on my bill which was a surprise. Also the food was amazing. The Mutton Rara dish literally had the mutton falling of the bone and super tender. Being 5 mins away from my home, I have found a great place to dine with friends and family. Definitely coming back for more.

Just one thing to note here, except for our table, every single table was served with a complimentary papad basket. So that came as a surprise! Hope the management takes note of the same. Service quality is good, but not quite there as yet. However if you are in Dhakuria and tired of the other places, give this a try and i bet it wont disappoint!

The kababs were delicious to have in, but the American choupsey was nothing special,it could have been a way more tastier.
Staffs were friendly enough but slow, they brought my virgin mojito after 30mins I ordered it.
But overall people can give this restaurant a try.

Run run run here till the place gets old. Everything is inclusive of tax for now and the food is to do for. The portions are way too generous and the service is prompt. Just the kind of things you can expect from a new Kolkata restaurant. I hope they retain their service and quality in the long run.

The kebab platter is great and was more than enough for 4 people as starter, yes 4!!!
We had special chicken biryani which again had generous amount of alu anda and chicken. They serve raita as well and complimentary papad to the guests. The chicken was great as well. We were too full to order dessert but I'm sure it would have been nice. 

Thumbs up!

There is a saying that never judge a book by its cover. The saying applies perfectly to Marhaba.

Every weekend my wife and myself eat out. Today we decided to try Marhaba. The ambience of the restaurant is beautiful. Neatly laid tables, walls decked with abstract paintings and small figurines. I was immediately hooked.

For starters, we ordered Crispy Baby Corn and half Tandoori Chicken. The baby corn was as we like it - crispy and tangy. The Tandoori chicken though was something else. It was not Tandoor. I love Tandoor dishes and to he honest, this is the worst Tandoori Chicken I had in Kolkata. With Marhaba located bang beside Tandoor Park, if they keep up with this quality of Tandoor, it would soon become Hoodi Baba.

For the main course, we ordered Kadai Chicken and Plain rice. The chicken was bland and not fresh and the rice was sticky and dry.

Overall, never going back again.

We had mutton biriyani, chicken bharta, chello kebab, chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken malai kebab.. They provide raita complementary with biriyani... and we also got one refreshing drink complementary... Biriyani was good but chello was let down.. Those who are faded up with Tandoor park in Dhakuria can give a try to this restaurant to change the taste..

They served a glass of redressing lime and pudina sarbat as a complementary drink with chelo kebab. But still I can't give full points as the chicken kebab served with the chelo kebab platter is not properly cooked.

We ordered peswari and kasturi kebab 3type s of nan..chicken tikka masala and reshmi butter masala. .the breads and kebab are delicious.but gravy items are not upto the mark . There was a miscalculation in bill too..so check your bill twice before paying. 

Interior is very nice .

Interior decoration was contemporary, though the television sound was quite distracting. There were manholes beneath the seats and the chairs were not at all comfortable. But the host was very polite and it was quite true to it's name. Now coming to the food, we ordered reshmi butter masala, mutton roghanjosh, peas pulao and butter naan. The food was good but the mutton pieces were undercooked and quite stiff. Finally, we ordered Trutti Frutti for dessert, and it really shocked us. It tasted heavenly. There were not too many fruits and was full of kaju and pestas, which gelled well with the ice cream.

Paid a visit to this place yesterday.. ambience - spacious, decor was good. hospitality- very nice. no complains there either. Now food - we ordered marhaba special chicken cheese kebab which was absolutely delightful. The kebab pieces were tender juicy and the coating of cheese made it more tempting and delicious. Chicken biryani was pretty normal well cooked rice, chicken piece was well cooked as well. Only one complain that is i believe the kitchen area should be a little more clean, whatever i could manage to see commenting on the basis of that and also I did have a dead fly in my biryani at first which made me sceptical about the cleanliness of the place. They did change the biryani but dead insects in food is unacceptable.

We visited Marhaba on a rainy weekday after hearing about this newly opened restaurant from one of my colleagues. 

On entering, we were welcomed by one of the servers with smile and seated to a 4 seater table. The place is spacious and nicely done. The ambience comprises of mughal decors as well as modern art frames. Inside is a mocktail counter offering varieties of drinks. Overall it was a calm and quiet ambience that the flat screen television disturbed occasionally.

Coming to the food, I heard they are serving good chelo kebab and Tandoori pomfret. So without wasting time, order these two dishes to start our lunch. We got a complimentary nojito with the chelo kebab and I ordered for a pomegranate nojito separately. The drinks came within 5-8 minutes and both were nothing bad nothing extra-ordinary. Very basic and doing their job of quenching thirst well.  Also the pomegranate nojito had orange slices in it – did not understand the concept but accepted it as is.

After about 10-12 minutes, we were served the chelo kebab and tandoori pomfret. The chelo kebab consisted of buttered rice, 2 sausages, 5pc of chicken kebabs, 1 roasted tomato and a poached egg. Everything was well synched and tasted very good. Kebabs were soft and juicy. However, tandoori pomfret was the show stopper! I have never tasted so well done fish anywhere, except perhaps in home! We were so in love with both the dishes that we finished almost with 10 minutes.

Next we ordered for a Mutton biriyani and a plate of shami kebab. But the server told us that shami kebab is not available and suggested to have boti kebab instead. He said this would be better than the shami kebab and go well with biriyani.

The biriyani came, along with the boti kebab after almost 15 minutes. We had very little hope for the biriyani for some unknown reason and to our surprise, it was quite good. Long grain rice along with a very soft pc of mutton and potato and egg - a perfect Kolkata biriyani one could ask for. Loved it!

Finally it was time for the boti kebab and damn! The 3 mutton botis were under cooked, so hard that we could not even took one bite of the meat. The entire dish was such a disappointment that I cannot express. Somehow, after the chelo kebab and a perfect pomfret tandoori, we had very high hopes for this. We mentioned this to our server as well. He was apologetic as he was the one who suggested this dish to us.

Finally it was time for the bill and when it came, we were told that they have waived off the price for the mutton boti kebab as we could not eat it. Appreciated the gesture. Later on, the manager (so it seemed) of the place came to our table and asked what was wrong with the boti kebab. On learning, he assured that he would like to serve us the same dish in our next visit and would not give us a chance to complain. We thanked him and left the place.

Overall, I would say we had good experience as it’s the small gestures from restaurant that makes it different from others. I wish this place progress well in future.

P.S. They gave us a 10% discount voucher for the next visit, so I am definitely going back to try out other dishes. Thank you Marhaba!

Visited the place for lunch on 27th June, 2017.
Location: 5mins walking from Jadavpur University towards Golpark. Wasn't difficult to locate. Beside Tandoor Park.
When we reached, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant, so we chose our seat. It was a table of 4 but we preferred it since we also had heavy bags with us. Ambience was nice, well decorated. Was playing Bollywood music on a television which could take some reconsideration since it might disrupt conversations.
There were a few minor glitches that happened during our visit.
One. While using their washroom, either they ran out of water or their tap wasn't working (since their flush did). But upon complaining to the management, they gave me an entirely new bottle of mineral water to wash my hands with. Felt a little bad though, since they could have just given regular water, but that just shows the promptness and eagerness to serve properly.
Two. We ordered Crispy Crongee Chicken for starter, Chicken Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken for main course and firni for dessert (extremely mismatched I know). The person who took our orders suggested we upgrade it to mixed fried rice but we refused, citing that we were allergic to prawns. When the orders came, I saw that it was a mixed fried rice. My friend was almost about to serve and eat without noticing and the outcome of that could have been horrific. So I sent it back and asked him to take the garlic chicken as well, and bring it back after reheating along with the rice so that we can have it warm. When he did get the correct fried rice, the garlic chicken had run cold and there was a layer formed that's typical of things that have any thickening agent like cornflour in the gravy. We decided to dismiss it and just eat it as it was.
The food was quite good. I thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes, most of all the firni and the chicken starter. The garlic chicken pieces were a little small though, and food quantity was quite less, since we always take only one bowl of rice and are stuffed but here we had to take two and that too we finished them off with ease.
They don't charge taxes, which along with the good taste and quality of the food, is a plus. But their faulty service and quantity cost them some score.
Will visit in the future maybe to try out their Indian fare. 😊

I heard the name from one of my friend, that a new restaurant opened at Dhakuria Bus Stand.
After thinking thrice I went there instead of the other option.
It was a take away.
I ordered a kebab platter 375 rupees without tax.
After 30 mins waiting I got my parcel.

It was not at all well prepared kebabs, old dead meats are given. Either of them were little bit of juicy or tasty.
Green Chutney was sour in taste, felt old of couple of days.

So if you want to waste your money to try this pathetic joint. you are always welcome.
cold kebab with old chutney, you wanna try? come here.

Management was too scary to taking care of their customers. I saw they are providing wrong bills to some table, wrong order also given to some people.

3 ladies asked for butter nan, they got normal nan.
How pathetic managers :)

anyway... thanks for being a competitor for others options.

Marhaba, a newly opened restuarant, is located at Dhakuria beside tandoor park. I ordered food via swiggy so wont be able to give a detail review regarding the ambience and service. So lets jum into the food  straight away. My order was chicken biriyani, chicken reshmi butter masala, 3pcs tandoori roti and non veg american chopsuey. I had the biriyani but took bite from each of the other items as well. The biriyani was light and tasty. I gues a bit more quantity would have suffice but its okhay the taste was quite good. Coming to the reshmi butter masala, i liked its taste; it was quite rich in flavour but lacked a bit of spicyness i should have required. Well i m not a devotee or fan of american chopsuey due to its sheer too much of sweetness and tomatoeyness. When i had a bit it was too much of sweetness. So i didnt like it. Overall it was a good dinner we had and i hope they progress well.

From the outside it looks like a pretty small place and nothing too fancy, but when you enter you get a different feel and it is pretty spacious. The ambience is pretty comfortable and the service is nice too. Placed right beside Tandoor Park and serving the same cuisine as them, Marhaba could not have fared very well, had it not been for their good food. 

Usually north indian dishes, are not served with a lot of decor, but here the matter is different. It has understood the importance of making food look good as well as taste good. So any dish that you order is served looking very pretty on your table, and when you dig in, it tastes really nice. 

The price is reasonable compared to the food quality. So its a good option when you want to go in for a hearty meal with your friends or family. Their kebabs especially, as amazing. Really nice, tender and juicy meat is served and their fish kebabs are good too. 

Would recommend to try this new place out and show them some love.

This newly opened restaurant 🍴 is in dhakuria next to 2-3 shops after tandoor Park and hot tray.

Ambience and decor is good with quite good no. of sitting arrangements.

Service is quite prompt.

I went with a friend of mine and ordered Hakka Noodles, Chilly Fish and Hot Gulab Jamun.

Quantity was enough for 2... Quality of the food was great as well.

Noodles was good. Fish was soft and tasty. Gulab Jamun was OK.

Would like to try their other dishes as well on my next visit.

Recommendable ❤

Way to go MARHABA 😃 Best wishes.

I visited this newly opened restaurant a couple of days back. The ambience along with the music system was really nice. I ordered for a couple of non veg starters as well as a non veg chalo kebab. All the food was more than satisfactory and I was really happy with such efficient customer service. They provided me with a free plate of veg Momos as well. Keep it up.

Well, the day I had peeped inside u quite liked the warm yet dimly lit space,done up with clean lines. It somehow lacked resonance of it's brand name. Today I ordered their food, requesting for a home delivery, which they did. 
I ordered for a special and a regular mutton biriyani along with sides of dhania chicken and bhuna gosht.
While my mom and sister approved of the biriyani as they felt it was light on the palette, I somehow failed to find a delectable taste. Not sure if it's their prob or my taste buds have gone for a toss.
Next the dhania Chixken,  had a bit of unlikely tang,which wasn't much of my choice. The chicken portions were of respectable chunk though.
The third and the last item that I opted for was bhuna gosht, a fimiliar dish for all who regulars mughlai eateries. This box full of red tomato gravy prep was different from all that I have tasted till now. M a bit confused, if I liked it or not. But what I am very sure of is the amount of oil floating on the surface of this dish, is much more than the others!!!
Not very sure, but I might drop by at the resturant sometime!!

A small family restaurant with cozy comfortable ambiance. Not suitable for large group treats as the seating arrangements come in 4's per table. Food is good and tasty, prices are affordable and the service is good. Waiting time of ordering is also less. We tried both Chinese and Indian dishes, but I personally liked the Chinese better. We also tried their specialty pomfret tandoori, but it was not so great as it looks. Overall, its a budget friendly option for a quick dinner/lunch.

Posh looking restaurant in Selimpur serving tasty food

FOOD: We didn't have a full course dinner here. Ordered Peshwari kebab and Crispy honey chicken. Both the items were well cooked. However, the Crispy honey chicken was absolutely fantastic. The quantity was also sufficient. And the taste soothed the taste buds. Once we placed the order, they served us Chicken momos as complimentary items. The momos were also well made and set the palate for the items to come. 

AMBIANCE: The ambiance is pretty cool with the walls decorated in abstract paintings and small clay models of warriors of Mughal age. The decor goes well with the name and the mughal food items that they serve. However, a modern touch of the contemporary restaurant is also kept with the paintings and the mocktail bar at one side of the restaurant. The lighting is also pretty well. However, the live TV serves as a distraction during conversation.

SERVICE: The staffs are helpful and hospitable. The complimentary momos are a big plus. Cash and card both are accepted. And the best part is, they haven't started charging any taxes over the food items yet. So the cost of dining remains well under budget.

OVERALL: A pretty good restaurant that was capable of impressing us with the decor, behavior and food quality. Hoping that they would maintain this in the long run. Recommending this place to anyone who wants to try out a new eatery in the area.
