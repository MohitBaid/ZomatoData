Pathetic home delivery service. Cold food delivered. Took 1 hrs for a 5 min distance. Slowest service. Delivery guy and manager kept blaming each other

Specific instructions given for the home delivery through Zomato was not followed. We ordered food from here for the second time as the food was tasty and value for money. But this time food was spicy and sauces were not provided despite specific instructions given beforehand.

Ordered for home delivery.well a above average place for take away or home delivery of Chinese food.as it doesn't have a seating arrangement
.reasonably priced..ordered a prawn Cantonese chicken fried rice.kung pao chicken and pan fried noodles.all were enjoyable except pan fried noodles 
The pan fried noodles when mixed was too dry
.the prawn Cantonese was NYC but that lacing of egg made it too thick and egg was overpowering the other ingriedients taste.the chciken fried rice was v NYC and so was the kung pao.chicken
Have tried their Hakka noodles it's NYC..their soups are OK..little too thick..I had the manchow soup..the hot and sour chicken soup too black filed with soya sauce over powering...a place reasonably priced for good Chinese food..

Ordered in for the second time. The packaging is fantastic! Oil-proof, spill-proof, extremely neat and commendable.
Even the different sauces are packaged in a separate container. The extra charge for packaging makes complete sense.

Food is good! Slightly greasy, but delicious. Quantity is unbelievable for the pricing. Not too spicy, therefore perfect for those who prefer light food.

If you're looking for a delicious Asian meal that won't burn a hole in your pocket, look no further. Noodle Mee has an eclectic menu including Thai dishes, and the food won't let you down. 
We tried the
1) Pan fried noodles - the noodles and curry were packed separately, which ensured that the noodles wouldn't become soggy. It has light soya sauce, which makes it absolutely delightful!

2) Diced Schezwan Smoked Chicken - A very interesting and unique flavour. 

3) Chicken Fried Rice - the best I've had so far. And that's saying something, because I eat a lot of fried rice :P

4) Chicken steamed momos - so succulent! And well worth the price.

Their packaging is great. And portions are large enough for 3 people. Give it a try when you're craving Asian food!

Excellent quality and light on the palette.
Unlike heavily spiced, indianised chinese which i am not a fan of .Their food is quite authentic and the generous use of herbs makes it taste great.
Quantity was enormous for example 1 plate of any item can serve 3 or 2 real gluttons.
Steamed Basa in Lemon Sauce was the best (Very light and soupy with coriander,bamboo shoots ,lemon grass etc) followed by the Chilli Garlic (loads of garlic and perfect sweet and sourness) Chicken in Chilli Oyster (tasted similar to manchurian), Burnt Garlic & Capsicum Fried Rice( Lovely pungent and aromatic flavour ) Chicken Wok Hakka Noodles ( Nothing great felt something missing) maybe the chef got tired preparing my order üòÇüòÇüòÇ Prawn In Hot Garlic Sauce ( Good quality prawns and gravy that most will savour, a must üëç)
As we had ordered for home delivery. Packing was outstanding and food piping hot. Chilli Sauce along with Chilli Vinegar Marinade was provided in handsome amount. Overall great experience. Sorry couldn't upload photos ,table was empty before i realized.

Aah! Well don't google me, noodle me! 
As catchy as the tagline sounds, it surely is a treat to the palate. 

I tried the following :

Thai green curry : Delectable to its core, the coconut concoction boasts of the flavour of lemongrass, kaffir lime and basil leaves along with chunks of chicken, which leaves you salivating for more. A personal favourite. It's a Must Try. 

Devil's Chicken: True to its name, the main dish is indeed a balance of hot, not-too-spicy, and full of flavour. Paired with chicken Hakka noodles, it's a winner.

Three Treasure Vegetables - The trio of mushrooms, broccoli and babycorn with a hot garlic sauce-base is surely a delight. Treasure the flavours till the next meal!

Honestly, I would recommend this place to anyone who is fond of both Thai and Chinese food, very authentic in every aspect and does surely make for a memorable experience! 

Kudos Noodle Mee!

First and foremost this is the first restaurant/takeaway profile on zomato that mentions the food item name with the picture. When it comes to the food it is probably the best option for ordering in at home. My order was:
Stuffed Mushroom Garlic Pepper- This was truly flavoursome tossed with onions and not the usual bland mushrooms made with salt and pepper. 
Pan Fried Fish- Very large portions of fresh fish. Again delicious. 
Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice- Really fragrant and the quality of rice was very good. 
Chilli Garlic Noodles- We requested them to keep the spice factor low which they complied to and hence we lacked the full extent of the flavours, still very good. 
Veg Coin In Manchurian Sauce- The first time I have ever eaten manchurian at home when the coins did not absorb all the sauce. 
Chicken in Tsing Hoi Sauce- The Chicken was diced and cooked in a very good garlicky sauce. 
Overall they delivered quite quickly and have a large quantity and would recommend ordering carefully.

After going through so many positive reviews I decided to try out this delivery outlet for today's dinner. Here goes my detailed score

Food Quality 3/5
Price 3/5
Delivery 5/5
Quantity 5/5

What we ordered: we were 3 of us and ordered Pan Fried Non Veg Noodles , Golden Fried Prawns, Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken, Chilli Garlic Noodles & Pan Fried Fish.

Ch Garlic pepper chicken was unique and tasty.
Golden Fried Prawns had too much coating .
Pan Fried chilli fish was tasty and nice
Both the noodles were not nearby the level expected from Noodle mee. Chilli garlic noodles had no flavour at all and the most disastrous item pan fried noodles which had shredded vegetables and that too cabbage and green capsicum. Any standard outlet will provide pan fried noodles with diced veggies and more types of veggies.

Not a happy experience. Hope this was an exception , Team Noodle Mee!!

Yet another very satisfying Chinese meal! Kudos to Noodle MEE. For starters we had chicken Momos, spring rolls and pepper garlic chicken. Chicken momo had thin coating which was a relief. Spring rolls were delicious. Pepper garlic chicken was one of its kind. I have never had anything like this before. The fried rice was just the way it should be - simple wok fried - subtle yet delicious.
I am a freak who likes to have fried rice standalone without an accompaniment! Dinner was good today üòÑ

Wanted to have a quick bite - and despite the glowing reviews on Zomato - was hesitant to be adventurous because I was trying this joint out for the first time.
Ordered through Zomato and was slightly skeptical because of the distance from my place. Delivery was right on time and food was piping hot!!
Chicken Chowmein: 5/5
Crispy Honey Chilli Potato: 5/5
Ginger Chicken: 5/5.
Packaging: 5/5
Can't wait to try out their other dishes. Only regret - with only one stomach, can only order a couple of dishes at a time.:-)

Working on Sundays is something most of us have done and most of us aint proud about it or maybe some of us are. A good takeaway is the best weapon of choice for every employer.
So i had no idea what was being ordered till the order was placed. Golden fried prawns, mixed wok tossed fried rice, garlic chicken and chilly fish was ordered. We were about 8 people and maybe 5 plates of rice were ordered which turned out to be quite a lot. The food was quite good especially the golden fried prawns. The rice was filled with eggs, prawns and chicken and perfectly seasoned. The garlic chicken seemed to be moderate but surprisingly it was a tad lighter than the usual stuff which is good. The chilly fish was quite hot and spicy though the variation in the size of the pieces was disappointing. This is by far one of the best takeaways that I've seen in the city. Do try this joint out when you're feeling lazy!

This is a delivery outlet for authentic Chinese food located near Alexandria Court near Rabindra Sadan metro station. I was invited to a friend's place and she ordered food from this outlet. The food arrived in a very short time which is impressive.
The packaging was perfectly done and maintaining hygiene is their top priority which is visible from the packaging. 
The food that was ordered :
Starters: 1. Schezwan smoked Fish- this is a starter dish with perfectly cooked smokey fish pieces in spices and veggies, medium spicy. 
2. Chicken lat mei kai- chicken pieces cooked in spices giving it a reddish colour and tastes really good.
3. Golden fried prawn - this is the best dish among the starters. It had long thick pieces of prawn fried till it becomes golden brown. It's juicy from inside and crisp from outside.
Main course- 
4. Chinese Noodles and Fried Rice - Even the ordinary Chinese noodles and fried rice from this joint are cooked in a unique way. They give a huge quantity and one will easily serve 2-3 people.
5. Chicken schezwan rice- this rice isn't too spicy, it has a perfect blend of spices and vegetables which perfectly goes with the chicken dishes that we ordered.
6. Chicken Hakka noodles- Hakka noodles are my favourite so I almost finished a whole bowl of it and they were delicious.
7. Hunan Chicken- Diced chicken pieces in hunan sauce and veggies compliments the noodles and rice pretty well.
8. Hot and sour chicken - the sweet and spicy combination in this dish is perfect and the chicken pieces are juicy and are a delight to your taste buds.
9. Fish in chili oyster sauce - The fish was so soft and together with the sauce tasted heavenly. It wasn't very spicy but the schezwan rice and this fish dish are a good combo.
10. Devil's Chicken - if you love spicy food then this is your dish. The devil's sauce with spices makes the chicken fiery and tastes delicious.
The packaging and hygiene quotient is top notch. The quantity is commendable. Each dish can serve 2-3 people. The quality of food is very good. The regular Chinese dishes taste delicious and surely gets a point higher than other joints. The price is also reasonable considering the location of the joint. The food is worth the price. Do order from this joint to serve you with some delicious Chinese cuisine.

This is a takeaway store, delivering amazing Chinese food to your doorstep. 
We happened to order in from here the last week.
And at the first glace I was very impressed by the packaging. The containers were clean, hardy and the food was steaming hot when it arrived. 
We ordered for Golden fried prawns(came along with garlic dips), chicken lat mei kai, schezwan smoked fish for starters. The fish is highly recommended.
For main course, we opted for chicken hakka noodles, schezwan rice. Loved the quality and quantity of each portions. 
To go along with the grains, we settled for hunan chicken, devil's chicken and fish in chilli oyester sauce.  Each of the heavies had a unique taste and the meat were soft and succulent. 

Great going ‚úî

8. Hot and sour chicken - the sweet and spicy combination in this dish is perfect and the chicken pieces are juicy and are a delight to your taste buds.
9. Fish in chili oyster sauce - The fish was so soft and together with the sauce tasted heavenly. It wasn't very spicy but the schezwan rice and this fish dish are a good combo.
10. Devil's Chicken - if you love spicy food then this is your dish. The devil's sauce with spices makes the chicken fiery and tastes delicious.
The packaging and hygiene quotient is top notch. The quantity is commendable. Each dish can serve 2-3 people. The quality of food is very good. The regular Chinese dishes taste delicious and surely gets a point higher than other joints. The price is also reasonable considering the location of the joint. The food is worth the price. Do order from this joint to serve you with some delicious Chinese cuisine.

This is a takeaway store, delivering amazing Chinese food to your doorstep. 
We happened to order in from here the last week.
And at the first glace I was very impressed by the packaging. The containers were clean, hardy and the food was steaming hot when it arrived. 
We ordered for Golden fried prawns(came along with garlic dips), chicken lat mei kai, schezwan smoked fish for starters. The fish is highly recommended.
For main course, we opted for chicken hakka noodles, schezwan rice. Loved the quality and quantity of each portions. 
To go along with the grains, we settled for hunan chicken, devil's chicken and fish in chilli oyester sauce.  Each of the heavies had a unique taste and the meat were soft and succulent. 

Great going ‚úî

Who doesn't love chinese cuisine? Well i am an ardent lover of chinese food and my eyes landed upon Noodle Mee. Trust me guys, this aint no ordinary food joint. Noodle Mee has the capability to give massive competition to other eatery stations as well. This is a soley delivery and most probably take way joint. This was on my wishlist for a long long time and finally i got the oppurtunity to cherish their chinese delicacies. We ordered a plethora of things and each and every item amazed us by its quality,quantity and freshness. For starters, we had:

Schezwan Smoked Fish: the fish was soft. You can actually get the spicy heat. A lovely dish overall.

Chicken Lat Mei Kai: i loved this one. Crispy chicken tossed in a hot and sweet sauce. Perfect balance of flavours. You get the crispyness as well as the heat  and sweetness -what else do you need? My favourite.

Golden Fried Prawns- the main attraction of the day. Prawns dipped in a batter and fried to golden perfection. It was served with a light spicy dip. The prawn was tender and beautifully cooked. Each and everyone loved this to its brim.

And for lunch, we had:

Szechwan Rice: this is basically more on a spicy note and i loved it. The rice was cooked beautifully and the spicyness was so perfect. Its not overwhelming heat and not sweet too. I absolutely this one.

Chicken hakka noodles: i am not a fan of noodles so i tried a bit. It was good. Noodles lover will surely love this.

Hunan Chicken: this was on milder side. Had a subtle taste. 

Devil's Chicken: as the name goes by,  it has a fiery note to it. Hot and spicy. The chicken pieces were juicy and tender. Loved it.

As i mentioned already, quantity and quality was good. Packaging was good and delivery was definately on time.

Do try this. I am surely you wont be disappointed at all.

Noodle MEE brings to you Chinese and Thai flavours at its best ! I ordered the Chinese food and can I just say that I was in awe of how the food was so fresh and hot when it came home ! 
Coming to the food , I ordered 
*Chicken Lat me kai - Amazing flavour and loved the way the Chicken was cooked. 
*Golden fried prawns - It was hot, crispy and delicious. 
*Schezuan Chilli fish - Spicy and delicious fish. 

Main course 

Hunan chicken : This wasn't spicy or banging with flavour  and was still a welcome dish ! 
Fish in oyster sauce : Absolutely loved how soft the fish was !
Chicken schezuan fried rice and chicken hakka noodles were amazing accompaniments with the dihses ! 

Special mention to the amazing packing and the freshness of the ingredients used.

We were ten people and had ordered lunch from here today. The experience was more than awesome. Their packaging was great and they served piping hot food which excelled both in quantity and quality. Food we ordered :

1. Schezwan smoked fish : Fresh basa cubes that were soft inside and slight crispy outside and tossed in a spicy sauce. It was lip-smacking. My favourite starter of the day! 

2. Chicken lat-me-Kai : Crispy chicken fried and tossed in a hot and sweet sauce. This was great in taste too. 

3. Golden fried prawn : Large prawns fried and served with a gravy like dip. The dip was amazing and went perfectly with the fries. 

4. Chicken Hakka noodles : It was full of chicken chunks. It tasted great.

5. Schezwan chicken fried rice : The flavour was good. It was not too spicy and thus was appropriate for my friends who like it less hot!

6. Hunan chicken : This was comparatively mild in taste. Shredded chicken in a gravy that tasted perfect. 

7. Devil's chicken : Another favourite from the day. Hot and spicy and obviously as I love my sides. 

The best part of them is their quantity. A highly recommended place :)

By far the best food takeaways / home delivery I have ever come across in this city. Noodle Mee will help you get through lunch and dinner when hunger pangs. When it comes to food delivery, the most important thing is that it should be delivered fresh and hot rather than it being stale. There are a lot of other takeaway joints but each of them has some issue or the other, be it a limited variety on the menu or the quality of food delivered. Noodle Mee overcomes all those limitations and provides you the best.

Asian cuisine is my favourite and I have had it delivered to me countless times. Usually its main courses but the starters options I found here were tremendous. Out of the many, my personal recommendations would be Stuffed Mushroom Garlic Pepper, Wanton Spinach & Cheese and Stir Fried American Corn. The quality of these was high enough to match the standards of some leading Asian diners in the city.
Coming to the main course, had the usual Thai Curry with Burnt Garlic Noodles. Even liked the Singhoi Potatoes, purely for its spicy gravy.

Generally I don‚Äôt rate takeaway joints this highly but Noodle Mee certainly deserves it.

Prior to my gastronomic experience at Noodle Mee,  I always stuck to the opinion that dining in experiences are better ,especially when you are ordering crispy prawn or chicken ,wantons etc. I stand corrected after tasting the recently introduced range of starters that  Noodle Mee  has to offer_ ranging  from the delicious  crispy  stir fried prawns, spicy, fiery pepper grilled chicken ,chilli garlic fish, my favourite  of the day spinach and cheese wantons ,steamed chicken momos - probably the best sized ones I have eaten with a moist and juicy inside, stir fried chilli mushrooms and the humble American sweet corn elevated to great taste (stir fried corn- crisp fried in batter) decent serving portions ,lip smacking taste and quick service made me decide that this is going to be a regular if I have to order Chinese. Great taste ,quick delivery service and superior quality of packaging -this is one of the takeaway options that is going to become your go to option to order  mouth watering Chinese fare in aamaar Kolkata.
Go try it out for yourself today.

Kolkata is seeing an upsurge of delivery joints off late as more and more people are choosing takeaways over a dine in! I have always been a fan of dining out but after my experience with Noodle Mee, i have developed a certain love for takeaway joints which offer a plethora of options!  

I am an ardent fan of Chinese, a fussy eater when it comes to choosing the dishes and a hard critic and this place ticked off each and every criteria with perfection!  The packaging was neat and clean and the delivery was just on time!  

I am more of a starter lover than a main course fan and most of the starters which we had ordered were lip-smacking, delicious and the portion which they provide is worth commending. 
The chilli garlic pepper chicken stole the show for me , the pan fried chilli fish was soft with a hint of crunch  it packed a punch basically!  For prawn lovers, the crispy prawn garlic pepper would be a good buy! The steamed chicken momo quite good, it was juicy but i felt the coating could have been abit more thin!  

This place provides an array of veg starters too - we really liked the stuffed mushroom garlic pepper, the spinach and cheese wanton was brilliant and the pan fried chilli tofu is a must have!  
Too many starters?  Well like i said i have a soft corner for starters!  

Coming to the main course, the quantity and quality was unparalleled! The Kung pao chicken and the fish in hot garlic were my personal favourites and are highly recommended! The sweet garlic chicken was quite friendly with my taste buds too!  
The chilli garlic noodles was one of the best that i have had till now. For rice lovers, the mixed rice would be the perfect option - the taste was unparalleled and the quantity was enough for two people!  

This place really knows how to pamper their customers with quality and quantity!  Definitely ordering from this place again!

Situated a minute from the Rabindra Sadan metro station, this place is a take away and delivery joint. So sit back, relax, order and wait for the treat to begin!

Here is what we friends had and is recommended

Starters:

‚Ä¢Chilli garlic pepper chicken- Three simple words- Oh My God! It was one of the finest starters i ever had. It was hot, crisp, perfectly spiced and made me want it more and more.

‚Ä¢Wonton Spinach and cheese- Spinach never ever tasted so good! It has a thin outer fried covering with the filling of spinach and cheese that will blow you away!

‚Ä¢Steamed Chicken momo and Veg Momo- The filling was an amazing one in both of them. The covering was a teensy bit thick though.

Main Course:

‚Ä¢Kung pao chicken: Couldnt get better. It was juicy and full of flavour.

‚Ä¢Singhoi Potatoes: Goes perfectly with the fried rice, though the next item is a must must must order.

‚Ä¢Green Veg curry: Mind=blown! Put it on rice and let your taste buds take an amazing tasteful ride.

‚Ä¢ Chilli Garlic Noodles- Both veg and Chicken: It was as the name specifies and featured sufficient spice and garlic. It was a done deal for me and for all noodle lovers!

To summarise: For me, It was a Home-run!

Dont get it wrong and start searching for the ambiance of this place because they don't have it. Its a take away joint who gives boost for best dinning experience at your home. With all the soothing ambiance you have at your home Noodle Mee's food is the cherry on the cake. Suddenly so many Take aways joints have taken the city by surprise by serving the kind of home based cooked food which is giving the Flavors you need for your taste buds.¬†
God loved me so much that he started showering his love heavily in form of water, despite of the heavy rain nothing stopped the food to reach me.

The food scenes went this way:

1. Crispy Prawn Garlic Pepper : Who doesn't love prawn, i guess 1/100 and when the delicious prawn comes up mingling with the flavors of pepper garlic flakes and wine finished with vinegar and roasted black pepper nothing can stop your mouth utter "WOW".

2. Spinach n cheese fried wantons : Wontons are getting limelight big time now a days and that highlighted too in their menu. Perfect stuffing and fry just did this right. Spinach gave me strength and cheese turned the taste go crazy.

3. Mixed Rice : Fried rice is always in my menu if i m going to have Chinese order. Didn't disappoint me but i guess i could have done much better.

4. Kung Pao Chicken : Szechwan dishes always brings smiles and happiness. Filling the life with Kung Pao spicy style & it complemented the rice very well.

5. Chilli Garlic Noodle : Oh yes the red soldier ready to fire your plate. This is what they say about this. And it shot me down with the taste. Decent one.

6. ¬†Fish in hot garlic sauce : Tremendous. They made me believe that they mean business here. Such spices combining together to give you the feel of garlic and chilli together. It complemented the rice and noodles together. Recommended.

Beautiful i would say. If i ignore the awful weather then it was certainly a beautifully presented and done dinner. kudos to team Noodle Mee..... Keep Surprising meeeeeeee.

Noodle MEE was suggested by a friend to me who ordered frequently from there. Since it was a rainy evening and me and a few friends of mine were in the mood for a movie at home plan, we decided to give this place a try.

For starters we opted for five options that we could binge on throughout the night. The inclusions were :

1. Spinach and Cheese Wanton - Ah, doesnt the name make you hungry already? Without a doubt it  turned out to be perfect. Crisp and full of flavour. You can actually taste the perfect blend of cheese and spinach. 

2. Crispy Prawn Garlic Pepper - Needless to say another favourite of mine. The prawns were done perfectly and the size was neither too big nor too small. Loved it.

3. Stuffed Mushroom Garlic Pepper - My love for mushroom was aggravated further by this dish. Perfectly cooked and sauted.

4. Steamed Chicken Momo - Rain and momos have always been my favourite type of combination. The size was quite good. The stuffing was great, but i feel the layering could have been done better in comparison to their other outstanding starters so far

5. Crispy friend corn kernels - Have been a sucker for this dish ever since Barbeque Nation, and thankfully, this was quite good too.

For the main course, we had quite a few options too.

1. Chicken Chilly Garlic Noodles - It had just the right amount of spice and tasted great.

2. Mixed Rice - It came with the perfect amount of everything. 

3. Fish in Hot Garlic - It went quite well with the fried rice and was soft and devoid of any fishy smell. Yummy!

4. Steamed rice with Thai Curry - This dish deserves a standing ovation. It was mindblowing. The curry is easily comparable to those that I have tried in top notch thai restaurants. You NEED to order this asap.

The quantity of each and every dish was very good. Will reorder from this place soon again.

Time to pig out when the food is free. *wink*
Well I'm happy for getting treated by my friend tonight from this home delivery joint. It's absolutely worth it!
It was a journey from doorsteps to dinner in twenty minutes. And it doesn't have to be difficult to be delicious.
Freshly packed with decent portion of everything that has been ordered. Value for money, undoubtedly.
üîºStarters were excellent.
Chilli garlic pepper chicken was my favourite of all with right amount of spices.
Pan fried chilli fish was getting better with each bite ^_^
Next we placed crispy prawn garlic pepper to keep our tummy happy. Of course it remained insatiable! We wanted more of it ‚ù§
Spinach and cheese wanton was something really different and the one of the best veg momos I've ever had!!
Our starter kit ended with pan fried chilli tofu and it was fabulous on a whole.
üîºMain course looked so appealing even when before it was unpacked. Quality and quantity was equally great :)
*Value for money* as I said.
Even IF you're a non vegetarian please do not skip the Green veg thai curry. Trust me on that and savour it with plain rice without wasting much time.
I found Fish in hot garlic more impressive than the sweet garlic chicken. Succulent meats with decent portion of mixed rice.üëç
Would plan a meet soon, just to give this delivery joint a call and arrange an adda zone at home sweet home over some tempting titbitsüòç

Cant get enough of this place. Its a must have every week. Just love the way they pack the food and the taste is amazing. Their momos are good steamed chicken momos. I love the devils chicken . I feel its better than the one served in barbaque also!!!we have tried the tom yum soul.. its authentic and light but very tangy... the pan fried noodles are good with generous helpings of greens and meat. Fish in chilli wine sauce is just as you would like it. Prawns in chilli garlic sauce is yummy... fresh prawns always... i keep trying new stuff from here and it never lets me down!!! Great going guys... a must try for the ones who havent till now!!! Only deivery or pick up no seating!!

Ordered noodle mee special fried rice ( egg wrapped chicken fried rice ), veg Hakka chow, kung pao chicken and garlic prawns. Food was delivered in pretty good time. The packing of the containers was air tight steam wrapped in plastic as well so the food was hot enough. Kung pao was excellent. Rice was super. Chow was good as well. Prawns however were fried in thick batter and then the Garlic sauce serving was done. I see it all over Kolkata that restaurants try to make the prawns look bigger ( the prawns sent were good in size anyways ). Would have preferred the prawns with the sauce without the batter, which was pretty thick. Hope after this review they can try by giving prawns without the batter. Otherwise a wonderful first experience. Will order again.

Well I'm happy for getting treated by my friend tonight from this home delivery joint. It's absolutely worth it!
It was a journey from doorsteps to dinner in twenty minutes. And it doesn't have to be difficult to be delicious.
Freshly packed with decent portion of everything that has been ordered. Value for money, undoubtedly.
üîºStarters were excellent.
Chilli garlic pepper chicken was my favourite of all with right amount of spices.
Pan fried chilli fish was getting better with each bite ^_^
Next we placed crispy prawn garlic pepper to keep our tummy happy. Of course it remained insatiable! We wanted more of it ‚ù§

Noodle mee¬†

Whenever it comes to Chinese take-aways, this is THE place nowadays & so far we tried the following items:

üî≤ Chicken momos - nice and juicy
üî≤ Drums of hell - good
üî≤ Shanghai chicken - üëåGo for this!!
üî≥ Hakka chow - noodles are nice and thick, not overcrowded with veg and non veg accessories¬†
üî≥ Chinatown Ginger Prawn - üëå üëåtastes like London - Chinatown prawn @mamagotofunasian¬†
üî≥ Crispy chicken in chili honey sauce - hot & sweet, nicely done with vinegar & sesame
üî≥ Pan fried chow - a bit oily of course¬†
üî≥ Chili garlic Noodle - hot & spicy¬†
üî≥ Chef's special fried rice - Da ¬†Best, chicken fried rice covered with a nicely baked omelette napkin üëåüëå must try.¬†
üî≤ Chicken chili - conventional (gravy) good (dry) something I was looking forward to for sometime (manchurian)¬†

Noodle MEE had called for feedback and I had just 1 word to say Superb - in terms of quality, quantity as well as packaging. 1000 bucks you spend is more than enough for 4 people. Im sure, you'll love the experience. ‚ò∫

Ordered Noodle Mee food at a friend's place for a kitty. The food had us bowled over! Amazing chilli garlic noodles- just spicy enough to tingle the palate. The rice was full of vegetables , fragrant and humungous quantity! For starters we had singapore chicken- such a balance of spice and sweet!!
The exotic vegetables in hot garlic sauce were a riot of colours- and so tasty. We had stir fried chicken with chinese greens and steamed lemon fish- some of the friends wanted a healthy option . Each dish lived upto our expectations and much more.

A special mention about the packing- spillproof, neat and done in such a way that food was piping hot when it reached us. Sauces were sent cutely in small bottles. Someone has taken an effort to do things differently.
Each one of us was licking our fingers and were taking down the numbers of the outlet for future use.
Great Stuff Noodle Mee! Keep it up

The noodles were insanely spicy, to the point the spice obliterated all other senses and flavours. Devils Choice and Stuffed Mushrooms were decent. Order the noodles only if your spice tolerance is extremely high.

UPDATE: Vishesh from Noodle MEE just called me up, and has offered to redo my order. I appreciate the gesture on his part. 12/10 for such fantastic customer service. Hoping to order again soon.

It's the best place to order Chinese at home or office. People are always sceptical when having food delivered but Noodle Mee has changed my mindset.
It has been around 5 6 times that I have ordered here past 3 months and each time the food is delectable.
I usually order a starter, chilli garlic noodles and main course. Food is hot compared to other places and palatable. Delivery is within 45 mins and packing is classy and elegant which is not seen from other places. The only drawback is never I had a chance to try their lotus stem in wild pepper and they keep saying menu is being revamped which has not happened until now. However the staff is courteous and helpful. The main advantage being no extra packing charges or service tax apart from the price mentioned. Truly a class.

All you chinese and tibetan food lovers, are you reading?
Risk averse? Try out the veg/non-veg combos, we tried and it was amazing.
Schezwan potato/manchurian veg coins/momo/chili and garlic noodles. Each one so unique i cant wait to try out more dishes this place has to offer.
The owner of this place, Visesh as i recall his name to be, great guy. Was polite enough to come up to us and greet/take feedback from us. Operating out of just a small garage room, this place serves food bang for every buck.
But one thing, this place only delivers so no seating arrangements here to welcome you, but, but let not this deter you from trying out this one amazing of a place.

Tried their dry chilli chicken, drums of hell and their special fried rice. The fried rice comes wrapped in an omelette and was truly delicious.
My only complaint is that they sent the fried rice wrapped in an aluminium foil instead of packing it in a container.. wish they hadn't done that..

Ordered food from this place through Zomato! Well the food no doubt was served post one & half hour of ordering, the food tastes good. I would would suggest the management to look up to their late deliveries and also for making sure you provide with the required cutlery (spoon, fork, etc) along with your delivery. The packaging of food seemed good and to mention it was still warm when received.
So on the whole liked the food. Definitely need to improve on food delivery..

We ordered veg chilly garlic noodles, wok tossed chicken fried rice & pan fried chilly fish. The portion is more than sufficient for 2 adults. Taste of the food is very nice specially the Fried Rice. The best it was among all other items. Pan fried fish had the right balance of flavour & spices.Just missing a bit of crunch in the fish & veg noodles was a bit oily with almost no vegetables. If these small things are taken care of then the score will be a perfect 5. And not to miss we loved the packaging too. Very neat it was.

A must for try for All.

The food reached me within 40 min and was piping hot. Both the quality and quantity was good. They even gave me a bottle of soft drink as a complimentary. Loved the food, especially the Kung pau chicken! Will order again.
P.s. sorry no pics this time..Was too hungry and simply gobbled the food!!

Had a really really nice experience after a long long time after ordering food for home delivery through Zomato from here.Ordered for the first time from here and was rather sceptical though the place reflected a very good average rating. Please find the details below:

Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles-It was with the right amount of chilli and garlic as i love both of them in abundance and it was spot on.However,people who Don t like extremely spicy food will definitely not like it.Good quality and quantity of noodles.

Drums of Hell-Very well marinated and soft pieces of chicken with the right amount of spices.

Dry Chilli Chicken-Again well seasoned and marinated and had a little bit of gravy much to my liking.

Hunan Chicken-A little disappointing as it was not spicy as expected and had a whitish gravy.

Wok Tossed Fried Rice-Great quality of grain and good and neat vegetables.The portion was also very good.

One thing which was really appreciable was the packing which was classy,elegant and definitely stylish which lacks in all places for take aways and home delivery.

The only downside was the price which was a tad high but I can still live with it.

Review Update:
Ordered again a couple of days ago,I guess wi th March 2017 to be precise.Ordered the below and the details follow:

Wok Tossed Fried Rice-It was a Veg option chosen willingly.Had perfect grains as well as quantity.

Hunan Chicken-Strips of Chicken in a gravy with ball peppers but the only downside is the lack of heat!!!

Prawn in Devil Sauce-Perfectly soft and succulent prawns but again lack of heat!!!!

P.S.-Not sure if the Management has intentionally toned down on the heat quotient (coz didn't call and ask for extra heat coz last time it was really hot even without asking for it).

Noodle Mee is an only delivery restaurant which serves up some mouth watering chinese food to the city.

For last nights dinner, we ordered some dishes from here and they all were just amazing, here's the list :

Crispy Mushrooms - These mushrooms were just amazing, they were filled with cottage cheese and carrots, then fried and then tossed in garlic, onions, spring onions etc. Gave it an amazing taste, I'd love to know how they would taste with some lemon grass added into the mix.

Chilli Garlic Noodles - These were just how they are named, full of chilli and garlic. I must warn you though, if you can't handle chilli or can only moderately handle chilli, this dish isn't for you, you should get the burnt garlic and capsicum fried rice instead!

Tsing Hoi Potatoes - These were soft potatoes in Hoisin sauce which tasted amazing and went really well with the noodles.

Another aspect, I must appreciate, is the fact that the packaging was done so well, that the food was HOT (Not warm, hot) till it reached us, now that is some great packaging according to me. Great work by the team that runs this place and hope to visit their restaurant soon enough! :D

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name in both places)

Today ordered hunan chicken, stuffed mushroom, and the noodle Mee signature fried rice from this place. The mushroom preparation was awesome I must admit. A good stuffed bunch of mushroom deep fried and then tossed with pepper n garlic. It was finger licking. Coming to the rice and chicken both were equally good. I must say their packaging is great as they delivered in my office and I travelled with it via metro. There was not a single leakage. The service and staffs are also very cordial. I would be very happy if they also open a store in north Kolkata. I would recommend this place to all for their food, service and uniqueness. Uma Chattopadhyay

Ordered food online. I didn't expect such good service during durga puja but the experience was good beyond expectations. The food was packed very efficiently. The food came in black plastic containers well-wrapped in plastic foil wraps. We had ordered honey chili potatoes, Hunan chicken, burnt ginger and capsicum fried rice. All these costed us Rs. 600/-. The quantity was just huge. Enough for 4persons. Food was tasty but I wish the honey chili potato had less honey. It was way too sweet. Overall good experience.

I have been ordering from this place for quite sometime now and seems to be high time that I give them a review. This is one of my top Chinese goto place now. 

I have tried several dishes and all seem to be good. However I am partial to their Pepper Fried fish, golden fried prawn, dry chilli chicken and Kung Pao chicken. In veg, the crispy chilli babycorn and stuffed mushrooms are delicious. The fried rice seems a bit bland so I prefer their schezwan rice instead. The quantity is good enough for 2 

The packaging is excellent and delivery is always prompt. Not sure how they manage It but the food always arrives piping hot. Bolstered by my personal experience, I had contacted them for a lunch party in my office for about 25 staffs and each one of them praised the food.

Thanks for your service till now and I hope that you continue the same quality going forward. Cheers!

Delicious pan fried momos, the best part being they're delivered at your home yet so fresh and not at all soggy . The best Chinese place for home delivery! I will surely recommend this place , I haven't visited so can't comment on the ambiance and staff but I can surely vouch for the neatly packed yummy food !

Noodle MEE is my all time favourite for ordering Chinese. The food they deliver makes a dull day at office worth looking forward to.
I have ordered quite a few items from their menu. I would give them a thumbs up for quality consistency above all. The portion size is very good. The packaging is neat.

My favourites from the menu are

Starters:
The stuffed mushrooms garlic pepper
Potato and broccoli in honey sauce
The pan fried momos( a must must try)

Main course:
Tsing hoi potatoes
Potatoes in hot garlic sauce
Vegetable coins in Manchurian sauce

Wok tossed Fried rice
Pan fried noodles
Chilli garlic noodles

And a special mention goes out to the Red Thai curry ( Excellent)

I love the combos they offer ( available only at lunch time)
The first time I ordered from this place, I ended up ordering 3 days in a row.
I have never tried takeaway...it's always been delivery for me. The phone is answered in a courteous manner by well informed people.
I just love ordering food from here.

I was in Kolkata and I was craving to have Chinese food, Upon my friend's recommendation I ordered from this delivery outlet. I ordered a crispy chicken in chilly honey sauce along with chilly garlic noodles. The quantity was enough and the quality was superb. The food was beyond satisfaction. This outlet has won my heart and I would definitely order from it again on my next trip to Kolkata.

The first day, when i tried noodle mee, that day food was exceptional. I loved crunchy braised lemon chicken, kung-pao chicken , hunan-chicken, chicken noodles . But the second day food wasn't at all up-to-the-mark. Infact it was not good. I would request please maintain your consistency . I loved everything whatever i had on the first day.

Recently my cousin and I decided to order from this delivery outlet after hearing about them and reading their reviews. Though the food took longer than usual to get delivered the food was a total win win! 
The chilli chicken, Kung pao chicken and chilli garlic noodles were a perfect blend of flavours. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the noodles were not too spicy at all. We thoroughly enjoyed the three dishes we ordered and look forward to ordering food from them more regularly.
We would definitely recommend this place to all Chinese food lovers!
Keep up the good food!!!

It was a Sunday afternoon and I felt like ordering some food home delivered! Was browsing through Zomato and came across noodle me which I had heard a lot about! So ordered a kung pao chicken / cottage cheese in hot garlic sauce and spicy prawns accompanied by veg hakka noodles. Have to say that this is one of the best Chinese I've had in a really long time. Their packing was fantastic and it retained the heat well. Usually Chinese food doesn't taste as good if not eaten immediately but the food here was piping hot and tasted brilliant. Their sauces were just perfect and the pieces were well cooked. Big ups to the team for such fantastic food! Glad that Kolkata has such an amazing home delivery place. Even the prices were perfect for the quality of the food!

Months later, I guess I have to edit my review. Utterly disappointed by todays food. March 12, 2016 evening, had ordred an egg pan frird noodles, hunan chicken, chicken fried rice, dry chilly chicken & chicken lemon coriander soup. The did deliver the foos on timr but they forgot to deliver the noodles & sent the gravy instead. We were shocked at the dinner table so called on their numbers & they did NOT respond! Quite a shocking return. Have to think well before ordering anything or recommending it to a friend. This sheer lack of communication was expected to the least!

Noodle MEE is among the better food joints to order in from. Because I haven't been there, I can only say so much about them.

Their chowmein is at par with Chowman, and when served hot, there are few places better. They serves plenty per serving, and each plate of chow is understandably plenty for 2. Their sides (Chicken) are alright at best. You can find better for less, but it's worth trying it out once.

Good food, definitely worth trying.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made. :)

Finally a Chinese takeaway/delivery joint which serves lip smacking food near my area! Ordered from here last week. My order was their noodle mee recommended stuffed mushrooms, noodle mee recommended tsing hoi potatoes, burnt ginger capsicum rice and chilli garlic noodles.
The food came packed in neat packages and I must mention that the packing was good. Presentation wise it looked like some takeaway from a new York eatery! Those cute little bottles with Chinese staple sauces is a good idea.
Coming back to the food, I loved what I had ordered and a special mention to the tsing hoi potatoes and ginger capsicum rice! The food was prepared well and flavours were spot on!.
The portions are good and our order was sufficient for our hungry lot!
Pricing is quite justified and is reasonable considering the quality!
Ordering again and again and again!!
Keep it up guys! :)

After a long time had a chinese meal worth remembering and recommending.  Had ordered just basics like noodle rice manchurian and schezwan panner. Right from the packaging till the meal its excellent. There's freshness and taste in the food which now days are rarity. Panner was soft and spicy. Both the noodle and rice were absolutely yummy. Manchurian was also nice. Would certainly be placing repeat order very very soon.

From placing the order to having it, no complaints. The noodles were great however the vegetable coins could have been better. The coins were a little extra dry from inside. The lunch combo is completely apt for anyone having lunch solo. Quantity, quality and taste of each item of noodles/rice, manchurian and momo is worth every penny spent. It is a must try. This place never fails to get my appeciation for their food. Kudos to the great packaging techniques, its impressive. 

P.S. do not miss the crispy chilli babycorn.

Ordered a delivery. So the review doesn't include ambience or service speed. 

‚Ä¢Chicken Lat Me Kai
Laiden generously with spring onions, this is a very different tasting version of the famous Lat Me Kai. 
Presentation - 4/5
Taste - 3.6/5

‚Ä¢Noodle Mee Fried Rice
This is basically a mixed fried rice served wrapped in an light fluffy omelette. Amazing to taste. I had asked them specifically to add chicken to it. 
Definitely a must try.
Presentation - 4.5/5
Taste - 4.6/5

Well packaged, amazing tasting Chinese food for a small pocket pinch.

Definitely going back to try more!

1. Timely delivery
2. Piping hot food
3. Tasty food
4. Generous portions
5. Very good packaging.¬†

This is the first time I have seen neat packaging with little plastic bottled for vinegar and soya sauce instead of the pouches that are impossible to pour without spilling and messing your hands!¬†

A great experience. Will definitely order again :-)

No doubt the food is good the chilli garlic noodles and the devil's choice were the best, i didn't like the veg fried rice much. The quantity and quality of food was very good.

I recently came across this new place in town Noodle Mee who deliver your chinese food to any part of Kolkata other than saltlake i suppose. They dont have a dine in facility right now. Just to try out their service we ordered a lunch in our office. We were not expecting it to be any different from other food joints who deliver the food in offices and our homes. But to our utter surprise the food was delivered on time and was packed so nicely that it was still hot. Their Momos are a bit costly compared to other vendors in the market but their momos are pretty big in size and very filling. Their dish Devils Choice is probably one of the best in town. Even their Pan fried noodles and chilli garlic noodles were simply wow. Though their Fried Rice was very bland and tasteless. We had ordered a burnt ginger garkic fried rice. Try out noodle mee and i dont think you will regret it. Their portions are pretty large and one plate of noodles is enough for two people.

The quality of ingredients used are very good and the food no doubt is extremely good. Keep ordering form here as I stay in the same building where noodle me is loll. Have tried a couple of their dishes but simply love their chilli garlic noodles,pan fried noodle, pan fried chilli fish. rest of the dishes are also really good. Great place to order good Thai and Chinese dishes.

Home delivery!!!
There is a lot to say about this place and this new trend of home delivery that has taken over Calcutta!!
Just had a meal from noodle mee and as a chef I would rate it under the following heads:
Food - outstanding
Quality - highest
Quantity - more than enough and worth the price
Presentation - home delivery presentation is based on        
                        the packaging which is pretty good
Service - can't ask for better. I believe you should wait    
                For the best. Nonetheless quick

Let's go on with its favourite --- kung paox chicken, singhoi chicken is highly recommended with its favourites chilli garlic noodles and fried rice. Pan fried momos and fried prawns are to die for. 
Hot and sour soup was high in flavour and quantity but on a sweeter side which gets the rating to 4.5.. 
But the place is a must try and highly recommended at least by me. Don't just go by the price but also the amount of quantity and quality of ingredients used.
Brilliant experience üòÉ

I had given up on home delivery food, until someone mentioned Noodle Me (NM). I tried it last week (apprehensively). Ordered 5 dishes.... not knowing what to expect. 
Was very pleasantly surprised. Food was amazing!!¬† Almost 5 star quality (but not that expensive). They delivered on time so that was a relief. 
Best dish was the Thai curry and the pan fried noodles and momos. 
They dont hold back on good veggies and food tasted like it does at Mainland China or Chinoiserie. Very surprising in a delivery place.....
Recommended it to my neighbour too.... they said the same stuff .... so I know its not just me.

First time that i tried this place was three weeks ago & turned out to be really decent. This is probably the only delivery restaurant which delivers fresh food in the afternoons as well. ¬†The best part was that i was starving and requested them to get the food delivered asap & they made it did happen (Food was delivered withiin ¬†20-25 mins). Packaging was nice and glad the food was not spilling out.¬†
Kung pao chicken & firecracker corn is what i ordered and glad that it dint disappoint me. For people like me who are skeptical about ordering from different places- id suggest you definitely give this one a try. Its worth your money.
For a place like chowringhee Road where you have ample of options to choose from, this most definitely comes in my top 5.

So to start with this is a new place in this area that serves you chinese food. Well i ordered from this place yesterday and to start things off i ordered the dry chilli chicken it was very tasty, had the right amount of chillies and succulent boneless chicken made for a great starter. Next upi had the wok tossed chicken hakka noodles which was nicely done, not too oily and for the sides i had the devil's fish which was tasty as well.. so overall a satisfying meal would ¬†order from here again.

He wanted to get some yum food but pay day was yet to come.. Then he got a call from his guru" beta call noodle mee".. What an idea sirji.. Well next best thing happened in India after me is noodle me.. Hahahah sorry for such a bad story but bottom line awesome food + great staff = good happy society .. Great job guys

2 Hours to Deliver, need I say more. They expect you to order lunch at breakfast time and dinner at the time of lunch, and maybe then we can expect to get the food delivered by next day.

We had ordered food for 4 couples and preferred to follow their suggestions. I must say the food was excellent, especially the prawns (surprisingly large sized), and the chicken, ¬†and the quantity was way beyond what we had expected. Whats more, their delivery person was very courteous and the food reached right at the time we had asked them deliver.
We would definitely recommend Noodle Mee to anyone looking for good value for money.

This is a very new place and i know this place will do well. The chinese and the quality of food is very good and fresh.
Though they just do home delivery i would like them to open a sitting area.
The best part was their food was hot and i couldn't imagine that the food will be this hot .
I will try the non veg soon but the vegetarian is also very tasty and good.
Keep up the good work and also would recommend people to try this new place when they dont feel like going out.
Tried the non veg was really good enjoyed it a lot a perfect sunday dinner.
