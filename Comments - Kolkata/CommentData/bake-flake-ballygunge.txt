Saviour. Sreyoshi is a saviour. I had to send a Birthday cake for my friend's birthday today and I couldn't get any decent places to deliver a cake in her area. She stays in Naktala. I had thoughts of using swiggy to send pastries as a last resort but I came across this place and after reading the reviews I went ahead. I called her yesterday and placed an order and by today 12:30 my friend cut her cake. I had ordered the Chocolate truffle cake. The look was very neat and clean. My friend said it was very soft and nice. I am really grateful to Bake Flake for helping me with this.
Thank you so much. :-)

Awesome varieties. Loved their bakery products, fresh and quality product, I would rate it more than KookieJar. Everyone should try their products , Currently only one outlet at CCFC available. Looking forward for their retail outlet.

A "fresh feel" about Bake Flake products. For all those whose love for good cakes died along with Kookie Jar, one must visit the outlet at CCFC. The quality, taste and price of their savouries and desserts are very well balanced. Lemon tarts, chocolate pyramid and quiche are a must try. ...

Good items from fresh ingredients. They know the art, they make it good. 

Appears as if they bake with love.

I have been there with friends.
Best thing is they are open to suggestions.
And most importantly great taste and good value for money.....


😊

A must try for their gooey chocolate cake, delicious pastries & patties! Love munching titbits from this lovely little bakery . The assorted breads & cookies are an absolute wonder & the cheesy white pasta is to die for, yum! :)
