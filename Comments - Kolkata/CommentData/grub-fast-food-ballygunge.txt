I have grown up eating their food...üòÅüòÅüòÅ
Located 2 mins from my house...this is the best budget friendly fast food shop in our locality...hands down my friend... :) 

My favourite dishes here are :-

Chicken Chowmein(Hakka or Gravy anyone..
Both are great) ...Quantity is superb for the price n taste is also commendable for sure...



Chicken Lollipop -- Bang for the buck...Super tasty tangy generous sized lollipops... just too good :)

Chicken Cutlet-- Another tasty one n super value for money dish..

Fish Fry and Fish Fingers -- Both are equally good and tasty :)

Crispy Chicken-- Maybe priced 10-20 rs more i feel...but worth it...Quantity is generous and no complaints on taste for this one too...

Chilli Chicken(Gravy)-- This is one of their signature dishes for sure...atleast for me...They specially make this non-spicy for me and with extra gravy..cuz the gravy is awesome... :) But u can have it spicy too...

Chicken Manchurian-- This one is also another signature dish... Gravy is just too good on this one too and a bit thicker than the chilli chicken's one...

Fried Rice -- Mixed Chicken or Veg...U can order any one of them...and you won't be disappointed with either of these...neither in taste nor in quantity...

Chicken Chow Chow Fried Rice-- Now this one is a bit different item...basically its fried rice and chowmein mixed...yeah sounds weird i know...but it tastes fine...
Yeah it may feel a bit dry...so you may want a gravy item with it...or atleast some sauce to cover it up... :)

Rolls-- Their rolls are very much filling but i dn't like the parathas of their rolls...

American Chopsuey-- This is also very nice :) 

Prices are really reasonable and quality and quantity are also very satisfactory...rare combination indeed :)

Now they have also started making some good Momos..though i feel the soup can be better...the momos are nice... :) 

Thats Grub's best items for you from one of their most regular customers from a very long time... :)

Good Food ,sufficient quantity and affordable prices...... these 3 qualities define this place. Located @ Broad Street (oppostie to Ripose Nursing home) which is quite close to my house. This a takeaway joint but they also have home delivery service. My favorite dish here is¬† fried rice and dry chilly chicken. Their Gravy Noodles is also quite decent. You can also try their schezwan , hot garlic chicken and crispy chicken. One of their biggest plus points is that they maintain their quality of food during the festival times as well.

Grub is a great option for getting home delivery in and around Ballygunge area. They make excellent dry chilli chicken, crispy chicken, gravy noodles and fried rice.. I am not very fond of their Hakka noodles. Their chicken cultet and fish roll are also nice.. Prices are very reasonable.

The food is within budget and the quality is pretty good.. We frequently order Chinese from this take away service. You should definitely try their awesome Thai soup and tasty veg chop suey..

Good for take away or home delivery.

I have had Paneer Roll, Vegetable Haka Noodles, Vegetable Gravy Noodles, and Crispy Chilli Babycorn. They serve pretty decent tasty Chinese food. Paneer Roll is a little dry but still my favourite here.

Kathi Rolls used to be quite good but not any more - deteriorated taste & quality, and overpriced. As far as the Chinese fare is concerned, this place is just another neighbourhood Chinese Dhaba.

although there is nothing special about this place, but given the rates the quality it serves it quite good. i used to frequently stay over at a friend's place in old ballygunge. on many unplanned nights, simple chicken in noodles, rice and with gravy in garlic, and hot and sour sauce was our staple menu. the home delivery is okay. try it for the fast grub, as it says.
