Haven't been to the outlet but have made a zomato order multiple times, thanks to zomato treat, they serve 4 gulab jamuns on every order, tried chats,  fruits, south a Indian and Chinese from this place. 
Dosa from here became too soggy on arrival so I avoid this place for dosas though.
Baby corn is okies, quantity very less, noodles was plain, less vegetables. Fruit salad is the best and my regular order, at 50rs you get ample amount and varieties of fruits, coming to the chats papdi chat is the one to try first.

Though zomato offers hot gulab jamun as treat but, never got my gulab jamuns hot. Special mention to the staff here, highly cooperative when editing orders that adds an extra point to this place.

Good food. But why would you charge me 10 rupees for packing of a roasted papad in an envelope?

You call this cheese, chilli, toast?
I never had a worse cheese chilli toast ever. The quantity is nothing compared to what even a roadside place gives.

I ordered a white pasta and a plain dosa. Dosa was good at both quality and quantity, but pasta was very less in quantity. Ambience is good, spacious, staffs are well behaved and helpful. service was bit slow.

Food is average, we ordered cheese masala dosa which costs rs 120, tastes average bit overpriced. We can get better cheese masala dosa St this price in kol. Chole bhature was also average. The bhature is nothing but a big poori and not bhatura, chole was too bland. Overall one should go if u don't have any other option and wanna grab a quick bite in between office work.

Located in the working hub , dalhousie , this is a lovely outlet. I visited this outlet the last day . I was impressed at the hostility of the waiters. We ordered a hakka noodles, cheese grilled toast and a cheese dosa. The quality and quantity were both good. And they served it in a very presentable manner. The noodles were yummy and so fresh, the toast was good too and the dosa was crispy and all the chutneys and sambar were great.

Went there for lunch and ordered their special veg Thali.. The service was tad slow.. The Thali had 1 masala kulcha 1 naan 1 daal 1 paneer 1 mix veg 1 Chana masala. A gulab jamun n papad achar.. It all looked nice n tasted good.. It was more than enough for the two of us.. The place was pretty packed.. They need to increase the temp of the ACs though.. The best part was there was no tax.. So the pockets pinch wasn't much.. It was total paisa vasool. Now the no tax bill was a gst thing or permanent that I can't really say.. All over really nice experience.. Worth a visit during the lunch hours in the busy office para area..

Located at Dalhousie, just opposite Gillander House, this new place was pretty packed when I went there for lunch today. Had the Grilled Club Sandwich, and not only was it plated prettily but was quite good too. The service is very quick and the menu, though all vegetarian, offers variety.

Busy Bites has been an absolute game changer for lunch/snacks in the busy N.S. Road and a big break from roadside food - which was the only option in the area

The restaurant is air-conditioned however they can improve it by keeping it at the lowest temperature rather than saving their bills by keeping it at 24 degrees.

The sitting slace is sufficient with big tables and prompt service. Service can get a tad bit slow at times but nothing which would upset you.

The quality of food and the style of service is also quite amazing. The south indian food is served with three chutneys and sambar and all the items are equally good. Especially the Molagapuddi Idly and Tomato Rice. Dosas are also good.

The bigger veg thali is sufficient for two and is quite good for the price. Chinese is good too as is Mexican Hot Pot, Veg Stroganoff with Herbed Rice.

All in all, most of the items on the menu are good for the price especially in a busy office area like this with the ac bringing in a lot of relief.

This place has two positives: its awesome location and it is air-conditioned. It is near RBI and walkable distance from the bus terminus/Writers' Building. Nearest bus stop is Fairlie towards Howrah on Stand Road.

Now to the food. It's a vegetarian restaurant serving Indian and Indo-Chinese food. Taste is chatpata and caters to the popular palate. Nothing remarkable. Hawkers just outside the door serve better fare. But they don't have air-conditioning.

Ever heard of the term 'male bimbo'? Waiters here are just that. They stare at your lips while you are telling them what to eat. You have to repeat your order at least four times before your words penetrate their cranium.

Will I go back? No

The newly opened restaurant is situated in the busy office area of Dalhousie.
The decor is pretty simple.
The staff is not courteous and a bit rude too.
Now to the food...
Some of the food items are just okayish with substandard quality evident.
Bought a plate of spring rolls and oil was dipping from the rolls.
The grilled sandwich was only half-grilled.
The quantity of the pasta that I'd bought was very less compared to other restaurants or cafes with a similar price-tag, moreover, it wasn't that great too.
South Indian and Chinese dishes are kind of good.
Thali is bit too exorbitantly priced, other eateries provide the same (even more) quantity at relatively cheaper rates without compromising on the quality.

Since, it is a new place, expect that the management would look into the issues and come up with solutions.

Good joint for business people. 
Neat clean place for VEG food. 
Decent service and rates.
Dal, biryani, kesar tea, paneer bhujji are good.
Rumali roti and sattu roti not up to mark.
Cutlery and plate washing needs more care.
Local delivery is prompt and free.

We ordered a Thali and Chinese combo. All the items in the thali were tasty and decent quantity. You can choose any 3 items out of the Chinese menu for the combo which is very nice of them. We choose Hakka noodles, Veg Manchurian and Schezuan Chilli Baby Corn. The Noodles and babycorn were decent. However, I didnt enjoy the Veg Manchurian as much. The manchurian were too spicy and the manchurian balls were not cooked properly. All in all a pure veg restaurant near strand road area in itself is a Thumbsup!
