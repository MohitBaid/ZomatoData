The Ambience was good and so were the hookah, the extra refill was like the cherry to the chocolate cake, pretty affordable, food was average. :)

Used to go there when I was in school, the place used to be really good but now it's not as popular as it was before, better hookah parlours available. But if you're low on cash, Katerpillar is the best choice

This is located in CA block. I wanted to visit this cafe for a long time and finally last week i did. They have decorated their cafe nicely. The ambience is good. The service is also good. They serve good hookah with affordable price.

The place is sickening. Literally. I got back home only to get awfully sick. Had ordered a pasta, blue lagoon , a hookah and a green apple soda(which we barely touched) . Me and brother both have been throwing up like insane. The place really needs to be checked for quality control.

Location : near CA island, Saltlake sector 1

Speciality : hookka

Ambience : not that good, shabby, broken seats, full of smoke without proper ventilation

Expenses : Pocket friendly

Food : strictly Ok vegetarian food. We ordered garlic cheese bread, chili garlic haka noodles, cheese pasta, Mint mojito, kiwi shake. Servings were really big.

Hooka: flavour was good but the coal stays only for 15 mins which is really a drawback.

Parking : Not at all a problem

Don't go here if you don't like congested places, uncomfortable seating and poorly ventilated place especially when it serves hookah. The place is very noisy and small. Although the food is okay.
