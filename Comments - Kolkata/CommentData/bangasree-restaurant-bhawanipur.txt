Simple take away outlet.. They do have sitting arrangement but its hardly for 10-12 people.. When you roam around hungry thinking what to eat in between dinner and snacks, while having the last few coins in your pocket, you must try the chicken chowmein here which comes just for ₹50, not much oily..
Except this, you may try fish fry, fish finger, dry chilli chicken..
Once took chilli paneer and was totally disappointed as the paneer had a very bad odour coming out from it.. So please avoid paneer items here..
Good for quick snacks in low budget..

I've seen people who can't even spell restaurant criticize this place saying it's horrible!! Well we must understand that this place isn't meant for luxury dining. It is mainly a take-away outlet, with a few tables for people who like to have a little something on the go.

Now, this used to be my go-to place during my college years, when I used to live near Maddox Square. Almost every other evening I used to buy an egg chicken roll, or have a fish kabiraji here. Me and my PG mates often used to order fried rice and chili chicken for dinner, or just plain steamed rice and mutton for lunch. The taste is great, but the food is very very affordable. You won't find a place easily in South Calcutta where they give you egg or chicken rolls at such cheap price.

Even the mutton curry is relatively cheap and quite tasty. The kabiraji and chicken pakoras too. The momos are delicious and finish very quickly. I think I have had almost every item on the menu in my 3 years of college, and it was all worth it.

This is a small Chinese restaurant, permitting only takeaway, located near Lansdown market next to the UBI ATM. Being a small roadside joint, I had never thought of having food from here, as there are better options in the vicinity. But when a friend of mine suggested this place, I decided to give it a try. I took home a parcel of chicken fried rice n chilli chicken. Well, if u r expecting the food to taste like that in a dine in restaurant then just forget this place but at such a cheap price, this tasted far better than what I had expected from here. The rice was fragrant with generous chicken chunks. The chilli chicken was great, though somewhat extra spicy. The combo of both was great. Also the quantity of fried rice was more than enough for me and the chilli chicken had around eight large chicken chunks. Overall, the food was really nice. Would try the other dishes next time !

A small restaurant as well as a take away counter. The food here is really good and the price is very affordable. The quantity of fried rice and chowmein is very much satisfiable. Home delivery is also available. Also if you want a quick bite, this is one place to be in.

This one's not for the "classy" ones. A small take away counter located diagonally opposite the southern samity ground. This place serves decent quality food specially if you consider the price. It is extremely extremely cheap. Rolls, pakora, fried rice are some of the items that I personally like a lot. The gravy chicken dishes are okayish.
Overall it's a decent one, but as I said not one for the "classy" people.

Having snack and major meals from this next door restaurant for the last 2 decades. The present owner is my childhood pal and he had successfully reformed this joint in the last 20 years. Delicious dishes (Indian & Chinese), reasonable pricing, friendly staff are few of it's good qualities. Bangasree Restaurant undoubtedly is among the most popular food joints in it's category. I wish they'll come up with a bigger place soon, where families can visit and celebrate food. It's just a hole in the wall at the moment and hence it's more of a take away counter.
