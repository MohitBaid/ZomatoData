Ordered strawberry with ice cream and fruit custard.
Strawberry with ice cream was simply great.
Fruit custard was also good.
Staffs are very nice.

The smallest joint who serves some delicious shakes, ice-cream & waffles.For ambience you have the Ecospace amphitheatre so no separate point on that.Coming to the food should try their cookie Sunday.Topped with cookies,dry fruits,vanilla ice cream,It's a must try. Another hit is their mocktails Red devil.Could also try their waffles.4 out of 5.coming to service they have only a man power of 3 people,still they are quite fast some times they are bit slow when they are crowded. So a 3 out of 5.

This is located inside my office which is in Gitanjali Park. I loved their drinks named after Game of Thrones. It's not because it was named after Game of  Thrones but it tasted good too. They change their daily menu for desserts which can be tried too.

Visited the place recently (multiple times) and their shakes are to die for! Would recommend the Cheesecake shake and Ice Cream Waffwich.
The pricing is better than other outlets near by.

I have tried the Cheesecake Shake, Cookie Crumble Shake, Nutella waffle, Ice Cream​ Waffwich and Green Apple Mojito. All of them were really great. 

Will keep visiting to try other items from their vast menu.

Nice little place inside Eco Space.
Reasonable price.
The shakes,Mojitos and Lemonades are really really good.
This place is a must try.
Maybe they should increase the number of staffs for a bit fast serving.

Sippy is the latest addition to the food court of Calcutta's very own IT hub and it's quite refreshing. They have quite a variety of shakes, juices, coolers even waffles on their menu but what caught my eyes first was their GOT Special Cooler menu. Marketing done right! For day one me and my friend went for their Cookie Crumbled Shake priced at 75 suggested by them. It was smooth, tasty and good enough to crave for their other offerings. Will be back soon to taste more of them.

Stopped by this stall inside Ecospace after lunch one fine day. They serve only shakes and waffles. Being full, we did not try waffles, but ordered 5 shakes and coffee among 6 of us.Among the shakes, I liked the Blonde Next Door and cold coffee. The service is a little slow. Hope to visit again soon!

This tiny stall is located inside the Ecospace complex. Tried some of their shakes. Pretty decent, and very refreshing. 

Recommendations: The Blonde Next Door Shake and the Oreo Shake!

Amazing location yes it's in my workplace so great for me. We had availed the offer of buy 2 get one free mand ordered the strawberry mojito . It was really refreshing one and we saw it getting prepared in front of our eyes. Hygiene wise top notch based on the location and size of the outlet. The best part was the mango ice cream with caranel sauce that is just a treat to your taste buds that takes dessert to a different level. Overall it was an awesome experience highly recommended. Improvement can be done if more varieties of juices can be provided and complete list of the menu is usually unavailable ( especially fresh fruits )
