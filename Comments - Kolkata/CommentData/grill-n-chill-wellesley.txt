Ordered their veg pizza yesterday and it is easily one of the worst decisions I ever made. It was cold, dry and tasteless and definitely too small a portion. Will never ever order from here again.

Located near bata more at rafi ahmed kidbai road..
Relatively small seating area.. perfect for hang out with friends... Perfect place for snacks..
I visited this place many times. I like their fast service and nice attitude towards their customers.. i had tried many of their items like chiken sandwich, chicken burger, french fries, wai wai, fresh lime soda etc..
All the items are tasty and Delicious.. booth quality and quantity are satisfactory within a reasonable price range.. if you wanna have nice evening snacks in low budget then this is the perfect place for you...

This small cafe is near my school. Have been there a number of times. 
White sauce pasta, pepper chicken, chicken sandwich, chicken burger, fresh lime soda, garlic bread, chicken cheese pizza - all the items are really good. The quantity is not at par with the prices, though. 
Staffs are courteous.

Although relatively small seating space, the place has good food on offer. Located on Syed Amir Ali Aveneu, the place is good for evening snacks. We ordered the mixed sauce pasta and chicken cheese sandwich. Both of them were yumm and the staff is also very cooperative. There are offers available as for the combo packs and it's very affordable and pocket friendly.
A must visit!

This is a small outlet near Bata more. A perfect place to hang out with couple of friends. You can easily locate the place even. Let's come to the point one by one .
The ambience is great , the place have been nicely setup with few stools and tables to sit around with friends and couple of food quotes to discuss about even , which gains customer attention. 
The food is catchy , you will like it and it won't pinch your pocket even . Seeing the quantity and quality it's worth the money .
The service is too good , the owner who handles the cash counter is a very humble person himself and helps you out in everyway , and the other staffs also engages you in the conversation so to keep you busy .
In short a must try place if you pass by the outlet ☺

A cool place to hangout with friends. Had been there to grab something after college. Tried their cheese chicken burger, chicken pizza and brownies with chocolate sauce. They were quite good. The price is pretty good too from a student's point of view. Wouldn't repent going again.

A bunch of us school friends checked in this place. Easy on the pocket, this place offers a variety of items.
We were about 8 people and barely fitting inside.
Ordered a Chicken Steamed Momo, Chili Garlic Maggi, Chicken Burgers with French Fries, Cold Coffee and Fresh Lime Soda.
I mostly liked all the food items.
But the drinks were okay.

Located conveniently near my school, I went this evening to try their burger.
I ordered their Double Layered Non-Veg Burger for takeaway as the place was too small and barely 6 people can sit comfortably.
Coming to their burger, I tasted no chicken in the patty, the aforesaid 'chicken' patty tasted more like Aaloo patty and that too, two layers of it.
Items are reasonably priced, but if their costliest burger tastes bland, I don't know what else to say.
You can go for a quick bite but don't go with high hopes like I did.

Small joint on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. Meant for take away - however there are places to seat for 8. 

I love their Veg Cheese Corn Sandwiches. 

Would try their Pasta soon & update my experience here...

Hygienic live counter - 

You can have good combo offers as well.

LOCATION
This new joint is located in Rafi Ahmad Kidwai Road near the Infamous Bata Mod, well we still call it Bata Mod even after Bata shut down at this location years ago. Some Things shouldn't change. 

FOOD
The Menu is quite simple, not confusing at all. This place has to offer most of trending fast food items. They have Sandwiches, Burgers, Pizzas & Garlic Bread, Pasta, Maggi & Wai-Wai, Momos, Fries & Shakes. They also have Economical Combos.
I personally don't understand the concept of ordering instant noodles from Restaurants, I mean I am not saying they won't taste good, they probably will, and this place has quite a few options, but for me the thought is plainly revolting. My first orders from all new places have pretty safe choices, I am not a Dare-Devil when it comes to ordering from new joints. So I ordered a few Chicken Burgers & Chicken Steam Momos.

Chicken Burger - The Burger was prepared fresh. The patty was made from Chicken Mince & it was still crispy when delivered. They serve it with Mayo & Mainstream Toppings like Onions, Green Belle Peppers, Tomatoes & Lettuce. There so many places offering Burgers, that it is almost impossible to decide which one is best. The burger was good, I would definitely get it again. 

Chicken Steamed Momos - I love Steamed Momos, and this place has nice Momos to offer. The filling has a proper ratio of Chicken:Onion, (well you know how some places stuff it with truck loads of onions to increase the volume) & it was generous too. The flavors were subtle but the Sauce provided was Spicy, Piquant & Delicious!

I will definitely try more stuff, and will order these dishes again. I really hope they maintain their Quality & Freshness. I do recommend both the dishes I tried. 

AFFORDABILITY 
The prices are pretty Reasonable. 

AMBIANCE 
I haven't had a chance to visit this place, I ordered the food at home, so I really don't have much to say. Moreover it is the taste of the Food I am more concerned with.

SERVICE
Delivery took about 20-30 minutes, and everything was packaged properly.  A very Sweet Lady took my orders and she was cooperative.

PS: Yeah, I know a few pictures would have been more helpful, but I ate everything before I could click pictures. 

Capisce! ;)
