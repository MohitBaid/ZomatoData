Went into this lounge last weekend with all office team members. Not my initial choice but we all like to agree with ladies else we can be called uncouth! We all went on the machan which has an interesting view of the tiny dance floor. Liquor was at throw away price of 100 bucks a peg (large). Problems begin when we decided to order food & hookah. I think flavor of the hookah was 'Make me Cough Loud'. Food was literally thrown away. Chicken, Fish, Baby corn all were BAD! Recommendation: Go only with people with whom you don't want to talk (Loud music won't let you anyway)

Pls don't open such places if u all are not capable of doing so.Very highly priced for the quantity they serve its much better at a roadside restaurant than your lounge.And the atmosphere is just pathetic with loud music and Dim lights.

It was my first and last and ofcourse worst experience eating in Zion Lounge.....If u people are searching for some rubbish food, this is the best place u will find. I would have rated this place as 0.0 but there was no option for that, so thought of giving them a rate of 1.0 so there bloody reputation is maintained.

Not a very pleasant experience. Today i visited this place with my boyfriend...The lounge is not at all spacious..we ordered chilly fish and crispy chilly babycorn...the fish was charged 300 bucks..but it wasn't tasty at all...the fish gave a stale smell...the crispy chilly babycorn was comparatively better.. the hookah was charged high and was not upto the mark...it actually burned a hole in my pocket..

Ordered ------ Chilli Chicken dry , Mixed Hakka Noodles , Tuborg Beer


The PROS :- Only low cost bar that opens during noon in this area. Food was good, Price was fine. Staff were fine too. 


The CONS :- They need to improve their decor. They should recheck the songs they played. It is nothing like a lounge but only a bar & restaurent. Food quanity was not that good.

Close your lounge and open a tea stall outside city centre 2 so that you cheap crowd cannot have a bad impact on the mall. Ohh sorry!! The staffs are also of such a low mentality that they think loud volume music will attract guestsüò© yeah!! It will attract local roadside people. I have some suggestions for you... during pujas, take your speaker to the auto stand near Cc2 and play songs.... many people will come and sell tea thereüòÇyou will have a very high income there rather than running a cafeüòÇüòÇ please close your cheap lounge

A very disappointing experience. The lounge was too small..the seating arrangement being very uncomfortable..There was hardly any space to move. The music being played was not up to the mark and was extremely loud for a place so small. They charged rs 500 for a single flavoured hookah without a single coal change. It was not at all worth the money. There are way better hookah lounges all over Kolkata. This was simply a waste of time and money.

Zion is a small hookah bar with a small dance floor at ground floor of City centre Rajarhat. The disadvantage of this place is that its two small with a very few sitting place. The hookah bar does not serve alcoholic beverages. The foods available is quite ordinary. The music is too loud for this small place.

The worst lounge I've ever been to. Annoying ambience along with the service. Firstly, they don't provide alcohol. Secondly, hookah is 400 bucks with no specific flavor as such. On top of that, there's an entry fee. Lastly, I won't call that a dance floor. It's really small. Their food isn't good at all. Basically, it's a waste of money there. Yes, it looks like a lounge to some extent but please make things available with a worthy price like a lounge.

Worst lounge ever possible.d stuffs r inefficient and busy either checking out chicks or gossiping with each other.food is tasteless and stale and cold. The dance floor is so small that there is a fair chance tht while dancing u will land on a creepy or perv stranger (this kinda people visit this place on a daily basis) .Djs r incompetent and only play hindi songs spclly honey singh over and over again.we went there in a group.despite our requests ,d dj nvr played a single english dance number.i guess he is nvr into english songs. D crowd is cheap.and yes d hookahs r ovr priced and dont last long. If these all r not enough to kill u or ur mood ,then d smokes which they use to mk d dance floor dreamy ( it actually suffocates u and brings u closer to hell) sure will.bt if u still survive i cn gurantee u that the bill will surely kill u.its a kill-bill.

On my worst nightmare I went to this place. I and my bf were searching for a hookah place at city centre 2 and we found this. To enter this place we had to pay entry fees. What is it a disco or wat? As we entered it was almost empty. We orderd hookah which was ok. the music is so loud that u won't feel like sitting and have ur hookah nicely. Price is too much as compared to the quality. Bad place to go.

We ordered 'sex on the beach' and the hookah was good enough. 
It has a small dance floor... Which is empty most of the time... The dj plays good music. The upstairs has a good, cozy, perfect seating to enjoy hookah.

After you pay 100 or 300(counting your blessings if you have two x chromosomes) you enter this beautiful lounge. To your utter disappointment,you find no snow lions/spiderman statues/cool gadgets or whatever they charged you to see.

The hookah I cannot comment upon as I do not take it. The smoke runs out soon and is known to choke people as well. They have a squarish dance floor which mostly stays empty. The upper floor seating is actually quite nice.

If the music doesn't deafen or the accumulating smoke doesn't choke,you can always count on the rickety stairs to kill you. And if you still survive,the overpriced maggi will definitely ensure a couple of days at the hospital.

The only place in the world I'd like to rate negatively.
Unbelievable.
I had such a bad time,I actually looked for you guys on Zomato to give you a review.
Went to this place with a friend. Like some amusement park entry fee, can you believe they charged us 100 bucks per head?! And then we had to write down our names on some funny notebook! From there on, the experience went downhill.
300 bucks for a hookah that we could stand for just about a minute. THAT bad! Music was school time, which was a pleasant change but the crowd was school going-red bull drinking kids too!

Since I kind of liked the whole decor of the place,I actually called for the manager to discuss itwith him,give him some candid input.But the service and the management was so poor,by the end it seemed to be run by a bunch of school kids!

We left the hookah as it was and left the place. For obvious reasons,I wasn't happy paying 500 bucks, but the boy at the door was insistent and impolite. The regret of not having gone back to get my money stayed in me for the entire evening! Please refund my money before you guys close down!

Come back to me here with a defensive reply you guys, and I swear I'll teach you a good lesson!

The Zion Lounge at CC2, Kolkata is a small lounge!  The decor is kinda okay!
The menu card needs to be changed and more food items should be included. I found only the Chicken Kebab to be tasty. The music is good but a bit old. 
This place is good in serving hookahs! That's the only good thing about this lounge!

Bad experience Not worth visiting.Firstly, place to small to be called a lounge and lack of proper ambience fails to cover it up. Secondly, the place is horribly managed. Menu card was not needed as the place had only 2 items in stock. Thirdly, the authorities were plain straight rude. And lastly, hookahs were not up to the mark and were below average, which should be the essence of every lounge.
