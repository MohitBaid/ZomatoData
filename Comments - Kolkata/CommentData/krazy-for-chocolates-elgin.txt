This is a very small shop in Lord Sinha Road just adjacent to Emami Market. Not very spacious and sitting area is limited. 

The Doughnuts and Chocolate cones are simply delicious. I haven't tried out much of their bakery but they always look good. 

The Doughnuts have chocolate oozing with every bite.

Tried red velvet cupcakes from here and although the cake had no filling in between which made it a little bit dry but no regrets because the frosting was more than enough to give a creamy texture to the otherwise dry cupcake and the flavour was also nice.Will definitely try more flavours next fime

This is my all time favourite bakery! One if the best dessert place in Kolkata. One can never get enough of this place and you just end up coming here for more sinful chocolaty delicacies. One their biggest attractive is the Red velvet muffin & Jar. That happens to bag the most appreciation as far now. Each and every dessert is really gonna make you feel like you're tasting heaven. The store is small and is located just below the Forum Food court. The staff is really good and it's mostly quite crowded, yet their service is fast. The prices are reasonable. 
This little outlet will surely steal your heart & make you wanna try every dessert on the counter. Though haven't yet tried their savoury dishes yet. Their flat bread pizzas look really tempting though. Also they have some chocolaty birthday gifts and chocolate lollipops.
The name does justice to the store. It'll definitely make you crazy for some 'Krazy for chocolates'.

Well, since I am a die-hard fan of Manju Sethia products ‚Äì their City Center 1 (Saltlake) branch being my favourite, hence, paid a casual visit to their Forum outlet at the 4th floor. At 7:00 odd hours, they were almost out of stock for savouries, although, numerous pastries were still available.

I had a cheese tomato swirl as well as a paneer puff parcelled for takeaway for next day breakfast. Both of them were just fine, although, full marks for presentation as well as the low pricing.

Glad they accept Sodexo meal vouchers! Outlet size is pretty small and service is fine!

This is more of a take-away outlet and for a dine-in, you will have to accommodate yourselves in the food court in the above floor!

Purchased 2lbs choc truffle cake, cake was so hard that it was even difficult to cut and it was not at all fresh, even the base was not soft. I came back to the outlet with the remaining 75% of cake and after tasting the shop representative said that it was a bit hard as it was kept in shop fridge. Rubbish excuse provided by shop representative. Highly irritated with the type of service and response by you guys. 75% of the cake is left out at your shop so that you can enjoy ur so called fresh and tasty cake.

Delectable little things exhibited in the glass showcases in a small kiosk at Forum Mall, on the 4th floor - that's Krazy for Chocolates! It was a sin to call myself a chocolate lover through all these years, and never any of the cute little things from this shop. Thanks to a friend, who finally decided to free me from the guilt. 
The Truffle Pastry, with its rich chocolate is absolutely amazing ! So are the tiny chocolates they serve. The Chocolate Cone again deserves special mention. The Velvet Mousse, however, did disappoint me, as it hardly had the taste of Mousse and the base was somewhat chili and bitter.

Located right opposite Birla High School (for Boys) ,it is one of the BEST confectioneries in Kolkata.
Please try their chocolate pudding, blueberry muffin and sinfully cheesy savoury items. Also their personalised range of products make great gift items. Also, the prices of the items  are quite nominal compared to the taste, quality and above all variations.

I've been to two other outlets of krazy for chocolates and whatever I've tried so far, I didn't like.

After watching a movie at forum, I decided to grab a quick breakfast.
Ordered this mayo cheese sandwich kind of thing and the moment I took the first bite I know I had to ordered another one.

The buns were filled with cheese and mayo with capsicum juliennes on top.

I also took away a chocolate lollipop and I didn't like it at all. ‚Çπ20 bucks down the drain.

For finest cakes which look and taste awesome, you can bank on this place without a second thought! I have ordered for customized cake and cupcake twice from here before and the results were amazing! :) All I had to do was browse for beautiful pictures of cakes online, choose my favorite, send them the picture and wait for the final output and the cakes/cupcakes have always been a replica! Take a look at the attached images.

Apart from customized, designer cakes K4C also serves varieties of mouthwatering desserts to choose from. Would recommend Chocolate Galleta, Tiramisu and Chocolate pyramid.

Food -
Super yummy, neither too sweet nor bland, just the right blend. Apart from sweet treats, you can also try the veg snacks such as submarine and roll. No beverages here.

Quality -
5 stars for quality! :)

Service -
Good service. They give good suggestions and the service is quick. Although, I'd like to mention that at a given time they have a limited number of pieces of pastries and treats available. The counters are refilled at intervals when the stock arrives from their bakery at Alipore. Because of this, I have many a times missed out on Tiramisu.

Price -
This can be a put down. 950/- for a pound of designer cake is quite steep in spite of the taste and the look being flawless. 200 is the standard delivery charge whether you stay 5 blocks away or 5 mins away.

Overall, I personally love this place for the quality and I guess you would too. They also offer photo cakes. :) Check it out!

Krazy for Chocolate is my favorite desert shop in the city.... This outlet is situated on 4th floor in forum mall.... Their special attraction they can make so yummilsious egg less items.... One day I bought a two layers chocolate cake for my hubby's birthday.... It tasted not up to the mark.... Staffs behavior are good.... Pocket pinch was acceptable....

An attractive little chocolate store, you are bound to stop there to admire the attractive chocolates and cupcakes.A specialty chocolate store they make wine bottles, moustaches, gramophone records, guns with bullets, cigars and other innovative stuff all made of pure chocolate. They are lovely to give and receive as gifts. What I really like is their red velvet cake in a jar. It's has the cake and some cream and you can scoop a spoon out(attached to the jar) and have as much as you like and refrigerate the rest. Do pick up the chocolate lollypops in different colours and designs.

I simply love this confectionary. Being a chocolate lover, it's into my regular list of confectionary. This time went there for a take away of chocolate lollipops, donuts with oreo, tiramisu. Didn't like their tiramisu that much. Others are good.
Recommended place!

Located inside Forum mall. Krazy For Chocolates has never failed to impress me. Choose any pastry of it and itll turn out to be delicious.  We had ordered for a photocake (truffle) and just as I expected it was sooo beautifully amazing and delicious! Yeah even the staff present there are quite friendly.

I came here with very high expectations but it didn't hit the mark for me at all.Took the chilli chocolate,nutty praline wrap and red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting.

Nutty praline wrap-This was the only dish I loved completely.Chocolate and crunchy praline..superb combination.Since this was the 1st chocolate I tasted here the disappointment with the latter stuffs seemed more bitter

Chilli chocolate-I thought the chilli peppery flavour will be infused within the white chocolate.The sweetness of the white chocolate with sharp kick of spice from chilli pepper..would've been a winner dish..that's what I was expecting.But it was just plain white chocolate topped with chilli flakes.Was very ordinary in taste.

Red velvet cupcake-I saved this for last because appearance wise it made me salivate and it seemed to be the best of the lot.But it was the worst not only here..worst cupcake I've ever taste.It was hard,dry..not a bit of moisture you expect in a good cupcake.The cream cheese frosting didn't taste like cream cheese at all.It was extremely salty,greasy and totally disgusting.

Not repeating this place again.

Well, Krazy for Cholocates, I am crazy for your strawberry cheesecake as well. I mean seriously - it was a little cup of heaven. Coupled with a black forest pastry and chocolate gellatin (not exactly sure about the name), we simply had a wonderful time. The chocolate one was truly a mouthful as my girlfriend had to take her strawberry cheese cake home. So, keep it up guys. Good quality and great taste all around. Would love to try out your mango pastry and lemon tart some day (which was the actual plan we had today BTW)

Located on the 4th floor of Forum Mall, Elgin Road, its a small joint, but has a variety of chocolate preparations that you can drool over. They make customised birthday cakes too.
Had ordered for a photo cake for my friend's birthday. They charged Rs.750 per pound for truffle. Our cake was of 2 pounds having the Harry Potter photo. The cake was beautifully made, rich tasting and very neat looking. Along with the cake they gave a cute little smiley faced candle and a knife with a bow tied on it. 
Service is good and fast. We had to order for the photo cake just 2 days before the birthday. 
According to the quality and taste of the preparations, I feel the pricing is quite reasonble.
Krazy for Chocolates is surely worth a try.

Located at the 4th floor of the Forum Mall, Elgin Road. It's the most tastiest cake brand in the city , according to me. I have tried the cone-shaped cake, which is so delectable. The Oreo Cheesecake is orgasmic, too. I simply love chocolates and I cannot resist the urge to buy pastries from here , whenever I go to Forum Mall. Plus, it is pocket friendly. Recently, had the Swiss roll as my birthday cake and needless to say, it was awesome. I have to try the red velvet cupcakes, soon. HUGE SHOUT OUT TO Madam Manju Sethia. :)

Located on the top floor of the Forum Mall and placed just beside Wow Momo, this is one of the numerous KfC outlets spread across this city. A small outlet this one, displaying desert items mostly made up of chocolate and then punched and tried with some other flavors. I paid a visit to this outlet on yesterday and day before yesterday, just after my visit to TGIF. Had tried the small chocolate flavored toffees (if I may say) which are priced for Rs. 25/-. I am not a big fond of their cakes though but the crunchy flavored chocolates, full of nuts and almonds makes my tastebuds tickle. :-)

The pocket pinch isn't high here and the standard of the product is also quite good. Highly recommended for a quick small bite if you are around. :-)

This place is an absolute delight to be! Located at the Forum Mall, a completely vegetarian chocolaterie, Krazy for Chocolates caters to you variety of chocolates, cakes and other desserts. Had come here yesterday after lunch at TGI Friday's. It's a small kiosk exhibiting all its items in the glass showcases on all sides. We had taken the Mango Mousse, a Chocolate Fudge and Chilli Chocolate. The mousse was amazing, rich with Alphonso Mango slices and cream, it lifted up my mood instantly. The fudge was okay, nothing to honk about. But the chilli chocolate was unique. It was white chocolate topped with chilli flakes. The chocolate had a filling inside which was kinda spicy. It's unique and will present you with a twist which you have never tried before. This place is decor recommended. They have a number of outlets all over Kolkata, you can try them at your nearby outlet also. So just don't wait, go to Krazy For Chocolates and have your bit asap. Happy Dining! :)

A small outlet located at forum, Krazy for Chocolates is power house of everything chocolaty! Love their pretty little Truffes. They tasted really amazing and look so pretty! Also tried some chocolate cone thing which was also really good. Twice I've tried the red velvet cupcake. 
First time I tried it, it was tasted but the icing tastes of salted butter! Very unpleasant the icing was. 
Second time, the icing tasted a lot lot better. Already loved the cupcake and now with the improved icing, it's a lot more splendid! 
This is a must try for all those who area "crazy for chocolates ". This place is quite a treat!!

Their chocolate spoon was the first that I had tasted...it looked cute and tasted great!!! I've had their assortment of chocolates and most of them have not disappointed me... The best part is that they try and innovative new flavors so I'm always assured of something new every time I drop by...

Bought a brownie, chocolate truffle cupcake and a red velvet cupcake, the red velvet cupcake was weird in taste mostly because it wasnt fresh, and the chocolate truffle was tasty but it wasnt fresh as well. the brownie was amazing. even though i am not a brownie person, i liked the brownie i took home. :) the staff service was good. overall i enjoyed my experience. :) thanks

Very very very disappointed with the service here. Had pre ordered a red velvet cake for a birthday. And arranged for pickup time between 5-530 pm. At 515 pm when i was already on my way. Called to check the lady was abrupt said it will be reasy by 6 and hung up. On reaching their outlet the staff had no clue that there outlet had a pickup scheduled and had to get them on the phone with the person who took the order. The guy said the cakes leave the main center at 6 so will not reach before 615. Why then was i assured that I'll get it by 530? More infuriating the staff tried to suggest i purchase the red velvet cup cakes instead of the BIRTHDAY CAKE i had ordered. Finally cake arrived an hour late. Finally. Taste wise. Disappointing. It tasted nothing like a red velvet cake. No cheesy creamy flavor nothing. It was basically a bland cake with red food coloring and white frosting. Rubbish and a total let down!

This place is heaven for every sinner, and hell for every saint. Chocolates in every form cakes, pastries, cupcakes, bouquets, alphabets, cones what not. You name it, they make it. Every big ocassion calls for celebration and i have always banked on K4C. Any special cake orders, always try to connect your call with manju sethia. She personally looks into special orders and never disappoints. The chocolate cone is a treat. Though the red velvet cupcake that looks so appetizing, does not really give you the pleasure to close your eyes and drown yourself in its taste. So a thumbs down for that. Had higher expectations.

Located near other prime restaurants in forum, it's definitely a good place if you have a sweet tooth for chocolate.
Only one negative point I saw was that today one of the two brownies they have was not warm and the other was also very slightly warm
The price is a bit normal high but ofcourse expected
Overall, four stars for tasty food

Well so after looking at few good ratings I decided to go ahead and get a cake from this place as this was the nearest cake bakery or cake place to my house. I called in to ask if I can just grab the cake or I need to make an order up front? The lady who answered the phone told me no worries, just go in and pick it up from the shop itself. Well turns out they didn't have the Black Forest when I got there and I was told that I must have talked to the factory person. Well my issue is that they shouldn't have the factory persons number on this app. I was disappointed that after someone giving me their word on a particular cake I had to pick up something else. But the other cake that I did bring home was simply great. It was soft, delicious and just right as far as the amount of cream, sugar, texture, flavour and softness is concern. I also grabbed some Black Forest pastries which were again quite great. All I would like to mention is that they need to provide better communication to the clients directly at the shop not to someone who is sitting outside the shop. Anyways if you are a chocolate fan, definitely go to this place.

For all chocolate lovers, this is the place!  You get chocolates in customised shapes and sizes to suit your fantasy. Muffins, cupcakes, fudges, cheesecakes, red velvet cakes are few to name. I buy an assortment of cupcakes etc for my loved ones and carry them back.
Ps: always ask for the fresh ones instead of ones from the pastry.

My experience with this place had been terrible.. i once took away some pastries and puddings for my homies and when i came back home and opened the parcel they were all smelling bad as if i have been served a week old stuff ! Had to throw all away and i decided never to visit again.. Make sure u check the quality before u buy !

Krazy for chocolates describes me in every literal sense if the term :P I am a big time chocolate lover and this place is a huge relief to satisfy my sudden chocolate cravings after college. Located in Forum which is a 5 minute walk away from college,I happen to come here and grab a bite everytime I visit the mall for lunch or a movie. I have tried everything they have on the menu. From the pastries to the patties and those yummy assorted chocolates to the cupcakes. I also love the fact that they keep adding and bring out changes to what they serve and everytime I land up here I see a new pastry ready to be gorged on by me. Thank you,K4C,for the relief you provide me with. :D

This place is located just beside wow momo in Forum mall. Beautiful small shop with varieties of chocolate. The chocolates were so well shaped that I even felt bad to eat it but I ate it anyway because resisting chocolates is very hard for me üç´. They also have cakes and I love their red velvet. I always like to give something sweet in every occasion and thus brought a small chocolate for the engagement of a very close person with other gifts of course. üíù

This is a small confectionary located in forum mall. They serve a huge variety of cake and pastries. At first, i was confused what to have. Then i took a red velvet cupcake and a chocolate gelatta.
The cupcake was good but i had expected it to be better. The cheese cream at the top was tasty.
The chocolate gelatta was too delicious. It tasted heaven. It was like a choco mouse with a cake base, a layer of chocolate and garnished with choco chips. This made my day !! My bill came to just INR 105. The prices are incredibly cheap in comparison to other places in forum. I'm coming back here for sure !!:D

If you have a sweet tooth and also are a vegetarian then you must try it out. I had Blueberry Cheesecake and Hazel nut pastry which from the look of it was mouth watering and it actually tasted good. The price was reasonable. I read really good reviews about Krazy for Chocolates and then tried it out and it actually lived upto my expectations. :)

Chocolate being the short route to happiness/stress buster for me and for that matter most of us, this place allows one to indulge into his/her share of sin! Muffins, cakes ,pudding,mudpie, mousse ,bite-sized flavoured chocolates you name it they have it ÔÅä and they are all eggless  too . Prices are moderate (but not cheap).  All in all this a great place for all the dessert/chocolate lovers.

Location: Fourth Floor, Forum Mall; Near the Box Office.

A review about this place has been long due and to be precise a good four years. Have been frequenting this place since my college days when it was situated on the ground floor near the Candy Treats shop and now is located on the fourth floor adjacent to WoW Momo.
One can just not resist the delicious pastries, chocolates, cakes straight from the ovens of Mrs. Manju Sethia; a renowned name in the world of confectioners.¬†
Being an ardent lover of chocolates, when I had just come across this place I had tried almost all of the fare, but, with the passing time have always stuck to a select few as they are the best of the lot. And, each time they taste just the same!

Tried until now: Chocolate spoons, mini cups, chocolate cone, blueberry cheesecake, chocolate boats, chocolate tarts, and the list would go on.

Personal favorites:
- Sinful Pudding
- Chocolate Mudpie
- Coffee Swiss Roll
- Truffle

They also have a variety of savories on offer, but, I have always looked up to this place to satiate my sweet tooth cravings.

Prices are slightly inclined towards the moderate end.

An amazing place for sinful indulgence. Choco-love!
- Yet to try the savories, comments due.

You get varieties of cakes, cupcakes, savouries and chocolates here.
I found the oreo cheesecake to be irresistible and that's what I ordered.
Its a must try i should say. The butterscotch pastry tastes wonderful as well. :*
There is lack of space as a few tables are arranged outside by Forum Mall but its occupied by gossipers almost all the time. :(
Good experience altogether. :)
Happy Eating!

Krazy for Chocolates is a great option for dessert lovers especially chocolate lovers out there. It is a small dessert parlour located in Forum Mall, Elgin Road. The store is independent and does not require a food court card. Another good thing about this dessert parlour is that all the cakes, pastries and stuff are veggie friendly with no egg.

As the store deals in all kinds of desserts, you will find different pastries, truffles, brownies, cream-rolls and full size cakes. One of their latest innovations called 'Krazy Choco Cone' is a must try. It is a cone made out of chocolate with more brownie type chocolate inside. It's really yummy and as good as ice-cream. And if that is not all, they also have strawberry and butterscotch flavoured cakes and pastries for non chocolate lovers.

Also if you are a non sweet tooth, then you might find their burgers and other appetizers interesting. Though they keep very less of those but still makes a descent snack.

Service is good and fast. Pricing is very nominal for the stuff they deliver. The only problem is lack of seating. Though there are few tables outside arranged by the forum mall, however most of those are occupied by gossipers.

For a quick dessert, Krazy for Chocolates is a great option. Their famous chocolate cone is a bundle of joy with different layers of mousse and cake surprising you. However, if you do not have a sweet tooth, it might get too much at the end since it is quite sweet and large. All preparations are egg-less, which is good news for vegetarians.

The best Cake that can ever satiate my palates was chocolate truffle I had at this place. The best bakery that would surprise you how a cake can be baked without including egg. I was surprised when Keshav was ready to provide me sugar free cake when all the other bakeries had put up their hands,  that too in a span of 12 hours after I ordered. Hats off to the concept and the team for their stupendous effort and the decorations which will force you to dig into without looking for other options and thanks for the baking the cake in an impossible time span.

Oh my god, I found my day saviour , my mood lifter at forum last week. Heard that this was krazy for chocolates' first outlet. Though I frequently visit forum, I cannot imagine what a bimbo I was not to have found this chocolate shop, not to worry, I did finally, and my day was saved. I am addicted to this shop literally. The strawberry dip drives me crazy. I believe for people who like chocolate mixed with strawberry ( just like me) , this is what you actually can ever desire. The choco truffles i die for. And the usp? The chocolate cone. It kills me and makes me alive at the same time. Whenever I am off the mood, all I desire is a chocolate cone to make me smile. The mousse and the choco chips bound by a hard chocolate crust can actually bring me to a state of "unani" as the Japanese call it so. Ecstatic do I feel at that moment. However its here that i first tasted the choco muffin and  the choco brownie. Its mind blowing. Rightly said, I am krazy for chocolates

The red velvet cake was ok but i've had better at oder places being Bombay d best on my list

Overall - 4/5 

Advice is to try Snacks n Chocolate items der will make one's normal day a hapennin one!!

Every item on the menu is a bliss for chocolate lovers.... The pancake and the filled doughnut are the special attraction of the place besides the varieties of chocolate....
Hats off to the owner for making all the preparations egg less ... You can delight your taste buds with any variety of the chocolate with pocket friendly prices.

Krazy for chocolates made a not-so-crazy-for-chocolates person like me absolutely fall in love with the chocolates they prepare. A salute to manju sethia maam for this. 
Perhaps this is the only outlet which churns out such amazing chocolate cakes and goodies without egg making this nothing short of a heaven for all us vegetarians. 

I am absolutely in love with this joint and especially the cakes. I literally gorge on them. 
Be it my bday or my friend's or my mom's or just anyone's, I make sure the cake IS from krazy for chocos!

Besides the amazing cakes I also love their cheesecakes and this particular chocolate item I always used to have when I visited forum .. I absolutely forgot it's name! Guess it was chocolate surprise (?)
Anyway it just tastes amazing.. So much that I'm salivating while writing this!!

P. S. Guys do not judge me for the twilight cake B|

I have been a regular at this outlet ever since it opened its doors.Previously located in the ground floor of forum mall and now relocated to the fourth floor this place really lives up to its name and is a treat for the chocolate lovers!
There are various innovative items on offer other than the usual pastries and cheesecakes and cookies etc.All the chocolate based items are quite nice.The chocolate cone,oreo cheesecake and the mini chocolates with various fillings are my personal preferences here.The mini chocolates with different fillings are very nice and more so considering the price.All the items are really well prepared and are an excellent option if you are looking to gift someone.
Among the relatively newly introduced savouries section,they are about decent.I must admit I have not tried many of the savouries on offer and so I will probably not be the best judge.But the main attraction of this place is and will always be the chocolates as the name aptly suggests.The prices are slightly on the higher side but if you like your chocolates this is worth a try.

I have been to this outlet since the days it occupied a spot on Forum's ground floor. It has now been relocated to the 4th floor, near Spaghetti Kitchen.

They serve a range of pastries (including cheesecakes, black forest, etc), mostly seemingly made of butter cream. All preparations are egg-less, and to me, have a synthetic feel because of that. They have a range of breads too, as well as mini chocolates with various fillings like mint, peanut butter, strawberry, blueberry, pineapple, etc. They also do a range of chocolate gift items.

They are somewhat pricey. The mini chocolates begin at Rs 20, pastries go up to about Rs 100.

I like their strawberry filled chocolate the most! I am waiting to try out the cheesecakes some day, but have resisted because I prefer the baked ones.

Okay so this one ! 
I used to pass by this place pretty often .. But never had the time to walk in .. One random day I decided I'll go in .. 
I walked in like a loner .. Saw all the chocolate and got over excited ! 
I happily guilt freely ordered 
1) mini cup 
2) choco corn 
3) Choco lava 
(Mind you I had missed gym for 1 week now ) 
I hogged the choco lava cus it was oh well choco lava 
It was just fine .. Not too great not bad either 
Then came the choco corn which looked very appealing and tasted very appealing too .. After eating a whole bunch of chocolate I was on sugar rush hence I ate one more choco corn n then the mini cup .. 
By this time everyone judged me , I over ate ! But it left me smiling and happy 
But it was very easy on pocket 
Price - 5/5 
Food - 4/5

The Oreo cheese cake of Krazy for choclate is the best cheesecake in town. Period. I had tried many things here but i cant keep my hands off that cheesecake!! The choclate message they make is neat and is very cute. But yes the pastries are heavy and i have never been able to finish off one by myself. I guess it is my second favourite after flurys.

In the city for which cakes and pastries meant only kookie jar,Ms.Manju Sethia opened doors of Krazzy for chocolates in Forum.What started as a small display window at forum was extended to a fully dedicated  confectionary off moira street.Where do i begin?Perhaps by mentioning my favourite which happens to be the oreo cheesecake!The pinapple pastry,chocolate cone,truffle pastries and the chocolates are just wonderful!This place also dosent disappoint on the saviory front,the mexican pizza slice,mushroom parcel are very good for a quick bite.
Everything here is very reasonably priced,from pastries to cakes to their chocolate displays!
I know Calcutta is now spoilt for choice which so many bakerys and pattisserie's opening everywhere,however Krazzy for chocolates is my go-to place to comfort my sweet cravings.

My friend from Delhi who's been only staying for the last 10 months in Kolkata informed me of this place and the lady behind it : Mrs. Manju Sethia. She was awe struck when I reverted saying that I had never heard of this name before. That very day she took me to this outlet. We actually went there after having some dosas from a Burp! outlet @Forum. So wanting to keep it light, I went for a Pineapple pastry. It was perfectly spot on. The icing for me was the cream which was really fresh and was soothing too. It was perfectly light for a pastry, just like I wanted. Definitely worth a try...

Way before back when Kolkata was still good ol' Calcutta we had a lady who was a highly reputed name on the Culinary scene ..... Mrs Manju Sethia.... the lady behind Krazy for Chocolates. Mrs Sethia started out with cooking classes and orders for her delicious food from home and has expanded from that to being a recognized brand in the city ... more power to her. 
She was one of the the first people to introduce the innovative chocolate shapes from roses to records that carried messages for different occasions with cute stuff like "Just for the record I love you" etc and naturally it was a runaway success. Her chocolate products are excellent even in terms of taste not just aesthetic appeal and make for great gifts as well. I really like the Crunchy Cheese Sticks,Chocolate Cone, and the Strawberry Doughnut available at Krazy For Chocolates.  As far as her delicious chocolate is concerned try the Orange , Blueberry , Strawberry , Coffee Caramel flavors which are my personal favorites. Krazy for Chocolates also makes delightfully designed personalized cakes for various occasions that one may unhesitatingly order.

Krazy For Chocolates - A good bakery for VEGETARIANS :) 
-----------------------------
Brief:

Owned by the famous "Manju Sethia", this place is one of the most selling cake shop in forum and is very famous amongst the youngsters. I had been here with one of my friend and i really like the courteous behaviour of the staffs out here. I had been like long back but they had a lovely presentation, ideas and quality products. 

I am really happy to see the "INNOVATIONS" in the field of cakes and bakeries specially by Krazy for chocolates. 

-----------------------------
Cakes - I had the milk chocolate spoon and the bottle made of chocolate specially designed for birthday. I must say a very Unique concept and that's the USP. 
-----------------------------

Summary:

Cake/cookie presentation 5/5
Cake/cookie quality 4/5
Cake/cookie quantity 4/5
Hospitality 4/5
Pricy? Yes, a bit on the higher side but worth it. :) 

----------------------------
Conclusion:

Definitely coming back for the cheese cake and the new items on the menu. :)
======
Recently on 1st July'15, i tried the Red Velvet Cake and their special Happy birthday cube chocolates. The red velvet cake was nicely presented and tasted good too. However, a little more softer could have done wonders. The cube chocolates were decent enough.

I have never really been a huge fan of Krazy for chocolates becaue I dont really advocate Eggless baking . Nonetheless it is huge market and Manju Sethia is the undisputed leader in it. The biggest plus about this outlet is that protect they sell is very clean . Although I don't really like the idea of cheesecake in a cup . The Cakes are loaded in butter cream , artificial colors and are just too sweet for my liking , however the chocolates are beautifully tempered and the chocolate based desserts are nice especially the tulip mousse and the molded chocolates. MY niece swears by the cake pops. I on the other hand like the black forest and the pineapple as they are much less sweeter. Tried the savories the other day the panner tikka bun ( not sure of the exact name) was hungry and gobbled it in no time . Even the Mexican pizza is good. The quality of bread used in their products are very good .

I have rated the other two outlets at The Regency and City Centre and realized that this one was left out.
Krazy for chocolates is a chocolate lover's paradise at affordable rates.

Yes, it is hard to believe that it is a vegetarian joint because the chocolates are so delicious even without eggs. I am an egg lover and so it is definitely hard for me to believe but trust me, the products are really good here.
I was at Mezzuna yesterday with friends. After the food, we decided to pamper our sweet tooth with some goodies from this joint.
This is a small little counter in Forum Mall and cannot go unnoticed.
Yesterday it was buzzing with people and I managed to scoop up some goodies for friends and myself.

Here's what we ordered :

Oreo cheesecake
Krazy chocolate cone
Oreo fancy cookies

Now, the oreo cheesecake is a big, delicious, chocolate cheesecake that is on display. The biscuit base and the chocolaty layers form a delicious combination inside the tongue once its in. Its a complete showstopper.

The famous chocolate cone is big, and thick to the brim with melted chocolate inside. Share it because its a huge calorie intake inside the tummy. The outer chocolaty crust is crispy and delicious. Statutory warning : SHARE.

And lastly, the fancy oreo cookies. I took them back home. Now, I seriously had no clue of what these cookies are like. Once I opened the box, and i was so happy. But, the best was yet to come. One bite and I realized that it has an entire oreo biscuit inside it! :D
So, the outer layers are just chocolate and inside lies an entire oreo biscuit. It was sweet and tasty.
I had taken two : white chocolate and the chocolate and both turned out to be delicious.

I absolutely love this outlet. 

Coming back for more.
Cheers! :)

An absolute delight for one with a sweet tooth, this place is a gallery since it keeps and sells pieces of art. The nutty roll reminds the Burt of the heyday of rollick ice cream. The choco cone is something I wanted to try but I was already binging on the nutty roll. It is a lovely place and totally recommended. I just wish the temperature was a little lower since cooler chocolates are cool to taste!

Whenever I eat cakes from here, I forget about counting calories!  Super delicious cakes you will find, Mrs.Manju Sethia ...I just Love you for making these taste so yummy and that too 100% eggless!  Chocolates are very colourful and attractive. 
I am eagerly waiting for it to come up with a big outlet with more attractive and tasty bakery products!  :)

Not krazy enough for me !!!!!!

Krazy for chocolates is the brand owned by the famous Smt Manju Sethia who is also widely known for conducting training workshops for desserts. Being 100 percent vegetarian, it ensures a sweet bite for every person of the family any day of the week. There are lots of variety to choose from though one could find even greater options in the theatre road outlet.

Muffins are amazing  especially the strawberry & coffee ones. I am not fond of their pastries so much though chocolate driven varieties fare better than the others. I find the cream used in the pastries a bit heavy, hard and oily otherwise it could be great. Birthday cakes are good especially the ferrero rocher cake which is yum !! Prices are pretty competitive. There are not many snacks items in the menu and ones available are average. The milk  or garlic breads are nice.

I am crazy about my pineapple or black forest pastries and this place disappoints. I have more satisfying experiences at a kookie jar or a biscotti but i when i want eggless deserts, they hold a monopoly !!!!!!!!

Nice presentation and taste. Wares are fresh and design concepts are out of the box. Chocoaltes are available as CDs, messages, boxes, fruits etc. Some unusual breads are there as well, like tomato bread. All items are pleasing to both the eyes and the pocket. Staff is friendly. Seating arrangement is a problem though.

I love this place....this one is 100% vegetarian but u don't get that feel,,,,really tasty and yummy desserts are available here. 
Once i had ordered a cake from here, they had prepared it very well. The designs of the cupcakes, cakes and cookies are wow..just love them,,,the disc-shaped b'day cake sort of is really nice,,,
Staff are polite and  the place is small with no sitting  arrangement.
4 from me.

Though the name goes krazy for chocolates,their chocolates aint that good..neither the variety nor the taste.Also i expected better gifting options from this place,but the assortments are not well arranged,neither is there option for chocolate baskets.They have another outlet at hungerford street which has more space and seating arrangements.Hope that place gets some good changes in place.Their desserts,and i mean every one of them quite delicious though,delightful mousses and chocolate cakes.
