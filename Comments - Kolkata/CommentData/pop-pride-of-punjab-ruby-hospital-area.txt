POP is located just beside sanjah chulha. While sanjah chulha is the most popular of the clutter of restaurants an Panchanam Gram, EM bypass and few walk into POP too, sometimes due to lack of space at sanjah chulha. The place is quite cheap and serves alcohol too. Service and food are both moderately good. I had been there only once, long back. We had ordered for a few north indian items and all were decent.

We had no intention of visiting this place but had to given Sanjha Chulha could seat so many of us. Also, the waiting time allotted to us was huge.
Unplanned but not unpleasant!Â 
We ordered quite a few different dishes from their menu, mostly Indian.

Much hyped place.... Ambience is like good rather damn good. But i dont know why they have lesser variety under every category. Soups taste damn bad. Starters are damn good but not the main course.

Had food there in 2005. Food was awesome then. Music and performance was good. Parking and home delivery facilities are commendable
