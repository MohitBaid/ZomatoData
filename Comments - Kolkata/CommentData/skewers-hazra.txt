Burgers have started to make their impact by taking over the city. One such place which reflects the taste of youth is Skewers. It is an amazing place near Maddox Square which serves gourmet burgers cooked to perfection with handpicked ingredients, stacked high with layers of delectable flavours. Not only does it serve some great dishes but also has all the elements for a perfect ambience as well. It has a casual vibe with fancy graphiti walls stacked up with wooden tables.

The signature burgers one should definitely try out here are :

üìç Death by Triple Bacon : It has a goz beef patty topped with three layers of bacon, cheese, lettuce and onion jam. 

üìç Crispy Sesame Fish : This burger contains Panko and sesame crumbed crispy golden Beckhti fillet, onion jam, lettuce and cheese. This can definitely be the choice of a bong or a fish lover here. The taste being amazing and the presentation being on point, this burger is a hit.

üìç FarmVille Burger : Consisting of two corn-peas-carrots patties, chilli mayo, cheese, lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, this veg bombshell will leave a burger fanatic spellbound with it's authentic taste.

üìç Classic CheeseBurger : With Goz beef patty, house mayo, cheese, grilled onion, lettuce and tomato, this Cheese Burger is here at Skewer's to definitely leave an impact on it's consumer! The spices blending perfectly and the aroma being disctinct, this burger served with savoury dip and home fries is love.

üìç Southern Blue : This burger has goz grilled chicken patty , garlic mayo, blue cheese sauce and lettuce. Chicken being the only meat ingredient, this burger is top notch in it's taste.

üìç Cheese and Bacon Burger : Cheddar, blue sauce, crispy bacon, grilled bacon, sauteed mushrooms, Skewer's special pepper sauce, this burger is also another great dish to fullfill one's hunger cravings.

Coming to the fries,

üìç Bacon Cheese Fries : The bacon mince was fresh and the fries were crisp. It tasted amazing with cheese toppings on it.

üìçBarbeque Chicken Fries : These are a delight too. Chicken topped in Barbeque Sauce made these munchy fries perfect appetizers! 

The mocktails are great here. With price being on the lower side, these mocktails definitely have a refreshing and soothing capability to comprehend the food here. I'll mention two of my personal favourite drinks here.

üìç Strawberry Lemonade 
üìç Lemon Spritzer 

Hospitality is great here. The service is quick and the food quality and quantity in comparison to the pocket friendly price is totally just and appropriate. With these amazing delicacies, they are already winning hearts and will definitely continue to do so. 

With the wholesome burgers and fantastic fries, Skewers is a place for a perfect meal.
They also serve great continental, american as well as chinese delicacies!

Recommended.

I was at Skewers the other day to try out their burger and fries menu. The burgers that they had to offer were phenomenal, they were juicy and delicious. The menu has been curated beautifully and has plenty options from fish to beef, bacon to chicken and yum Vegetarian options as well. 

The strawberry lemonade is a must try at Skewers. It's the generic lemonade but with a twist of strawberry. Perfect to wash down a massive burger with a side of fries. 

The barbecue chicken fries was my favorite among fries. You can snack on them while you wait for your burger to come out of the kitchen. 

The fish burger - Fishy Wishy was excellent. - 5/5 

Death by Bacon burger had 3 layers of different types of bacon. A bacon lovers dream come true. - 4.5/5 

The Potato Head Burger was one of their delicious Vegetarian options. I can promise you Vegetarians out their, you won't leave skewers disappointed. 5/5

Steak burger - 5/5 excellent beef steak which has been grilled to perfection. 

The menu is priced very reasonably. A meal for two might average out at 700 approx. The restaurant is clean and has a fun vibe.

Spicy Babycorn -- It was ok type. Just an average babycorn dish.

Farmville Veg Burger -- it was completely tasteless. Dint expect this bland burger. It was even difficult for me to finish the entire burger due to its horrible patty. When complained about the taste, the employee replied "its a veg burger, it contains peas, corns, carrots..thats why it tasted bad". Now what else we could say after hearing this kind of an excuse?

Stoneheaven's fried chocolate bar with vanilla ice cream -- i was craving to have the entire chocolate by myself. But, the looks can be deceptive. After we tasted it, even 2 of us me and friend couldnt finish up that single bar due to its taste. The chocolate had a very very chewy texture.

Lemon Fizzy -- this was fine.

‚Ä¢Spicy Babycorn ~ was okiesh nothing special..

‚Ä¢Cheese & Bacon Chicken Burger with Barbecue Chicken Fries ~ expected a better burger with obviously not too cold buns, bacon not crispy, patty was ok, fries were not that good so left it over..

‚Ä¢Farmville Veg Burger ~ don't even every think of trying this one, worst of all totally blunt no seasoning awful taste..

‚Ä¢Stoneheaven's Fried Chocolate Bar with vanilla Ice-cream ~ looks too tempting but hold on nope nope nope don't ever try it.. chew chocolate bar which me n my friend couldn't even finish, too bitter to taste.. ü§¢

Service ~ late and bad..  when we said that the veg burger didn't taste well at all the reply just stunned us as it was said " sir it's veg burger, it has corn peas and carrots this is how it is.. I was like so if you know it's not going to taste good why the hell did you keep this in your menu??? WHY?

Went there for the Mountain Clegane Burger challenge. Loved the experience. They were very friendly and supportive when I was taking the challenge. They even played the "Light of the Seven" tune from Game of Thrones in the background to match the theme of the "Mountain Clegane" burger challenge and I found that really appreciable. The burger was awesome too. It tasted so great even when I was just gobbling it as fast as I could that I wonder how great it would have tasted if I savoured the taste by slowly having it. Would love to do that the next time I visit the place. :)

I did have the chance to take a look at the menu while the food was being prepared. The prices of the other burgers seemed reasonable. The place was small, yet nicely decorated and charming. The service can be improved a bit, but overall a great place to visit.

But I am disappointed with the quantity of one of the items I ordered .
I had ordered -
‚úìBarbeque chicken
‚úìStuffed creamy fish

Though barbeque chicken could have been better I loved Stuffed creamy fish and both the items are served with rice . I recommend you to try the latter dish !

So, after going through the positive reviews in zomato, we decided to visit this restaurant today. Located exactly near Maddox Square, is this small eatery.

For food we ordered
1) MEAT LOVERS' PLATTER
2) BUTTERY HERBED RICE
3) STONEHEAVEN'S FRIED CHOCOLATE BAR.

PROS: The ambience of this restaurant is quirky with good background music and so was the meat lovers' platter.

CONS: 1) The guy who was sitted was absolutely disinterested in even serving us water as we entered.

2) The rice we ordered though complimented the skewers pretty well was undercooked and the quantity was terrible.

3) Now, coming to desserts. We wanted to have their Skewers special brownie marshmallow but it was unavailable..
So after going through the description of the dish, we settled for the STONEHEAVEN'S FRIED CHOCOLATE BAR.

Honestly, the dessert was just average and as they mentioned it to be a "nutty" chocolate bar, there was no taste and sight of even a minuscle amount of nut in the choco bar.
3) The price of this dish as mentioned in the menu card was 120 bucks. But as we received the bill, the price was written to be 150 bucks. And then the guy was like he forgot to tell us about the new prices at the beginning and there is a 30 bucks increase on that particular item. I mean. Seriously? We were the only people in there and the guy who was absolutely disinterested and was so busy with his phone that he forgot to tell us about this.
Service was pathetic and even the serving time was poor but still it can be forgiven if we were served good food and lastly
4) They dont even have a washroom which is also a bummer.
Had quite high expectation with this place.
Not quite sure of a second visit.

A delightful eatery. You know you're in the right place when a restaurant's beautiful decoration is complemented by scrumptious dishes which you can just keep on eating without being full.
It's a 5/5 for me. A bang for buck I must say.

Well it was afternoon time when me and my friend have decided to find in in this place..It's a nice cozy place with awesome delicious food! I really liked their signature dish Fish Alfredo which was creamy tasty and two big chucks of fish was served which was worth the money paid! In starters we had Lemon and Herb chicken which was again crisp from outside and juicy from inside..do visit this place! It's a must try place ever..keep it up guys!üòäüòç

Skewers is a little place for Chinese and Continental near Maddox Square.Hardly 4-5 tables are there. We tried
Fish Goujons
Chicken Crispers
Hakka Noodles
Schezwan Noodles
Chilli Fish

Fish Goujons and Chicken Crispers both were good and crispy. Chilli fish was also perfectly made. But neither of the noodles was up to the mark.

Nice little cozy place. We went there on Saptami midnight. Ordered Chicken chilli, Strawberry lemonade, Cheese garlic bread and fish fried fish, and a chocolate based Sundae...

Taste was okay. Chicken chilli was super hot, Fish fried was great....They ran out of ice for the lemonade. They tried their best amongst all chaos of mid night pandal hoppers. Will again visit after puja, as I found their food good and reasonably priced. Service was also fast.

The place looked good in first appearance, nice and cozy. Good place to hang out with friends if you are not looking for anything to eat because the food was below avg. The oriental fried rice was nothing but simple rice and egg bhujia ( yes, you read it right). The garlic in the garlic chicken was so overpowerful that even next morning i was able to smell the garlic in my morning tea. And when we asked for extra plate they just gave us the breakfast plate even though we ordered dinner.
Overall very poor food experience. Need to up their game.

Was on my bucket list for a while. 
Location: pretty convenient. Right on Earl Street.
Interior and Ambiance: It is a little small but thankfully it was absolutely empty when we went today. So wasn't a problem. The big graffiti on the wall and the quiet ambiance is a plus. 
Staff: Helpful and friendly.
Food: Now comes the important part. Had heard a lot about their Skewers but unfortunately neither me nor my friend were very hungry, so we just ordered one plate of meat lover's platter with herbed rice. This dish is supposed to be their speciality. It did have a lot of variety of flavours but the size of the pieces looked a little too small. However must say that the pieces were well tossed in the sauce, and tasted delicious. Herb rice was okay.
Pocket pinch: It is quite light on the pocket and has the ability to be a student spot.
Overall, Skewers was a good experience, especially uthe good service. Would definitely visit again with a better appetite to try their variety of items. All the best.

This nice little joint is situated near Maddox square, Earl street. You will get a wholesome meal for group of people in a pocket friendly price. As the name suggested Grilled items served with sauces (skewers) are their speciality. MEAT LOVERS PLATTER; STUFFED CREAMY FISH (cheese and spinach stuffing) are my personal favourite. You can choose from different breads or rice items as add on to the skewers for a wholesome meal. BURNT GARLIC RICE is bland, I did not like it.

This joint also has some decent dishes for veg lovers.

Quality service and well-behaved and friendly staffs are the add on over your meal.
Happy dining.

We went here last Sunday to attend a Game of Thrones themed Weekend Lunch and Quiz contest. Its a small foodjoint at Earle Street near Maddox square. The seating arrangement cozy and the wall arts are really great. Coming to the food, we were served GoT themed items. We took Ned's Head Potato platter as starter along with Chicken Littlefinger. Then there was the Milkshake of the Poppy to sweeten the moments. For main course we had Mountain's Carnivorous Platter, Faceless Men's Sandwich and Lother's Chicken Pie which were delicious. The preparation standard is also very high according to what I have seen that day. Price is ok given the amount they serve which is fulfilling.

I was planning to have desserts but I was pretty upset after the quiz to not have won anything üòëüò£.

Anyways this restaurant opened only last January and the way it improved in its short journey till day it deserves a heartfelt 5/5 from us.

Kudos to the Owners #Bikram Banerjee & #Ankita Banerjee for letting us enjoy our nerdism. CHEERS!!!

Please keep organizing these thrilling contests to go with the delicous food.

The reason i am giving this place a 5 out of 5 is completely different from other times i'd rate a cafe or restaurant a 5. This place gave me something that i have been screaming for since the past year. N that is "something different". Yes...i went on the day of the GOT quiz competition. But it just wasnt a quiz...it had a menu to compliment it n the way these guys prepared the menu paying homage to the greatest show on earth...its really commendable. 
The targaryen fries...best fries i ever had. The dragonfire chkn...it had a weird smell..but the taste was great..(nice with the cherry tomatoes) n of course the theatre with the dish. U always eat the dish with ur eyes first. So thats what makes it great. Also the white walker sundae n the milk of the poppy chocolate milkshake. Like the sundae was so good..the blue cura√ßao n the marshmellows...n it really really looked like a white walker dish. Also the milkshake had a prominent taste of milk. 
Also i would like to mention the unsullied platter n the chkn littlefinger. Its very well thought n the unsullied platter especially. Unfortunately i couldnt have it cz i wanted to try different things...but they looked great n i am sure they tasted great as well. 
So its a really humble yet desperate request that please keep the GOT menu. This is what the town needs in a cafe. Something different. We get pastas mains rice chkn mains n sides everywhere...this difference adds a layer to the food n u enjoy the food more because of the theatre. 
Now coming to this quiz part. The ordering of food as a compulsion of a certain amount instead of a mandatory entry fee is a really good idea from a business perspective..i commend the thought..really...but the only con that i n other fellow participants would point out is the prize...presto GOT coffee mugs with pens n candies...its cliched...like u should have gone with the theme of quiz in a more symbolic way...like giving the podium place holders a miniature crown or a miniature iron throne or a hand of the king broach or even nice posters would have done the trick. 
Despite this the quiz was really fun...the quiz master is a great guy..
One last bit of suggestion:
Hold more quizzes n competitions like this...GOT is like 6 years old. Its sooo famous. U can also do quizzes on FRIENDS, HIMYM, Harry Potter n the biggest hit which would b a show stopper would b All Things Marvel n DC. Cz this fandom is not 6 years or a decade old its 80 years old n it can be an even longer event...the menu can b more diverse...it would pull a lot more people to ur cafe n of course give a thought to the prizes. 
Had a great experience...but would b a more frequent visitor if u guys keep the GOT menu n keep changing stuff n doing new n different things.

Just before the season (07) finale of Game Of Thrones, one of the very few places to bring the mercury up is Skewers! Not that this tiny place could arrange a big bash of GoT events like the other food-giants, but it had its heart in the right place and every little effort it made for the event shone bright. ¬†
Once you are here, you will be greeted by the hosts, Bikram and Ankita. Their hospitality has a warmth that is the USP of Skewers. For a food-joint with an accommodation of hardly 20 people, it is very tough to provide you with all sorts of comforts that you are probably used to in usual dine-outs. But Skewers has tried its best with a beautiful wall art and a set of really good cooks. I haven't tried their usual menu, but the GoT special dishes were so delicious that I believe they wont disappoint you on any regular day.¬†
We ordered Joffrey's Sangria and Mother of Dragon's Fish for starters. The mains brought Dragonfire Chicken and lastly we had Slice of the Red Wedding. None of the platters was out-of-the-box or complete new twist; they were regularly known dishes presented in a new style and with fabulous tastes. And that's where they score high.¬†My friend

I normally do not post reviews but this restaurant was totally worth it. A location which is extremely convenient to drive to, the first brownie points scored by this restaurant is that of easy parking. You get 1 point for that. The friendly behaviour of the staff and personal attention given to the persons who come will score you another 1 point.¬†
Coming to food, we had ordered the meat platter, cheesy mushroom garlic bread, strawberry and chocolate drinks and the stoneheavens dessert.¬†
The food was of good quantity and value for money. 1 point for the that.¬†
The taste of the food was great, especially the meat platter which came with perfectly skewered pieces. I especially loved the creaminess of the meat which was tender yet skewered to perfection.¬†
The drinks were superb. A perfect 1 for the food.¬†
A special shoutout for the stoneheaven chocolate which alone can pull off miracles. The oomph factor for that one dish is enough to earn you 1 point.¬†
Thus, a perfect 5 on 5 for you people.¬†
Looking forward to more visits. Also one request, if you can kindly add more options to your menu and add more chocolate sauce to the stoneheaven chocolate. :) Cheers and have a good time.

Food: I loved everything I ordered, seriously each and every dish, and since we were quite a big group who visited the restaurant we ordered a LOT of food. All the skewers we ordered were extremely tasty and I especially remember the melt-in-the-mouth creamy fish. So after having stuffed myself with all the delicious food just as I thought I can't possibly eat any more there came desserts which made me wish I'd left some space for them because they were as good as it can get!
Service: Very courteous staff, really good service!
Ambience: Cozy colourful interiors, especially the wall, to appreciate which you need to visit!
 I can't wait for my next visit to Kolkata and I'm going to make sure this time I visit Skewers more than just once.

I am a rather fussy eater when dining out. Most often I am not very impressed with the culinary scene in Calcutta. I feel Calcutta is yet to become more bold and experimental when it comes to its gastronomic scene. So I am always on the lookout for eateries with a slightly different texture in their menu. 
When I came across Skewers, in one of the bylanes near Maddox Square, I was pretty happy to look through their food menu. It's a happy little place with neat decor and nothing over the top. I like that the place doesn't play loud music or has in your face artefacts. Skewers has concentrated on its food and done a very good job. It's owned by a young couple, who've tried to bring in a different sort of gastronomic experience to the city. As the name suggests, the place serves food in Skewers with a small portion of rice (they have a few options) on the side. I tried their fish with some rice, which was absolutely delicious. What was even more delicious was their strawberry mousse. And all of that in a very pocket friendly budget. 
Do give Skewers a try and it'll not disappoint.

A friend brought me here and it surprised me. A warm feeling awaits you at Skewers, with friendly surrounding, staff and yes it has appetizing food. What do you need more when you are away from home?  If you are from Kolkata you are lucky and for all those who happen to visit the city of joy at times, do try this place out.

A joint with a nice decor and an unique combination of grilled delicacies. There meat lovers' platter had a different variety of every skewer with a unique taste and the stuffed creamy fish was extremely delicious. Not too much waiting time after an order. A great place for an unique continental experience.

Disappointment just got worse !
Location : Way too tricky to locate,Skewers is tucked in Earl street,next to the Ritchie road.Google maps will come to your rescue,if you really want to visit this place after reading the whole review.
Service : Really really slow.Like it took them 1 hour neat to serve 3 dishes.
Food : WARNING - Do not let the reviews and pictures fool you,the portion is just too little considering the price they charge.So coming to the dishes we ordered -
1.Mixed Medley Platter : We had heard about it a lot and this particular dish is what we went to Skewers for.It contained -
* A skewer of four button mushrooms stuffed with veggies and wrapped in a cheese slice : This tasted awesome.
*A skewer containing a thin layer of minced mutton - one needs a minimum amount to savour the taste,at least.Guess that says a lot about my take on this one.
*A skewer of firecracking paneer as they call it : This tasted decent.Though I had no idea that you can put coated paneer pieces saut√®d in some kind of chinese sauce and put it in a platter like this.Mismatch is what I felt it was.
*A skewer of chicken and another of fish : Pathetically small pieces it had.Tasted below average.
2.Oriental Chicken Fried Rice : This was the only saving grace.
3.Stoneheaven's Fried Chocolate Bar : WELL.Do not judge a dish by it's name like we did or else you will have to sit trolled with a 5 star(worth rs. 5) fried with a bread-crumbs coating on,with a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with a bit of chocolate sauce and crying over 120 WASTED bucks.
We had a lot of expectations from this place and all of those are resting dead now,and definitely not in peace.
Try at your own risk. ‚úå

An average joint... I went there on a Monday I guess.. It was completely empty. 
I loved the interiors as well as the colour combinations. 
We ordered mixed hakka chowmien and a meat lovers platter.. 
Costed us 625* probably. 
The chowmien was huge in quantity and average in taste.. But the meat lovers platter did not satisfy us much.. The chicken pieces seemed extremely small and it was on the spicier side. 
Overall fair..

A very small little joint beside Maddox Square , this place has found popularity among the youth .
Went there with a friend for a quick bite but unfortunately they were about to host a birthday party that evening . We just had 30 mins as informed by the staff .
We ordered a mixed sauce pasta and a cheese grilled sandwich . The pasta was lip-smacking. Tasted amazing . The sandwich was OK , nothing special .

Pocket pinch : 500 for 2

Would love to try their skewers and desserts next time around :)

This intimate and cozy restaurant ,located in the bylanes of Hazra ,is an absolute delight.

Food ~ The food is very appetizing. Unlike other joints that use the same seasoning for all dishes, here each dish seasoning stands out from each other which come out smelling savory.
The Barbecue Chicken was flavorsome. The Barbecue sauce and the chicken with pineapple slices ,which were skewered, was cooked to perfection. The barbecue chicken wrap was zesty , bursting with flavors. And the Meat lovers platter is the WINNER hands down. You have to eat it to believe it. ¬†
The desserts will make you come to the restaurant again and again - Fried chocolate bar is heavenly.

Decor ~ 5/5 for the quirky decor. The graffities on the wall adds to the mood. ¬†Must say, Skewers is one creative restaurant from decor to menu cards to even the way in which foods are served.

Service ~ The staff here are very welcoming and attentive. The owners too make it a point to be present and look at every detail for making Skewers a wonderful gastronomic experience for their customers. The prices are extremely reasonable. The portions served is perfect to satisfy your hunger. Also, I was very impressed to see the cleanliness of the place.¬†

I wish the team at Skewers all the very best. I am sure it will carve a niche for itself in the days to come.¬†

YOU MUST VISIT !!!

Add one more to your bucket list of grilled food joint. Tucked in Earl Street near maddox square this little joint will surprise you in every bits & pieces. Various range of meat & veg option keeping the two types of foodie under control. To fill our pallet we went for,
üçπLemon Spritzer: as good as a nimbu paani.
üå≠Club Sandwich: a triple decker fully loaded sandwich with loads like egg, chicken, cheese, veggies & Bacon.
üç±Meat Lovers' Platter: a full barbecue of meat like chicken satay, mutton galouti & others doing full justice to the name, served alongside Hot Tangy Sauce. Recommended.
üçõStuffed Creamy Fish: indeed the mamma mia dish, fish skillet stuffed with spinach & cottage cheese tossed in white creamy sauce served with Rice. Highly Recommended.
All the prices are inclusive of taxes so no controversy there. Points cut for limited seating arrangements & ambience.
Still a worthy place to try some grilled items alongside the continental stuffs since the Chinese option is very limited. Pay a visit once its amongst the newly opened.
P.S. We swapped the mutton galouti with chicken.

Very recently, team Panchphoron was invited for a quick tasting session, and following were the dishes we were served:¬†
1) Black Currant Smoothie

2) Chocolate Shake

3) Mixed Medley Platter

4) Lemon Herb Fried Chicken

5) Fish Finger and Chips

6) Original Satay Skewers

7) Cheese Mushroom Garlic Bread

8) Devil‚Äôs Arabiata

9) Stuffed Creamy Fish

10) Caramel Custard

11) Stone Heaven‚Äôs Fried Chocolate

Their breads will surely catch your mind Fish Finger and Chips. Cheese mushroom garlic bread This is a bit of a take on garlic bread but kicked up a notch with the addition of creamy cheesy mushrooms. overall food quality was good. We need more of such assimilations in Kolkata. However the food didnt impress me as much as the decor.I would suggest everyone to pay a visit here once.

Skewers is located in Hazra, very close to Maddox Square. Easy to locate. Ample free car parking space.¬†
The restaurant is about a few months old, and they serve food in skewers.¬†
Try their mocktails/smoothies - litchi, mango.¬†
Recommended: Malai Mushroom skewers, Meat Lovers Platter, Mushroom Cheese Garlic Bread, and their desserts!!!¬†
The skewers are all complete packages in themselves, served with rice, and coleslaw makes for a complete meal.
Special mention for the desserts, of course. Given Ankita is a baker herself, the desserts are hard to miss!

Gastronomical Delight at Skewers..!

The intrinsic relationship of the people of Kolkata with the sultry and juicy Kebabs goes a long way back together. With the advent of new cuisine and lipsmacking flavors, this has become as near and dear to us as Rasgullas would be to us. A small and popular caf√© near Maddox Square, Skewers serves delicious and mouthwatering char-grilled Kebabs on a Skewer for the contention of heart and soul of its patrons. Their offerings is quite widespread and hence one can easily devour their tastebuds into a devouring meal.

The interior has been wonderfully done, with quirky graffitis. The sitting option is decent, and can easily house around 15-16 heads. While Kebab being their specialty, Skewers also provides dishes catering to other styles. Very recently, team Panchphoron was invited for a quick tasting session, and following were the dishes we were served:
1) Black Currant Smoothie

2) Chocolate Shake

3) Mixed Medley Platter

4) Lemon Herb Fried Chicken

5) Fish Finger and Chips

6) Original Satay Skewers

7) Cheese Mushroom Garlic Bread

8) Devil‚Äôs Arabiata

9) Stuffed Creamy Fish

10) Caramel Custard

11) Stone Heaven‚Äôs Fried Chocolate

The Black Currant Smoothie wasn‚Äôt overpowering but had just the right amount of subtleness and sweet tinge to it. The Mixed Medley Platter comprised of Firecracker Paneer, Barbecue Chicken, Malai Mushroom, Mutton Galouti, Firecracker Chicken and Skewer‚Äôs Special Chicken in Extra Hot Sauce. The Lemon Herb Fried Chicken had breasts portion of chicken which were skewered with a sauce made out of lemon and herbs.

This was a delightful combination as the lemon and herbs perfectly balanced each other. Fish Finger and Chips, quite a common Western Dish was once again a lipsmacking appetizer, with the panko crumbs coated fish was crisp and super fresh to lift our tastebuds. Served with fried and tartar sauce, this was quite a dish to savour.

The next episode comprised of the Original Satay Skewers, which had strips of char-grilled chicken with a touch of creamy peanut mix and kaffir lime. The cheese mushroom garlic bread complimented another dish, the Devil‚Äôs Arabiata very well. The garlic quotient of the bread, along with the cheese went very well with the Penne Pasta which was tossed with a tomato base sauce with a slight hint of garlic and chilli.

To end the mains, the Stuffed Creamy Fish were the best of the lot. Fresh, soft and tender portions of fish fillet, with a layer of cream over it which was then baked to perfection and served with lemon cream sauce and herb'd rice. My personal pick would be this dish, in my near future visits.

To end our saga, we savoured the luscious Caramel Custard and the Stone Heaven‚Äôs Fried Chocolate. While the former is self-explanatory, the latter was a bombshell. An entire Mars Chocolate bar, battered with coating and deep fried. It was accompanied with a scoop of Vanilla and Chocolate Ice Cream and topped with a dash of Chocolate Sauce. Needless to say, this was sinful enough to blow our hearts away and yearn for more.

If not for anything else, visit this place for their amazing Skewers, Stuffed Creamy Fish and Stone Heaven‚Äôs Fried Chocolate. While the rest of their offerings do stand out well, the ones highlighted above are exceptional and would give you true value for money.

I was on the lookout for a new place to eat when I came across Skewers. It is located in a bylane and very near to Maddox Square. It's a small joint decorated with beautiful grafitti on the walls. I found the staff to be very courteous and well acquainted with the menu. We ordered
1. Lemon Spritzer
2. Lemon and Herb Fried Chicken: Highly recommended. This one is served with french fries. The chicken has a very distinct flavour
3. Skewers spl chicken hot sauce: A good one
4. Firecracker chicken: A good one with a very unique presentation.
5. Stuffed Creamy Fish: Highly recommended. This one will surely win your heart.
All the mains are served with a portion of rice and salad. We were a little disappointed since only icecream was available for dessert. Overall a good place if you want to have some good food at a reasonable price.

Its a hard place to find while walking down the road but it was well worth it :). The food, the ambience and the price all made for a satisfying experience. 
We ordered a lemon spritzer(its basically fresh lime soda sweet) and a Stuffed Creamy fish. Stuffed with spinach and cottage cheese, the creamy fish along with the rice tasted like heaven. Then we ordered a Meat Lover's Platter , it consisted of skewered chicken dipped in delicious sauces and tasted really good. Lastly we had an ice cream sundae . Sadly the caramel pudding had finished for the day but we will definitely try it another day :D

It was a rainy afternoon and it couldn't have got better than this... lunch at skewers... a quaint little eatery by a dear friend who is a great home baker herself... so there I was tucked away in a cozy corner and treated to some very delicious finger licking good food and that too at very good rates... the panko fried mushrooms were crispy, tasty and the perfect starter complementing the afternoon weather.. this was followed by their very own barbecue chicken which was served very authentically and was delicious and finally there was my favourite stuffed creamy fish which was wholesome and extremely flavourful... all in all a great place to go with friends and family where the owner couple takes great care to make your visit really wonderful with their eye for presentation, portions and flavour... a must visit for all... well done Ankita and Bikram!

Tucked away in the bylanes of Hazra area, this little new place is where you can expect to get a wholesome, hearty meal with friends and family on a very pocket friendly budget. Best known for their skewered specialities, there are a couple of other dishes that I particularly liked. The Lemon Herb Fried Chicken with the perfect crunch and the Stuffed Fish with a serving of rice on side with the right creamy and fresh balance are a must try. The Noodles and Pasta are quite decent as well.
Among the skewered specialities, the Mixed Medley Platter with an assortment of six skewers ( both vegetarian and non vegetarian) is something you cannot miss out on. And for the hardcore carnivores the Meat Lovers Platter could be the perfect answer!
The portion sizes are generous and can be easily shared by two.
Among the desserts I loved the humble Caramel Custard. However, I might just go back for their Fried Chocolate Bar!

This #newintown little place, tucked away neatly in a lane in Hazra, is known for its skewered delights.  Over my two visits and one takeaway experience, I have tasted quite a few of the things on their menu, and out of the non-skewered things, I quite liked the Lemon Herb Fried Chicken with a crispy coating over tender slivers of the meat. The Club Sandwich which has fresh veggies, perfectly cooked egg, bacon and makes for a hearty mouthful, is another thing which I particularly liked. 

The mains here are generously portioned. The Chilli Garlic Noodles and the Chilli Fish are decent too. The noodles weren't gluggy at all, and were seasoned well. As for the fish, it could have had a little more chilli to justify it's name. However, the Stuffed Fish served with a portion of rice, were amazing. The flaky fillets doused in a creamy sauce, is one of those things that fish lovers will be forced to go back to, again and again. 

Now coming to the skewers, I have tried their Mixed Medley Platter, Meat Lovers Platter and also their Galouti Skewers. With an assortment of 6 Skewers, the platters are the perfect things to be shared, and are priced very moderately indeed. Both the Meat Lovers Platter and the Mixed Medley Platter are highly recommended. 

Of the desserts, I had the Caramel Custard. The simple, no-frill Custard with the golden caramel on top was the perfect ending to the great meal that I had thereüòÄ

Walk on a kebab trails with Skewers

Kebabs are a common delicacy in India. The common varieties of kebabs include Chicken Tikka, Afghani, Malai, Reshami among others. But, in an effort to break through the norm and give the classic an upgrade with unearthed ingredients and make kebabs with a desi touch - Skewers, Kolkata have been very enthusiastic.

A skewer is a thin metal or wood stick used to hold pieces of food together. They are used while grilling or roasting meats, and in other culinary applications. Skewers are often used for kebab dishes. The casual dining restaurant- Skewers boasts of having amazing char grilled kebabs that will leave your taste buds craving for more. 

Location : This is located in Earle Street, Hazra just adjacent to Maddox Square.

Food : Skewers promises an extensive menu. The kebabs being the main focus,  Skewers serves typical European cafe food with an amazing taste. 

Beverages:
1.Black currant smoothie - Make the most of the berry season with a glass of fruity goodness with a thick yoghurt based black currant pulps. 

2. Chocolate shake - This is the all the time favourite sweetened chocolate-flavored milk. Just dive in and feel the awesome drizzle of chocolate.

Starters:
1. Mixed medley platter - Malai Mushroom,  firecracker paneer, firecracker chicken,  barbecue chicken,  skewer's special chicken in extra hot sauce and mutton galouti skewers. 

2. Lemon herb fried chicken - Seared chicken breast with lemon herb pan sauce. The lemon and rosemary were a perfect combination. 

3. Fish finger and chips - Juicy pieces of fish coated in panko crumbs, deep fried and served with home fries and tartar sauce.

4. Original Satay Skewers - Strips of chicken char grilled and basted with creamy peanut sauce with a zing of kaffir lime.

5.Cheese mushroom garlic bread - This is a bit of a take on garlic bread, but kicked up a notch with the addition of creamy cheesy mushrooms. It's amazingness redefined. 

Mains:
1. Devil's Arabiata - Penne pasta in chilli garlic infused tomato base with chicken,  garnished with dried red chillies. 

2. Stuffed creamy fish - Tender juicy baked fish with lemon cream sauce served with herbed rice which is hard to resist.

Desserts: 
1. Caramel custard - House baked custard deliciously lined with a film of caramel on top. 

2. Stoneheaven's fried chocolate bar - This is the USP of Skewers other than kebabs. This is battered and fried chocolate bars served with a scoop of vanilla and chocolate ice-cream.The chocolate bars used are Mars Bars -- caramel and nougat covered in chocolate. The batter used is the same batter as is used for fish and chips. The caramel and chocolate melts in the mouth and takes you to a whole new level. 

What to look out for? The quirky doodle graffiti on the walls, Stoneheaven's fried chocolate bar, Stuffed creamy fish, Mixed medley platter and Original Satay Skewers. 

Want to experience Nakhoda Masjid on Phears Lane, Zakaria Street and Colootola - the ‚ÄòKebab Gully of Kolkata‚Äô? Don't think twice,  just drop into Skewers and re-live it all with a twist. 
Cheers!

Skewers is one of the newest restaurants in South Kolkata. The location is prime, near Maddox Square on Earle Street, and the joint is well lit and comfy.
Really found the name eye catching since I'm a lover of chicken skewers. So already, you know what to expect from this restaurant - a myriad of skewers to win everyone's heart. But that's not all, you also get a number of lip smacking continental grub and also chinese!

I was invited here by the owners, Mr. and Mrs. Banerjee, who were perfect hosts for the evening. The food tasting session that followed was a fantastic one.

So let's start talking food!

We started with 2 drinks, the Strawberry Lemonade and the Special Chocolate Shake. Honestly, I don't know which one was better, because I loved both of them! The refreshing taste of the Strawberry Lemonade with a dash of lemon was perfect for a sultry evening. The Chocolate Shake, on the other hand was rich and sinful with oodles of chocolate! Perfect for every chocoholic!

STARTERS :

‚Ä¢ Lemon Herb Fried Chicken - This was my favourite starter of the evening, and I'm recommending it to everyone who's visiting skewers! Absolutely loved the crispy cornflakes coating and the juicy meat!

‚Ä¢ Veg Gold Coin - Lip smacking veg pakoras in layman's terms. It was crispy and tasted really good.

‚Ä¢ Club Sandwich - Another winner from this restaurant! A triple decker sandwich loaded with cheese, chicken, egg and bacon! What more do you want? This was perfect, exactly how I like my sandwiches.

MAINS :

‚Ä¢ Chilli Garlic Noodles with Sweet Chilli Fish - The first thing that stunned me was the huge quantity! One plate of noodles is more than enough for 2, and there were 8 pieces of fish in the side dish. The noodles tasted perfect with the tangy sweet chilli fish. I loved the softness and the texture of the fish.

‚Ä¢ Mixed Medley Platter - It was time for us to try their signature item and I was awestruck just at the sight of it. If you want to enjoy perfect skewers, visit this restaurant and eat it the way they serve it to you! The experience is unparalleled. So this platter had a number of veg and non veg skewers which included Malai Mushroom, Firecracker Paneer, Barbeque Chicken, Sweet Chilli Fish and Mutton Galouti! My favourites were the Sweet Chilli Fish and Mutton Galouti. Each of the skewers had a distinct flavour and tasted different from the other! An absolute 5/5 platter!

‚Ä¢ Creamy Stuffed Fish - This was another dish that stole my heart! The stuffed fish tasted heavenly and was served with herb rice. The fish was creamy and stuffed with cheese and spinach. This turned out to be the best dish of the evening and I'm surely returning for this!

‚Ä¢ Mixed Sauce Chicken Pasta - One of the best pastas I've ever had! Honestly, I can't explain how amazing this tasted. There was a generous amount of chicken cubes, much to my joy! Another dish that is strongly recommended.

DESSERT :

After hogging so much, it was time for the dessert, and the beautiful Caramel Pudding was served to us. It looked and tasted amazing. I especially liked the texture. The perfect end to a perfect dinner!

In conclusion, I would say that Skewers is a must visit for every meat lover and foodie! The location is a plus point and so are the prices. This restaurant is extremely affordable and provides brilliant food without burning a hole in your pockets.

I absolutely loved the food and the d√©cor, and I'll be back again for sure!
All my love to Team Skewers!

‚ÄãSkewers is a small yet cozy restaurant close to Maddox Square. Going by the name, one can easily infer that the speciality of this place is food being grilled on skewers. But Skewers is not limited to that alone. This place has a vast menu comprising of Chinese, pastas, sandwiches, wraps and a lot more. ¬†¬†

I was invited here by the owners for a food tasting session. The place might look small from outside but it has an accomodation capacity of 20 people. The graffiti on the wall looks beautiful and the overall decor goes well with the casual dining concept. ¬†I started with the mocktails which included Strawberry Lemonade and Chocolate Shake. The Strawberry Lemonade was chilled, fizzy and refreshing. I liked the sweet flavour of strawberry which was balanced by a dash of lime. The Chocolate Shake was rich, creamy and flavourful. ¬†

Among starters, the Lemon Herb Fried Chicken turned out to be my favourite. The chicken fillet was thick and soft, fried with cornflakes crumbs. The cornflakes crumbs imparted an extra crispness to the outer covering. The chicken was marinated with lemon and herb which gave a beautiful flavour to it. The dish was served with fries and tomato ketchup. The Vegetable Gold Coin was crispy and is a good option for vegetarians.

The Club Sandwich was a triple decker sandwich loaded with bacon, egg, chicken, cheese and veggies. The bread was crispy and the stuffing was generous. It tasted good and was extremely juicy and flavourful.

Chinese isn't one of their signature dishes. The Hot Garlic Noodles tasted nice, which came in huge quantity with generous portions of meat. What I couldn't stop admiring was the Sweet Chilli Fish, which perfectly complemented the noodles. The fish was extremely soft and delicate, such that I fell in love with its texture.¬†

The Mixed Medley Platter, which came next, was a combination of a number of skewers, comprising of both vegetarian and non vegetarian options. It included Malai Mushroom, Firecracker Paneer, Barbeque Chicken, Sweet Chilli Fish and Mutton Galouti Skewers. The platter came along with the grill and looked very appetising. The meat and the veggies in each case tasted amazing. I somehow loved the Malai Mushroom Skewer, which I chose to be my favourite, even surpassing the non vegetarian options. The mushrooms were stuffed with cheese and veggies. The malai sauce tasted out of the world. I would recommend each and everyone to try this out during your visit to Skewers.

Moving on, the Stuffed Creamy Fish impressed me again. The fish was stuffed with cheese and spinach. It was an amazing delight ! The texture of the fish was great. A special mention goes to the creamy sauce which imparted a special flavour to the fish.¬†

I'm not a fan of Mix Sauce Pastas but I loved the one I had here. The mixed sauce was perfect, with proper balance of cheese and tanginess. The pasta had generous portions of chicken chunks. I, however, felt that the penne could have been boiled for a some more time but the beautiful flavour of the mixed sauce compensated it.¬†

I ended my meal with the Caramel Pudding. The caramel sauce was well prepared. The pudding was good in terms of both texture and taste. This is definitely a good option for desserts after savouring some delectable skewers.¬†

Overall, Skewers has a number of delicious dishes. My recommendations are the Lemon Herb Fried Chicken, the Malai Mushroom Skewer, the Stuffed Creamy Fish and the Mixed Sauce Pasta. The service was prompt. The pricing is pretty cheap, in comparison to the current market rates. I'm definitely coming back soon to try the other dishes on their menu.

Located in Hazra, close to Maddox Square Garden, Skewers is a small restaurant with a great menu.
I was invited here for a bloggers meet by the owner duo of Bikram and Ankita Banerjee.
The concept is different, food is served on a skewer. It is roasted, grilled and cooked to perfection.
The menu also boasts of your usual fare like Chinese, wraps and sandwiches.

Below is my gastronomic experience-
‚Ä¢ Mango Smoothie- yoghurt based and had a wonderful mango flavour #recommended
‚Ä¢ Litchi Smoothie- again yoghurt based but the litchi taste was missing. Can we improved.
‚Ä¢ Panko Fried Mushrooms- whole button mushrooms stuffed with cheese and deep fried in a panko crust served with ketchup. Was delicious, though they can introduce a dip alongside this otherwise good item
‚Ä¢ Mushroom Malai Skewer- mushroom skewered and grilled. Served with a topping of cheese and malai. Loved it #recommended
‚Ä¢ Barbecue Paneer Skewers- was served with spicy Mexican rice while the paneer was spicy and sweet. Delicious is the word. #recommended
‚Ä¢ Schezwan Potato skewers- for the Bravehearts who can take the heat. Loved the schezwan sauce which marinated the potato and was grilled with it #recommended
‚Ä¢ Mushroom and Cheese toast was a perfect blend of the combination I love. Cheesy, crusty, tasty!
‚Ä¢ Pasta in Bechamel sauce was just wow! Cheesy and creamy with a generous helping of parsley. #recommended
‚Ä¢ Fried Chocolate Bar - a crusted snicker bar deep fried in a delicious crusty batter and served with ice-cream. Truly America on a plate! #recommended
‚Ä¢ Mushroom and Marshmallow Skewer- yes you read right! The American favorites, smores flavoured dessert finds place in their menu and tastes just wonderful.

The place is small, but the dynamic duo have poured their heart out in planning a brilliant menu.

Why should you go to Skewers?
Delicious multi cuisine you cannot miss!
Reasonably priced menu

I would like to thank Bikram and Ankita for this invitation.
Do try this place guys and let me know how you liked it?:)

This small restaurant is located close to Maddox Square, run by an enthusiastic and energetic couple. Going with the name they try to present everything on skewers(even the dessert is served in skewers).
Most of the combos comes with herbed rice that augments the taste.
There is also a 'meat lovers platter' which is the most popular among patrons. It has 4 differently flavoured chicken and omitting folks skewer.
Among drinks there are mongo, pitcher smoothies. 
My personal favourite is the stuffed creamy fish skewers.
If you love pasta you can try the pasta in cheese cream sauce.
The brownie marshmallow is the dessert to look out for though you can also try the fried ice cream bar.

Had ordered meat lovers platter from Swiggy but received incomplete order.mutton galouti kebab was missing. Though Swiggy had replaced the order but still again mutton galouti kebab was missing. I again made a complaint‚Äã so Swiggy refunded me back . I would endorse Swiggy for their service but as for the restaurant would definitely not recommend to anyone.

Skewers - A small cozy place with great food. 
===== 
Location & Intro: 

It is located right near Maddox Square Park. It is not at all difficult to locate. 

Skewers is quite a nice concept which aims at providing reasonable portions of food at reasonable price. The best part about this concept which i like is that there will be minimal wastage as the rice portion served with skewers or their platter is not very heavy at all. I was invited here by Karishma Sharma who is a fellow foodie friend and a food blogger and we were a group of around 5-7 people. 
===== 
What i had: 

‚óã Litchi Smoothie - The litchi smoothie lacked the litchi flavour due to high yoghurt added to the drink. It was not even cold. To my knowledge, smoothies are supposed to be cold. I gave immediate feedback about this to the owners. 

‚óã Mango Smoothie - This one was much better than the former. The mango smoothie was flavorful and tasted really nice. 

‚óã Panko Fried Mushroom - The panko fried mushroom was crispy on the outside and smoky hot and tender on the inside. Really relished it. However, it should have been served with some other dip as it was not going hand in hand with the usual tomato ketchup.

‚óã Fish Paprika Pimento - If you are looking for a tinge of spice to your starter and especially hot and lipsmacking fish, this is the right starter for you. We were served this. I prefer boneless fish over the one with bones and this perfectly satiated my palate. 

‚óã Malai Mushroom Skewers - It was nice and creamy. Served with a bowl of rice to us and salad dressing. However, the presentation was nice but similar as compared to other dishes. Who cares about presentation much when the food is mouthmelting? 

‚óã Stuffed Creamy Fish Skewers - This was excellent. For the fish, they currently serve Basa fish. It was creamy, mouth melting and this one dish is enough for two. Served with a bowl of rice to us and salad dressing. Loved it.

‚óã Barbeque Paneer Skewers - It was really nice and quite a good dish for the vegetarians. 

‚óã Schezuan Potato Skewers - This was better than the paneer anyday. If you want to make a choice amongst the two, simply go for this one. However, if you don't want spice at all then go for the paneer. 

‚óã Meat Lovers Platter - The meat lovers platter was nice. However, some of the chicken pieces got stiff. I personally felt if they are marinated for some more time, it could have been much more succulent. Though, i loved it. The mutton was also nice. 

‚óã Pasta in Creamy Cheese Sauce - The pasta was served hot and was quite ample quantity. I liked it. Though, i felt that little more add up of oregano will add up to it's flavor more. 

‚óã Cheesy Mushroom Garlic Bread - The bread tasted really nice but i personally did not like the presentation of this one. 

‚óã Fried Chocolate Bar - The chocolate bar was fine. I am not a chocolate person neither do i like fried ice creams much. 

‚óã Brownie Marshmallow - This is highly recommended from my side. Totally loved on this one. The marshmellows were mushy. 

After having so much, we all were so full!!! 
===== 
Pros: 

‚óã Great food.

‚óã Moderately priced. 

‚óã Service is fast.

Cons: 

‚óã Small when it comes to space. 
===== 
Meal for two for two: 200-400 approximate. The prices are subject to change due to macro economic factors such as inflation, etc. 
===== 
Summary: 

Presentation 4.3/5 

Taste 4.2/5 

Quality 4.1/5 

Quantity 4.1/5 

Service 4/5 

Hospitality 4.2/5 

Ambiance 3.8/5 

VFM 4/5 
===== 
Conclusion: 

This place is a great place even if you want to eat alone because of their portion size. I will be visiting soon again.

Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

Skewers is cute little place located in Hazra. The most visible landmark is the Maddox Square. Easy to locate. Ample free car parking space. Done up in shades of yellow and black, this one's hard to miss!¬†
The name itself is a big giveaway - yes, they serve their food skewered or using skewers.
Young owners add to the vibrancy of the outlet - they are so nice to talk to! You'd know how hard they have work to set this up. This is known concept but no one else in Kolkata has taken this risk.¬†
Moving on to the mocktails - must try - Litchi smoothie, and mango smoothie. The base is of yogurt and very refreshing!
Food - Every meal is a whole meal in itself. They have lately added some Oriental offerings in their menu and they are definitely here to stay!
Recommended: Malai Mushroom skewers, Meat Lovers Platter, Mushroom Cheese Garlic Bread, and their desserts!!!
Except for the appetizers, every meal has a good portion of coleslaw, skewered meat, and herbed rice. The rice is nice and flavorsome.
The desserts are beautiful visually, and melt in the mouth. Definitely try their fried chocolate bar. The brownie is made in house too.¬†
A warm evening wrapped up amidst good food, and good people! Thanks

A small place but with a big heart! Excellent

food.. Try the cream of mushroom soup... Thick with cream nd delicious, followed by the cheesy

penne ... Very filling.... And the mixed meat platter... Excellent, though the chicken could have been more tender maybe.
A great start to a restaurant that has a lot of potential. What's even better is that the owners are there personally and are totally hands on.... From taking your order to serving to even clearing the table!!
Prices too are reasonable. Highly recommended

Skewers served us a lovely lunch which comprised of Fish Pimiento, Crispy Chicken as starters followed by Grilled Chicken, Grilled Fish and Stir Fried Chicken Noodles as mains. It is a nice cosy place near Madax Square and we loved the cool interior. Food was served promptly and it was better than what we expected. I would surely go back to check other items on the card especially the skewers and the yummy desserts. The staff was very cordial, the chef came out and exchanged a few words with a smile which made our dining experience quite memorable

A small quaint restaurant next to Maddox square park...if also closes by 9 30pm which is strange.. It has a good decor and excellent service. The concept is good and the flavors and taste is good... We tried a meat platter... Which had different items and was nice. However I did not like the quality of the meat.. The lamb was not available and the chicken was very hard... Either very old stock which has gone hard or not thawed properly....

My daughter and I chanced upon the outlet quite accidentally and what a chance meeting it was! The ambience cosy; the Mario Miranda inspired wall which would captivate the selfie addicts and above all the food- delicious! We had ordered the Meat Lover's Platter and the Firecracker Chicken Wrap. The variety on the meat platter was amazing. The meat was succulent and the flavours, amazing. The wrap came with fresh fries and Cole slaw, yum! The next time we tried out the Pasta in Bechmel sauce. It was creamy with just the right hint of garlic. We are total converts. Looking forward to trying out the whole menu because we are seriously serious gourmets and gourmands.

I love love love this gem of a place! Located very close to Shishumangal Hospital in Hazra, its a fantastic eatery. I went to this place for lunch and the food surprised me.
We had ordered the Meat platter,fiery chicken wrap,pasta in bechamel sauce and panko fried chocolate caramel roll with chocolate ice cream.
The meat in the platter were succulent,juicy and chunky with a plethora of sauces. Coleslaw is served on the side.
The fiery chicken which came in a wrap was spicy and sizzling. The wrap was soft.
The pasta was al dente, creamy and cheesy. The portion was more than enough.
The dessert was the best of the lot! The chocolate caramep roll was crunchy on the outside but gooey from within. It was a sweet assault on our taste buds!
The dishes are very very reasonably priced and at present no VAT is levied.
The decor is lovely and quirky!
The staff is very polite and helpful.
Sorry no pictures as I had forgotten to take them since I was too mesmerized with the food! :)

I first came across this place at Tastes of Bengal food festival. We ordered for chicken barbecue and sweet chili fish. Both were served with rice. The food is really tasty. The pieces of chicken were succulent soft , they just melted in our mouths. Looking forward to visit this place at Hazra. The barbecue was live even though the portions were small. Nice job.

Skewers had put up a stall in Tastes of India at Nalban. It was a treat to see live grill and the fire that came out of the grillers. Coming to the food, had a chicken peanut coconut skewers. It was served with a rice. The chicken skewers were soft and juicy. Loved the flavour. The rice was just awesome; it was spicy no doubt but was so good. The combination was well matched. Will visit the outlet soon.
