Situated just opposite "The Wall" and beside "Tolly Tales", Hola is a fascinating discovery. Nice ambiance (would recommend sitting near the windows facing the road), simple yet effective decor. They have used the space as much as possible while ensuring it isn't cluttered. There are three kinds of seating arrangements including plenty of private-like seating space.¬†The menu is currently limited as it is a trial menu (it's been less than a month this place opened) yet the variety on it is amazing. I really recommend the not-so-usual fare they have on their menu; especially the wasabi prawns, pokchoy dumplings, chicken teriyaki bao. These dishes were absolutely delicious. They have two soups on the menu, though these are the usual sweet corn and manchow - both are delicious so a definite try. I have tried some of their other starters like the crispy chilly babycorn and ebony ivory balls (chicken version) - these were so-so. We also tried chicken and corn suimais which were decent.¬†In the main course, the Indian fare (we tried the jeera rice, garlic naan with chicken lababdar - all good) and the Oriental fare (we tried burnt garlic noodles - good, chicken fried rice - so-so, fish in mild garlic sauce - so-so and a chicken in Malaysian sauce - so-so) are usual and decent. The continental fare is limited rigth now. However, the grilled fisk cakes in pea puree is a very good dish. It is made in true continental style and so many may find it a little bland. For authentic continental lovers, it's a delight.The desserts are great. We tried a brownie with ice cream once and chocolate mousse the other time (yes, 2 visits already!)..both desserts were exceptional.¬†The mocktails are also nice. We tried the watermelon mango basil - very good, cucumber - very refreshing, orange mojito - good, spicy something - so-so. They also have shakes available, but haven't tried those.The prices are average to above average but justified given the quantity served and the taste of the food.¬†The service is warm, friendly and above average. The co-owner is usually around to chat and recommend dishes. The chef also drops in at the end of the meal. They are open to feedback and also suggest and serve options not on the menu currently. They also make a lot of effort serving dishes that look good!All in all, this place is a must try. I've tried almost everything on their current menu. Stick to the unusual fare and you'll definitely love it. Can't wait to go back once they move to a larger menu or maybe even before that :)

This place is a new one in the city . Situated just beside Tolly tales/on opposite side of  Xrong place . 
The co owner of the place was very friendly and welcoming and gave her personal suggestion for food and drinks . The interiors are classy and the staff are friendly . We tried The Chicken Teriyaki Bao and it was delicious . We also tried a couple of their soft beverages ...i liked the ginger ale. 
The prices are on the margin and the menu has a lot of variety , not just the same old food you find in every other pub . This place is worth a visit .
