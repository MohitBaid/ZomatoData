Being very close to my school and my girlfriend's home, I've had different kinds of sweets from here on various occasions. But among their recent creations, I admire their kheer kodom the most. Kheer kodom is one of my favorite sweets, and I actually have not had a better kheer kodom anywhere. Hats off to laxmi narayan for so many succulent memories.

This sweet shop located just opposite to chaplin park and very near to South calcutta girls school. Tried their Misti Singara and rosogolla, Average taste. Nothing special.

It's a small neighbourhood sweet shop which most people who have grown up in the area will swear by.  The sweets and the sandesh are regular fares but the singara is just fabulous.
