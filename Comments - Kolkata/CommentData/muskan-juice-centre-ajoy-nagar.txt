The best part about this small juice corner is that they use fresh milk. (Tetra packs) 
Also decent flavours with good brands to back it up.
The behaviour is stale at times since the man handling this shop looks tired and has unusual glass sizes per random juice or shakes.

I normally don't prefer having juices or shakes outside as I feel these can be very easily prepared at home and won't cost you as much. 
Nevertheless when you are out for long and you really need to quench your thirst,  this ain't a bad place to do so!  I have tried their mango juice,  pineapple juice and cold coffee.  They were all pretty standard but the cold coffee was really well made! :-)
