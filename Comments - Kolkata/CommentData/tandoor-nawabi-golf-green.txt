Arduous semesters and odd hour hunger pangs go hand in hand. Surfing through online ordering eateries nearby at pocket friendly prices made me run into this place. Was looking for something North Indian and this place happens to provide so. Seeing the prices pretty reasonable, quickly placed an order for Butter Naan and Kadhai Paneer. They fetched us our food within 25 minutes to our sheer surprise. The food was nice as well, paneer was okay and quantity pretty enough for two people.

First of all this foodjoint should not get even 3.3 point review which is showing right now . I dont give negative reviews easily but this order made me do dat . this place called 'tandoor nawabi'  should b named as  'tandoor bakwas'... To ol d foodies out der plz dun place ur food orders frm here ever as i have experienced d pathetic one wd deir food quality n taste. For my anniversary dinner we have ordered 'Mutton Biryani , Chilli Fish, Mix fried rice , Chilli Chicken ' . each of these items were PATHETIC... In terms of quality , taste n quantity it was soo bad . quantity was real bad. Chilli chicken was full of Blood Red food Colors dat u wont feel like eating dat by opening d box at d frst tym only... Chilli fish was undercooked n raw olmost. Fried rice was undercooked too. 
Overall Rating would b 0 out of 10 .

Just wanted to have casual light veg food all of a sudden yesterday when I came across this place.So we ordered Mushroom Masala,  Mixed Veg and Butter Tandoori Roti.
Price :- Very Reasonable 
Quantity :- Very Good (4/5)
Quality :- Not at all bad as pwr the price(3.5/5)
Go and order food from here if your budget is low and you are in no mood to cook food.

Had ordered mixed veg and navratna Korma which came basically the same with same ingredients and taste. Had their veg polao. They use the biriyani rice and mix it with veggies and paneer. Thus taste is not so very good. Basically tastes like biriyani.  Their rolls and kebabs are better. Quantity wise ok. Not very much. Their chicken cutlets were juicy, but were smaller in size as compared to the price they charge.  Ordinary resturant with ordinary food.

This restaurant do not deserve even 1 rating for the pathetic food that they deliver. I had ordered yesterday a plate of handi chicken based on the 3+ rating I saw for this outlet. The order reached my place before time but once I opened the container of food I got shocked by seeing the color, the texture and the smell of chicken handi. I have never seen such a pale dish in my life and to make it more worse the handi chicken did not have even a pinch of salt. It had the tiniest of pieces of chicken in it. I wonder how Zomato have listed such an atrocious food joint in its online ordering portal. I have shared a picture of that horror dish that I had been delivered for all of you to witness it.

Chicken Tikka and chicken reshmi kebab. Tikka turned out to be better than reshmi. Tikka was tangy, spicy and juicy....on the other hand reshmi was far from reshmi....since it is delivered at home there is always chance of the food getting cold and soggy. In case of reshmi kebab...the risk is that instead of being soft, silky and succulent it tends to get hard and rubbery....anyways....Tikka thik Tha.....

Ordered from Tandoor Nawabi. Delivery took around 35 minutes.

I ordered naan, tandoori roti and chicken chaap. Quality was pretty average. Didn't expected it to be delicious either. Chicken chaap was very oily & was tasteless according to me, it had no flavour. Only plus is that the price is very cheap. Chicken chaap was of 100 rupees.

Naan & tandoori roties were ok.

All in all, it wasn't a good experience.

Ordered via Swiggy hence can't comment on the ambience. The food isn't that great and lacks flavour. I had a chicken cheese kebab and mutton biriyani. The kebab was bland and needs a bit more salt. Also they need to team it up with some type of chutney to compliment the sweet taste. Biriyani was dry and lacks flavour though the mutton was well cooked. With 2 pieces of mutton, one piece potato and egg it is serves good for a person. Where it lacks in taste it makes up in portion size and pricing. Overall, much improvement needed in terms of flavours and taste.

Had the biriyani as a takeaway item. It was a pretty basic biriyani, no added frills, keeping the Kolkata style of cooking intact. People who do not enjoy the smell of kewra water (as pointed out by the commenter below, apologies for the mistake) might struggle a bit - I didn't mind it very much. Personally thought the rice being mildly spicy was a good thing, and the potato was really well cooked. All in all, decent place, based on just the biriyani.

I ordered for a plate of Mutton Biryani.
The mutton was severely undercooked.
The Biryani had the smell of attar or ittar, that too in very high quantities.
This made it unappetising.
And as an icing on the cake, the order was delivered 30 minutes late.

নবাবী ঘরানার রান্নায় পারদর্শী।

অসাধারন কুলচা। চীজ কুলচা.. নরম, পুরুষ্টু আর পেট ভরতি চীজ।
খেতেও খাসা।

এর সাইজ বেশ বড়.. অনেক নামীদামী রেস্তোরাঁ কুলচাকেও

লজ্জায় ফেলে দেবে।

বাকি মশলা কুলচা বা কিমা নান.. দুধর্ষ।

তবে মাঝে মাঝে পরিমানে নজর দিতে গিয়ে স্বাদে খেই হারিয়ে

ফেলেছে।

আর একি মশলা বিভিন্ন পদে ব্যবহার করার বদ-অভ্যাস কিছু

নম্বর কমাল। তাতে বিভিন্ন খাবারের নিজস্বতা হারিয়ে যায়।

আর মাশরুমের পদে.. অনেকদিন ধরে ফ্রিজে থাকার

ফলে..মাশরুম রাবারের মত অবস্থা..মিষ্টতা হারিয়ে ফেলেছে।

খরচ কম।

তন্দুরি খাবার খেতে ইচ্ছে হলে আসতেই পারেন। হতাশ করবে না।

Not at the best location. Delivery timing needs to be taken care of. First time had a great experience having tandoori, butter chicken etc etc. But the following experiences disappointed way too much. Special mughlai didnt had anything special in it. Malai paneer was average. Fried rice too.

Simply great food! without a second thought just go for it. They know our taste better. Food is worth the money. If you want an awesome food to be delivered at your home then TANDOOR NAWABI is simply best in this area. No extra charges (service tax, VAT, packaging charge etc.) like other shitty restaurants.

Located at a very strategic position near Golf green..food from Tandoor Nawabi is extremely pocket friendly. Be it the mughlai or newly added chinese, food is prepared with a lot of passion & this is evident from the taste. The fish fry is the best in the locality. Indeed a take away joint worth repeat visits.
