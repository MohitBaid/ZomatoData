This is a cozy ice cream parlour situated inside a market very near to the Madhyamgram Chowmatha... Nothing to speak about the ambience, decor or staffs... Service is good... I tried their triple scoop sundae... And it was good... Pocket pinch is friendly... It is mainly popular among the college goers...

I went to this place with my friends. Seating arrangement is good. The ice cream are not bad... Good place to give adda... However we had to wait for 30 mins before we could have our order even though the place was almost empty... Still a good place for a date.

Excellent place to hang out with friends.... The sitting available at the 1st floor, and also a very nice place to share a scoop with your gf/bf
Is a must visit.....
