Royal spoon is near the place i used to stay during my college years.. i was there umpteenth times..i have tried almost everything from their menu..egg rolls to chicken rolls,hakka noodles to gravy chowmien... the monos are just too good to descrive... panfried momo and drums of heaven are really tasty...i love their food... though it is a roadside shop.. but the quality of the good is really good... their mixed chowmien is my favourite.. there is no sitting arrangement in that shop.. you have to sit  outside the shop.. there are benches outside the shop...i wish they could arrange some seating.. it is cheap,pocket friendly... 
i should go there again...

The food in this place is awesome and the price is ridiculously low for the quality. The Chicken Chopsuey served here is a must try, the quality and quantity is just unbelievable. Mostly had take out, so will not comment on the ambience and service but take outs are prepared pretty fast.

It is located near Bethune college, very often i go there in break times...! 
They don't have sitting arrangements except only a bench and 2 or 3 tools... its difficult to have food there.... but there services are very good. They make tasty food. Mainly i have there combo plates , those are amazing to have for lunch.
Prices are reasonable and affordable.
Services are too good.
Food are freshly cooked and awesome in taste.
Staffs are good.
A must place for college goers ðŸ‘Œ

Ordered food quite a few times in between classes, through Swiggy.
They make good chinese undoubtedly!
Food-
Pan Fried Momo - Highly recommendable! Tossed in spicy sauce.
Schezwan Fried Rice- A bit sticky. Portion of egg chicken is very less. 
Hunan style Chicken- served in white sauce. Chicken pieces were tender enough. Gravy was a good blend of Chinese spices.

Quantity is good. Highly pocket friendly.
You might even avail good discount when you order through Swiggy.

Located near Hedua Park, vivekananda Road. Small take away outlet with Chinese Cousine offering. Ordered Non-veg combo(Rice). Quantity was good and so was the taste. Chilly chicken was awesome with extra spicy taste. Pocket friendly place.

Royal spoon is not royal by any means!!! ðŸ˜‚
I ordered for one chicken sweet corn soup n garlic prawn(dry). They confirmed the order, later called me to notify that prawn items r not available. So I asked them to send the soup only. Wat they sent tasted awful. So small amount of chicken Pieces. They didn't send any sauce too. The quantity was small too.. The food disappointed me a lot. The only good thing about the place is, the pocket pinch is low.

The food is tasty. However, they take a lot of time. Being a college student, it's pretty tense having to wait for your lunch when you know class is about to start. Sitting arrangement includes a bench on one side of the food path.

Was searching for a cheap option while scrolling through swiggy's list and got to know about this place. The food seemed really cheap so I ordered it. I ordered a mixed chowmein and drums of heaven. The delivery from the resturant was prompt and the food was piping hot when it reached.

The mixed chowmein was good and it had great quantity which could easily feed 2 people. The taste was okayish but it had numerous pieces of chicken, eggs and prawns.

The drums of heaven were cruncy and really tasty. It was worth 120 rs as the plate came with 8 pieces which were fairly big. I loved it and would order this again.

When I saw this on Zomato I was so excited to write a review. I've been here for uncountable times...it's extremely pocket friendly for college students like us ..this place is mostly crowded with students. They have varieties of food options mostly Chinese and despite of offering food in such a low cost they serve decent food.
Firstly let me tell you they don't have any sitting area but a few benches outside the shop...except of sunny days which are fine. I've tried here noodles, momos,chicken and veg combos and what I love most are the combos. They are so low at cost still good in taste. The combos include rice and chicken/noodles and chicken in only 60 rs and veg option for approx 45-50.
This place is a gift of God for college students... when you have hunger cravings  but pocket is empty they are the real saviours. They serve such good food at very low pocket pinch. This nonveg combo consists 1 plate noodles 2pcs of chili chicken and one chicken lollipop for only rs 55... Yes you read that right...that too maintaining the quality.
Overall I love this place and this is the ultimate place when u are hungry and your pocket is empty ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ

Royal Spoon is a road side eatary serving Chinese and mostly Rolls. I paid a visit to have their Chicken roll. Tasted very average. Neither the paratha nor the red sauce tasted good. Chicken pieces average and much oily. Didn't feel like having anything else from here.

A good  local joint. Nothing fancy, nor the customers should expect it. The food quality is good compared to the prices. The tastes are subtle and it is nothing like the other local food joints which serves extra oily, extra spicy food at low cost. Taking view the price indsx the place is good for quick bites

Went out for work and on the way i got hungry. As i was Near Hedua Park so wanted to try a new place. Got this very near to me and surprisingly on Zomato. Landed up here with my bro for some quickies.
Its a small roadside fast food joint with no sitting arrangements. The very first impression was a turn off when they didnt have veg Momo. So finally we thought of trying their Â Veg and Non Combos. NV Combo was consisted of 2 pieces of Chilly Chicken with Veg Noodles and Veg Consisted of Panir Manchurian with Veg Noodles.Â 
They took 20 Mins to make the same and handed us in the 25th minute. It was very ordinary with the noodles and the chicken was not even fresh. They charged us Rs.5 extra which was not mentioned in the Rate chart that was truly annoying. Very Bad Experience.

This place is located near my college. So im quite regular here. I have tried out various items from here. Like chicken haka chowmin, chicken schezwan chowmin, chilli chicken. All items are quite good for satisfying your hunger. I have also had their momos.  The chicken steamed momo is actually good but the soup is very dull with no salt and pepper. It feels tasteless with raw vegetables. I think they should improve the quality of the soup a bit. The pan fried momo is also quite good.

If you are in Hedua Park area, hungry but tight on budget, then you can definitely try this food counter!Located near to Hedua Park at Ramdulal Bus stoppage make this restaurant very easy to find!

It is a small food counter, which provides you a large list of pocket friendly items! No sitting arrangement is a very negative point for this restaurant, but there is a bench in front of the shop where you can see, if you are quuet lucky enough cz it remains crowded whole day!

Service is fast, they make food in front of you. But if you ask about the hygiene level of the  counter, then there remains some doubt in your mind!

When me and my friend reached this shop it was almost 10pm and counter was opened so don't worry, if you are late and looking for food then you can try your luck here!

We ordered Chicken Steamed and Fried Momo! Both of the item was good!!The size of the momo pieces are good enough, the chicken inside the momo was well marinated and smashed and the soup really taste well with the momo!

So if you are in a hurry and want a quick bite, then try this restaurant!

Being situated close to my college, this is the place to always jump into with my friends whenever I'm hungry. The range of menu is too diverse for a roadside food stall but I always stick to their steamed chicken momos, which are absolutely amazing and can give a tough competition to any tibetian joint. The huge round momos with a thin outer skin comes with an amazing minced stuffing. The chicken soup has an aroma of chicken stew with chopped veggies. The soup goes very well with the momos. Five momos with the soup comes at just 40 bucks, which is damn cheap and can fill up a hungry person. I have also tried their Chinese fare which is good.

A couple of minutes away from Bethune college, this little fast food eatery is a common choice of college students. Even though it doesn't provide a proper seating area, the cost efficient variety of dishes to choose from make people go back for more. The fried chicken momo at only 50bucks is genuinely good. I'm not very keen on their noodles section but one can try out the Manchurian with fried rice or even opt for the rolls.

This footpath based Royal Spoon is located near to Hedua Park. Be it a small food counter with no sittings at all but they have a huge menu to select from, that also for very low price. 

The restaurant is overall dirty & hygiene level looks very bad. Their staffs takes little time to give you the food even when there's very few orders. However they will make the food in front of you.

Me & my friend ordered Chicken Streamed Momos & Chicken Fried Momos & shared both. The Momos were served in a nice plate & garnished well, that I didn't expected from here. Momos sizes was average & chicken pieces inside of that was mashed & well marinated. Fried Chicken Momos were fried very well with no extra oiliness. Soup was very lite, that felt good with the Momos. Sauce served with this was very chillies but of good quality. Overall very basic taste for a basic price point that you will love to gulp while hungry.

If you are tight on budget, basic food counters like this always stays a good option. Where there's nothing Royal about Royal Spoon, but its enough for a quick bite.

Both the items were really good. Even tasted the momo. They're good too, specially the pan fried one. Give it a try!
