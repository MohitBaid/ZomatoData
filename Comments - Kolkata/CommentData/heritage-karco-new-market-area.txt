An old eat out joint in new market area! A good option to munch in some food in between shopping! It was the same case for me,while shopping had a chance of having chicken roll! I must it is a great one! Longer than usual rolls with succulent amount of chicken in it. I would really love to have it again!

I had paid a visit to this restaurant with my buddies and well it was an absolute delight to taste the delicacies. The chicken pakodas were extremely delicious and very much presentable. The chicken bharta had a perfect mixture of eggs in its gravy. A delightful lunch indeed. The only pain being the taxes :p

My best choice for hanging out with friends and family in New Market area. One of the oldest restaurants. I remember having live music there in my childhood days. 
I love this place because of its quality food, ambience and spaciousness.
Best dish is Roasted Chicken.

Chinese dishes are delicious. Would recommend all varieties of their mixed noodles,be it Singapore Manchurian or Schezwan noodles.. which are loaded with meat eggs and prawns.Quantity is more than enough for two people..side dishes are also good. Please try their Chinese fish finger and momos. Chicken steam momos are just heaven..eight large momos with a steaming hot bowl of soup..the momos are so soft they just melt inside your mouth.

Nice place to chill and satisfy your hunger after an exhausting round of shopping. Located inside New Market, it gives a true heritage look and feel and the cuisine is strictly Calcuttan, serving great tea, coffee, cuttlets, rolls, mughlai parantha etc.

I would've rated this place a zero if was possible.. Worst restaurant I have ever been to.. Worst service and worse food.. Sandwich was cold and tasteless.. The person who is serving the food is so careless.. They don't even care about customer's feedback or comfort.. I'll suggest everyone not to go here.. Completely waste of money..

Ordered Chicken Friedrice,Chilli Chicken and Chilli Fish..It's high time the chefs cooking in the kitchen learn the fact that the word chilli associated with any dish doesn't mean plenty of chillies in the dish...
It's a no thumps up from my side.

Visited this place after nearly a decade and didnt have any high expectations.. Wanted to kill some time waiting for my brother to arrive fr our shopping spree and hence checked in.. It has become more spacious than what it used to be.. My mom ordered a moghlai paratha and the attendant suggested a fish cutlet to me.. We also ordered coffee.. The coffee was good.. The moghlai paratha was not bad.. There were chicken pieces in it.. Wish it was less oily.. But the fish cutlet was a dissappointment. It was just a mash up of veggies with a hint of fish smell.. No fish was discernable in it.. And that came for rs 105.. But service was fast.. Good enough to sit and pass time after a shopping experience in new market..

This place was in my bucket list since many days. 
Visited this place today. 
They have an ac and a non ac section. 
We entered in the ac compartment. 
We ordered American chopsuey and a chicken Afghani cutlet. 
Both the food were okayish in taste... 
The chopsuey had too much of sauces and was lacking taste.. We could taste sauce only. 
However the chicken Afghani cutlet was fine.. Not too good, not bad either.. 
Pocket pinch - 389 for 2.
They serve sealed water bottles.

Have heard about it from my mother when during her younger days she used to frequent it with her colleagues and friends. She had spoken highly about it, and had mentioned the dish "boti chicken" which was popular at that time. 
Today when I went there, I looked for the dish, but no, it has been replaced a long time ago. So settled for grilled chicken instead. It was good enough, no scope of complaint. The masala coke could have been better.
The service is prompt but the staff are not friendly, mechanical.
The restaurant is spacious, can fit in lots of people at one time.
Price pocket friendly. Parking no problem if you manage to get a parking space.
Good place to drop in when you have very little in your pocket but would prefer to eat in a cozy corner of a restaurant, being waited upon by staff.

Though I could not eat the Liver curry so Parceled, charge was 5rs and Karco Provides 1ltr. Kinley Mineral water once you seat, that is 24 rs.. so My over all bill was rs 225 with GST  @ Heritage Karco, New Market Area, Esplanade , Kolkata (13th September,2017)

We stumbled upon this eatery while shopping at New Market. The place has two section. One with A.C. and the another Non-AC. The decor is fine and has lots of space. We tried the Singapore fried rice and chatpata chicken. Both of the dishes were surprisingly good. The rice was flavourful and chicken was nicely cooked. After a long time, I really liked the sweet and sour chicken . This one is a good place to satiate your hunger pangs after shopping

▫Chicken fried rice --- the quantity of rice enough for 2 people.  But chicken pieces was not fresh. Dry and chewy.
▫ Garlic chicken was good in taste. But gravy little bit sweet .
Over all it was a average experience. 
Service was quick. Staffs are friendly.

Visited this place on a Wednesday afternoon. Not hard to find and near to the Esplanade metro
(about 7 mins walking distance from the metro entrance). Situated on the first floor of a shopping complex, this place is literally a chhupa rustam. As soon as we entered, the staff greeted us courteously.  They have a separate air conditioned cubicle where we sat. Overall service was prompt. There were 2 of us; we ordered 1 plate of Veg Chow and 1 dish of Garlic Chicken(8 pieces). The Veg Chow was standard but the Garlic Chicken was bang ON POINT. The quantity given was enough for the two of us. Ambience was overall quite nice. 
Would love to come back again.

Had been to new market since childhood but to my utter surprise, I never noticed this place until my husband told me about it. And boy, what a discovery for me. I instantly fell in love with this place because of the behaviour of our server. We ordered chicken momo, moghlai paratha and coffee. The food was awesome and I never had such mouth watering moghlai paratha ever in my life. It was crispy and yummy. And the icing on the top was its pricing. The total bill was below 300 bucks. This place is a must try for everyone.

Karco used to be one of our lunch destination  when ever we visited new market. Grilled chicken used to be our favourite and standard dish to order. One a recent visit the location has been shifted post a fire that broke out at New market many years back but the flavours remains the same at a reasonable price line. The menu has been made more commercial with the addition of Chinese momos and rolls. I wonder why the chicken roll has not been rated as one of the best in town. Momos were also very good with a nice soup unlike the watery rubbish which most places offer.

This old eatery is located at New Market area and  mainly serves North Indian & Chinese dishes.

Simple ambience and decor.

Quite spacious with sitting arrangements.

Tried their Mixed Chowmein & Chicken Manchurian. Both were sufficient in quantity . Chowmein had good fillings but was oily. Both dishes tasted nice but still nothing to rave about.

Price is reasonable.

A  heritage joint which is there for ages with its nostalgic ambience. The standard of the food has been very well maintained with its prompt service.  Visited today after a long time with an old friend.  Ordered Roast Chicken and Chicken Sandwich. The roast chicken is a continental dish at an unbelievable affordable price.  The chicken was soft, tender and not overcooked. Not for health freaks as it is bit oily. But the taste was heavenly and the portion was more than adequate.  The chicken  sandwich was good too with three sandwich per plate. I had to have a very light dinner after this gastronomical affair.

One of the oldest eateries in the city, karco is still a favorite amongst all the shoppers who stop by to grab a quick lunch after a hectic day of shopping at the new market area.
It might not be at par with the other dining outlets with pretty and expensive decor and creative menu but it does offer you cheap and fulfilling good food you can always count on. The menu is pocket friendly and fills your stomach.
So it would be really odd to compare it with any other eatery because this joint ages back to the time when it was the only affordable eatery in town serving Chinese food..

This is one of the oldest eateries in the city which has seen a lot of ups and downs. Yet its cosy, friendly ambience is still very much there. A place to drop in while shoppin'. Once upon a time, the place was popular for its savoury items and tooti frooti Ice-cream. 
While biryani house is on one end of new New market, karcos is at it's other end serving Chinese as well as Indian dishes.

A big disappointment... 
While enjoying the puja shopping, decided to visit this restaurant. The interior is suffocating with too crowded furnishings. Had to queue up for the lunch. Than came the menu, the menu in itself is a bit pricey,
But later got to know that most of the items are out of business, and the topping came with the ill service of the servers and the managers.
Finally it was my last trip there...
Complete piece of disappointment...

A good place to relax & have a quick bite after a long, tedious shopping spree. You can choose the AC or non AC section according to your will, though finding place in the AC section requires a stroke of luck as the place is almost always crowded. Food is good. I particularly remember prawn fries which we ordered as starters & was quite good & heavy. Altogether it was a good experience.

Karco is an old-school place rather than a fancy eatery, not to be judged by the ambience, you'll be mistaken to do that.
Apart from the heritable part, food is quite moderate here, once I've been here after shopping in new market, in weekdays also it's almost cramped up.
We ordered mixed hakka chow-mein and chicken sweet corn soup.
Food came within 10mins hence service is fast. Portions of chow-mein was great, enough for 2ppl and it was tasty as well, but a lil greasy, and don't expect them to serve you noodles like fancy places in a bowl, because they don't charge you like that. Sweet corn soup was okayish with generous amount of shredded chicken.
Pocket pinch is nominal, and again this one is a must visit place due to its age-old legacy!
RECOMMENDED! 🎩

The food served here is good. The fish fry and  Mutton cutlet is a favorite. 
But the service is terrible. Clumsy presentation and dingy ambience mars the place. The A.C. Section is so tiny, the space crunch is terrible.

Thought seemly a non-descript place in the New Market, it serves good food. Stumbled upon it during a shopping spree in the area. We ordered chicken biriyani and let me tell you its as very very good. If you like the typical kolkata biriyani with fragrant fluffy rice with the potato amd chicken then this is thhe place to be. It also serves chinese and other muglai dishes. Heritage Karco is a very old place going back a couple of decades; it is nothing fancy with very basic decor but the biriyani was good. So if you are in the area and you are craving for some biriyani do check it out.

Heritage eatery indeed! Remember days when dad used to take us here for 'chowmein-chilli chicken' post shopping from esplanade or after a movie at globe or metro.
Visited after years today , reminiscing old times with mom , and ordered for a chicken sweet corn soup , chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. The food was average , the soup was sweeter than my liking , sweet and sour sauce was no where near what i should taste like, but a sumptuous meal at 450 bucks.
Though theres a partitioned air conditioned section as well , yet the legendary place craves for some moderinization in terms of interior decoartions.

It is probably one of the oldest restaurants of the city and is still the favourite of yesteryear's shopaholics of the new market area.

I have been there in childhood as well as after I joined Zomato :P

The food is more on the okayish part, although their rolls are still one of the finest to be served in this city but the main course will not interest you much.

The ambience  is a bit noisy and not very cllassy.

The cleanliness also happens to be major issue for me here

Karco - A legendary name in the city of joy's foodsutra. The old times hot favorite place for their Chinese food. I am sure everyone must have heard the name from their parents mostly which used to be a must go to destination if your at New market.

I don't want to analyze this place based on their food quality or taste because they don't serve any fancy food but sumptuous meal everytime you visit them. Staffs are well behaved and serves you with a happy face. I am pleased everytime I visit them. Also a lot of memories they have kept and made for me. Thank you for serving well.

People often used to say that your shopping at New Market isn't fully complete unless and until you dine off at this place before heading back to your home. Do not know how much of it is still true, but this place is still regarded as a legendary and pocket-friendly restaurant. Situated inside the New Market Complex, the place offers both AC and Non-AC section. Many people prefers the latter to avoid extra taxes.

Coming to the food, their noodles and Chinese side dishes were always my favorite here. Crisp noodles, loaded with flavors comprising of veggies and excess of meat; it was a perfect excuse to devour yourself into Chilli Chicken or Chicken Manchurian. Their starters like Pakora and Fish Fry also used to pack a punch with less of batter and more of fish/meat.

Although the service and the quality has seen a steady decline over the years, this place still remains hot-favorite to many. The pricing is cheap and considering the quantity they serve, it will not burn a hole in your pocket.

People often used to say that your shopping at New Market isn't fully complete unless and until you dine off at this place before heading back to your home. Do not know how much of it is still true, but this place is still regarded as a legendary and pocket-friendly restaurant. Situated inside the New Market Complex, the place offers both AC and Non-AC section. Many people prefers the latter to avoid extra taxes.

Coming to the food, their noodles and Chinese side dishes were always my favorite here. Crisp noodles, loaded with flavors comprising of veggies and excess of meat; it was a perfect excuse to devour yourself into Chilli Chicken or Chicken Manchurian. Their starters like Pakora and Fish Fry also used to pack a punch with less of batter and more of fish/meat.

Although the service and the quality has seen a steady decline over the years, this place still remains hot-favorite to many. The pricing is cheap and considering the quantity they serve, it will not burn a hole in your pocket.

Quite a popular restaurant in new market area. Found it using zomato. Since then went there a couple of times. There is nothing to tell about decoration. 
While scanning the menu card my eyes instantly stuck on Thai Delicacy section. Ordered Thai karco special. It's basically chowmein with lots of egg, chicken, prawn, fish etc. The quantity is huge. More than sufficient for two. Much less spicy yet tasty.

I'm a huge foodie and I will eat anything as long as it is palatable. Can't say the same for my middle-aged relatives and it can be quite a struggle finding an eatery that can cater to their tastebuds. Fortunately we happened to end up at this joint and they loved everything they ordered .... From the Dal Fry to the Mutton Kassa. 
          Such a wide range of cuisines to choose from. We didn't even leave behind a single morsel of food on the plate. We even ordered some more items midway into our meal and the service was real quick. 
          The best part is that a meal for 5 set us back by only 1200/- bucks. That's what I call Value For Money. 
           Definitely coming back for more. 😄

Heritage egg rolls, since my childhood this place has only been known to me for its awesome rolls. Nice and long made of thin moderately fried and crispy paratha, their taste is different than most.
Costly as gold but a diamond of a snacks that cannot be ignored or go untasted (even of that's a word😋)

Went to karco almost after a decade. Happened to be there only because of a little bit of shopping in and around new market. I was surprised to see only a family of three having a dull and lonely meal, with almost no one around on a Sunday evening. We ordered american choupsey, chicken fried momos and a bowl of thick chicken noodle soup. Something didn't seem right from the moment we stepped inside. Food was ordinary and service was terrible. Momos were oily and the choupsey topping tasted like plain tomato sauce. The prawns inside were boiled so bad,that it tasted like rubber. Only saver was the soup. Utterly disappointed.

Located at New Market complex.It is a budget restaurant. The ambience is simple but decent. There is a AC section also but we avoided it to save the extra tax. Hence ordered for Chinese prawn pakora which was so so,mixed fried rice was delicious and chicken kebab masala-it's a new one but really tasty. All the dishes were quantity wise sufficient for two persons.

Visited this restaurant yesterday and found it exactly as it has always been; cheap yet tasty!
Ordered a chicken schezwan noodles and a Singapore chicken.
The chicken schezwan noodles was as tasty as it should be, well cooked and well spiced..
The Singapore chicken was quite well cooked too.. it was cooked with some colourful bell peppers which made it look really appetizing! The chicken seemed well marinated as it was soft, juicy and extremely flavourful..
And to add to the experience, the quantity of both the dishes were enough to feed two hungry gluttons!
** A piece of advice to the Management: please tell your serviceboys to be a bit more prompt and give a better service to the guests!
Well, must try foodies!

Always have heard so much of this place from people. After a tiresome shopping session decided to go for lunch. The moment you enter the place you'll notice the huge dining space. There's a separate ac lounge too..simple decor.
About the food:
I wouldn't say extraordinary or lip smacking, but the prices are reasonable the Chinese dishes are pretty good. Would suggest to stay away from the mughal dishes.. And definitely try the "veg Manchurian".. Happy dining :)

Pujo shopping at new market had to be wrapped up with a sumptuous lunch at Karco- a tradition! And over the years the food hasn't stopped being mouth watering.
The ambience is decent, mostly cubicle like arrangements sans the partition.
The food- fish fry, chicken curry and the biriyani are good choices in Indian. The fish fry is more of fish fillet less of batter, a delight.
My personal favourite is the Thai Karco Special- noodles loaded with eggs chicken mushroom and liver. The portion is enough for two, the taste light yet well balanced, definitely in harmony with the non-veg bonanza... This one is definitely a must have. :)
Staff is courteous and have an idea about the dishes on the menu. Price is generous. Do drop in guys!

This pocket friendly restaurant is popular due to its good taste in food. Me and my shopping partner directly barged into the air conditioned section which was completely empty. My vegetarian friend ordered Veg Schezwan Noodles and me, (a hardcore meat lover) ordered Chicken Schezwan Noodles and a Paneer Manchurian as a side dish.

The service was very polite. Needless to say that the food was very delicious. The noodles were extremely crisp and filled with flavors. The Paneer gravy however tasted like an ordinary 'chilly paneer'.

I am so glad my friend introduced me to this good restaurant. I can't wait to come here again and try some other dish. However, I would recommend them to introduce some new interesting names to the menu. I couldn't decide for ten minutes what to eat. Otherwise, a very good place to fill your stomach after a hard day of shopping (we all know how painful it is).

Heard a lot about the legacy surrounding this place. Sorry to say though, the quality has degraded over the years. 
Located just by the entrance to New Market, this place quite old, visibly undergone a makeover. 
Went there with the family. Parents ordered Chinese. The chow tasted just fine, the garlic chicken though was nothing special. 
I went for my safe bet on occasions such as these- chicken bharta along with lachchha paratha. That turned out to be a dud though. The bharta was not that good. The parathas were too oily. Not a great experience personally it''d be safe to say. 
Quite easy on the pocket though. And it's got a.c. So you might want to drop in and decide for yourself whether you like this place or not. Personally, I won't go back in a hurry. 
Almost feel like apologizing for this.

Karco- the name itself smells legacy. It's the legacy conveying from past to exhibit. Our Kolkata my Kolkata and history of Kolkata, it is a standout amongst the most well known restaurant from that point forward to now.

But it was all. Was is the word here. In the event that I have no spot to go, I pick Karco. What's more, I don't think that its extraordinary in any capacity. people are impolite and exceptionally rude. They must get exhausted by the clients. The administration is terrible and slow.  No exception for the food and I won't give it much point for cleanliness. No Air conditioner however you need to pay extra tax, No restroom and card facility, yet you need to pay taxes as usual . I heard such a large number of things about the music and all, however I never discovered any. My misfortune, yet Karco is a major thumb down for me.

I was damn hungry as a pig. Ordered a schezwan fried rice & garlic chicken...Food was good, but lack of good ambiance.
The heritage eatery still has the old charm, and calls for at least one visit.

Karco had been my favorite for many reasons. I studied at Maulana Azad College and it was a stone throw distance to Karco. I remember visiting Karco before the fire destroyed old New Market. Since it was run by an ex- Goethalite the ties with Karco was strong. In my childhood I enjoyed their Sweet Corn Chicken soup and whenever possible still go for it. Karco has changed over the years and always had a simplistic decor with excellent service. In between it had gone through a bad patch with staff strikes and losing its sous chef. Recently, my sister visited Karco and enjoyed the food. She was telling me that it revived a lot of our childhood memories. The American and Chinese Chop suey are amazing, the Mixed fried rice well prepared, the Talumein and Thukpa were wonderful. I would love to visit them soon as it has been sometime I went to Karco. I remember that one main dish with noodles or, fried rice used to be more than enough for two of us. It would be good to relive old and fond memories.

One of the oldest eating places in new market area, this place retains the charm of old Calcutta restaurants. We ordered Thai chicken soup, chicken fried rice and garlic chicken. The soup was good, except that it was topped with the oil of schezwan sauce, which made it taste really hot and spicy at first. Other wise, it was good. The rice and the chicken were tasty, and their portioning is quite good! Overall, a charming place to eat after a shopping spree

Karco-the name itself smells heritage..In this era of globalisation when everything around us is changing so fast this place upholds a piece of the good old calcutta, a glimpse of the lost City..Indeed it is one of the more popular restuarants in the City for ages and its location makes it a favourable one too..This place still serves one of the most delicious Rolls,one essentially devoid of any sauce,and chicken kebab cubes,something I personally savour so much..Coming to the ambiance nothing flashy about this place..In fact even last time I went there I didn't find any A.C. working, so keep that in mind too..The service is also quite slow and the servers are not all attentive..However when it comes to food this place does cook up some pretty decent and tastefull Chinese dishes at an extremely pocket friendly rates..This place is a hotspot for shoppers who frequents Hogg Market area..Coming to the food I would personally recommend the Grilled Fish, Chicken Pakora, Fish Orly and Schezwan Noodles..However last time I tasted Garlic Chicken and Singapore Chicken I failed to differentiate between the two..Don't expect any unique menu or cuisine of the highest order but regular economical meals..

situated at the heart of newmarket you cant afford to miss it. A big spacious restaurant with 2 separate rooms for AC and non AC. There is nothing 'heritage' about the interior, minimalistic design . staffs are well aware of the menu. we have ordered karco special chowmin gravy and chicken chatpata .the chowmin was stuffed with chicken, prawn,paneer,liver and all laid on a omelet bed.

quality of the food is on the good side but i would say quantity was really good , actually the waiter told not to order anything else these 2 items will be enough for me and he was right ! i have to pack the rest of the food!!! i like the chicken chatpata than karco special gravy chicken.

In a heavily crowded market, this restaurant stands out. One of the oldest restaurants in the area which offers great Chinese food and great value for money. The mushroom noodles, schezwan noodles, chilli chicken, garlic chicken are among the few dishes that I would recommend. If you are in New Market, would strongly recommend you to check this place. Not great ambience as such and mediocre service, but great food!

I did not quite know about the existence of this food joint in the new market area. We were shopping at new market and after a tiresome shopping, we wanted good food. Something sumptuous,  filling and lip smacking. the shopkeeper at new market suggested karco. But I had got such negative reviews about karco that I kind of wanted to avoid it. But karco was definitely a better option than kfc. So went in through. It looked like it was a "heritage" restro. The decor being overtly simplistic. It was huge and spacious. Food is served in no less than five minutes. The waiters are quite well versed with the menu. We started off with chilli mushroom dry. And the mushrooms looked amazing. Steaming and hot it was. And it melted in the mouth. A bit on the spicy side. But amazing in taste. And for the main course . It was thai karco special chowmein gravy. It was stuffed with prawns and chickens and paneer and liver and the whole thing lay on a bed of egg omelette.  Just unimaginably tasty. It was of huge quantity. it was too much for the three of us. The waiter suggested we should go for a chicken chatpata to team it up with the gravy chowmein.  It was sweet sour and spicy . And amazing in taste. Kudos to karco. I am definitely going back soon.

the roll center outside the restaurant serves delicious rolls nd for me the halal(no sauce) is very good..the size of the rolls r massive too..
the choupsey is average tasting..
more or less the place is good..but the waiters have serious attitude problems..

Carco was introduced to me by my father when i was 12 years old :D After that day, whenever I went there, I found it very annoying. Don't know why but whenever I stepped into that food joint, no one even came for an order. If fortunately someone attained us, then it took a long time to serve the food. If I go for their food, I always loved their Garlic Chicken over any other food-place. Their Chinese cuisine is really a pleasure.

As the name suggests "Heritage Karco" it is indeed an heritage which has preserved all the fading cultures, warmth, quality, etc nowadays from restaurants of similar category. But this outlet has still hold on to the goodwill and homely atmosphere of bygone days. I have been here a couple of times till date. It doesn't have any kind of fancy decor. Its a very simple setup and has a nice peaceful ambience. They mostly specialises in north indian delicacies and quality speaks about their dedication. Every dish which i have tried till date like chicken butter masala, mughlai chicken etc was A-class, none of it had any flaws(perfect blend of spices, moderate amount of oil, tolerable richness) and the texture were brilliant. This is a place which will deliver unforgettable cuisine to your palette without any kind of fuss.

It's been years since I ate at this place. It's got a new AC section so if your looking to eat in comfort do drop in as not many other joints in the area have the facility. We ordered a moglai paratha and fish orly. Both were tasty but but oily. The fish orly came with some potato chips and 3 slices of tomato and cucumber respectively. The fish had a fresh taste but I didn't quite get the chaat masala sprinkled on the top of the chips. The moglai was better and the aloo accompanying it was well cooked. 
The bill was a tad more than expected... maybe because of the AC? Perhaps I shall try a curry the next time. I hear they are good.

Karco was introduced to me by Nandita Aunty who is also the co-owner of this refurbished heritage of New Market Area. She guided me to the things which was the speciality over there. And i liked it all.
The Baked Fish and Grilled Fish are pretty filling and tasty. One is a soy-sauce based another tomato-sauce based. The tomato sauce one dressed a butter fry fish with boiled veggies. I make it a point to order these whenever I am in the vicinity. 
Other than these, the Thai Chicken Coriander Soup  and the Sweet and Sour Chicken is pleasant to the palette.
It is a pocket friendly place. The Chinese over here is good to satisfy both your palette and your stomach. 
I would like to suggest the change and up gradation of the interiors and the place will become more popular among all ages.

This outlet has been not even my favorite but also my families since 10-15 years . I do not remember having my lunch/dinner over here . But we always end up increasing our calories by ordering rolls from here.. The parathas are very soft and not much oily. The fillings are pretty fresh , hot and soft. They do not put any kind of sauce/ketchup inside the stuffing . But the taste is exceptionally good owing to generous amount of onions slices and lemon juice. I kinda like all the rolls and try any depending on my mood but have an inclination towards egg veg roll. Which I feel they cook to perfection...

It was Puja time ticking fast, and I was weary of carrying my friends’ shopping baggage. So we all needed little motivation, when we were moving through the Newmarket area, we discovered this is eating diner (before that we thought it as garment shop, I don’t what the hell I was thinking). 

The space is big enough to breathe in, a shallow decoration or you can say no decoration.  But the place looks quite comfy, when we settled down and put hands on the menu, only one thing I saw that could feed my appetite, Biryani…. so I did not waste a moment to place the order it. But my doubts are nibbling my mind’ strings. 

Mercifully my hunger did not die on waiting, it came within few moments. The quantity looked promising, and when moment of truth unveils, the Biryani actually tasted god. We have taken Chicken curry to go with, and the two got very well. The Biryani was moist and full of aromatic flavors. My Veggie friend had ordered Mughlai, and I must tell you the Mughlai had tasted as good as it could be. 

On the subject of service they are good enough to go with. And best part they are cheap on your pockets too.

Had visited this restaurant with my family, I am new in Kolkata, so its one of the first restaurants i had lunch in, its a very nice place with a nice homely feel about it........Had chicken biryani here, liked it a lot though i had had much better..........Specially liked the fish which my mom had ordered, she had given me a piece of it as all moms do.........Loved it......It was very good....so, in short, its a good place to go with your family and its like an "oasis" in the bustling new market area (even though it doesn't have an ac).......

Karco is one of the oldest places to eat in the New Market area and pretty much synonymous to Chinese food in the area.
I have fond memories of going to this place during my school days to eat chili chicken and the super yummy double egg roll and going to it after almost a decade just evoked sheer nostalgia. Its located in the new wing of New market and it still quite good.

The dry chili chicken was pretty decent but a tad bit on the oily side. I somehow feel that our taste buds have evolved over the years and thus the chili chicken didn't make us too happy

The manchurian noodles and the shcezwan fried rice both were good. and the garlic chicken although a little sweet was tasty .

The Quantities are quite good and the service is very prompt. We had a great time !

This place is the perfect place to drop by if you love the Kolkata rolls if you are out shopping in the area. The behavior of the staff is well- they will bark at you if you try to sit as they make your rolls at the counter! 
But they do make the chicken roll absolutely perfect! The chicken pieces are adequate and soft. No overindulgence of sauces means you get an authentic lemony flavour to it while the outside paratha is just crispy enough!
So visit Karco for its rolls but be sure to be disappointed by their behavior.

The USP of Heritage Karco is its location. It is situated in the ever-busy New Market area, where it is difficult to move almost at any time of the day, with people doing shopping from cakes and pastries to fruits and vegetables to garments of latest brand and virtually everything you can think of. A restaurant at such a location itself gives it added advantage because people don't have to come travelling from distant places to have food here, rather they will prefer to have something in the midst of their shopping activities.
Karco offers snacks, lunch, dinner- everything, be it in Indian dishes or Chinese. Though most prefer it to have snacks, like the varieties of pokoras and chowmein, the main course lunch is good as well. Chicken items like Chilly chicken, chicken manchurian, garlic chicken are really delicious and so are their fried rice preparations. The quantity served is good and a plate can easily be shared by two. Food served is really hot here and till the last bite, you will feel it. The service is also good and you don't have to wait long to get your food. Both AC and non-AC options are available and you can make your choice depending on your preference and budget. One more good thing is that foods are reasonably priced here and it won't dig a big whole in your pocket when the bill arrives. The ambience is pretty good  though the decor here is old fashioned- perhaps to relate closely with the prefix 'Heritage' before its name. It's worth a try and you are unlikely to be left disappointed.

First of all it's location and space are the two plus points.
Quality of food is not very good but okay compared to it's price.
Chinese items and dish fry cutlets are items to try out.
Service is fast and friendly. It's a value for money food joint.

A heritage restaurant of kolkata. Once karco was closed for a long due to spreading of fire. Then it is reopened and running safely. Food quality is not too got but fair. As this is not a costly one & at a prime place, so people usually come here to have some lunch evening snacks or dinner.
