What a shame! Dhaka biriyani of Jessore Rd is a big name and this tiny shop is spoiling it. Very poor quality biryani with very poor service. Do they think that their customers are fools?

Great place for a Biriyani Lover , the quality is good and upto the mark of the best ones in town . Though the restaurant is a bit small and is inside a narrow Street and without any other branches and always going from salt lake to jadavpur for that would no doubt be worth it but I would love if they would expand their business from one shop to many others.

বিরিয়ানিতে কি ঢাকাই গুণ আছে তার মাথামুণ্ডু বোঝা গেল না । একদমই সাধারণ মানের স্বাদ , গন্ধ । মাংসটাও আহামরি কিছু নয় । দাম খুবই কম । পরিমাণে মাঝারি ।

An average place to drop by. Tried the Biryani once as I used to come nearby for some work. The only thing good is probably the Potato and the Egg. Did not quite like the Rice nor the Mutton portion which came along with it.

Located just beside the Golden Gate restaurant. Ordered mutton biryani for a take away. Nothing special - very ordinary taste with less oil and spices. Though the name of the shops sounds like they sell biryani in dhakai style, but the staff clarified that its not the same.

Mutton Biriyani here is good but ordinary. Mutton kasha looked good though I haven't tried that.

I used to live in sulekha for a year & have tried all the biriyani shops once atleast & I think in this location there isn't very authentic biriyani places so one can try it once as the price is very cheap.

I have only taken take aways, that too only Biryanis, from this place, which consequently will make my review only Biryani centric. The Biryani of this place is pretty good. They give an egg along with the potato & the relevant meat, which makes it a little more special. Would want to try the other items here. I would recommend this place if one is looking for Biryani in & around Jadavpur.

The place is just beside Bawarchi in Jadavpur....near KPC Medical College. 
They mainly serve Biriyani here. Tried this place twice... The food quality is decent to be honest. Price is pocket-friendly. 
The rice is soft. And the mutton or chicken pieces are good by taste and size. Also they give you Aloo and Egg with it. 
However it's mainly a Takeaway-and-Dine place with no place to sit properly. The staff is good though.

One of the bekar Biriyani I ever tried so far. The rice was so hard to chew as well as the mutton piece. This was my 1st and last time.
