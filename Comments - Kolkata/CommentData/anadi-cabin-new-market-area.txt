This place is all about heritage and old Calcutta feeling. Their service is quick. Just go for a regular Moghlai or a special moghlai, the alu'r torkari that is served alongside is good, infact better than the moghlai itself. Stay away from the mutton kasha, it's a bone curry, no meat at all. The absence of wash basin and lacklustre might bother you if you are looking for something fancy. Good place for a quick snack when you are tired of New Market shopping.

A very old place, in the City of Joy, popular for Mughlai Parathas. I had always wanted to be here listening so much of nostalgic stories about this restaurant from my elderlies in my house.

The room is small and cramped. Very limited tables, thus often you will have to share tables with strangers.

Coming to the food, it was very very plain. I did not find it extraordinary or worth the hype. What's more painful was the excess use of dalda or vanaspati in my Mughlai Paratha. The whole arena lacks maintenance. Do not be surprised to get half cleaned cutleries here. Staffs are ignorant. Stocks are also certainly limited here since they couldn't serve me a Fish Cutlet at around 7 O' clock in the evening, settled down for a Chicken Kabiraji instead. Though the Mughlai Paratha was served quick, the Kabiraji kept me waiting for almost 20-25 minutes.

If you really wish to give this a try, take away is highly recommended. Hygiene is really questionable here.

Cheers!

The moghlai paratha is really good, it's quite soft better than other places and other items are also quite good. The main problem is the behavior of the staffs working. They may be rude. The restaurant is small and has more number of tables than it should have making it look more small.

My Father has similar memories in regard to this joint. Anadi Cabin represents the deep roots of the great heritage of the rich Bengali Calcutta (Kolkata) Culture of India. And, how old and great The roots of the Bengali Culture of Calcutta is. Trying the Chicken or Mutton KOBIRAJI is a must here in Anadi Cabin.

Had heard a lot about this place in the social media, famous for their legendary duck egg mughlai paratha and mutton kosha. This place comes in the list for the famous eateries in Kolkata. But unfortunately the quality of their food has deteriorated. The quantity is also very less. Had high expectations from this place though. They still follow the nostalgic Kolkata vibes, which feels good, alongwith that i think they should match-up the food quality also to hold the heritage of the place.

The history of this place still holds...but food quality has deteriorated over the years...had the traditional mughlai Parantha with duck's egg, fish cutlet and coffee...felt really good on a cold rainy evening...however staff behaviour was not at all acceptable...location is impeccable as usual in the heart of Kolkata at Esplanade!

the food is quite good. we ate the renowned¬†mughlai paratha. it was very tasty, the inside part was really good. the problem with the restaurant is its condition and the waiters, both of which are so so so laid back. there are very fewer seats first of all, and they make the parathas just where the people seat, which makes the¬†tiny restaurant full of smoke and ruins the environment. also, the waiters are rude and don't say anything. on seeing the menu outside the restaurant which had written mouglai paratha (hen's egg), mouglai paratha (duck's egg)... etc, i asked a waiter 'Which one did you serve us?" as he didnt cared to ask which one we wanted. he just replied that it was hen's. then i asked, 'Do we have to tell you that we want duck's egg to get that one?' he just said ' Just sit and you will get everything'. when i asked the same thing to the cook who was frying, he just nodded his head and said nothing. I was left surprised and blank. They are so confusing and don't¬† say clearly what they are providing. I wish the restaurant was a bit more hygienic clean.

Anadi Cabin a cost friendly place to have snacks and some lovely Mutton khosa with Moughlai Parantha.

I have to this place with my friend many a times whenever i end up at esplanade. 
I love their Moughlai Parantha (with duck egg) & Mutton Kasha.

Yes, the sitting arrangement can be improved here. But they really do not have space to expand. Let me remind you, this is a heritage 'restaurant' of Kolkata famous for moglai. Right now there are three types of moglai available. One normal one with duck egg. A special one with a duck and a hen egg. A double egg one with both hen eggs. The quality is not excellent, but good. At just 70 odd bucks you cannot expect super-healthy option. The mutton kosha is famous also, but lacks in quantity. But lets not complaint. Prices are going high. Yet they offer in a pocket-friendly manner. This is a traditional place and one may have a moglai sometimes for the sake of Bangaliana.

Mughlai paratha that smells of nostalgia and Calcutta heritage. Our parents' generation lose their mind over their mughlai paratha, so this time I was in Calcutta I made it a point to drop by. The place is quite small and basic. The cooking area is right in front. We asked for only mughlai paratha which came with the side of potato subzi and some salad. Coming to the food, it was decent, like most mughlai paratha you can find in Calcutta joints, at least I didn't find anything special or worth mentioning.
However, they should focus on maintaining basic hygiene of the place as I saw cockroaches freely roaming around near the fridge and the cutlery being extremely dirty.

Just 5mins from Esplanade metro station, Rotis stuffed with generous amounts of chicken keema, onions and eggs, the heavenly moghlai paratha and Mutton kosha are the speciality of anadi cabin. You will find out various options for moghlai paratha but anadi serves one of the best and cheapest moghlai parathas.

I heard a lot and seen a lot in fb that it's one of the legendary moghlai paratha makers in Kolkata, who still continues their fame.It belongs to top food places in kolkata.So we visited last weekend for trying their speciality.We ordered two moghlai paratha,they asked for the plate for meat with that but we denied.Some quarter/full/half plate concept is there..not known properly.it was not at all soft the size is really small,I was thinking to order one first because my concept about moghlai paratha that one person can't finish at once,but it's really not that much quantitative. Taste was good,because the egg bhurji inside the paratha is duck eggs,the preparation style is something different,good taste,but they are serving not hot because it's already prepared before.aloo sabji with that is totally chilled, services wise only 1/5,but their interior wall visibly carrying their old prestige and culture.Good but not competitive for today's Kolkata.They need to improve,because change sometimes good...

Everything is poor here. Poor foods with poor hospitality. The waiters quarrel between themselves regarding the customer. Ordered the so called famous moglai but it was just tasteless. It won't be harsh to say that my local area's moglai are better than this. It's just waste of money. Even a waiter put a fallen knife in a customer's plate without washing it. Please don't go there guys.

Worst ever food I have ever ate. Mughlai Porota was so horrible even road side stalls tastes better. Same for the fish kabiraji. Will never recommend anyone again to that place.

Everything is poor here. Poor foods with poor hospitality. The waiters quarrel between themselves regarding the customer. Ordered the so called famous moglai but it was just tasteless. It won't be harsh to say that my local area's moglai are better than this. It's just waste of money. Even a waiter put a fallen knife in a customer's plate without washing it. Please don't go there guys.

One of oldest and famous outlet in new market area ( opposite big bazar, Dharmatala).  It's a small eatery and always crowded.  This place is famous for their moglai parota.  Parota was good and stuffing also tasty. Parota served with aloo sabzi, salad and tomato üçÖ sauce. But we found a piece of hair.  Very much disappointed. But the staff immediate change our parota.
Next we ordered fish fry.  I really like it.  Fish was fresh and stuffing also delicious. 
Nothing say about the ambience.  Only problem is the cleannes. Even the plates and glasses was quite unhygienic.

I heard about this place many times..This place is famous for its moghlai parathas..so I went there with lot of expectations..but it could not stand on my expectations fully..I ordered special moghlai parathas and mutton kosa..As of taste, moghlai paratha was quit good..but mutton kosa was a complete disaster..They serve 4 pieces of mutton in a quarter plate which costs 60 bucks..but I got only 2 small pieces of mutton and one fat and one complete bone..and the taste was also very regular..Overall I would say if I can buy a egg-chicken moghlai (double the size of Anadi's) in same price why should I go to a famous restaurant like this?.

When your belly throws tantrums you are bound to "satisfy" it with whatsoever possible. This is what happened today. I went shopping with my parents, when my dad suggested this place (mind you, he is a nostalgic dude). He claimed to be a regular to this place during his college days, but by the time I finished off the meal, I really didn't get his "loyalty".¬†

Anyway coming to the menu, they don't have one. (Seriously, I am not kidding) All they have is a chart stuck on the wall with the names of the dishes on it. We ordered Moglai Parota. This is egg & meat keema inside a thin maida parota. The moglai parota was fried using a lot of oil in very high heat. So the whole surface was almost like deep fried & some of the parts were over fried / browned. The moglai parota was good in terms of seasoning. It was soft, good to taste but had just too much oil dripping from all over. As we were about to finish off the parota, we realized that there was choice of Moglai parota with duck egg. We should have gone for the duck - bad luck.This was accompanied by an un-peeled aloo subzi similar to the ones served with kochuri. This was nice to taste. Not spicy, not hot but balanced.

Post this we had chicken cutlet ‚Äì This had good tasty chicken inside & crispy but fat bread crumb layer outside. The outer layer was so fat that the taste of the chicken was getting overshadowed at times. We then moved on to Fish kobiraji. For the uninitiated, a kobiraji is a patty dipped into raw beaten egg & fried ‚Äì that forms a bushy cover on the outside. ‚ÄòKobiraji‚Äô is a bengalized version of the English word ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô that refers to‚Äô covering‚Äô the patty with egg. The kobiraji once again suffered from an over thick outer layer. The fish inside was flaky & nice. Overall the cover was overtaking the taste of the fish. At this point the waiter gave us hand wash, before we finished our intended meal. He already thought we had over eaten.¬†

Next my mom ordered Mutton Kasha. I (quite naturally) took some pieces for tasting. It was basically a mutton curry with chewy but soft & small pieces of mutton. The curry was good in general but not what a true mutton kosha is. It lacked the intensity & punch of a kosha. It was a good mutton curry on its own. We had this with Parota. Almost deep fried, dripping with oil, soft and chewy.

I am very unlikely to revisit this place. So much for nostalgia!

I had heard a lot about Anadi Cabin and its celebrated ‚Äòmoghlai parota‚Äô; so eventually decided to try it out with my sister one evening. The interior is akin to most such Kolkata ‚Äòcabins‚Äô of yesteryears. Cleanliness seems to be an issue in most such eateries....has it got something to do with the typical Bengali platitude of ‚Äòsimple living high thinking‚Äô, which in my opinion has instilled a certain disregard for external appearances in the community??!! The moghlai parota was a huge disappointment; the accompanying alu‚Äôr tarkari (potato curry) was equally tasteless. It was sad to see how these ol' places have fallen from grace :(

The moghlai parathas are economical and healthy and tasty.And their mutton kosha is just out of the world.AWESOME.
Fish cutlet and chicken cutlet is delicious too.
A good advice,do not judge by its looks.They will give you place to adjust.just hop in,order a moglai paratha and a mutton kosha.
The place is small and conjested.You have to share tables.But its fun.
Highly and happily reccomended.

I heard this name many times so i visit the place with my two friends to taste their signature dish...

Food: the food options in this place is very few.so we ordered moghlai paratha which comes with masala aloo...the taste of the food is nothing special...price is cheap but that is ok in respect of the food....

Ambiance: looking really old and lack of maintainance....behaviour of the staffs are very poor....only its old reputation makes this place alive....

Food is okay but the staffs are ill-mannered. They don't know how to behave and demand tips shamelessly like beggars. If you tell their manager about this, he simply ignores.

Yesterday, when the waiter returned the change, I was counting it because they don't provide any bill. The waiter constantly looked at me when I was counting and demanded to leave 30 rupees on the table. I have never seen any waiter to demand the amount like this. I have seen some to ask politely about tips which I give whether they ask for or not, before leaving. But yesterday, I asked for the reason. He replied that I have used their service and I have to give service tax. I asked if he knew anything about service tax. He replied that he needed that money due to GST. I asked for GST bill. He then started to behave really bad and others were also looking at us. He told us to leave the restaurant immediately. The manager was sitting right beside us and didn't say a word.¬†

In my experience, this is the worst restaurant among the so called "old gems" of Calcutta. I didn't check Zomato rating before going there but now as I see the rating, I wish that I had.¬†

In my opinion, there are lots of other restaurants nearby both cheap and costly and they also provide better food. So, everyone should avoid this restaurant.

food: 3/5¬†
ambience: 1/5

Anadi is a legendary restaurant in Kolkata. Serving delicious Moghlai Paratha for ages it is always crowded with foodies. Ofcourse their star item is Moghlai Paratha and they offer different variations of that like normal,special etc. Every kind of that is delicious in one word. I have not tried the Mutton Kosha or any other item but they look yummy and I am eager to have them. Space is very little and looms shabby. But don't go with it...go with the charm of Kolkata which they are mainting for years.

Never trust someone who eats only mutton but not chicken, because that is what happened to us. A friend recommended this place and man....a total disappointment.
The location is pretty easy...at espanalde metro opposite of big Bazaar.
Very small place so look carefully.
Ambience..... What ambience üòë
Inside you will find oddly placed chairs and very old waiters. Menu is displayed at the front on a blackboard and can also be requested.
The food :-
We ordered....
Double Egg Moghlai Paratha.... Which was bad, more bad than even the roadside Moghlai near Ashutosh college. Served with onions and sauce.
Mutton Kasha Half.... Tasted good but half was more like my 8yr old nephew could eat.
Cold drink....with extra charge
Wanted to try more items but more wanted to leave the place....ASAP
Conclusion - Don't go...like ever. This place is neck to neck with Golbari interms of food, pricing and ambience. It's just Hype.
Cost Benefit Ratio - 0 out of 5

P.S. - Notice how the pricing is 12, 52, 44 and so on....this is done so that whatever you order the total is never in round figure. And whatever change you get you are bound to give to the 80yr old waiter. Because well...after my visit...not giving any tip.

This place is generally crowded and they don't maintain cleanliness of the place.

Visited here two times and everytime ordered Duck egg moglai paratha & mutton kosha. It tastes really good. Mutton kasha is not so good but it's OK, not bad. But the moglai paratha is really amazing. The price is reasonable. The restaurant will be better if they can separate the dining tables and kitchen to different spaces.

I along with my friend ordered Anadi‚Äôs famous Moglai Paratha with Kosa Manso. Honestly speaking I am not that impressed with Moglai, have tasted far better elsewhere.  We actually enjoyed the Kosa manso. It was light, soft and less spicy. The Servers were polite and service was prompt. Ambiance is not exciting at all to attract today‚Äôs modern generation, but hey, its heritage you know, it has its own beauty.

Behavior was not good of the restaurant people. Someone wanted a change of 2000 INR but the behavior he received was not at all good. This kind of behavior is not at all expected. Behavior is the first identity, some people often forget that

I have been there a long time back. Had the famous Moghlai paratha, Kasa mangsho and the fish kabiraji... the mutton was so soft but the gravy was really oily. The Moghlai paratha and kabiraji were really good. The only problem is that the place is very small and remains full most of the time.

A legendary name once upon a time,famous for its Moghlai paratha and kosha mangsho. Unfortunate to say now it's just an unhygienic, below average shop cashing on its past glory. Tried it's Moghlai paratha, was very disappointed. It was greasy,tasteless and really very oily. it is very cheap for sure but still not value for money.

I was recommend by my friend and my experience was quite good. We ordered Mughlai and Fish Fry. Mughlai was good. Size of fish fry was disappointed me compare to the price but taste was okay. Surely I will visit again for Mughlai.

This place is a part of Kolkata's food heritage and I finally got to visit it! The place was packed even during a time that I thought would be crowd-free. It is situated right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Dharmatala. We ordered fish fry, chicken kabiraji and tea. The food was okayish. Moghlai seemed to be favourite with a lot of customers. Tea was hardly warm. But I guess it's tough attending to all those people, their orders and their high expectations. Servers were polite.
Cannot refrain from mentioning that in spite of being extremely crowded, they managed to safely keep aside my water bottle that I forgot at the table (saved me from losing another one of my Mom's tupperware!)

Few days back, me n my colleagues went for a quick snack here. Ordered moglai paratha and mutton kasa. Food was okay. I have had better moglai here only years back. Food has really downgraded with time. Mutton kassa was a saviour as it was well prepared. But the thing which put us totally off was the ambience. Yeah m not screaming for posh ambience but atleast a hygienic one would have helped. Floor was greasy... U can slip n fall anytime. Cutlery was so smudged with oily things... Eww. Please maintain basic cleanliness atleast.

'Anadi r Moghlai paratha' is a nostalgia in itself. There are a handful of benagalis who may have not heard of this. I have been there quite a number of times. It's old cabin concept, bit cramped in tables and swift waiters relives the nostalgia, bt sadly not the Moghlai paratha for which it is so famous. The side dishes like mutton kasha, fish fry were just ok.

Remember shopping before pujas when we were kids. It invariably used to be "new Market" (#hoggmarket) or lindsey street? At least one Saturday or Sunday, it was a must to shop in that area before Pujas. Else you felt you really didn't shop for those new clothes / footwear. The same were mostly available in and around Gariahat too. But what used to excite me about the Lindsey Street/ esplanade area is that we will at least have a meal or snacks in one of those tempting joints. If we have known moghlai paratha in Kolkata we must be knowing anadi cabin and vice versa. And if the shopping stroll ended around SN Banerjee road in the afternoon or evening, it was difficult to avoid this ubiquitous joint. Recently as I was passing by SN Banerjee road, chanced upon glancing at Anadi cabin. It wasn't as busy as I recalled it used to be. And I found the table empty where i had my last meal as a kid decades  ago with my father. I didn't go in. Seemed like the table pulled me in. The same one which I sat as a kid with my father. Not sure what to order. Last time I was here, I ate what he ordered. The person asked me moghlai ? Of course, that's why I am here. Wasn't prepared for the next question as well ... " double dim (egg)?"  Had to say no and go for single one. Already had one for breakfast. Next question "kosha mangsho half plate ?" Well yes. Shortest simplest order for food. Vague memories tell me the place has remained the same. Three chairs on either side of a table though I can't assure that 6 plates can fit in or not in that table. While the kitchen is inside, the place where moghlai paratha is fried is bang at the front center of the place. That's the star attraction here. You can even see moghlai parathas being fried as a passer by. What an innovative way, that too, so many decades back, to pull in the passing crowd. Yes.....everything remains same. Only that my father is not sitting opposite me anymore. As they fry the paratha, vague memories cross my mind. Got alerted by the cherished plate reaching my table. There are many accompaniments like salad, sauce and the dry potato curry. But I need to taste this paratha without adulteration. Hence the first bite is just the paratha. Crispy, well rounded with the taste of stuffing inside it and the coating of flour and egg around it. They cut it into pieces for your convenience so that you don't need to move around your knife and fork all across the plate attempting to cut it. The next few bites are accompanied with sauce, salad and potato respectively till the "Kosha Manghso" (mutton curry) is attempted. What I appreciated about the mutton is that the gravy is slightly more than the traditional kosha mangsho of kolkata and rightly so if you want to really mix the paratha with it and have it. When you have a kosha mangsho with roti or usual paratha, the gravy can be much richer in taste since the roti /paratha per se doesn't have any significant taste. The gravy here is delicately balanced to ensure it doesn't kill the taste of the moghlai paratha, the very reason why one goes to anadi. The mutton pieces are smaller in size than many places but quantity is enough for one person, well wrapped around the bones. "Tea sir?"  Just as I was finishing the last bite of paratha. Why not. That's the best drink after this meal. Along with tea came the bowl to wash your hands off. Nice...one bowl to wash your hand and a cup of tea to wash the moghlai paratha and mutton into your stomach. They say Anadi is not that what it used to be. Is it that or is it now we have most of such traditional food available readily in local shops and hence the charm of having it where it belonged to, is over. Can't say. I loved it. Maybe the moghlai of other places are wrapped in the same type of flour and egg as here. But nowhere else will I get the extra wrapping of Anadi moghlai.....the wrapping of golden memories of my childhood.

I was shopping in esplanade and I thought of trying this much hyped place called anadi cabin.
I always used to hear this from my dad and mum that this place had amazing moghlai..
I dropped in with my friends on December 2015
We ordered a moghlai,6parathas and 2 mutton kasha.
The parathas were greasy and moghlai was nothing to be such hyped of.
Plus the place was too small..and it wasn't that cheap as we expected.
Mutton kasha was okayish.

Long time waited to visit. Situated at the heart of kolkata, the Esplanade, this place is a pretty small joint of old memories. Serving kolkata foodies for ages, they may not have the lusture but taste of the food makes you forget all worries. Went with my good old friends and had a good snacks time. Famous for mughlai paratha, their chicken cutlet is also quite good. And by the way, as they are selling like hot cakes , food is not stale as the place looks, i didn't have a problem to digest. Period.

Probably one of the oldest place in the area. Very famous for their mughlai and kabiraji. A small joint very old style. Nothing significant to be mentioned about the decor. Had visited many a times but never had the chance to review it. Well a quick drop for a quick snacks is what I recommend. Nothing too fancy but quite tasty.

This restaurant is absolutely unsanitary. I found a dead small brown cockroach in the potato curry. Upon complaining, the server said it was ginger. Everyone on my table agreed that the " ginger" was a cockroach indeed. The plate with the dead specimen was immediately whisked away and wasn't showed to the boss. My appetite was dead just like the cockroach   but what takes the cake is then the incident was being hushed  up by the waiters and was being denied!!! Inspite of all the people having viewed the garnish on the curry. I would like to warn
 everyone of this totally unhygenic place as this could be a source of an epidemic outbreak and food poisoning. PLEASE STAY CLEAR OF THIS AWFUL DIRTY AND RUBBISH RESTAURANT IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN GOOD HEALTH!!

The Moglai is nothing to brag about. May be once it was great, as I heard from people. Now it is just a waste of money. The moglai took 46 rupees, and additionally the waiter also expected a tip for this petty amount. All the time I ate I was trying to imagine it's greatness, but was largely disappointed compared to the craze and hype people have built about it. Zomato's rating of this food shop as 2.7/5 will continue to go even downwards if they maintain this poor quality.

Kolkata is known for it's amazing street food. So when it comes to street food, can one think to not talk about Mughlai parathas? NO :D

Anadi Cabin is one such legendary place, which has been serving city's best mughlai parathas for ages! 
Situated right in the heart of the city, this small little cabin is very easy to locate with a very homely atmosphere. 
The food is cheap and the taste surely wins the heart. :)

Visited this place just because of its age old reputation but it was an utter disappointment. The supposedly legendary mughlai parantha was super oily and nothing to brag about. The cutlet was okay. The mutton gravy though was tasty. The price is low but any Street side eatery would serve you better food than this.

This is a legendary restaurant known for Moghlai Paratha. Even after dwelling in the New Market for more than half a dozen years, I did not find an opportunity to make myself served by them until yesterday.

Located on Jawarhlal Nehru Road, near Esplanade Metro and opposite to Big Bazaar, this is small eatery devoid of any glamour. I have been there along with dearest friends of mine and have had a gala time.

We went inside hoping to order for the signature item but it was not available at that time. Getting cornered, we ordered for Chicken Cutlet and started discussing among ourselves.

The order delivery took an extended time, but, once it was served you got less to complain. The cutlet was good in taste, the chicken was fresh and tasty and so was the mustard sauce (kasundi) provided with it. However, the onion pieces went stale as they were cut long back and I did not like the taste of it.

The waiter and their behavior are appreciable.

A visit to be made to get an idea of the heritage Kolkata.

One of the old legend in kolkata. This small restaurant is vary famous for it's Mughlai Parotha. ¬†Been there many times and ordered only moghlai paratha. Located near Esplanade, quite close to the Metro Station . ¬†Don't expect a great ambiance but what disappointed me is that their quality is deteriorating with time. Its not the same anadi as it used to be.

Anadi cabin..who doesn't know this shop for moghlai parathas and kabirajis. I'm pretty sure every moghlai lover visits this outlet at least once in his lifetime.Been to this place a numerous time to relish on their legendary moghlai parathas, kabirajis and mutton kasha.And each time we felt the foods' quality and taste detoriating. The oily parathas don't taste good anymore as they are too heavy on the palate. Service guys are pretty rude. Feels sad to see how a legendary shop as this one is falling out of it's place in delivering good food.

This was once a legendary outlet for Mughlai parathas in Kolkata. Gone are the days when people used to swear by anadi's Mughlais and kabirajis. Both quality and quantity wise they have detoriated. Heard so much about this place from my grandparents, this place turned out to be an utter disappointment. The cutlets and kabirajis are okay-ish but I would advise not to try the Mughlai parathas, they are just tasteless.

The only reason to visit the place is the food. 
The ambience is nothing for a fine dine. But you really need to visit this place atleast once for this being such a legend. 
Mughlai paratha, although too oily, tasted lovely.

Moghlai Parantha at its best! Seriously great quality food at pretty decent pricing. The rates are very low, and the quality is very good for the pricing. The service was quick. Keep up the good work.

The rating is ONLY for the food, which is really delicious.
My friend and I went here for a nice evening snack date today but the service of the place was a huge letdown. The waiter was just not interested to listen to us and went on saying that there will be absolutely no Mughlai Paratha. On further questioning he said we would have to wait half an hour for it (which was completely alright by us), but he himself seemed really disinterested.
Well, we were determined to eat and grabbed a table. We ordered two fish fries and one moglai paratha with duck eggs. The fish fry was average but the Paratha was OUT OF THIS WORLD. A perfectly cooked soft inside and a flaky, crunchy texture outside. It was just BEAUTIFUL.
The bill came to a mere 134 rupees which was an added bonus.
So, for those seriously religious food connoisseurs out there,do try this place but I warn you that you have to navigate through rude waiters and an overall slothful ambience full of negative vibes to be able to ultimately reach your gorgeous moghlai.

Had heard a lot about this place ,but the food fell short of my expectations. Most of the people come here and order the mughlai which I found too oily and the chicken cutlet which i had was okayish. One of the pros is that the food here is quite cheap.

Anadi Cabin is dead. Frankly if people are still visiting this place, it is definitely not for its moglai parota. Perhaps people like to visit this age old eatery for nostalgia. If one visits this place please be ready to treat yourself to greasy cutlery. I tried changing a fork that was not washed properly, and the waiter came back with another greasy one. The moglai parota you get in your neighbourhood is better than the ones you get there.

I know this is a very well known restaurant but now it looses its popularity. Whenever you go there a man comes to you and forces you to take mutton preparation with mughlai parota and if you said no then he again forces you to take Mughlai with double egg.And if you said normal Mughlai then either he will say it takes long time or pay exact cash as no change and ultimately you come out from restaurant.I don't know how much commission is paid by  owner to him for one mutton dish.Moreover the overall hygiene is very poor and reputation is gradually deteriorating.

This is a very small place for sitting and i always crowded. It is a old restaurant known for its mughlai paratha and mutton kasa. The mughlai was nothing special but the mutton kasa had minced meat and tastes great. The setup of the restaurant is awful. It is more of a footpath sort of joint.

As its an old place so leave the question of ambience a small cabin but it could be cleaned properly atleast. Behaviour of the stuff are good and delivery is very quick also. But the main drawback is food, the "famous moglai porota" is famous by its name only, the taste was not at all worth mentioning. I did not like it at all, the fast food restaurant near my house serves tastier moglai than this.

Situated next to the Esplanade metro station, opposite to Dharmatala bus depot this place is serving mughlai dishes since years.

With very limited sitting arrangements inside it's always full. A year ago came here with friend & tasted mutton kasha with parathas.

Mutton was average & they serves 8 very small pieces of mutton just at just 220 bucks.

The man there was also well behaved & refilled our plates with extra curries & salads without asking.
But the parathas were very much oily.

Haven't tried the famous muglai though. They looked very oily too but I will try them for the next time.

If you don't like rich or oily dishes, then it's not the place for you.

Legends says if u visit Kolkata, this place is a must visit to satisfy your hungry, horny street food palate..  Well not exaggerating, but this place has owned it's name by it's fabulous, lips smacking moghlai paratha. Specially the double egg moghlai paratha. Ask anyone around the city for a place to have moghlai parathas, everyone will direct you to only one spot, 'Anadi Cabin'.  The place is small, with only 6 tables,but that doesn't stop people from having the best moghlai parathas in kolkata..  Simply awesome.. Limited menu with moghlai paratha, mutton kasa and parathas on the menu.. Very pocket friendly.. Do have a visit for sure.

The taste of Mughlai Paratha is extra terrestrial. 

Moreover the people managing this old joint are indeed case study subject of "How to delight a customer" 

The prices are very reasonable and worth spending of what the taste buds on the tongue gets . 

Fresh made things - no worries of stale product . 

Superb .

We had gone to the place thinking that such an old name would be a good place to have moghlai paratha. But we were let down badly. The moghlai wasnt a moghlai at all. That was bad enough because this place specialises for that dish. The egg portion was not there almost. And one would expect at least a wash basin to be there , but we had to wash our hands out on the road. On top of that the waiter came and stood in front of us expecting a tip. But such a disappointment does not deserve a tip or any further visit. Not recommended.

Anadi Cabin is one the oldest restaurants in Kolkata, and truly it arises nostalgia. Located very conveniently at Esplandade, at the junction of S.N.Banerjee Road, and Jawaharlal Nehru Road, this place is one of the favourites among the Kolkata population. Unfortunately, it appears that, of late, the place has lost a bit of its old grace and shine, and under fierce competition from new outlets. But still, it deserves a visit. And so did we, a few days ago. We had Moghlai Paratha and Mutton Kasha there. And yes, the taste is still there, as it had been earlier. The place remains crowded often, and we had decided to take the food as parcel. And really, it didnt burn a hole in our pockets. We hope this old legend survives the test of times and continues to serve up such great food at such affordable cost.

This place part of old Calcutta cusine for common people. I loved their Mughlai paratha sincce my college days. Again in Sept 16 just dropped in to test again my old favourite. The same shabby cabin. Crowed during the office time. No elbo space in sitting arrangement. The Mughlai Paratha testes the same. Same oily staff with some chopped onion and cucumber. Though I do not like this junk any more but here I got the opportunity to revisit my past. It is worth that sin.

Anadi cabin is one of the retro restaurent & also legendary.
I came here in my childhood with my father & having their best dish, special moghlai.
Today after the interval period of our pre puja shopping, we went there at afternoon.
The moghlai were out of stock. :p
Then we ordered Plain Parota & Kosha Mansho (Mutton Kasha)
The mutton was splendid. Just after putting the little piece of parota with mutton, it was heaven..
Loved it very much. 
The little pieces of muttons are very easy to eat.
It's very ideal for the mutton lovers like me. :p
The mutton kosha with gorom gorom parota!!! In one word, delicious.
The hospitality of the old age person was very soft & lovely.
Though the manager a bit short temper all the time.
Lol.
Going lile there, is like, cherish the childhood memories.

My last visit to Anadi was some 5 years back. The experience then was not at all good.¬† The paratha was not seasoned well, and being used to moghlais stuffed with generous amount of masala or keema, this one seemed bad.

This time I decided to taste it keeping in mind its simplicity. So, I ordered one Special Moglai Paratha with duck egg and one quarter of Kosha Mangsho. 

The moglai was crisp and not dripping with oil. The stuffing like the earlier visit was egg and chopped onions only. If you eat it as an egg paratha, and for the time being forget the fat stuffed moglai, it tastes good. So this is a good one for those who loves it simple. The potato curry needs a bit more seasoning though.

The kosha mangsho pieces were good. Not melt in your mouth, but still soft enough. The pieces were small, but had good amount of meat. A quarter will be enough for two if you are eating it with the Moglai. But the gravy tasted a bit weird. I tried but could not understand why though.

Be attentive while you place the order. The waiters try to make you order more. Like I ordered one special duck egg moglai and he tried to make it a double egg one (Don't have a problem with double egg, but they are made with hen eggs only as per menu). Also the quarter plate of kosha mangsho he tried to make half plate.

Will rate the place a bit higher this time as I was judging it from a different angle as mentioned earlier. Still, personally, I would not go to this place for Moglai. I love my fat keema / masala stuffed ones.

This small restaurant is the reminder of the old Calcutta. The age old wooden tables and its staffs have seen many generations come and go. A visit to this place is an absolute must for everyone. My first venture into this place started with a double egg mughlai paratha. The crunchy paratha with mouthwatering filling gave me enough reasons to understand why this small place has managed to pull crowd for years. . Team up the Mughlai Partha with the Mutton Kasha, and experience the explosion of taste in your mouth.  The cutlets are equally good, but it is the mughlai parathas made out of duck eggs  and the nostalgia, that holds the legacy of the place

A lazy day at work prompted me to atleast end it with some culinary aplomb. Hence, my trip to this shanty ill-kempt cabin amidst the hustle-bustle of new market.
A not-so-missable hoarding gets your attention. The waiters indulgent and smiling and some even dressed in the nearly extinct dhotis. Now when was the last time you were caught in such a time warp.¬†

In the age of transparent open air kitchen, the main chef doles out the parathas n kabirajis in his claustrophobic glass panelled kitchenette space.

I attacked my mughlai paratha made out of duck eggs and relished it. The fish kabiraji was so-so; I have had better tasting stuff elsewhere.¬†What came as a delightful surprise was the kasha mangso - soft, succulent and sinful. I wonder why reviewers haven't gone gaga over this.¬†

The service is prompt, no hassles about not taking bigger denominations of Indian currency notes (believe me that's a big hassle in places like these).

However, be forewarned that most of the stuff is fried in dalda like substance which gives you a sense of bloating quickly. With its dingy seating arrangement minus the luxury of modern cooling system, the place is meant for gastronomical adventurers only!

There are some places to eat at Kolkata which should ideally be beyond ratings and reviews, because the time for which it had passed with it's head high in the food industry of Kolkata deserves a huge RESPECT. Without a doubt, ¬†Anadi Cabin is one of such places. The footprints of my forefathers in this place made me think whether I am capable enough of reviewing the phenomenon. But as a foodie, I thought of exercising this democratic right ! :)
Don't look for an ambiance. don't look for a service. Just order the Mughlai how you want it to be. YES, you heard that right. I would recommend just the "Double Hasher Dimer Mughlai", and that too, ask to customize the same by asking them not to give the unnecessary fillers into it. The final thing made out of all your suggestions is a piece of heaven in your mouth and you would feel why it has been a nostalgia. Price is damn cheap by today's standards and location wise, it is a very easy find. All in all, a must try !

Another one of the "old gems" in Calcutta. Has it stood the test of time? I beg to differ. Yes  it is still quite famous, but I feel it has more to do with the name that it has created for itself rather than the food. Tried the Egg chicken Mughlai Paratha. They serve it with a side of salad and potato curry. 
Was it out of the world? No. 
Was it that delicious? No. 
Was the service good? No. 
Just about ok. Very very cheap though.

I have been going there for many many years now. Possibly for the old world charm and it's legendary status. I always order a moglai parota with mutton kosha. The kosha is good.

An Iconic place like this, that has been in business at the same spot for 98 years, deserves our respect, and should not be rated.. Yes, a lot of people might feel the food quality may not be what it used to be.. But it is still damn good.. and to survive in the food industry for such a long time, which is extremely competitive and has new entrants every day, is no mean task.. The Kosha Mangsho is light and the meat is cooked to its desired softness.. The Fish Fry is not covered in so much batter, that you can't taste the fish..

Got special mughlai paratha (duck egg) packed. The service is pretty fast and boy the food smelt really great and was great to eat. Eat it when hot, else looses its charm.

It is located opposite to Esplanade Big Bazaar. People say Anadi is famous for mughlai paratha but I find it oily and tasteless. Very unhygienic place. Only nostalgia can't please you. Totally waste of time and money..

An Iconic place like this, that has been in business at the same spot for 98 years, deserves our respect, and should not be rated.. Yes, a lot of people might feel the food quality may not be what it used to be.. But it is still damn good.. and to survive in the food industry for such a long time, which is extremely competitive and has new entrants every day, is no mean task.. The Kosha Mangsho is light and the meat is cooked to its desired softness.. The Fish Fry is not covered in so much batter, that you can't taste the fish..

Anadi Cabin is one of those forefathers in Kolkata Cabin Culture which found their forte in cooking up the the most magnificent Moglai Parathas. Almost a century old, this old cabin near Esplanade Metro Station serves some excellent Mutton Kasha as well as heard from locals and frequent goers. We mainly went to try their famous Moglai and every penny is worth the taste. The crispiness in the multiple layers of the gigantic paratha and the evenly spiced meat filling makes your every bite worthwhile. They serve a potato side along with it, tastes better with the Mutton Kasha.

Pro Tip : For an enhanced experience, visit on a rainy evening. A glass of piping hot tea, one plate Moglai and the Old Kolkata Charm. You will fall in love with it. ;)

The standards have gone disappointingly down. They still encash on their old glory of being the inventors of Mughlai paratha, however neither the food, nor the service come any close to their glorious past. Waiters are rude, the place is unclean and needs serious renovation. The sitting area is small and very, very hot, as they would cook right in front of your face. The Mughlai parathas are oily and the stuffings lack the meaty richness. The coverage of the kabiraji cutlet too is very oily. The fish fry is somehow decent. Indeed a sad fate of a renowned place.

My father first suggested this place to me and being a history student, it would have been blasphemous to pass this place up. This British era joint had been on my foodie list for quite a few years. Their moghlai paranthas are legendary ....and I wasn't disappointed. They are light with a perfect balance of spices and very different from the overly dense ones usually found at fast food counters. The kosha mangsho, another hot favourite among customers, didn't impress me much. The place itself is very small,not preferable for a hangout but it  holds an old world charm. However I will be definitely back for the parantha.

The inventors of the Mughlai Paratha! Yes there used to be cars queued up at its front to get a hold of their Mughlai Parathas. Celebrities and luminaries alike. Alas gone are those days! Now it's a shadow of its past. A nearly forgotten entity. But they still boast of their tradition of making Mughlai Parathas with duck eggs (only establishment to do so in the world) and spices and a secret filling. Eat it, with a bowl of Mutton Kosha and you'll know how it's to be Mughlai!

This is one of those very old eateries in the city which has ‚Äòalways been there‚Äô! Anadi Cabin is now run by the third generation and sees a good crowd turning up for the legendary, egg-batter-fried Mughlai Paratha that Anadi is so renowned for. Fluffy, stuffed with keema and accompanied by a potato gravy and onion salad, this is a delicious preparation which should not be missed. Other deep-fried Bengali foodstuffs are also available at Anadi. Located in the Dharmatala area, if the interiors or exteriors bother you, you can always opt for their take-away service. The owners as well as their patrons focus only on the snacks and are not at all perturbed by the shabby furniture, limited seating and roadside crowd!

This place reserves special place in my heart. My parents used to come here since they were childhood sweethearts. This place must be listed in the legendary collection as it is an absolute classic. 
Love the Moghlai Paratha here to the moon and back. This place is so much renowned for this dish only. I also love the Fish Fry and Chicken Kobiraji. Last time, I came here, I wasn't a Zomato freak then. But this time, when I go back, I am surely gonna take pictures and enrich my review for sure. I feel so nostalgic and happy about Anadi Cabin. Oh my God! Happy Dining! :)

'Once upon a time famous' eatery has been loosing its pride. I found nothing special about their mughlai. 'Alur torkari' was bland. So I had to order mutton kosha. It was brought from the small, congested and unhygienic kitchen. Disappointing. On my second and third visit I tried DUCK EGG MUGLAI, it was decent. But I expect better better side dishes and some decent salads along with it. Anadi failed to fulfil my expectations.
Still it gets so many customers. Still anadi is the name people prefer for mughlai, the owner should give some effort and care to revive its quality and charm.

Anadi Cabin is one of the legendary name of Kolkata. They have been serving from the british times to all the foodies.¬†

**Location**
Located just near¬†Chowringhee ¬†Esplanade crossing on the entrance of S.N banerjee road.Just opposite to The Metropolitan Building.

**Food**
They are famous for their Mughlai Paratha thats all we know. I have heard about this place from my childhood and visited them as well.
I tried their Mughlai paratha which is very ordinary nothing special a bit oily as well.
I was a little disappointed about this place.

**Service**
Service was the key which I liked the most. Very fast and well behaved as well. The person serving us was very iterative and gave a lot of trivia about this place.Well behaved and nice human being too.Sorry as I did not remember his name . Good experience,

Everytime I walk past Anadi Cabin, I see a dingy place but always surprisingly crowded. I had wondered the food might be really good then. But, I had never ventured to get food from here myself. 
One evening however, my curiosities got sated when my mum brought home a Mughlai (Moglai, as we Bongs call it) Paratha from Anadi Cabin which supposedly is one of their specialities. 

The parantha was oily and tough, the filling had hard, raw pieces of potato that tasted sort of bland.. 

Big no. 

This place clearly doesn't hold up to the good name of the Legendary Old Calcutta 'Cabins'. 

Never going to have food here. Period.

Well Anada Cabin is Kolkata's one of the most oldest Food Outlet. But with time they forgot to evolve. There is no privacy in this Outlet as hardly 10-15 people can sit at a time. So you have to compromise. Be careful of the Waiters as they can mislead you as they did me. The best thing you can have there is Moghlai and Mutton. Just 3.5 for this. One time visit can be good :)

An old relic of the bygone era, Anadi Cabin today is nothing but a washed up memory of the past. Situated very close to the Esplanade (Dharmatala) crossing, this should fall to your right if you walking towards Corporation Building (Aminia). This is more like a roadside stall tucked forcibly upon the footpath. Would seem like a shortened one storied room, the area inside is unimaginably small and the appearance is clumsy.

The ambiance is nil, unless you consider some wooden tables and chairs to be the flagbearer of exoticism. You can find dirt here and there, almost everywhere. People are almost made to climb upon one another, and the staffs try hard to fit as many people as they can in a single array of chairs against any given table. Their apparent specialty are Moghlai Paratha. And rightly so, once upon a time they singlehandedly defined the history pages of gastronomical delicacies. Tales are told of how people used to flock here for a quick evening snack and their money was well compensated for owing to the quality this outlet had been dishing out since ages.

Much contrary to what this was in the past, the situation in the present is totally abysmal! The egg mixtures are poured into a single bowl and hence it can be highly doubted if you do avail yourself of an entire egg or even when it comes to two hen eggs or if you just get a mug of water out from the ocean. The Moghlai Parathas are mostly bland and not cooked perfectly throughout all the sides and edges. The comedy of error however lies with their accompanying Alu Sabji which is as good as small and tiny chunks of boiled potatoes without any salt.

They do dish out some other items as well but I never had the courage to try them out and probably I never will. I thoroughly appreciate the contributions of these quaint little shops when it comes to defining the history books, but the legendary status alone cannot contribute to their success in the future. They need to buckle up and improve the quality of their dishes or forever sink and obliterate into the darkness of forgotten memory.

These are considered as Kolkata's old charm eating joints, which the owners themselves have no care to maintain. With no intention of hurting a traditional Bengali sentiment, I admit it must had been one of its kind in earlier days, but the golden period is no more.

Crowded, clumsy, low on seating space, and an intentional pushing tendency towards customers like eat and get going is quite a lowdown.

Speaking of food, we went during pre Puja marketing, ordered their Moghlai Parathas. Nothing extraordinary, plain stuff. They don't use eggs one by one in the parathas, instead they use a bowl filled with egg mixture, just dip a handful of that and make the paratha. So you dont get a full egg even for sure. Bad, my paratha had a fallen hair in it, they did not care to look or even change.

I personally had enough of this sentiment. And I will definitely avoid this joint.

This review goes out to all people whose‚Äôs valuable reviews have helped this eatery to get 2.6

I know most of the guys who eat here are the kaku kaimas. Very rarely I find the yo yo school kids or college guys going here for food. Ask any boy to take his girlfriend here for a evening snack, he will probably cancel the date than being here with his girlfriend. And probably that is why after so many decades Anadi has only 228 votes.

I don't know what you people think about this place. Probably the place being small, seating arrangements being old, food being oily, place being unhygienic. the yellow fridge is still yellow and running has helped it to get 
such rating.

People go out and see this world. Go to other cities. When you will find there they are serving you nonsense in the name of food and that also for ¬†4 times the price (yes Mughlai porota is Rs 150-200 per piece) ¬†and still manage to get 1000 ratings putting them at 4 or 4.5, you will understand

Or maybe I am wrong. Let this eatery be not a place for all. Let this eatery be unknown to the butt shakers of Roxy. Maybe this seclusion will help Anadi to maintain the taste of "hans-er dim-er moghlai porota" for all the years I am alive.

My rating of 4.5 for them considers only the taste and pocket friendliness.

If you are out in the Dharamtala area at the latter stages of the month having a thin pocket and feeling hungry, Anadi's Cabin is the perfect place for you. Makers of one of the best moghlais of the city! Along with the Mutton Kasha, it makes quite a combo. Watch out for the temper of the owner though. He is quite hot-headed albeit it's fun to watch.

Anadi r cabin has been known for its Mughlai Paratha for decades. And it didn't disappoint when I visited this place. 

Prepared with the best of raw materials, the paratha could be a oily and unhealthy for most, but if you are in the city to have mughlai paratha, well this is the place to visit. 

Cleanliness is no better than any bengali mithai shop, but adequate to host a crowd close to 30.

I seemed to have gotten lucky this evening.This place unlike before was open.I have heard a lot about it from my friends and family members.And since then I have always wanted to try this place out.I had a Special Mughlai Parantha (duck egg) today. Served with mediumly spiced potato curry and tomato chutney,the size of the parantha was enough to fill me up.The filling is of fried duck eggs,onions,green chillies perfectly cooked in certain spices.Besides being pocket friendly this place also has realy shitty waiters.Here you cannot hold a table for your people because of the rude behaviour of the waiters and the grumpy crowd.But I promise once you take a bite of the food it will wash away every annoyance or any trace of anger.

I've never been a fan of mughlai paratha....but still went there yesterday to try it out.... And my opinion still doesn't change... I just feel that mughlai paratha is just a flattened version of egg roll.. :p
Well, about the place...its bang opposite esplanade big bazaar...doesn't look fancy at all...it just looks like all those cabins that we see in Calcutta....but there are few such cabins at least the food is legendary and this anadi cabin isn't the one...so i don't see any reason why this place is a legendary joint...
I won't recommend this place...

Its a place where you can find something cheapest and light food specially when your became exhausted hopping in new market area. This place is known for moghlai paratha and I had d same in which they use duck egg instead of chicken egg. It was good in taste.

Anadi Cabin is probably one of the first 'Fast Food Joint's of Kolkata. People of the yesteryears would swear by the moglai parotas of anadi along with sherbats of paramount & addas of Coffee House. Even me being one of the younger lot in this city remember having their moglai before catching a bus from the nearby bus terminus in my childhood.
Long gone is the childhood as is the glory of this outlet.
With so much competetion from the likes of patties & shawarmas this outlet has nearly faded from the foodie map.
Nonetheless on a quiet lazy saturday afternoon decided to try them again.
The seating arrangement remains as cramped as before, with table sharing being the usual norm. Ordered a mughlai parota with a plate of kosha mangso. To tell the truth I did not find the moglai as bad as some reviewers have said. However the mutton was more bones & less meat. They also serve cutlets & fries.
Surprising for such an outlet they serve fingerbowls!
So overall my vetdict is one can try their moglai once, if not for the taste, at least for the trip down the lane called nostalgia.

Went to this Outlet after hearing from Many of my Close Foodies.. It's an old and Legendary Mughlai Food Store in Esplanade located exactly in SN Banerjee Road Crossing.. First of the Cabin looks a bit odd and congested.. Secondly I ordered Special Hen Egg Mughlai Paratha with Chicken Cutlet... The Mughlai Paratha was Good but not superb though I would say they have their own taste in their own way of cooking... But the Chicken Cutlet was not at all satisfactory as I expected better in size as well as quality.. Anyway I would suggest everyone to just check in and try out if anyone is interested.....!!!!!

Heard a lot about it so went there one evening when returning from Big Bazaar. I ordered double egged Moglai with duck egg but it was finished so went a single hen egged moglai and it was not crispy enough, the inner portion was undercooked. Didn't like it much ,they don't even have a good cause and what I got ,was a piled one. Anyway ... 3 for its fish fry only. The thing which I can go for again but of course via take away system.

This place is located close to the esplanade metro outlet leading to the corporation building , and is a stone's throw away from esplanade big bazar . The restaurant is tiny , with marble top tables with tiny chairs exceeding the table capacity , cramped into the little space surrounding the live kitchen , where one can watch their mughlai parantha being made . The duck egg mughlai parantha is the most popular item on the menu , and is paired with mutton Kosha. I had heard about this place so much from my mom that I wanted to try , but sadly , I must say it let me down ! The mughlai parantha was square shaped , smaller than the ones served at other restaurants , and was visibly oily . Though the parantha was soft , the taste wasn't good enough nd the potato curry (alur torkari) accompanying it was plain bad. The mutton Kosha had apparently boneless meat that still retained bones and tasted average . The tea ordered post meal was too sugary but strong cutting chai . The worst part was when the people wanting take away delivery of mughlai parantha were told to wait till 7 pm from 5-40 , because the stuffing for the parantha was not frozen and ready yet ! If legendary shops such as these do not work to maintain their food repute , then sadly the famed "anadir moghlai " may someday cease to exist .

Old cabins of Calcutta and rude old waiters go hand in hand. This place being no exception, I prefer a takeaway than sitting down there. The crispy and exceedingly tasty moghlai porota has its own unhealthy charm, and is a good change from the regular sandwiches and pizzas that we have all the time.

Visited this hyped place after years only to get little disappointed. Anadi Cabin is famous for its Mughlai Parathas. But during my recent visit I could find that the taste has deteriorated over the years. Also having Mughlai Parathas nowadays is a  sin considering the loads of oil that goes into it. Still you can visit here once to try the different varieties of Mughlai Parathas.

Heard about this place before but was disappointed to have their food. Anadi's Cabin is quite over-hyped traditional eatery which has unfortunately lost it's charm over years. They were once known for their Mughlai Paratha and Chicken Kasha, however the taste has gone down over years. Mughlai Paratha is okay but was too oily. Same thing goes with the Chicken Kasha.

The place is really small and shabby looking. No renovations have been one in years and eatery is really in a bad condition. Kitchen seems to be dirty and poses a hygienic risk. Pricing is the last thing to worry about.

Overall not recommended from my side.
P.S. - Sorry for the poor quality pictures. Clicked them from another phone's camera.

Talking about Mughlai Paratha, in Kolkata, every foodie has his own favorite food joint. Some make the paratha thin, while others fill it up with generous stuffing and of course the accompanying potato curry differs in taste. But if there is one place which is known to everyone, at least by name,√Ç¬† it is Anadi Cabin in Esplanade.
                                                                ...

Situated at the heart of Kolkata, this is one of the ‚Äòcabin‚Äô-s of old Kolkata, where politics and football were discussed over a cup of tea and Moghlai Paratha (Baida Roti or Mutabbaq). The signature Moghlai Paratha is served with a dry aloo subzi and salad, and a quarter plate of Mutton Kosha is just the perfect accompaniment you can order. The two dishes will cost you a total of Rs. 92, and for that price it is an offer you cannot refuse. Throw the cuppa in, and for 100 bucks you will have a meal that you wouldn‚Äôt forget anytime soon. Ask any Bengali and he will vouch for it.

This place is all about the Calcutta of the past. A heritage in its own right.¬†
Located just opposite the Big Bazaar on the Esplanade crossing, it's a small place on the side of the road. Kind of small and starved for leg space, this place looks like it has remained the same for the last quarter of a century.¬†
Anyway, getting down to the food end of things, the only reason we went there were the legendary Moghlai Parathas we'd heard stories of, and I'm glad to say they weren't all wrong. Tbh, I'm not a Moghlai Paratha lover, but even I enjoyed that.¬†
The normal order over there seemed the paratha, followed by a chicken/mutton cutlet, which we couldn't have for time crunch. but which I'm willing to go back for sometime.¬†
The total bill was just short of 150 for 3, the waiter smartly pocketing the change though.¬†
Anyway, if you're a lover of Kolkata street food, and have heard folklore about this place, you must visit. Else, no harm in giving this a skip.

A very small crowded place just in the opposite foot of Esplanade Big bazar. Visited here today and we have ordered Moghlai made of Duck's Egg. The service was quick. The taste of the moghlai was not up to the mark. The Potato dish served with the paratha was horrible and tasteless. I have tasted far better moghlai in cheaper price than this. I am not satisfied as i didn't find anything great about this place, neither the food nor the ambiance.

I paid a visit long back. The restaurant is over the main road so I utterly doubt its hygienic state of food. But leaving aside this parameter, the food is average. I ordered for the famed mughlai, the size was small in accordance to the charge levied. The waiters were very quick but not friendly enough. Worth a visit owing to its fame, but visit once is sufficient.

After a long and tiring shopping spree,to enter a dingy little restro and have some oily parantha with greasy mutton is so not us these days.. Or is it?! Don't even think of the interior and all that stuff, I'd happily trade it for the food and heritage value..
We got ourselves Mughlai Paratha and Mutton Kosha!! Now the Mughlai Parantha was large, and very very very tasty! Mutton Kosha was very rich, heavy and delicious, and also served in big portions!
As most of the Old Kolkata Food and Restaurants are disappearing from the city, am glad to have this one, as it is.¬†
With Anadi(his photograph still hangs on the wall) blessing us all, this eatery is an absolute treat and reminder of all the good times the city as seen!

But mind maintaining that same authenticity pf the food is very hard..! Extremely dirty . .. And they dnt even slice you moghlai parathas before serving..! How can person eat a paratha without sliced with a fork and knife..! I was embarrased in front of my friends. I used to go when cholds but not now. Please avoid . Proceed at own risk.

We were looking for a cheap place and were very hungry.We found out this small place and thought of giving it a try.Firstly you will not get most of the items mentioned in the menu board,what is available all the time is mughlai paratha and mutton kassa.We were twi people there and we ordered two mughlai paratha and a half plate mutton kassa. The mutton kassa was okay and the paratha tasted good. It was quite heavy too. This place once used to be very famous for such dishes but now uts just a shadow of that.

It is likely that you will come to know about this place from your father or uncle, because it has been famous for their mughlai (moglai) from that time only. Never felt like entering there until my uncle took me there. Just opposite to big bazaar. The mughlai is tasty alright, I liked the crisp.

This small restaurant is known from the black & white days of Calcutta & was well famous for their Moghlai Parata. It is located just opposite of the Esplanade Big Bazaar. The space inside is very small, but somehow manageable to just take the snacks. Coming to the food : They only have very few dishes & snacks & Moghlai is their speciality. They use Duck Egg unlike normal poultry egg used in other Moghlai Restaurant to make their Moghlai. However don't know about the ancient moghlai of this restaurant, In present states I didn't find anything great. All the Duck Egg fanda don't help to improve the taste of  their Moghlai. This tastes very bad & serves in kind of little burned state, with less spices in the parata. Even the potato curry that is served with this is also on the bad side. The size of the parata is on the smaller side & prices is on little bit higher side, comparing with other restaurants.
Conclusion : This restaurant definitely doesn't deserve to be visited especially when you are in Esplanade, there are so many other great restaurants nearby.

An  institution by itself... It's not a place for a fine dining or for that matter any dining experience.... It's a place for a quick snack or packing up some hot and oily and tasty mughlai parantha with nice mutton. Yum

From childhood I have been hearing from my grandfather and then I would hear from my grandma and my dad about this place
Atlast das took me here and we ordered the very much awaited special mughlai parotha with the famous kasha mangsho. This is 1 of the oldest most famous joint in kolkata and once a person came here cannot ever forget the taste of their mughlai. Jus love this place.

Located on the opposite foot of the Esplanade Big bazaar this small eatery which finds a soft corner in the heart of city's food lovers especially the old timers because of its famous Mughlai paratha.We ordered the special Mughlai paratha with mutton kosha.The parathas were crisp thin stuffed with egg.The taste was good.The mutton kosha was average.The total bill for two plates of special Mughlai paratha and a full plate of mutton kosha was 296/-.There were only few customers.The empty benches in this small cabin tells you the rest of the story.The old times are long gone and the hype of Anadi Cabin is slowly dying down.
P.S. Those who are constantly nagging and complaining about 'hygiene','space' and 'great service' Anadi Cabin will definitely disappoint you.

This place has deteriorated from its earlier position of popularity steadily. Located at busy cross roads the quality of crowd visiting is below the levels acceptable. One has to now go to this place in company as otherwise soliciting female customer is known to have forced company at the table and asked you to pay! So beware!!
The place is unclean and the plates usually smell of earlier served food. Wiping clothes and table tops too are unclean!
The food is smelly and not appetizing!
Moreover so many good Roll centers have come up that this one is now without relevance!
They deserve no more than 2.0

Ufff... finally could locate it ... heard about anadi cabin from dad , even from grand father ... just see .., how much royalty it carries in it .... just casually walking down the lane of esplanade to avail a metro ... suddenly it glanced in my vision ... I overwhelmed with joy as I have heard about anadi a lot ... dad often brought mughlai from anadi while returning from office ... so without hesitation I entered the cabin ... may be it is too small ... still the walls are soaked with tradition and heritage ... waiter asked me ... as usual  I asked for their signature dish .. it took a few minutes to understand and he told me about their best mughlai paratha and kosha mangsho ... and I was waiting for it .. after having the meal .. that humble man asked for tea or cold drink ... I said no ... as I dint want to loose the essence of kosha mangsho throuh the burp ... I loved anadi cabin

This is an iconic restaurant back from the days of our grandfather. But with a heavy heart I regret to say that the quality of their food has drastically declined. Once Famous for their rolls and kabirajis has lost its charm. I ordered Fish Kabiraji and Egg rolls. Both were oily and unhygienic. 

They should invest some money and try raising the quality of their food at least.

Come here for the legendary appeal of the place, and for the oily fast food. Don't expect anything healthy or anything that makes you go oomph.

I heard about this place from my father. So I visited the place with much of nostalgia and expectations. Firstly the place is small with wooden chairs and wooden tables with marvel tops. The interior reflects the age of the restaurant, the oil paints one some areas of the wall gives a look of torn down past. 
The place have a cramped up sitting arrangement which is uncomfortable for a person carrying few extra weight. The mughlai paratha section can be seen while passing down the footpath. The utensils are decade old with stain marks on the glass you will not like to have water there. 
They have a lot of varieties in Mughlai Paratha. The variety is basically on the choice and number of eggs one would like to have in his or her Mughlai Paratha 
I ordered the classic plain mughlai paratha with single egg. Well they make their mughlai paratha on a strange looking pan. The bottom of the pan is thin and probably since it was bought it was never washed.
One strange thing I noticed that the waiter served people who came later, before us. The waiters were more chatty and friendly with them. When I asked the guy about my order he arrogantly said it will come when is it is ready. It is clear that this place has got some fixed customers so they will get the first preference even if they come after you. 
The food finally arrived after 40 minutes. The mughlai Paratha was accompanied with potato curry, cucumber onion salad, and tomato sauce. 
The Paratha was thin and chewy and lacked any crunch, thanks to their thin bottom pan. The filling was simple egg and onion. It was blunt, no taste at all. I had to put salt and pepper myself to make it tasty, the potato curry had the similar bluntness. It was just boiled potato in turmeric water with skin on it. No salt no taste at all. The tomato sauce was those cheap variety and made extra cheap using water. 
The food was pathetic. There are many better place to have a good mughlai Paratha in Kolkata. Go to mitra cafe, coffee house, or to the snacks store near you. 
Go to Anadi Cabin only if you want to feel the nostalgia.

Anadi Cabin is one of the oldest restaurants of Kolkata...
This actually can be considered as a Cafe more than a restaurant...

By location, it's great.. ¬†situated on the Main Esplanade crossing.. so easily accessible for all..

Foods are OK.. can give you pleasure to put off your hunger.. also good for spending your evening snacks time..¬†
I've been there 2 to 3 times.. ¬†found no degradation in their food quality..

The only Con you can find is... space is much less, you might not get comfortable seating.. and this is a very busy type of restaurant as well.. ¬†the waiters are always in hurry.. but this is a style of those days in Kolkata.. so can give you a traditional touch..¬†

So.. ¬†to define in short.. ¬†not a bad place to take a break and spend some fooding time during your shopping..

This place would be in the memory of everyone who has seen the town from the black & white days till now. Anadi Cabin is one of the, rather the oldest food joints in town and it's evident by the retro looks of the place from both inside and outside.

Don't bother to look at the ambience cause to be honest, nothing much is there to notice. The only thing that struck bad was the food quality that has dipped drastically in the decades gone by. The name and the once earned reputation is what that's running this place. I seriously hope that they spend and try to gain back the way they used to be.

Anadi Cabin lives up to its title - the eatery is, in terms of space, a slightly large cabin crammed with tables, chairs and customers in various stages of their meals.
This was my first encounter with the famed Mughlai Paratha and Fish Kabiraji. And I loved both. The Paratha was like an exotic omelette rolled in thin dough and the Kabiraji an intricate sensation of eggs, fish and batter...

This place is situated just opposite Big Bazar. hard to miss. Its a small eatery, quiet busy. Heard so much about their Mughlai with Duck egg so i decided to order that. Service was fast. It came with sauce, ¬†onion and alu sabzi. the alu sabji was tasteless. Now the mughlai was crisp but saltless. It was quite bland. I could not uderstand was all the hype about. I have had much much better mughlais. This one does not do justice with the money they charge. Not satisfactory.

Well supposedly one of the prestige and heritage of Kolkata's food history turned out to be somewhat calm and mild in their food. Anadi cabin is famous for its visitors and have quite a history for being a hotspot in its golden days, but as it is true.." With time everything perishes".
I went to the cabin this Sunday with my ma, my sister and brother in law. We ordered their famous " moghlai paratha " that came with different stuffing of poultry/ duck's egg that too in single/ half / double quantity. The food was nothing like extremely outstanding. Its tasted simple as we find in any of ours Para's moghlai shop. Along with the moghlai was potato curry which too was was simple and nothing of great taste.
The service was the only thing that was good.
Moreover the food was over priced if compared to its taste.

Generations have come and gone but anadi cabin's mutton kasa and mughlai paratha has remained. The place is old surviving many years. Its economic. Visited by many regular patrons.

We ordered a chicken mughlai with ducks egg. It was great. 
We also got a plate of paratha and mutton kasa. The parathas were good. The mutton kasa was well cooked and tender but oily...
Overall it was good.

As the food they serve NOW is simply terrible.
Their oh-so-famous spl.mughlai with duck egg is a garlicky disaster!!!!oh my gosh!!!it tasted like biting on raw garlic!!!
Their chicken cutlet is so tough and dry...one can barely swallow.
Visited it the second time in hope of improvement. But in vain.

So when we went to Kolkata's Chowrangee lane AKA Esplanade, we situated Anadi and walked in for dinner. Alas! The maangsho was finished but we ordered Mughlai parantha(suffed with duck egg) and fish and chicken cutlet, which were all pretty good.

For me Bengali and moglai parota goes hand in hand . I have tasted this particular snack in the very less know food joint but some of them amazed me . The USP of any good moglai parota is unique smell of fennel seed , mutton keema and ginger . But I am sorry to state that all of them are missing in Anadi kebin. The texture which is hallmark of moglai parota is totally missing and quality of cooking oil is pathetic . The brand Anadi is gone .

Being from Burdwan, moghlai for me was always complemented with ghugni but kolkata's alu chokha is nowhere near my old favourite ghugni :) I had read a lott about the famous
 eateries of kolkata of which even my dad, my frnds' dad boast of. So one fine day we thought of trying their moghlai paratha. Being allergic to duck's eggs I didnt try their well famous "hanser dim er moghlai" (moghlai with duck's eggs) and thought of giving a try to the hen's egg one. The ambience is nothing to talk of. Some old shabby chairs and tables stacked up. And we shared the table with some office goers before we changed our table only to share it with a couple! Coming to food, I have come to the conclusion that mostly these nostalgic places are overrated. The moghlai paratha was nothing spectacular. It was quite hard to be eaten with fork and we literally fought with our forks and knives before we could actually eat that up! And it was oily too :(

Well,now let's be true..Every old place is not legendary!!!
This place used to be better earlier as far as I have heard but i found nothing much 'Special' about it because I had to encounter a long hair in their mughlai paratha once and really that can't be done away with while rating this place!!! But yeah the other items they make are on an average tasty but I have had better food in places with around the same pricing. So,can't really say that the place is a standout one :)

The glass enclosure is situated right at the entrance and the performer,  a gamchha wrapped around his loins, was in his position inside the cubicle; as if to play to the gallery. On my visit to the century old Anadi cabin, I could think of no other logic but this for erecting a glass walled cabin right at the entrance. The owner, back in those days, had the foresight to attract clients by displaying the art of making the mughlai paratha.  

Anything historical is fascinating and one associates mustiness, worn out and greying look with history. anadi cabin is all that!  Time seems to have stepped in decades ago and got trapped in the layers of soot on the walls. It probably waits even now, in hope that the status of the conjurer of the heavenly tasting mughlai paratha changes for the better and that he is given a makeover! Alas, everything is still the same, as it probably was, many years back. But the good thing is that this is also true for its dishes!  The mughlai paratha still gets made with duck's eggs and it is a treat to watch the dough being flattened till its like a thin sheet of paper! Apart from the paratha,  I also decided to order the fish cutlet and was simply bowled over by the explosion of taste inside my mouth as I took my first bite. The cutlet, in appearance,  was thick, perfectly browned and came with the accompaniment of kasundi and chopped onions. Inside, I realised, that the fish had been chopped or mashed fine with onions,  ginger and green chillies. It was simply out-of-the-world! 
Those wishing to go there should go with the intention of savouring a piece of history. Only then can they expect the food to levitate upwards from their stomach to their hearts and fill it with all its goodness and cheerfulness.

a small food joint with various options for cheap and tasty food.I'm hearing about their kosha mangsho and moghlai paratha from my dad since the day when i've first visited this city(I was of around 4/5 years that time :p).But after tasting their items,I came to know why my dad is such a big fan of them.I mean seriously their Kosha Mangsho,Chicken Cutlet is too good.After shifting to Kolkata for study purposes,I oftenly visit this place for small treats :).Whenever I hop into this place,I always see either tourists or office colleagues or students are having their favourite stuff.really love this place for their Simplicity :)

Being from Burdwan, moghlai for me was always complemented with ghugni but kolkata's alu chokha is nowhere near my old favourite ghugni :) I had read a lott about the famous
 eateries of kolkata of which even my dad, my frnds' dad boast of. So one fine day we thought of trying their moghlai paratha. Being allergic to duck's eggs I didnt try their well famous "hanser dim er moghlai" (moghlai with duck's eggs) and thought of giving a try to the hen's egg one. The ambience is nothing to talk of. Some old shabby chairs and tables stacked up. And we shared the table with some office goers before we changed our table only to share it with a couple! Coming to food, I have come to the conclusion that mostly these nostalgic places are overrated. The moghlai paratha was nothing spectacular. It was quite hard to be eaten with fork and we literally fought with our forks and knives before we could actually eat that up! And it was oily too :(

Well,now let's be true..Every old place is not legendary!!!
This place used to be better earlier as far as I have heard but i found nothing much 'Special' about it because I had to encounter a long hair in their mughlai paratha once and really that can't be done away with while rating this place!!! But yeah the other items they make are on an average tasty but I have had better food in places with around the same pricing. So,can't really say that the place is a standout one :)

The glass enclosure is situated right at the entrance and the performer,  a gamchha wrapped around his loins, was in his position inside the cubicle; as if to play to the gallery. On my visit to the century old Anadi cabin, I could think of no other logic but this for erecting a glass walled cabin right at the entrance. The owner, back in those days, had the foresight to attract clients by displaying the art of making the mughlai paratha.  

Anything historical is fascinating and one associates mustiness, worn out and greying look with history. anadi cabin is all that!  Time seems to have stepped in decades ago and got trapped in the layers of soot on the walls. It probably waits even now, in hope that the status of the conjurer of the heavenly tasting mughlai paratha changes for the better and that he is given a makeover! Alas, everything is still the same, as it probably was, many years back. But the good thing is that this is also true for its dishes!  The mughlai paratha still gets made with duck's eggs and it is a treat to watch the dough being flattened till its like a thin sheet of paper! Apart from the paratha,  I also decided to order the fish cutlet and was simply bowled over by the explosion of taste inside my mouth as I took my first bite. The cutlet, in appearance,  was thick, perfectly browned and came with the accompaniment of kasundi and chopped onions.

I would like to dedicate my 50th review on zomato to Anadi  Cabin.

Think Moghlai Paratha and Kosha Mangsho,think of a tiny cabin at one end of the hustling and busy roads of central Kolkata,that's where you come across a place like Anadi  Cabin.

This is a legendary place indeed.They say that size doesn't matter,and if you come here, you'll really understand the meaning of the words I just stated.

Nostalgic and goes decades back.If you are that typical Bengali person still dwelling in the fashion of the early 80s and simply enjoying the beauty of Kolkata,this is one place where you must come.
As a photographer you can capture the various styles in which the Mughlai Paratha is made and the expressions of the cook,who toils day and night living up to the expectations of his customers.

Be it a weekend or a normal working day I will always visit this place,every time I come to Kolkata.
It is highly recommended for travel and food lovers to visit this place once in your life....else you'll miss a bigger part of Calcutta.
Once the great founder Job Charnock rightly said Calcutta is the City of Joy.This wonderful cabin adds to the delight of calling Calcutta 'The City of Joy'.
Rest I'll leave it up to you to explore....

"Anadi cabin" is not just a random restaurant which you come across on your path, it is blended with the culture of kolkata. Well, around 90% of the people in town or their family members have some nostalgic connection with this place. It is located in esplanade just opposite the newly opened "Big Bazaar". It is a small outlet without any kind of fuss and decor it comprises 3-4 tables to accomodate around 10 people(approx) at a time. But whenever i have visited this joint i hardly found a single table empty. Their legendary "Mughali Paratha" and "Mutton Kasha" is famous like anything all over the town. People from far away places, even from outside the states come over here to treat themselves with these succumbing evergreen offering from this joint. Our grandfathers have relished its offerings during their days and now so do we. From generations to generations the legacy of "Anadi Cabin" will keep on spreading like wild fire as it did in the past and its legendary journey will continue.

Anadi Cabin. The name would take you back in time and you are bound to feel the nostalgia. Before proceeding let me mention that if you are looking for ambience,coolness quotient etc then this is not the place for you.  The place doesn't have an AC,Sofas or the other basic amenities of a eating joint. What it has is the warmth of the staff,smiling faces which greet you,the simple menu and the manner in which staff ask you whether you want anything more. I was mind blown by the staff and their behaviour. 
Coming to the food,the menu is simple but legendary.  I mean who hasn't tried their duck egg mughlai parathas;single egg or double both seem out of the world.  Also there is the optional Mutton Kosha! 
Pricing is extremely reasonable and this is a place where a meal for two would actually cost INR 100!! ( Excluding mutton kosha of course!)
Please visit the place once,not for the ambience but for the food,the smiling staff and reasonable prices.

For all the stories you hear about this place not all of its food lives up to expectation. The mouglai is pretty cheap and good but don't ever get tempted to try the mutton which is not at all good. Nice place to go for evening snacks but nothing more.

I came to know about this place from my grandpa who used to bunk college and hangout at this joint. This place is quite famous for its mughlai, but the taste or the ambience didn't appeal to me much.
Nonetheless, after a tiring shopping at dharmatala, taking a mughlai break at this joint wont be a bad idea.

Anadi cabin

On a recent trip to the city of joy, I found my personal joy at this tiny shack of sumptuousness. This place needs no introduction and is synonymous with three words- Best Mughlai Paratha. Ok. Let's make that four words- Best Mughlai Paratha Ever. Yes, it's that good. Ask me, it's what I had for dinner two days in a row, and might have had for two more days had I had the chance...

The enjoyment begins even before you take your first mouthful of eggy goodness. Watching the skill with which the paratha is prepared right in front of your eyes is a remarkable experience- the ivory mound of dough, the paratha pulled as thin as a lace handkerchief, the egg stuffing splattered onto the sizzling tawa, and the mouth watering aroma, all build up to the moment of truth, when you tear off a steaming corner of paratha, place it in your mouth and chew in eye-scrunching bliss. 

The mughlai paratha is available in both duck egg n hen egg varieties, and I sampled the first out of a sense of adventure. Also, the other item on their menu, the mutton kosha, is incomparable. Melt in your mouth chunks of meat in a silky smooth gravy, served in a pretty earthen pot, it can be a wonderful accompaniment to the mughlai paratha. 

Ambience wise its not the most attractive joint, a tiny place with rudimentary furniture and quite frankly, an unhygienic appearance (which is the sole reason why I deducted a point). Hence takeaway can be a good option, if you can wait that long to bite in, that is...

Anadi Cabin has a legacy of Spl Mughlai Parantha as I have heard from my father. Had ventured once to enter here..... filthy n cheapness persists in every inch of the eatery. Looks they have not cleaned n renovated the place for last three decades.
The Mughlai paratha was in a pool of oil.The taste was different n spoilt our mood. Even the road side eateries in our locality better,  tastier, healthier mughlai parantha. The present management is a pure mess who has zero control over teh rude staff n absolutely nonsense cook.
The score should have been zero but looking at the rich heritage it has inherited, 2/5 has been awarded.

Anadi Cabin....... a name familiar with every elderly in Kolkata. They tell & retell fond memories of this place from time to time.... Nostalgia overcomes them everytime they hear the name. And my father is not an exception to this. I was longing for a good Mughlai paratha for some time, and my father recommended this place, remembering his good ol' college days.... So after some puja shopping, we one day decided for a take out from this place. 

Located over Jawahar lal Nehru Road, the old eatery maintains its ancient look. After going inside, the first thing I noticed, it was filthy! The tables, chairs, plates, spoons, the open kitchen, everything were dirty & unhygienic. Staffs were very rude. Still gave it a shot.....remembering its legacy..... Ordered its 'famous' Special mughlai paratha for takeaway. Also ordered chicken kasha, which we were curtly informed will not be available.  The open kitchen was extremely filthy with equally unhygienic cook. it took around 15mins to make 4 mughlai parathas, which they packed neatly for takeaway. Cost was almost 200/-

After opening the package at home, we found out it contained only a small amount of potato curry and salad consisted of onion only. The mughlai paratha was good in taste, very soft & nicely made, but nothing extraordinary. Although the size was comparatively much smaller than other places.  Potato curry was very spicy, not tasty at all. We avoided the onion salad altogether. Overall the food didn't meet our expectations and my father lamented how the quality have fallen over time.....

The after effect of this mughlai paratha was on this next day. From very early morning, all four members of our house had one common destination.....the toilet!! Cramping abdominal pain & diarrhea made the hell out of our lives for the entire day. And I swore that this visit was my last visit to that unhygienic place.

In my opinion:

Decor 2/5

Hygiene 0/5

Food quality 3/5

Service 2/5

Overall 2/5 

Disappointing experience.....enjoy the food here at your own risk!

I have visited this place couple of times before and everytime i liked it there.
Its a very old place in esplanade but the food is delicious.last time I ate special double egg moglai.It tasted so good and I think its the best tasted moglai parantha aI ever had.
The waiter was very helpful and ready to help.
Though this place is not well decorated and only couple of tables are there to sit.
But its the taste of that old authentic food that  always brings me there.

If you want to eat Muglai parotha, then this is the best place to eat. The egg used is Duck egg instead of hen's egg. The fares are Pocket friendly though hygiene and decor can be improved . The limited space and shabbiness often turns you away from the fine stuff they make. It is situated in Dharmatala area. It is frequented by middle class Bengali families who came to shop in this area.

Had another pleasantry while shopping parade in New Market Area with wife and kido.....when we reached the place it was almost full so we decided for takeaway....we had ordered chicken cutlet and mutton kosha.

Chicken Cutlet :

Big sized drooly cooked, with loads of ginger and onion along with minced chicken tatsed good however they had lessened the amount of minced chicken and majority you will find onion and ginger 2/4

Mutton Kosha 
The Kosha was bit flowing in gravy rather than sticky cooked and lacked the original taste which was before quite good some 10 yrs ago I had tasted. 2/4

We ordered their special mughlai and one mutton mughlai.
Ambiance/Service:-
Very unhygienic place, stenches on plates and spoon, table, chair everywhere.....smoky smell of cooking, very sloppy service....they gave us the menucard and took 6order almst after 15 minutes...n served the food almost after 25-30 minutes....terrible! !
Food:-
Very rubbery texture and only filled with onions, thatz wat they serve as their signature mughlai paratha..., with a strand of hair in the dry potato curry...very nauseating.,..
Really wont cm back,my first and last visit.

I am a man for heritage, but only if serves atleast close to the standars as it once set. For Anadi Cabin, it fails miserably. I don't know why people go on about it's moghlai partha. It's probably because this is one of the first places in the city where one could have found it. But if you go by taste, I've had better in about 100 places. Be it the parathas, the Kabiraji or the Kassa Mangso, they are below average. I have no problem with the ambiance as that is to be expected in smaller eateries. But nostalgia can't overlap the requirement for good food, which I didnt find here. If you wanna witness nostalgia, sit at home and watch a movie dated 50 years back.

What do we really look for in a place like this with minimal hygiene, average service and almost no care for who comes and goes? We look for a piece of nostalgia in the food in a place limping away from glory. That in evidence is still there in the oily duck moghlais and kosha mutton. The alur torkari still maintains its orangy tinge and this mystery of color still remains. Go there for the moghlai and kabiraji and the piece of dust lodged in your chair from yesteryears.

This place is nothing great when it comes to ambiance or the location . But it is surely great when is comes to mughlai paratha and chicken kosha. Have also tried their fish fry and cutlets but did not quite like it.. I prefer the simple standard mughlai paratha. The hygiene factor is missing so there is nothing to b spoken about . I prefer take away from here . There are better places off late which prepare good mughlai paratha in better ambiance and hygiene .. One can always try this place if they love moghlai paratha prepared from the egg of ducks ..

All that glitters is not gold.
This saying seemed apt for this place for some reasons.

They are famous for their Moghlai Paratha and Kosha Mangsho. They are good at it but nothing insane.
The ambiance made me feel a choked throat. A small and cramped place. You have to share your table with others.
I remember the waiters for a couple of reasons. They were very clever, and knew what their job well. They almost tricked me to have two plates of Kosha Mangsho. Moreover, if you visit the place in odd hours, you will see the waiters having good times with each other on the next table right beside you. That's unprofessional. And a serious turn off for me.

The food is pretty cheap. But that is what you get every where in restaurants like this.
Still, I will visit this place again with a hope to prove myself wrong.

Mughlai paratha and kabiraji fascinates me. So one of my colleagues suggested me to try anadi cabin's mughlai paratha. I paid a visit a few days back and the ambience is nothing to brag about. Can't say about the 'old Calcutta charm', etc. but the food is worth remembering. I had ordered a double egg mughlai paratha which was delivered within a few minutes. It was quite large and fluffy and the first bite itself made me say 'wow'. It was quite filling and tasty. No matter how the place looks, I would definitely visit it again and again because real foodies want real food which would not burn a hole in the pocket but at the same time would fill the tummy and satisfy your taste buds.

Mughlai paratha and dry potato curry as an accompaniment. The filling of the paratha is soft,succulent and filled with bits of onion and well,oil. But seriously,it doesn't matter. Medium sized square portions allow for a filling evening snack and can also double up as dinner. The curry is spicy and dry,thus going perfectly with the juicy paratha. This is one place I would recommend for Mughlai parathas along with South Pole in Gariahat. Though the latter serves larger parathas.

If you are looking for the great traditional Moghlai paratha and Kasha Mangsho, this is the right place. The Moghlai Paratha is still made here with a great deal of care and skill. You can have a choice of standard chicken eggs or Duck's egg at a slight premium. Worth the try! The Moghlai Paratha is generally served with a plain potato curry more like "aloo chochhori" and it is simply delicious. The paratha is crisp and melts in the mouth. You can also try a quarter of Kosha Mangsho which is a oil infested sinful dish of mutton, rich and spicy and tastes lovely. It makes for a great meal although you might need an antacid after all this.

Very very poor in hygiene...the cutlery,glasses and plates are not even bothered to be washed ,rather they are being wiped off with a dirty hanky. The quality of food is ok , as the taste is good but sometimes you may feel the uncooked essence of raw eggs from under-cooked dalda moghlai parathas!!!!!!!!!!The score of 2.5 is because of the traditional legacy and the cheap price!!!

Like many of Kolkata's 'old goldies', this restaurant has remained stuck in time while the world has moved on. Uttam Kumar no longer acts in movies and you carry around more than Re 1 in your pocket. So don't waste your time visiting this place. Any street corner roll counter serves better stuff.

To be very honest you can try the Moghlai Paratha along with the mutton kasha only if the old world charm fascinates you. The place is cramped, strangers seating  & even standing next to you, the waitors eager to egg you for tips, the plates not hygenic enough & it is quite hot inside in case it is not a winter evening. The only way it can earn points in the price & the fact that they serve quarter/half plate mutton kasha. The special moghlai( with 2 eggs) is soft in taste but I would recommend to carry the food & have it at home with clean cutlery & Mustard sauce & not the typical tomato based sauce that they serve at the outlet. Also in case you are little calorie conscious, avoid seeing them frying the parathas on the tawa since you might lose the urge to eat there seeing the amount of DALDA that they use while frying those !!

‚ÄúRich Heritage‚Äù, ‚ÄúWarm People‚Äù and ‚ÄúOld World Charm‚Äù are throw-away terms in ANY discussion on Kolkata. However, the stark reality we must face- the ‚ÄòOld Calcutta Charm‚Äô that we so often, sometimes unwittingly refer to, is most often NOTHING but signs of post-colonial hangover, decay and inertia. It is the same that has gripped this aged place.

 It‚Äôs difficult to be a ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô foodie in this city. With the advent of cross-culture cuisines and fresh dishes, one tends to undermine the century old food joints, which are either dying or dead already. Hence, I have a soft corner for them. These establishments carry the taste that has been enjoyed by several generations, and their existence seems to be confirmation enough that there is something special for sure; as they have stood the test of time‚Ä¶ seemed to be I was only partially right.

 There are certain signature spices, vegetables and food-grains that go into making authentic Mughlai Cuisine.

Having heard a lot about the legendary status of "Anadir Moghlai paratha" I had decided to try it out long back and I was not disappointed.I have tried the place quite a few times since and never have I been disappointed.The Moghlai parathas are really very nice.They are decently priced.The service is prompt.
But there is nothing called ambience as such.There is no air conditioning.The space is very meagre.It has very few seats and hence is crowded almost at all times.Hygiene and cleanliness is also not good.
But in spite of this the place gives a feel of Old Kolkata.The place has lost its charm and glamour in recent years and is actually more like another one of the countless fast food joints.
But overall the quality of the moghlai parathas and the heritage of the place makes it a place at least worth a try.

Like many of Kolkata's 'old goldies', this restaurant has remained stuck in time while the world has moved on. Uttam Kumar no longer acts in movies and you carry around more than Re 1 in your pocket. So don't waste your time visiting this place. Any street corner roll counter serves better stuff.

To be very honest you can try the Moghlai Paratha along with the mutton kasha only if the old world charm fascinates you. The place is cramped, strangers seating  & even standing next to you, the waitors eager to egg you for tips, the plates not hygenic enough & it is quite hot inside in case it is not a winter evening. The only way it can earn points in the price & the fact that they serve quarter/half plate mutton kasha. The special moghlai( with 2 eggs) is soft in taste but I would recommend to carry the food & have it at home with clean cutlery & Mustard sauce & not the typical tomato based sauce that they serve at the outlet. Also in case you are little calorie conscious, avoid seeing them frying the parathas on the tawa since you might lose the urge to eat there seeing the amount of DALDA that they use while frying those !!

'anadir cabin e moghlai paratha ar kabiraji' is famous for decades! located bang opposite to esplande big-bazar on s.n banerjee road, this tiny place is one where i never mind going after loads of shopping for a quick snack-bite. moghlai paratha is very tasty and filling, i prefer it usually with a cup of tea or coffee. pocket pinch- 50-70 bucks!
yes the place is very small and cramped but somehow i love it as it is :-)

"Moghlai maney Anadir Cabin" - Goes the saying and quite rightly too. This small place opposite LIC Building on Esplanade is legendary for its Moghlai Paratha. The feel and ambience is old kolkata with a dash of 'what once was'. This rings ever more loudly with Anadir Cabin losing its status as a must go address for foodies while in the Esplanade area. Its a shame that it has nearly turned into an ordinary fast food joint. The place is very small with probably 5 tables max. Its always overfilled however. The staff are courteous and the food is served prompt.However the cutlery may not always be clean!! The Mughlai may have lost its glory but it still shines through. Its tasty and juicy. I've heard that originally it was made from duck eggs, but on requesting for one I was told that the use of duck eggs have been discontinued with more people opting for hen egg. Honestly speaking, i haven't tried out anything else there as i felt everything else in the menu didn't deserve a taste through. Just go for the sheer romanticism of it all.

Chakraborty Tip : Save yourself the embarrassment of asking for the Sink to wash your hands. There isn't one.

A place with a lot of the old Kolkata feel attached to it, and a legendary status to go with it. The Muglai paranthas are very good, and very nicely priced too. Been there couple of times, liked every time. Not for the fussy man who worries about AC and comfortable seating.

Anadi Cabin has been a legend of Kolkata. "Anadir Moglai" would be mentioned in books, written down with love and care, and make the readers drool as the writer would wax lyrical about the softest meat broken apart with the touch of a paratha-clad hand. A paratha, which was no ordinary thing, but a Moglai, with duck eggs in it. The deal is... nowadays people actually go to Anadi and demand a Moglai with a hen egg. That is an anomaly, I must say. The best moglai comes from the duck. 

No dispute there, please. I am biased.

That said, my trips to Anadi is becoming infrequent now thanks to the inconsistency in their food, and their seating arrangement, which is declining. Anadi Cabin is very very cheap, but also, the quality of the mutton kasha (which btw is pretty cheap) has gone down. I want this place to revamp itself, recover, and restart. It is good plain Bengali fare, much more tasty than the mass-produced crap, and smacks of the heritage of the Bengali people.

Struggling to maintain its heritage and fame-this will sum up the present state of Anadi Cabin. I have heard from my mother that during her childhood, my maternal grandfather used to be a regular visitor of Anadi Cabin and brought home delicious moghlai parathas almost on every weekend. Whenever they used to visit Esplanade area, snacks at Anadi Cabin was must, else it would have made their day incomplete. Such was the craze and fame of this restaurant, located at the heart of the city, in years before. When I grew up and started visiting restaurants, I remembered my mother's verbal review of Anadi Cabin and went there, not once, but numerous times. But every time I was left disappointed with the very oily moghlai, with the taste which could hardly differentiate with any other road-side stall. To this, add bad behaviours of the waiters and a very poor ambience and poorer sitting arrangement. This place, at the best, can be visited when you are very hungry and want to have your food at cheaper rates. The question is: Why did I visit this place numerous times in spite of such experiences every time? It is because I am still in search of the glory this place used to have decades ago. I visit their everytime with the hope that things might improve and I will be able to experience that heritage feeling: but I am yet to get that. Probably, I will keep visiting this place again because of that nostalgic picture which have set in my mind, only to be disappointed again. The owners must keep in mind that every customer will not return back in spite of poor experience. Rather they must pull up their socks to improve the restaurant and make the most of having a shop in such a location.

This place used to be a favorite haunt for olden day foodies. But now it lacks that something that made it a rule in its heyday. Anadi's Mughlai Paratha is average these days. you can have better mughlai parathas at Das Cabin in Gariahat.

My Father , when during his hey days :) would visit this place with his college friends
  for the customary get together and gup-shup :)

later when I came into the scene :), he took me once there when I was like 12-13 years old . We were living in delhi that time so this was a vacation outlet that dad wanted to show me.

It's been 30 odd years since then , never got a chance again. but maybe would take dad to his joint just again to relinquish those glory dayz. was amazed that this place is now being run by the 3rd generation and the menu card may not have vastly changed. ! reminds me of that ambassador car. :)

I know that I am writing this review for my blind love for my City of Birth - Calcutta and my childhood days nostalgia of eating with my Dad at this age old restaurant called Anadi Cabin.

Due to staff unrest, it went to closure many times.  It had offered many dishes such as: Mughlai Paratha and other popular dishes at a very cheap price. 

It could have been still a star attraction for the visitors due to its marvelous location at the prime location of Esplanade but unfortunately the staff unrest and closing it down so many times, and for a long period each time, has hurt the growth of this restaurant.

Truly a horrible place. I went to Anadi a number of times in the previous years. The food was agonizingly bad everytime. The famed Mughlai Paratha was tasteless and greasy. Oil literally drips from the fingers. Add bad mouthed waiters and you get an unwelcome slice of culinary hell.

Why did I go multiple times? Simple-I wanted to negate the Murphy's Law factor-food tasting bad only when we go for a treat.

Anadi Cabin.....a dingy restaurant on the most happening place of Kolkata.....being the famous and vintage persona of traditional Bengali fast food outlet. The restaurant can be found hidden behind the roadside stalls and magazines...with couple of waiters who don't even behave politely...but dishing out softest and tastiest Mughlai Parathas along with Mangsho...you can even see how these delicacies are prepared from a glass pane mounted to let people see through.....arguably Kolkata's best.....try once....at least....for owners...please, maintain the sanctity of this place.
