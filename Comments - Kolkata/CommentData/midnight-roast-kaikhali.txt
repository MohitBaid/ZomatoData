I have ordered paneer butter masala box .I can say they are one of the best in the market. I have seen some of the negative review also. But really thought of ordering to have experience of this new venture.I don't know how people have given this review. Customer experience and the way they deliver is just awesome .Hats off for this service in Kolkata. 
All the best. I will make sure that I will be your regular customer.

History- I have tried to place order two times before this both the time they didn't accepted the order. And this time after after 15 min they accepted the order that to after modifying as per there stock.

My Order- Combo of Paneer butter masala and Rice. It was changed by them to mutter paneer and Rice.

Delivery- It took them 60 min to deliver the meal.

Food- 5 cubes of paneer ,10 pcs of frozen peas and under cooked rice. Mutter paneer was too spices and hell lot of kasuri meethi. Left it after 3 spoon. The proportion of Rice to gravy was like 20% gravy to 80% rice in box.

Verdict- A minimum you can expect from a restaurant is to cook rice properly. There are far better place which are there are on late night delivery. Try this place on your own risk.

The food was spot on!. I ordered a cheese grilled sandwich, jeera rice and kaju paneer. The sandwich can be said to be their speciality. Fabulous food at any hour of the night!
