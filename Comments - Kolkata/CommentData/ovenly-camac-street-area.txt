Cheese cake lovers paradise ! 
Baked caramel cheese cake is the thing to order here! Please don't make a mistake of calling an eggless cheese cake ! It's like calling for chocolate cake without chocolate ! To start with the definition of this cheesecake ! What do I say? Smooth and rich, heavy an yet so easy to swallow. Melts in your mouth and leaves you longing for just one more bite, and that beautiful luscious after taste of caramel that makes you want to shut your eyes and twirl your tongue around the heavenly piece of dessert ! Hence for such heavenly experience I would strongly recommend OVENLY !

First of all, I really like the name of this place. Recently tried their Macadamia Brownie and a Peri Peri cheese sandwich.
The brownie was an absolute delight. The perfect texture, just the right amount of sweetness and monstrous in size.
There is some scope of improvement in the sandwich because the cheese inside was dry and looked like it was roasted. The bread became hard but that is understandable because it was a delivery. However I loved the taste of the Peri Peri masala they used. Super spicy and super tasty.
P.s- surprising that I'm the first one to review this place. Do try it out guys and you won't be disappointed. Specially the brownie!
