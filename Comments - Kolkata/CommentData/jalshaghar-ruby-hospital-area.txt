Located near Ruby hospital , this restuarant is a place for live music , booze , chinese and Indian dishes. The ambiance is nothing as such to mention . They have a bar and a family section as well.

What I Ordered -

1. CHICKEN HARIYALI : Big pieces of chicken and tasted okayish . 

2.CHICKEN IN CORRIANDER SAUCE : I had it with naan and roti. It tasted good 

3.CHICKEN  SEEKH KEBAB : It was good  , but i feel the pieces should be given more

4.CHICKEN TIKKA KEBAB : The kebab was grilled to perfection . Overall a good item

5.FISH IRANI KEBAB : It was okayish ,nothing fancy to say 

6.KASHMIRI PULAO : Trust me I have had better pulao than this this. 

7.LASOONI KEBAB : A star item of this place. It was very tasty . Must try 

8.MIXED SCHEZWAN RICE : The rice was spicy , as schezwan is spicy . I had this with chicken in corriander sauce 

9.PANEER HYDERABADI : If you are looking for a vegetarian item here, have this dish. It was good 

10.PATIALA MURG : This is a very unique item . The chicken was covered in omlette and it tasted quite good 

11.RED ISLAND FISH : This is also a very good dish from this place ,the fish tasted awesome. Must try 

12.SINGAPORIAN MIXED NOODLES : Fresh noodles with prawn,chicken and eggs , a okayish dish .

13.VEG KADAI : It was a very okay item .

As per service is considered, the service is very slow here ,the waiters think that they are superior authorities and very reluctant. Please improve your service .

Went there on a sultry afternoon since was very hungry. I have read its reviews earlier, but hunger made me decide to try it. The security guard at the doorstep was the only person who showed happiness to see a customer approaching the place. If you look at the decore it is clear that its interior decoration was quite good at one time. But now it's a different story. Dirt and neglect changed its brightness to dullness.

The staff were busy watching cricket on the tv, so it appears that they were not very pleased to see me barge in. Anyway, a man eventually came and I ordered tandoori roti and chicken kasha. And also masala coke. The last item was given as an afterthought and the boy clearly did not like it. He went away sullenly and did not even seem to hear my request for tissue papers(again!!!)

He came more than 15 minutes later with the coke. Without straw. He took a while searching for the same. At last he found one. It was ok, but I missed the lime rind that some of the restaurants offer. The food arrived five minutes later. The tandoori roti was crisp and warm and the chicken kasha had just the right amount of hot and gravy in it.
Parking is not difficult at all. Price is easy in pocket.

Not bad but for the staff.

I didn't find anything much interesting to say about this place. If you're hungry and looking for a nearest good place to have something then okay. But if you're looking for a special dinner then you may not like this one.

Jalshaghar is a place for mainly booze not much to say about their food because it's very average and some dishes are below average as well. 

The ambiance is nothing much to mention as the they have bar and family section as well. With live orchestra performance this place is has a different ambiance. 
Chinese is average and the Indian dishes are below average.

The Chinese is quite good, don't know about Indian, and the service is good as well. They may also serve some food not listed in menu if there are only a few customers.

Visited once a few years back for a drink. They had this upstairs bar (ground floor for families) with live music playing. Don't know if the live music is still on. Didn't have much food so can't comment.

Good food, fast service and cheap rates. The perfect place for dine outs. Middle class bliss. Only, the Biryani could be better. Hospitality is okay.

Went there once when it was newly opened. Food quality was average. We had tried kababs, tandoori roti and a gravy which i don't remember. Not worth a visit.

went there couple of times..1st visit was ok..chinese items were good. chilli chicken, garlic chicken were having big pieces of chicken cooked well. on my 2nd visit i found food quality has gone down. chicken pieces are small, too dry, bland in taste. earlier alcohol prices were affordable. now it has shot up. the place is very conveniently located just on the bypass near ruby and have good parking facilities. but that's it. nothing else positive to say about this place. if you want to booze, you can visit but food is their weak point here.

The most poor restaurant I have ever seen. They dont have any other brands apart from Kingfisher and Haywards 5000.When asked for sweet lime ,they provided a salty one, when we complained about it, they brought a bottle of syrup and simply added it. We ordered dry chilli chicken, and instructed them to make it non spicy, when asked about it, said they dont know how a chilly chicken can become non-spicy.Overall a pathetic experience and waste of money.

Too heard to express my feelings. Service is good but the main problem is "The food". Me and my friend went their to booz and have some food. "Tandori chicken" was so bad it was under cooked and their "noodles", I can bet any of the "street food store" would provide tastier noodles than they had given to us. They don't have different brands of beer only kingfisher is available! Don't know why? Horrible experience and wast of money!
