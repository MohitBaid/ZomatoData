The taste of dry chilli chicken was aweful with too much of salt. Too much of bones instead of flesh.

The food quality is too bad. Two times I have ordered from them. Pizza and Chinese combo. First time pizza was horrible. Second time I thought maybeâ€‹ they don't know how to make pizza and all so I ordered Chinese combo as I was too hungry and no other option was for me.
But when I opened the packet I had no idea whether I have to cry or lough. The pieces of chilli chicken was microscopic almost. And the rice........
I am sure the rice became fatty having their Italian items.
