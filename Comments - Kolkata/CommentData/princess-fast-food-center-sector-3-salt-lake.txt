This is a street side fast food centre. Food quality is average. Before price hikes it was really cheap. But now it costs a bit more compare to any street side fast food shop. All in all an ok place for evening snack or even dinner for some days.

Small outlet in our local market serving fast food. The quality is pretty decent. Really like their fish fry & rolls, the tarka is also decent and worthy of a try.

Veryy good if you are hungry and need food immediately. Located in the IA chatal market, it is a take away counter. No arrangement to sit and eat, but it is attached to the IA Block Benfish. Cook is good. The chicken steamed momo and the chicken kosha is a must try.
