It was a sudden plan to visit Barcelos.. It has a good ambience and decor... As it was my first time so took recommendations from the waiter...


¬†At first i ordered Chicken Thigh With Onion And Pepper (it was just good) followed by Chicken Livers With Port Roll (i liked the taste) Chicken Red Burger ( i had it, ¬†and it was so juicy and delicious) Chicken Black Burger (fillings differ from the red one and was told it was amazing too) ¬†After filling our stomach to the fullest, it was time for the dessert to come... I ordered Dark Lava Meltdown Cake (presentation of the dish was just woww, and it tasted heaven)¬†


I won't say its a pocket friendly place, slightly overpriced, but its a must visit place... I had a good experience being here...!

The Sangria was superb. I loved the Jamaican flavours especially. The Peri Peri Chicken matched up to the expectations. But the pasta was overhyped and same with the sizzler. The decor and interiors were awesome. But the food was below par. All in all decent experience in my first visit.

The one n only barcelos in kolkata. A decent place to go and try some out of the box. The advertisement of the red black burgers tempted me check this out. We ordered full chicken and 4 chicken mini burger with spicy rice, and French fry as side dish. The full chicken was delicious. The chicken grilled with peri sauce we tried all the 4 types of peri peri sauces with chicken. The burgers were the best and hence is the main attraction of the place. Black and Red burgers were awesome with spicy sauce and yummy chicken stuffing. 4burger was very soft. Quantity is good for the price they charge. We will visit again

Heard a lot about this place but it was nothing extraordinary, rather not even that good. The number of visitors were not even more than 5. The decor was really nice but somewhat food wasn't upto the mark. We ordered 4 mini burgers, the different colored burgers tasted just similar... not difference in flavour, that was a complete thumbs down.

Very very average.... If u just have fancy stuff with fancy name in a fancy place it sells for few days but ultimately for repeat customers it shd b good.... Went twice last yr and nt going again ... On 25th Dec when every place in Acropolis had more than 1hr waiting time this was the only place which had seats vacant and I stl choose nt to go in this place.... U can go to the place once I guess and revisit only if u like it... That is my recommendation

Finally was able to visit Barcelos. The decor and seating is very good and comfortable. The service was also good. The best item was chicken sizzler. Would only visit this place again for the peri peri chicken sizzler and the non veg kebab¬†platter. It has quite an extensive menu but the food was too good. Highly recommended.

Checked in here with my friend. They don‚Äôt serve complimentary accompaniments or bar snacks which encourages one to order one from the menu. You cant have basic peanuts or cheese bites. So we ordered a White sauce pasta the chief ingredient of which was bell pepper of various colours which made it look colourful. It had a sprinkle of mushroom or olive. The White sauce was too less for the pasta to be greased well by it and it lacked every major for it to be called an Italian dish. But they charge you high enough. R/s 261 for handful of it. Better to have the R/s 15 Maggi pasta pack and add your own veggies. The people here don‚Äôt believe in serving well I don‚Äôt know why. They are least cheerful. Handed me a 1.5 ltrs beer pitcher to serve on my own. I served my pasta too. But they sure added service charge in the cheque which my friend later waived considering their pathetic service. The L shaped premises has a good view at the end of the L. 2.5 stars for the view.

Barcelos situated in Acropolis mall has an amazing ambience. The place has a good vibe and the decor is on point. I tried the black burger and the chicken steak over there. The burger was really filling, because of the wholesome chicken breast inside. You can also choose the level of spiciness. They have a separate sides menu from which you can choose two side according to the dish. The place is totally worth the money.

The chicken mini burger came in white brown ,red,and black colour. Each had a different flavour. The chicken was too soft and juicy.you are supposed to  choose a side with it.
The chicken espetada looks so tempting and is delicious. 
And the the lamb chops was yummy. Please try this dish
Service is fast

So... I ended up entering this loner place in Acropolis. 
We ordered 4 mini chicken burgers, 1 pinacolada and a on-promotion rum. 
 the pros-
- large space
The Cons-
- driest burgers ever
-hardest burgers ever(check the pic) 
- really tasteless and extra cheese was like sh*t (adding an amul cheese slice) 
- charges are unnecessarily high
-levy exorbitant service charges(no pic as we were so pissed that we forgot to take bill as wee)

A pretty classy place . The traditional flame grilled peri peri chicken is great. The sauces include supa peri, veri peri, mild peri and tangy lemon ( in descending order of spiciness) The peri peri chicken sizzler is good but is not close to the classic flame grilled peri peri chicken. 5 cubes of chicken is served with veggies and rice on a sizzling plate. The blueberry cheesecake like always is good. But not extraordinary. They serve it with a dollop of strawberry ice cream on a cookie.

We had a great experience overall at Barcelos in Acropolis mall, kasba, Kolkata. We went in fact without much expectation, just knowing that they serve black and red burgers. However, the staff were polite and knowledgeable about the menu, service was fast, and the food was delicious. We ordered a pitcher of orange and cloves sangria,  chicken platters, lamb chops,  4 chicken mini burgers and a double layer dark delight. Food was impressive! We liked the ambience of the place as well. Absolutely no complain about this evening at Barcelos.

Barcelos is the new entry in the Kolkata-food-scene, but this internationally spread brand is already famous in many international as well as few Indian cities already.

The d√©cor is minimalistic, rustic and gives a feeling of the road-side cafes one encounter in Europe. Being my first time in any of the Barcelos, and being a lone diner, I did not want to take risk and asked the waiter for recommendations. Upon his recommendation, ordered a peri-peri chicken and a virgin mojito.

Peri-peri chicken was their signature dish, and it was good, but nothing extra-ordinary. I ordered 1/4th chicken portion with one side dish. The price, I felt, a bit on heavier side.

Overall, just an Okay experience.

Food: It was a rollercoaster ride as far as food is concerned. Some things, especially the mutton keema sizzler and garlic fish rice, were pretty good. On the other hand, the soup was disastrous. The chicken wings, although tasty, had not been cut into wingettes and drumettes, making it difficult to eat.
Service: The service was okay. The staff seemed courteous in general, although they didn't do much about our complaints about the soup.
Ambience: The seating was problematic, as we were always having to move the table to get out and go to the restroom. It was loud since the kitchen opened into the main dining area and staff in the kitchen were shouting out completed orders all the time.
Conclusion: I don't see myself planning to visit this place specifically but I wouldn't go so far as to avoid it. In fact, we had come here because Asia Kitchen had a long queue. In a similar situation in the future, I wouldn't mind visiting this place again.

The food was really bad. Apart from the chicken and fish pieces, the peri-peri chicken sizzler and the grilled fish sizzler was pathetic .The long island iced tea was how it is supposed to be ,nothing exceptional. The rice in the sizzler was really very bad, I felt like I wasted my money on food for the first time.
But then again trying something out of the recommended list was a mistake.

We surprisingly got this place less crowded compared to the other adjacent restaurants and cafes. Ordered 4 Chicken mini burgers, Chicken Espetada, Oreo Shake, Tangy Mango smokey molecular drink and two Bira white beers.
The Chicken mini burgers came in white, brown, red and black colors- each had a different flavor. You're supposed to choose a side with it. We chose French fries. Recommended.
The Chicken Espetada looks so tempting and is delicious. Comes with 2 regular sides of your choice. We opted for French fries (again) and Potato wedges. The fries were thicker than usual, and though properly boiled, weren't as tasty. The potato wedges were burnt to some extent. Overall, I found the dish a bit overpriced when tallied with the content.
The Tangy mango smokey molecular drink has got a strong flavor. I liked it. Recommended.
Service is fast and the staffs are cooperative.
Pocket pinch: Rs 2500

One word - HORRIBLE!!
I placed an order for 4 chicken Mini burgers. When it got delivered I found the patty is missing for all - only bread, mayo, and veggies were there. There was no chicken filling. So I tried to contact the restaurant but mailed as none one the numbers worked. Finally i took Zomato help to connect with the restaurant. Now, the person I spoke to was an absolute idiot. He told me to come and collect the party as they don‚Äôt have their own delivery system. Hence they won‚Äôt be able to help me. He also went on to say they made a mistake, and so what?! It happens and they didn‚Äôt do it outspokenly. Obviously!!!! What a mind disturbing chat I had. Finally I lost my temper and patience and was at a loss of words also. At this point in time, Zomato called me back and told me they are refunding the payment. So I got my money back..but had to settle for Maggi as it was already late and I didn‚Äôt have the patience to order anymore. Oh, the zomato delivery guy got lost and so the delivery was delayed by 20+ mins. When I tried to call him, he kept disconnecting my calls. Overall a horrible experience with Zomato also. Swiggy is way better.

After a movie in weekends we thought of visiting this place with my full family. The first thing I liked is the ambience, loud DJ was playing in the restaurant and it was awesome. We ordered 4 cocktails, 1 starter and 1 main course.
Cocktails:
Kala khatta‚Äî not good
Tequila sunrise - good
Cosmopolitan - good
Whiskey sour - good

Chicken wings starter 9 piece- good
Peri-peri family meal - similar to above.
Total bill Rs.3451... which is quite on a higher side I must say. Overall average.

On a special day in Kolkata, we decided to ditch our regular Park Street and go somewhere different. Situated at Acropolis mall, the Barcelos is a nice joint on the top floor of the mall. The mall also has other wide range of restaurants to choose from. On a Sunday afternoon, I was quite surprised to see that the place was empty. Earlier over the call I have already told them about our reservations with the Jain food, however on reaching when I asked about the same the concerned person was quite surprised and we were only left with 2 options to choose from. However, on insisting we got help from the staff soon who checked with the chef and tried to prepare few Jain food for us. 
 
For starters we had the delicious Paneer patty served with veggies. The same was well prepared which melts in the mouth and was the best preparation. For drinks, we didn‚Äôt want to experiment anything and ordered for the simple sweet lime soda. The main course consisted of their famous chicken black burger, classic chicken burger, grilled chicken with mushroom and veggies and grilled salmon. Though there were a lot of options available still, we weren‚Äôt quite satisfied with the food. We found the burger pretty dry and the salmon was nothing extra ordinary baring the fact that the fish was soft and fresh. For the family which had few veg members, had no other option other than trying out simple Paneer prepared the same old way. 
 
Overall the experience was average, however the lady who served us later took extra care and ensured we were comfortable and was prompt too.

I had ordered flame grilled chicken, chicken drumsticks and a cheesecake brownie yesterday. 
The food was nightmarish. 
The flame grilled chicken,which is supposedly a speciallity here,was all bone and no meat. It was absolutely bland and the sauted veggies that came with it was stale and the odour was unbearable. 
The drumsticks were slightly undercooked and the meat didn't seem fresh.
The cheesecake brownie was the only good thing! 

A very bad experience.

Ordered Flame Grilled Chicken, Chicken Drumsticks & Cheesecake Brownie. To start with the good point, the cheesecake brownie is one of the best desserts ever. The drumsticks were decent.

Moving on to the rest of the meal, the entire order was COLD. Though the delivery time was 35mins due to the distance, I can pretty much say that a freshly prepared chicken cannot possibly be this cold. The house special Flame Grilled Chicken was downright tasteless and full of bones. Accompanied the dish were sauteed veggies which were stale, made evident by the strong odour straight out of the box. The French Fries were cold and without any hints of salt. The drumsticks were decent but couldn't save the mood after the massive dislike generated already.

It was a massive letdown.

It's been more than one year and I still remember this place very fondly. Located at the top floor of the Acropolis Mall by the RB Avenue connector, this floor is the Holy Grail for food lovers, Barcelos is one of the flag bearers of European cuisine. You should get a seat here as it has ample seating capacity. We started with 1/2 chicken wings and the orange and clove sangria and the traditional Portuguese sangria. The chicken was very juicy and had the right combination of flavour and spices. The Portuguese sangria wasn't all the good strictly by the taste, the orange sangria was a bit better.
In the main course we ordered Chicken Espedata and
2 mutton and 1 chicken burger combos with Mashed potato sides. The Espedata is a visual treat and we got busy clicking pics from the moment it arrived on the table. It tastes fabulous as well with the bell peppers, the mashed potatoes and the Mayo, ohh just mouth watering stuff. The mutton burgers next were amazing as well and so was their speciality black burger, it was so good that you can go there just to sample their burgers.
All in all we had a wonderful dining experience and it has been our loss to not revisit this one in the last 1 year.

Usually people go to Barcelos to have the black burger or other Portugese exotica. However, yesterday we went at the dinner time, so I wanted to have something wholesome. I ordered the Lamb chops. They were grandly sumptuous in quantity and were served with exotic veggies and khus khus, making it healthy too. 
I was also pleasantly surprised at the variety of sangrias they served.

Not sure if it's devil's boon or seraph's bane that I'd landed in this place, unplanned, at all. Overpriced & apt rated, the place is highly roomy(even has outdoor seating, which isn't really needed IMO) with scattered focus lights. The ambience and decor exuding woody notes is really a plus, with a bonus view of Gitanjali stadium if you manage to sit by the glass window panes in the innermost tier, specially at night when the lampposts lit up the stadium grass under stary sky. Albeit, I'm buffaloed by the interior Portugese charm, it's to note how the protagonist viz the dishes performed.
Black Burger: Main striker, served with a regular sides of your pick.
Idk how they make it black tho', by charring it or something. It doesn't affect the taste, rest assured. It was a solid, unadulterated chicken burger deserving a good deal of score.
Flames grilled peri-peri 1/2 chicken: Okay, not a good decision tbh. The flaming wasn't proper rendering the chicken deficiently tenderzied egressing those chewy results. The three sapid sauces don't help at all, meat is practically just buttered, salted, peppered. The mashed potato was blander than usual. The purpose of it is to counteract the richness of the associated main course, yet it stood out for its OTT dullness. As a consequence, we were saturated with the chunky piece of chicken, staring at us. It was tiresome, to speak for the fact.
Blueberry Cheesecake: I believe overpriced dishes should produce such a taste that doesn't make me regret a penny I've invested on it. Kudos, it's just balancing on a wire if I scale. A rigid cheesecake is rare but hey things exist to surprise us. The ice cream topped with a petty cream biscuit was another turn off.

3.6 from me at max. Oh they even charge 10% service tax. Not really inclined towards a second visit, but if I do it'd be to show peeps the idea of a black and a red burger.

Order : Chicken liver with port roll.

Comment : Although Barcelos is known for its peri peri chicken and burgers with buns of uncommon colours, I had chicken liver with port roll at the Baecelos counter (at Ahare Bangla). The port roll is a sweet (with a tinge of garlic) bun while the chicken liver was cooked in what seemed to be a pasinda curry. At 90 bucks, this combo was a winner.

Food : 4.5/5

I had been to the Barcelos in Delhi, so had great expectations from the restaurant. I really love their juicy and spicy burgers. 

However, this outlet was disappointing. I ordered black veg burger - it was not hot at all - rather cold. Further, it was quite dry and bland unlike the juicy one i expected. Overall, the place was disappointing.

The port roll is a sweet (with a tinge of garlic) bun while the chicken liver was cooked in what seemed to be a pasinda curry. At 90 bucks, this combo was a winner.

Food : 4.5/5
Ambience : 4/5
Price : 3.5/5

I had been to the Barcelos in Delhi, so had great expectations from the restaurant. I really love their juicy and spicy burgers. 

However, this outlet was disappointing. I ordered black veg burger - it was not hot at all - rather cold. Further, it was quite dry and bland unlike the juicy one i expected. Overall, the place was disappointing.

Barcelos provides you with an extremely comfortable  atmosphere. The interior is very nicely decorated. They offer a Portuguese special and grilled menu. However there weekdays lunch menu which starts from 12p.m.- 4p.m. is the most cost friendly with a complete food course. Truly impressed.

The outer appearance reflects an upmarket joint and so do the prices, but, not the taste....Truth be told!!!!
For a couple of craft beer (1 free with 1), virgin mojito, kebab platter & cheesy chicken wrap, shelled out ‚Çπ1,611/-
If you ask me as to whether the "squeeze was worth the juice" when it comes to quality/taste vs price tags.... Definitely no!!
The food menu wasn't that very comprehensive/varied either....
So with all the polish/lighting/attempted razzmatazz 3/5 is all that could be spared....

I had been yearning to hop into Barcelos from quite some time. Finally visited the place today. And what a disappointment it was! The ambience is good. Other than that there seems to be an issue with almost everything. We ordered a Portuguese sangria n a mint cooler which were decent. I also ordered their popular Black burger which like other reviews I'll also say was dry and tough. Another house speciality that we went for waa Chicken picantte. Well this had major issues. Firstly it's mentioned in the menu that you can oder any 2sides of ur choice. Bt the waiter played smart and placed 2 sides of his own choice. We gt those changed however. Secondl, the dish is supposed to have stuffed cheese inside the chicken. It took us great efforts to figure out the little taste of cheese inside. On top, the chicken was dry and very bland.
Then the dessert. We ordered molten dark chocolate. Man Barcelos deserves a negative marking for this. They charge a whopping rs.275 to serve a tiny chocolate cupcake(the molten chocolate was negligible) and one scoop of chocolate icecream. Seriously u'll cheat like this? And finally the bill. Even in a scenario where we're paying GST, these ppl add service charge in the bill which we refused to pay. Overall a horrible experience. Definitely nt going back!

I was very satisfied to see Portuguese food being served up in Kolkata. Combined with it's perfect ambiance, welcoming staff and over the top menu, it is one place you would definately not want to miss. 

We tried the black pepper chicken steak and the classic buffalo steak. I must say that I was a bit disappointed upon seeing the cut of the steak served. I was definately expecting a better cut. But the quality waa perfect. You should definately try the different sauces with your barbeque or steaks. All are promisingly intriguing and unique.

I ordered their famous black mutton burger in mild peri-peri flavour with a side of wedges while chilling at a friend's place.

Frankly,the burger was a huge disappointment.The most distinctive thing about the patty was that it didn't taste like chicken.On the flip side it didn't taste like a beautifully done patty of red meat either.

The wedges were the best part of the meal.

The burger was not at all value for money.At 405+copious amounts of taxes(for dine-in), it's a big no-no.

I'll have to try their chicken cheese espetada and famous grilled chicken to nail down a final verdict.Until then, it is what it is.

The quality and taste of food is fine. Quantity is really low and price is too much. Initially the name of the restaurant became popular but it's reputation is decreasing. It's a one time visit restaurant according to me.

American dining in Acropolis Mall, Barcelos provides all the essentials for a decent fast food experience.. ranging from burgers to pastas.. from cocktails to desserts.. it consists of a lot of varieties.. we ordered a 4 burger combo.. we replaced the black one with a red one.. and a couple of beers.. without doubting the quality which was on point.. quantity should be taken care of considering the worth.. Barcelos used to serve adequate quantity when it was new.. maybe a marketing strategy, but that has declined since then !
All in all, a happy experience! üòä

Rarely do I rate a restaurant a 5 or a 4.5, but Barcelos deserves a 4.5 from at least me because I was content with the food, and I only give high ratings when I'm content and satisfied. Barcelos did not fail to impress or amaze me with its good food.

The restaurant's located on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall and easy to locate. It's popular for its Middle Eastern cuisine and delicious fast food such as their famous Black Burger. The decor consists of murals of global maps, historical European street scenes, sketches etc; a smoking booth's also available.

We were given a separate Chef's special menu, a Portuguese menu and a drinks menu. We opted for the Chicken Espetada, a Portuguese hanging dish made of skewed chicken thighs, onions and peppers, accompanied with one's choice of any two regular sides. The server served the chicken on our plates from the hanging skewer, and one of the attendants was willingly kind enough to take our photographs along with the dish. 

The chicken morsels were extremely delicious, even though I'd chosen them to be non-spicy (one can also go for spicy). The potato wedges and French fries that I'd selected for the sides were fresh, crisp and very tasty dipped in the equally delish dip. One can also utilise the Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri or Super Peri sauces provided at the table. 

In a nutshell, Barcelos is one of those rare places that has won my heart. Would definitely like to revisit to perhaps try their Peri Peri Chicken or the burger. :)

Barcelos is located on the top most floor of the acropolis mall in kasba. We had gone there for dinner.
The ambience is good. The seating arrangements are cozy and the staffs are friendly and helpful. The walls are decorated with pictures of european lifesyles, overlooking the gitanjali stadium its quite a pleasure to dine and enjoy the view.
As for the food we had ordered the famous chicken black burger, grilled fish sizzler, chicken peri peri , blue lagoon, cheese cake, brownie shake and budweiser premium.
We really hard great expectations for the black burger but unfortunately its wasnt upto our expectations. It was good to taste but the bun was quite tough and dry.
Chicken peri peri was good. The portions were quite large and well cooked and tender.
The best was the grilled fish sizzler . It was made of basa fish and was soft and juicy and really of good taste.
The blue lagoon and budweiser were standard drinks.
As for the brownie shake, it was quite refreshing and tasty.
Finally the desert, blueberry cheesecake. It was really great. The cheesecake was topped with blue berry nd the botton was a buiscuit base. Also it was accompanied by strawberry ice cream. The desert was really worth the money.

To sum it up.. its a good restaurant , a bit on the costlier side but a nice place to relax and enjoy with friends.
Ps- they also charge a 10% service charge.

Visited this place with family and friends. To start with, the look and feel of the place is cozy and casual. The staff is friendly and courteous and the food arrived in a jiffy. They have an interesting Portuguese menu for cocktails and dishes. 
The only drawback I faced at this place was the fact that they don't have a washroom inside the restaurant. One must use the Acropolis mall washrooms which are a bit of a walk from the restaurant. But that's not much of a snag.
Over-all a great experience. Would visit again.

I have become a fan after my 1st visit. This place is way better than chilli's and less crowded which means no waiting time. There space gives off a warm feeling and is airy. It is unlike the american diner experience of congested seating and gaudy decor. There special treat are the 30 odd flavors of sangria. For a wine cocktail fan this is heaven. Service is prompt and may i say very discrete. They do not pester u to order or finish ur meal or try to whisk away ur half finished food. The herb fried chicken was delicious, onion ring turned out to be a bit of a dampner as a few of the rings had a bitter after taste. The red wine and white wine sangria on buy 2 get 1 offer more than made up for the dissapointment of the onion rings. Best to take recommendations from your server for the order. We enjoyed the simple fussili pasta in red sauce with chicken. We were plesantly surprised by complimentary dessert of house ice cream -coconut n paan flavour. Both delicious. I would highly recommend them for their food variety and beverages and their ambience and decor.

Located on the top of Acropolis mall, this has the potential to be a gem of a place.

Ambience: One of the most well thought of decors with lighting which sets the mood. Comfortable seating.

Staff: Very prompt service. Staffs has fair knowledge of what they are serving. At times, too much prompt, which i will mention next.

Food: We had ordered grilled chicken as the place is famous for the same. At the time we visited, their much talked about sangria was not available as they had not obtained the liquor license at that time.
All the four sauces tasted great with the chicken. Beverages were also good.
One down side was they served our mains even before we were half way to our starters. As a result the mains got cold. When we said the same to the waiters, they just didn't have a solution. That was not desirable at all.

Overall: A thumbs up for the food, price is on the higher side. Longing to taste their sangria soon. Deserves at least one visit!

Frankly speaking we went there with high expectation and were highly disappointed. Firstly, the people who were serving there were very casual, they did not even offered us water and not even the menu card until we asked for it. We ordered burger platter, but they served it without dips and chips, somebody else came and added this after it was already served. Another item was there of rice and vegetables with Fish. Fish was good, but vegetables were not fresh. Not really want to go back there again. :(

We ordered Chicken drumsticks, Peri Peri Paneer and Flame Grilled Peri Peri Chicken.
The food was disappointing. Hardly average, and grossly overpriced for the quality. The staff was, well, disturbing to say the least. Untrained and too intrusive. Inefficient with orders. We didn't dare to order anything more, fearing that it would be a waste of money. The bill was already high.

Situated on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall, Kasba. Its a pretty well decored and peaceful place with nice ambiance. I liked their detailing on the wall decors and furnitures. The bar is well stocked. They even have a smoking zone. Now lets come to the food. Food is above average, I would not say its great but pretty good but not upto the price that they charge. We ordered Chicken Wings, Grilled Basa Fish & Beer. I would suggest them to improve their service quality as it was below average. The service person dont even know how to pour beer from a pitcher to a beer mug as he filled it with froth! Moreover its a nice place to be with family and close ones though on a bit costlier side. You guys can try it out atleast once.

The look and feel of the restaurant was quite similar to that of Nando's. But taste wise not even close. We were a group of 3 people and ordered a half chicken grilled platter with potato wedges and spicy rice as the sides and 2 mocktails. Firstly, the star of the dish ,grilled chicken was not the star at all. It was overcooked,hard and tasteless. Taste was just ok. Sides were ok too. But the mocktails were awesome. We tried the mango one and the Kolkata special. Forgot the names unfortunately. Price was way too high for the quality they serve.Handwash area should have been there since it's a grill chicken speciality restaurant and I think using fork and knife for eating drumsticks is quite adventurous but that's my opinion . After going through reviews we decided to try this place. If you already love Nando's food don't expect this to be any alternative. Its nowhere near close in terms of taste and portion.

Still I have some observation after my 2nd time visit :
1. Please try some different type of peri sauce or may be some new one for Chicken wings,its sound bit monopoly for using same type sauce there also.

2. Didn't able to differentiate between VERI PERI & SUPA PERI for 1/2 Chicken section.

3. Billing- Did you really realized that it will impact on your rating after couple weeks of GST implementation. Why you guys generated the bill with SERVICE TAX after having the GST already in the bill!! I have found many comments with same things. When I have had a look on the Bill i found same issue and after complaining it was a new bill again. This is found very bad .

Otherwise again it was a great experience and will have more.

Barcelos, the very name intrigued me to visit the place. It was a long time plan finally made it. We ordered the Tenderloin steak and the chicken peri peri steak. The meat was very well prepared for the Tenderloin steak and was bang on medium rare. It was one of the best done steak I have had till date. The meat was juicy and the sauce was pretty tasty and went well with the mashed potato and broccoli. The chicken steak had a very unique taste, tangy and spicy and a first time for me. Personally I did not like it much but it's worth a shot.

When most restaurants in Acropolis have waiting lines & the food court chairs are all occupied, you are almost certain to find seats at Barcelos. It's the cornermoat restaurant near the lift on the top floor of Acropolis mall. 
There's a seating area outside as well.

Went there twice during Durga Puja & did not face troubles getting a seat. The decor is decent.

I found it a bit weird that the staff would be hearing your conversation and would feel free to chip in. Sorry, but we don't want any eavesdropping.

Didnt eat much here - quick bites only. French fries with dip was decent. Tiramisu, although small in portion tasted alright. 

They restaurant serves mocktails with Liquid Nitrogen Dioxide, commonly called as Dry-ice effect. I may be wrong, but sich drinks looks fraught with risk to me. Suggest not to touch/sip till it stops steaming.

OVER-HYPED. OVERPRICED. BAD FOOD. UNPROFESSIONALLY RUDE STAFF.

I'm not sure if my experience had been affected by the fact that I visited during the Pujas. However, there was no queue or any kind of rush whatsoever which could serve as an excuse for the food & service this bad.

Most of the tables were empty and there were hardly more than 15 customers at the time of our visit.
Our attendant was so unprofessional. He made a mistake in our order - We had ordered 1/2 Flame Grilled Peri Peri Chicken (2 pcs) and he had brought the full one (4 pcs). On pointing it out, he rudely argued with us and said we never asked for 1/2. We still asked if any adjustments could be made as we had also ordered a White Sauce Chicken Penne Pasta and 4 Mini Burgers and there were only 2 of us. But he bluntly refused.

Coming to the food part, if this is the kind of food they generally serve then this place is so over-hyped!

‚Ä¢ Hated the Peri Peri Grilled Chicken. I'm not having it ever again.. not even for free.
‚Ä¢ The pasta was, one word, HORRIBLE. You call that tasteless stuff white sauce penne? I've had bad pastas but this was by far the worst! No seasoning, no SALT! What's wrong with you guys?
‚Ä¢ Mini Burgers were still edible. French Fries were not given to us with the burgers. No idea why! Instead something that looked like mash but turned out to be some dry breadcrumb-like tasteless stuff was served.
Also, we were served the Red, Black and two Brown Burgers. Instead of one White. However, the two tasted different. I guess they were out of white buns so they replaced it with the regular ones (picture attached).

Had we wanted to argue with that rude attendant again, we would've complained. But we didn't see any point and were too tired to be complaining about each and everything. Hugely disappointing!

The price is so high and for this quality of food and service? I regret visiting this place ever. Never coming back. Not even in my nightmares!

After movie, it is my booze place. Let's enter have a cocktail or some beer and gone.

I went twice. 1st day to resolve my burger carving next day to keep calm my meaty madness.

Cinnamon Apple Santeria with 4 mini burgers.

They looks colourful and base bun prepared from different sources of ingredients like cocoa (black) , coconut (white), tomato (red) etc. Good and tasty with tangy pineapple twist. Little bit over pricy.

Next day I kept it simple. Two White Bira (295) affordable.
One herb spice chicken fried (no taste of herbs, oily, hard, chewy)
And then Chicken Picantte( chicken breast roll stuffed with lots of cheese, obviously different kind of cheese mixed in the stuffing. Great place to hang out. They include service charge in the bill, both of the times I told them to exclude. They politely removed it. Service was fast. Little less attaintive staffs.

Neway i will definitely go next time.

Worst experience ever.The  grilled chicken was so so but none of the sides were fresh.Paella rice was not available.So we chose the spicy rice.We remember very well how flavourful it was in Nando's.Here it not only lacks any flavour but also has that unpleasant odour that we get in rice kept in the refrigerator for a very long period of time.It was so detestable.At home we just throw away when it gets that kind of unfresh smell.It also has that dry  grainy type of texture that left over rice in the fridge always has.When we pointed it out they just took it and reheated the same stuff in the microwave.The odour and grainy feel was still there as we know it is quite irreversible unless not boiled again with water.we discarded the rice ultimately.The potato wedges were the only good stuff. So when they offered any other side instead of the rice we chose that .My daughter took a one platter which came with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.Both were equally unfresh.The veggies were rubbery with no taste of any of them and mashed potatoes had that same unfresh smell of foods kept in refrigerator for a very long time.
Go there only for potato wedges...if you are such a big fan of them.
It was a weekend and although the chilies and Asia kitchen (the two other restaurants just around it in the same floor )was as crowded as we always see this one had not a single customer.we are a great fan of  Portuguese food served at Nando's and had thought  many a time  before to give this one a try.
We were a bit apprehensive seeing it without a single customer.Still we thought to give it a try to form our own opinion not being biased about external factors and the experience made our assumption true.Wished not to give any rating as  even the lowest one is showing 1.If possible I would have given it a negative rating.

They had taken our old humble chicken to a total different level altogether with their various peri peri options and with a nice exceptional menu. We had started to think what really actually possible more with chickens. Preparations are different and as we heard it is Portuguese. Well, staffs are very efficient and so so courteous. They help you most to have a great experience each time. Go there and fall in love with old chicken again. Huge and generous place to have gala time. Cocktails are up to the mark too. Highly recommended.

Undoubtedly this place was awesome,great food must try in drinks is Sangria and in food is flamed grilled peri peri chicken(spicy),crispy fried fish and stuffed potatoes with mushroom and cheese (veg non spicy). Known for different flavours of sauce ,Barcelos simply the authentic Portuguese cuisine taste which we were looking for.To add to this the ambience is absolutely amazing.Chilled out place to hang out with friends or with your date ;)

Love their ambience specially the one from where we a get a clear view of geetanjali stadium , 
I must appreciate the service of this quarter is great , the people are not only warm but they are very prompt in getting your order 
Of the items I ordered special mention to the sparkling  micromolecular kiwi kooler , their speciality esperatada and the delicious mutton burgers . I must say they serve one of the best mutton burgers in town ..
In cocktails kala khatta will be the one to go for . 

All said and done the price is still on the steeper side

Absolutely loved the mutton kebab. Also ordered a spicy mango drink & black forest and absolutely loved it. Will go back for their signature dishes. Brownie point for their staff. Very courteous even if we were the last customer,they greeted and served with a smile!!!

Visited this Portuguese themed restaurant few days back. The ambience, food quality and staff service were really good. There we ordered 1 cappuccino, 1 latte, chicken espeteda (which is a hanging dish skewed with chicken thighs, I fnd it okayish, not too good and not bad either), mutton kebab sizzler (highly recommended) and for dessert we ordered dark lava meltdown and it is absolutely heavenly. Overall pocket pinch was 1750 incl GST.

I have noticed in some reviews people have mentioned about the extra 10% service charge apart from the GST. In that case all you will have to do is to tell them that you are not willing to pay this service charge (as it is optional) and they will prepare a fresh bill without it.

Terrible food. We ordered Portuguese chicken soup, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks and cheese chicken espetada. The soup was thin and bland. The mozzarella sticks had a foul smell and tasted horrible. The wings were tasteless. The cheesy chicken espetada had no cheese. The only good thing was the coke. Would not recommend this place to anyone.

Went here on navami for lunch. To be honest we wanted to go to chili's but because of the long queue there we opted for barcelos which seemed to be relatively less crowded. They gave us a waiting period of 15-20 mins and we got a table after that.
Ambience-- the decor is mainly done in wood, has dim lighting with oil paintings and gives an old European eatery kind of vibe!
Food-- we ordered the kala khatta and tequila sunrise (cocktails), herb crusted chicken and chicken espetada ( 1 of each). The drinks were great! Specially the kala khatta. It was quirky and refreshing. The herb crusted chicken was okayish nothing extraordinary. And honestly I did not find any herb flavour. Just normal crumb fried chicken.
The chicken espetada is one of their signature dishes and looks amazing! It's basically a hanging chicken skewers dish. We took spicy rice and French fries as sides for it. The chicken pieces were juicy and succulent but they did lack flavours and were quite bland. The rice quantity was very very small and tasted average.
Pocket pinch-- 1900 INR for two. They levy an extra 10% service charge apart from the 18% gst.
Overall-- keeping in mind the price they charge, I expected better food quality. But still I would give then another visit to try their famous colorful mutton burgers!

Barcelos was an experience never to be repeated. The service was good but the food was inedible. A simple pita wrap was an epic disaster. Soggy, with dry sad chicken cubes spilling onto the tray, not a hygienic way of serving, the limp lettuce and smear of taziki detracted rather than enhanced it.   
The picture says it all.

I would count Barcelos under one of the more disappointing dining experiences I‚Äôve had. 
It may be attributed to fact that it had just recently opened when I had dropped by for lunch in the middle of a shopping spree at Acropolis, as the recent reviews are not as discouraging. 
We were excited to check out the new restaurant but right from the lack of proper air conditioning to hardly any patrons- it did not give us a good start. Coming to the food, the 4 veg mini burgers dish we ordered was tasty and a good choice off an elaborate menu. The variety of hot sauces on the table added a little kick to meal as well. One observation - the name ‚Äúmini‚Äù may indicate otherwise, but the burgers were regular sized and one would be suggested to order accordingly. 
However, what cannot be ignored is the glacial pace of service and absolutely cold and stale Veg Platter that we were served. The steward was gracious enough to recall that plate of food unfit for consumption. 
The pricing is steep and the portions do not correspond to them. 
I wouldn‚Äôt willingly revisit the place anytime soon, despite the lure of a dedicated sangria menu.

As far as the essence of portugal is concerned, this place undoubtedly the best of all in town!

So on Saptami we had Flame Grilled Chicken PeriPeri, Cheesy Chicken Espatada, Chicken Picante and Chicken Trinchando Sizzler... Among all, Picante was my favourite, full of cheese; ultimate softness to go with spiced rice-yummmmmmmmm

But to review this place, I have to go catergorically

Ambience & Decor- 5/5
Service- 4.5/5
Food-3.5/5

I guess, this place needs to improve in that most important aspect compared to the pocket pinch

We ordered Grape fruit Punch , Chicken Wings , Grilled Chicken Pita and Chicken Espatada . 
The mocktail was awesome, 
Chicken wings were good but some pieces were hard.  
Grilled Chicken Pita was too much spicy, but tasted good.
Chicken Espatada was also good but they do not have anything extra ordinary in taste other than the grape fruit punch .
Service was good though . They charge 28% tax . (Service tax+ gst)

Chicken is something its very easy to prepare but a little lack of precision can ruin the plate. Well if you fonder perfectly cooked chicken, juicy and fleshy you are looking at the right place.

Before getting down to the numbers, let me highlight some special dishes :-

I must recommend the ,

1. Chicken espetada. 

2. Peri Peri chicken (one half with skin)

3. Also, the deserts are painted in the plate, with a delicate palate.

(I am not kidding check the images)

Like Tiramisu, Cheese Cake...

Lets start with the hard part :-

A judge of the palates :- 5/5

Chicken is perfectly cooked. Skins crispy on the outside juicy in-side not too fall-off not too dry. 

They have specialties in highly technical dishes. Which i appreciate hats of to the chef.

A hunger of sight :- 5/5

Plating is marvelous. I am simply awed by the plating of there deserts especially.

Very simple but elegant.

A judge of the environment :- 5/5

A perfect roadside view of ancient Europe. Will make you feel that you are sitting amidst a busy street of Portugal.

A judge by the pocket :- 3.5/5

Its a bit expensive. But i will buy it.

I definitely, recommend this place.  

Ohh... wait a minute, did i mention the Brownie on Ice-cream.¬†
No I forgot... :P

I really like the ambiance and service...pocket pinch is reasonable too but Barcelos has a long way to go when it comes to food. The old menu was good and the new one is impressive too. However, the taste of the food failed to satisfy the taste buds. 

We had ordered a Chicken soup, Penne pasta in white sauce, Herb crusted fish and Mozzarella sticks. 

The chicken soup smelled slightly of raw chicken. The mazzarella sticks had so less cheese that they looked hollow with no filling. The quantity of white sauce in the pasta was disappointing and the dish tasted bland. The herb crusted fish tasted okay though.

Had high hopes about this place but was disappointed. Hopefully they will work on their culinary skills.

Had wanted to visit Barcelos for a long time and finally did so for a Saturday lunch. We were seated in a comfortable spot overlooking the Gitanjali Stadium. The ambiance is good. The staff were extremely hospitable and polite. The service is prompt & professional. 
5/5 for the cheerful and accommodating staff. 
5/5 for ambiance & decors
4/5 for overall food experience. We ordered the following :
Lemon Chicken Portuguese soup - 3/5

Non veg kebab platter - 2/5 it was too hot & spicy and had us literally crying because of its rich spices. An unexpectedly disappointing starter thus. We then explicitly told them to make the rest of the dishes LESS SPICY. 

Garlic butter fish-5/5 this dish was cooked to perfection in all the items-rice, veggies and fish. 

Cheese chicken espateda- 3.5/5 this was their signature hanging dish with fries & colesaw. The chicken kebabs tasted good but the chicken was a bit chewy

Full Chicken - 5/5 this was the best dish according to me.4 Absolutely well cooked tender chicken peices, each portion was a big chunk of solid grilled chicken. Very fulfilling and thumbs up for this item. 

Chicken picantte- 5/5 this was another of their tasty signature dish...consisting of thick solid chicken wrapping up a  cheesy filling. Very well cooked and nicely presented with sides grilled veggies & wedges. 

Molecular drinks- 3.5/5  top class presentation, tastewise okay not so awesome. Hey rosy had ice in excess

Presentation & food garnishing-5/5

Overall a nice and food indulgent weekend experience. The ambiance & pleasant staff hospitality are worth mentioning .Prices are bit on the higher side. I would want to revisit, for their grilled chicken peri peri dish. However if you are visiting for the first time  do mention your level of spicy quotient. Too much or too less may spoil the taste.

"Barcelos" - this Portuguese themed restaurant was residing in my wishlist since ages and after hell lot of hindrance I finally made a landing in the deliciousness. 
Instead of adding some more adjectives to the decor of the restaurant or describing about how conveniently this is positioned , let me jump straight to my and everyone's point of interest 'FOOD'. 
Enticed by the ecstatic reviews of their Peri Peri specialities, we ordered 
#Peri Peri Chicken Wings - 4 moderately sized chicken wings were served in a black platter. They were spiced up to exactly what we instructed the attendant. They were juicy, delicious and satisfactory to our taste buds. A great start for the evening. 
Next we ordered :
#Mini burgers 2 chicken 2 mutton with french fries and mashed potatoes - This multi-coloured platter was a bloom to eyes and gloom to taste. They were nothing but ordinary and quite bland union of meat-lettuce-bread & sauce, though the mutton ones were a bit better than the chickens. Mashed potatoes also lacked the creaminess. A bad end of a good start. 

Overall, an okayish experince. Although, I would love to visit this place again and try out some other dishes to change my conception. 

P.S. I noticed in some reviews that people were complaining about charging an extra service charge alongside GST. All you have to do is tell them that you're not willing to pay the service charge and they'll issue a fresh bill omitting the charge. üòä

We're kind of in a fix trying to write down the experience here; it was definitely not bad, but at the same time, failed to leave a mark. The decor and service is par excellence, but the food was somewhat barely average. We had:

1. Barcelos Special Peri Peri Chicken - 2.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[The breast piece could have been a little kore tender (though the waiter did his best to make us understand that the meat breast piece is always tougher than the leg piece). The sauce was more superficial, and the meat inside was bland meat. The mash would have done with a little more butter]

2. Lamb Chops - 2.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Again, the dish was pretty bland or "incomplete" the moment the barbecue sauce gets cleaned off the meat. It was a lot of peas (as sides) compared to the amount of meat]

3. Oreo shake - 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Vanilla ice cream made the shake thicker in consistency, but still failed to hit the spot. Still better than many oreo shakes around town]

The decor and service is a definite 5‚≠êÔ∏è. Though they charged a 10% Service Charge on the bill, we liked the fact that the personnel attending the table quickly acknowledged it being "optional" (on pointing it out), and presented us with a fresh bill without service charge. 

Overall, I'd say the place is a tad bit pricy compared to the quality of food being served. The only thing worth there would be the bottomless beverage, where a glass of cold drink, purchased once, can be refilled unlimited time. A 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è, just above average experience.

Reading a lot rave reviews about their peri peri speciality, landed here on a weekend.
Hospitality was very top notch but well it was a little cold, the centralised ac literally froze us where we sat down, near their famous street painted wall.
Menu has a lot of specialities and they boast of being the 1st sangria bar in the country.
Ordered their featured molecular kiwi cooler, the catch being dry ice making it smoke on ur table. Starter was a light peach chicken salad, light, sweet with lettuce and eggs and chicken, cleansed the palate, set the mood.
Followed by was the lamb chops which was the best dish of the day served with couscous and peas side, the lamb was succulent and easy while the couscous filled you. Next was the peri peri chicken sizzler which although being their favourite really put me off,served with non descript yellow rice, the veggies were downright near to burned and not at all flavour, the chicken rolls were again a downer, under seasoned. Hoped for a better sizzler.
The table had these four bottles of peri peri in varying degrees, it saved the day at this point.
The biggest downer then was the billing which after GST we thought includes the service charges. Not only did they charge that extra service charge, their was this extra beverage charge although the only thing consumed was a non alcoholoc kiwi cooler. Taxes of over 500 bucks really pinchs your pocket.
Well it was one expensive meal for the taxes but kudos to the service team, you were excellent.

Today on my birthday I had my lunch with my girlfriend at this restaurant which was long in my wish list.
First of all the ambience is amazing.One will definitely fall in love with the ambience instantly.
We tasted garlic basa fish with rice ,along with peri peri 1\4 chicken and the signature chicken espeteda.
Chicken espeteda:The showstopper of today.We opt for french fries with mayo dip and herb rice as two sides among the 4 side dishes available as option.Hanging skewer in front of you.Wat else you need.It tasted awesome.Absolutely delicious.Chicken pieces were a bit hard but they were perfectly cooked with right amount of spice.This dish is a highly recommended absolutely a must try.
1/4 th chicken:The only dissapointing dish of today.Chicken portion was very much chewy and it was not at all good.Lacked proper seasoning.
Grilled fish with rice:Basa fish was cooked to perfection.It had right amount of crust and it was succulent and soft from inside.It was served along with rice and grilled veggies.This dish is also highly recommended.
Coming to staffs they are very much friendly and helpful.Chicken espeteda was redone by the staffs as it become a bit cool as we were busy in finishing other dish.
Conclusion:-
Ambience:4.5/5
Staffs:5/5
Food:3.8/5
Quantity:3.5/5
Price is a bit on the higher side.
Overall a very good restaurant to have date.

A nice place to chill on a summer noon, to make yourself warm on a winter evening and to feel the romance of a rainy afternoon. A wide view of the Gitanjali Stadium through its glass wall gives it an added glamour. You will surely fall in love with Portuguese food here.

1. Black Pepper Chicken
2.Chicken Trinchando Sizzler
3.Grape juice
4. Caipiroska (Vodka cocktail)

we booked here through Dineout app to take advantage of few offers that were provided to us. we had a nice experience here. being vegetarian our menu option was little curtailed but whatever we tried and had like kebab sizzler , pasta in white sauce and trinchado with rice were well prepared and served fresh. the servers were courteous and efficient. all in all a nice sunday lunch . would surely recommend. meal for 3 would cost 1200 incl taxes and service charges.

Good food and great place to visit for a long chat with friends. The cocktails are especially worth mentioning. Located in Acropolis, the place boasts of a large place. The backs of the chairs are not so comfortable. You may want to sit on the sofa to avoid the chairs. I loved the peri peri chicken. The taste was great. For mains, we ordered the chicken sizzler with humus and tenderloin steak. An unusual combination, the humus went perfectly with the continental chicken sizzler.¬†
I am docking off one point for the value for money quotient but I understand that the location is giving the price.

I visited this place yesterday for a light snacks since I had heard about their very unique concept of colourful burgers.
Unfortunately I was highly disappointed with the food.
We had ordered a black burger and a red burger along with potato wedges and grilled vegetables. The black burger was extremely dry. The red burger was better in that respect. But what turned me off completely was the chicken inside. It was extremely stiff and chewy. Even the grilled vegetable salad wasn't up to the mark as the baby corn had dried up. The only good thing were the potato wedges as they were really crunchy and hot and went very well with the dip.
The ambience was good. The place wasn't crowded at all hence we got our seats as soon as we entered.
The only plus point was the prompt and efficient service. 
The place is indeed overpriced and the food not at all worth the money.

My experience in Barcelos was a good one. I liked their food. I had a grilled chicken which was perfectly done and succulent along with a chicken starter that had olives inside them. We went  during the full day happy hour on Monday and I got a 1:1 on the pitcher of beer that we ordered so it was total value for money. The ambience was nice and the space is large. My one complaint, and the reason for the drop in rating, was that the AC was not cool enough.

Food was ok. Service ok too.. There are better continental restaurants in town. Everything can be accepted, atleast follow the taxation laws! This is nothing but cheating!

Went for lunch with my friend... The ambience and the set up is nice.. The restaurant was almost empty..The staffs were well mannered.. The food menu is quite good and attractive. We ordered for a Chicken and pears salad, it was good not that great because the dressing was not that prominent maybe the balsamic was little less if added a few drops more the taste would have been different. The Black Burger and the Red Burger was good, the breads were fresh, but the cocktails were overpriced in terms of the quantity. Overall the experience was nice except for one thing, nowadays when GST has been implemented then why "10% SERVICE CHARGE"??? I mean what for?? That needs to be removed.. or else everything was nice.....
There can be a second visit only if SERVICE CHARGE is omitted...

Had a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with some authentic Portuguese dishes. I can not comment much about the authenticity but food quality is not bad, quantity is bit less. The stuffs are helpful and courteous, interior is pretty attractive. Chicken olive and Trinchado rice was really different. Overall it is good experience, would like to try some of their other items too in future.

We had ordered the non beg platter,  spaghetti with meatballs and fish grill. Like the food. A bit on the higher side,  so picket pinch is sizeable.

The place just made the day better! The moment I walked in it felt great.. A sigh of relief!  The place looks just perfect.. It has three different sections for seating. Coming to the food, we ordered Herb crusted chicken, Chicken wings and Cheesy chicken Espetada. The first one was something not very usual and tasted good with just the required amount of crispness. Chicken wings could have been a little more juicy though it was good for a go.  The last one just took my heart away! The perfect blend of chicken cheese and kabab was the Espetada. It is often called the hanging dish and the name justified. One should definitely give it a try.  Service was great and courteous.  The only thing which brought a mark of may be a bad impression was the extra service charge which was levied on the bill despite GST.  One doesn't expect that from such a dignified place. Though on lodging a complain we were produced a new bill with just GST. 
Thank you :)

Having had a place like Nando's on my favourites list, i went in with high expectations only to be disappointed to a great extent. Normally i would order a chicken espetada but this one rare occasion i had to go vegetarian and ordered the veg one instead.. came with two gigantic cubes of paneer that simply had no flavour or spice inside but was just a big block of bland paneer. The burgers were served with the espetada so by the time we had that, it was cold. More so the breads, though of interesting colour felt seemingly dry. The the chicken burger had no patty in it but just a slice of chicken.Last time i checked, burger joints served burgers with patty and didn't go Mc or KFC on them.  Peri peri sauces have spicy flavour and are generally thick in texture.. these however, too liquidy and felt off for some reason. The kit ka·π≠ shake was nice however. Over all, not so satisfied.

So this review actually combines snippets from my visit here twice. I visited Barcelos first sometime in 2016, shortly after it opened up at Acropolis. Barcelos is one of the less crowded restaurants at Acropolis and it's truly amazing that people haven't really opened up to the idea of Portuguese and African cuisine yet. Kolkata serves a myriad of cuisines and we can certainly accommodate Portuguese and African in that list. 
The decor is simple and chic, the restaurant gives you a sense of space where you can hang around with your friends for a while. 
Now the fare served here relies largely on a selection of Portuguese sauces, namely Peri Peri sauce. They shuttle between four varieties if peri peri. The mild peri peri is do-able; I tasted the hot ones and they can surely burn your lips. The food served here uses one of the four sauces and the spice quotient is well explained by the servers. 
We have tried the chicken salad (it was plain boring), chicken breast and Peri Peri Black Magic Burger during our first visit. The chicken breast came with a side of grilled veggies (my health conscious friend opted for it). The chicken breast was tender, moist and nicely done. The clear winner however, was the burger. The burger consisted of a thick breast of grilled chicken done with moderately hot peri peri sauce, egg, mayo, cheese and pineapple wrapped in a par of fancy looking black buns. The burger was yummilicious. The accompanying fries were crunchy and complimented the burger well. The dinner ended with Tiramisu, but truth be told, I have had much better Tiramisu elsewhere. 
The second visit was more to get chilled beer post a Saturday work out. The food ordered were Chicken Espeteda and Chicken Trinchando Sizzler. The Espeteda is a fancy looking dish with hanging skewers of chicken, bell peppers and onions, served with two sides (you can choose your sides). Frankly, it's quite akin to a chicken kebab stick available at some Indian restaurants and save the fancy presentation, there's little wow factor involved. However, the sizzler was a stunner. There were three decent sized chicken breast pieces, served with rice, veggies and a sauce. The sauce was superb; I can go back simply for the sauce. The chicken was nicely coated in all the spices which lend the chicken a quite delectable flavour. The dish is a far cry from the sizzler served at Park Street and it certainly needs to be tried once. It can truly excite you. 
Service is decent, a tad bit slow though. The prices are moderate and the place can give you a welcome respite if you are tried of having Fajitas or Oriental at the neighbouring restaurants.

This place is a close imitation of one of my favorite fire grill places to eat Chicken with Peri Peri sauce..... you guessed it right "Nandos"!! It was a good experience with a nice ambience and food wasn't pricey too. I don't know somehow I keep comparing this place with "Nandos", although I try real hard not to. Their Peri Peri sauces are good but it definitely can be better. Overall a nice place to eat your fire grilled chicken with some beer on a Friday night.

It's always great to be here!! I have been twice here and intend to visit more to try all that they have to serve.

Chicken Espetada : we ordered French fries and spicy rice as the two side dishes with it. It was lovely. The skewed chickens were tender and delicious.

Chicken picantte : this was a chicken breast and it had a filling. Side's that we ordered were mashed potatoes and fried veggies. This was yummy and tad dry, not on the juicy side.

Fish skewers: a total of five fish chunks were served with a dip. This was finger licking good.

For drinks we had ordered beer and appletini..
Appletini is a vodka that they served with lime and Apple juice. I loved it very much.

Located in Acropolis mall,Barcelos is a restaurant which specialises in portuguese and continetal food.We had heard a lot about this place so we ended up visiting it for lunch one day, we ordered the famous chicken mini burgers which are a platter of coloured (red,white,black,brown) mini burgers which are flavourful and served with fries.The 4 mini burgers along with the fries were quite filling for two of us,for drinks we ordered the Kiwi Cooler which was a perfect spectacle of molecular gastronomy with all of the liquid nitrogen and tasted equally refreshing and then came the five ingredient sangria which was also very attractive and flavourful.
The atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasing and a part of the seating offers a city view and the decor is also impressive with a smoking room resembling the london phone booth and the world map on the wall.The only drawback I found was that the staff were not at all well informed about the current offers and were quite clumsy.

Chicken Espetada : we ordered French fries and spicy rice as the two side dishes with it. It was lovely. The skewed chickens were tender and delicious.

Chicken picantte : this was a chicken breast and it had a filling. Side's that we ordered were mashed potatoes and fried veggies. This was yummy and tad dry, not on the juicy side.

Fish skewers: a total of five fish chunks were served with a dip. This was finger licking good.

For drinks we had ordered beer and appletini..
Appletini is a vodka that they served with lime and Apple juice. I loved it very much.

Great ambience.. Food is good.. The staff are polite but the only thing that needs to be improved is the waiting time.. My first experience and not a good one. Had to wait for a very long time till the food was served... Rest all was good... Keep up the good quality of food.

Ambience is good but the food is seriously not worth it. A lot of hype . I ordered a burger with pulled chicken. It wasn't good.. Ordered some boneless chicken dish which wasn't tender

Located in Acropolis mall,Barcelos is a restaurant which specialises in portuguese and continetal food.We had heard a lot about this place so we ended up visiting it for lunch one day, we ordered the famous chicken mini burgers which are a platter of coloured (red,white,black,brown) mini burgers which are flavourful and served with fries.The 4 mini burgers along with the fries were quite filling for two of us,for drinks we ordered the Kiwi Cooler which was a perfect spectacle of molecular gastronomy with all of the liquid nitrogen and tasted equally refreshing and then came the five ingredient sangria which was also very attractive and flavourful.
The atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasing and a part of the seating offers a city view and the decor is also impressive with a smoking room resembling the london phone booth and the world map on the wall.The only drawback I found was that the staff were not at all well informed about the current offers and were quite clumsy.

This is one of the best pplaces for meat lovers.... I have tried both the fish and chicken items.  Grilled fish is too good.  Any steak is better than any other place. Really a place to visit again and again

Introduction of Sangria and New food items at Barcelos!

This was the second time I was attending a bloggers meet at Barcelos (Kolkata) over food tasting session. I missed the sizzler launch tasting session few months back for some unavoidable reasons. But this time it was tad different from the previous food tasting session which I attended, since here we dealt with Sangrias, something which very few can ignore! The Kolkata outlet of Barcelos¬†has recently acquired their permanent¬†liquor¬†license. And they have decided to up their game by adding not one but twenty one new flavors of¬†Sangria. I was privileged to be among the very few city bloggers who got a chance to preview this launch. We were shown the art of Sangria making and we tasted some of those awesome Sangrias which were freshly prepared right in front of us. I have always loved Barcelos and with this recent launch they have given me enough reason to fall in love with this place, yet again. Today the modern Indian is well-read, well-traveled and therefore has the capability to appreciate the tastes of various global cuisines. And it has been kept in mind while launching the new food items this time. It has brought flavors from across the world starting from Spain to New Zealand to Brazil so that their patrons can get a global taste sitting right here in their city of joy! New additions to the food menu include dishes like Portuguese Corn Soup, Mozarella Cheese Cigar, Arenccini, Chicken Olivet, Herb Crusted Fish and Risotto with Grilled Salmon just to name a few. I will describe few of these dishes which I tasted at this tasting session, besides the amazing Sangrias which honestly impressed me loads!

After a long time finally gave it a try. First of all d staffs r really courteous, d ambience is good n d food is awesome. We tried d herb crusted chicken in starters, where 6 pieces of chicken strips were served with barbecue sauce n it was pretty good. Tried d muddled pineapple n white peachy sangria in d cocktail section. I liked d white peachy, which  was served with chunks of peach. Finally to d main course, where i got confused. One of their staff helped us out n we went for chicken trinchando sizzler. It came with a side dish which contained cubes of chicken, bell pepper, olive n was a bit sour for my taste. 
Finally came d in-house coconut icecream n its a must try. Its a scoop of coconut flavoured icecream with chunks of coconut in it n its really delicious!!
They charge a service charge of 10%, which is a bit on d higher side in my opinion, bt then again all d fine dining restaurants r charging dat including Chili's, asia kitchen, etc.
Overall a must try!!!

Had been a pleasant lunch experience...loved the variety at cocktails n pasta in white sauce was really yummy. Want to try their shooters in bar menu next time. They have separate smoking zone too.  Ordered a keema siszeler, which was delicious. Only thing that hit me was additional service tax after GST , though when asked for they said its optional n removed it otherwise good experience and looking forward to visit again.

I've heard so much good about this place that I HAD to visit Barcelos.
And it was totally worth it. Extremely well behaved & friendly staff who helps you with the menu & takes feedback on every item you taste. The look & feel of this place is mindblowing. So is the food. We ordered 1/2 chicken platter with 2 sides along with fresh lime soda & black forest ice cream. Delicious food which will make you crave for more. It is bit pricey but never mind.. all good things come at a price!
Happy eating üôÇ

My Review : 4.5/5.0

I live in Bangalore , and all my kolkata friends had been gushing about this wonderful place all year, so during my visit last December , I decided to visit this place¬† with my cousins.
It is in Acropolis Mall, specialized in Portuguese cuisine. One of the main reasons behind it's popularity is that it is first of its kind in kolkata. The place is small, but quite classy.¬† We had ordered few popular items like Chicken Espetada (it is like one hanging dish, specialized one), Chicken 1/4 steak (yummy starters with chicken and potato), Grilled Fish sizzler (treat for bong fish lovers like me), Peri Peri Chicken Sizzler (smoking hot and spicy sauce), Hot Chocolate Brownie (yum dessert) and 
Cheesy Chicken Fries (yum). We had also ordered one drinks which had dry ice giving it a smoky feel (not able to recall name) and classic mojitos
Overall good experience !!!

First time we've visited Barcelos for a Sunday lunch,  Ordered draught beer, red wine based sangria cocktail, French fries, chicken ceaser salad, chicken sizzler with hummus..There were 4 varieties of Piri Piri sauces also which I liked. The ambience was great if you want to enjoy a sumptuous meal in not so noisy environment, I personally loved the decor. The food items were mentioned properly in the menu, also those were clarified clearly by the service person. Next time I want to try pita wraps, mini burgers, chessy alfredo pasta..:)

So, gave this place a visit yesterday. We made the mistake of ordering the appetizer and the main course together without tasting the food first. The service was quick. Rather too quick. Now, because they promptly brought out the food and we were hungry, we thought this was our lucky day. Unfortunately, we couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. The herb crusted chicken was strictly okay and the dip they provided lacked enough zing to cut through the richness of the cutlets. The French Fries served with them had also gone cold and hence lacked the crunch and texture that is the distinguishing characteristic of a good French Fry. Average for the price, but still forgivable. However, more horrors were in store for us! The chicken thigh and onion appetizer we tried next was appalling, lacked proper seasoning and we were shocked to find that the chicken pieces that were served to us were cold and stale. Now since we had ordered everything together, the rest of our food had arrived. So, we moved on to their signature hanging chicken skewer dish, and although it was cold like all their other dishes and accompanied by under seasoned potato wedges, compared to the course before it, it was redemption. However, when we took a bite of the cold chicken steak next, we weren‚Äôt too surprised that the meat was dry, extremely salty and way overcooked. Probably it was stored for a long time, hence the meat got so tough and there was absolutely no crispiness in the soggy skin either. Nevertheless, this dish had one redeemable quality. The spiced rice served with it. Credit where credit is due. It was really good. Moving on, our final course was the Peri Peri Chicken sizzler. This was a one of a kind dish. I have many fond memories of sizzlers of various flavours and types. But what tied all of them together was that the food served was sizzling hot. Forgive my pun. It was a ‚Äòsizzler‚Äô per se, as the charcoal underneath was still hot and some of the sauce was bubbling as a result. Yet, this was a first for me as the same delectable spicy rice above it and the once again rotten pieces of chicken were completely cold and so were the undercooked vegetables served with it. This was a dish where the main protein had gone so rancid that we could not complete it. And finally, although not a rant about quality and quantity which were obviously under par, what was also a bitter pill to swallow was that this restaurant charges 28% tax on the bill. 18% GST and 10% service charge on the untaxed amount. If the food was delicious and memorable, maybe then the extra 10% would have been justified, but for now it isn‚Äôt. In conclusion, I was extremely disappointed because I was hoping my first tasting of Portuguese food would be much better. I hope they resolve their quality control issues because, to stand out amongst a crowd of Asia Kitchen and Chilli‚Äôs in Acropolis Mall, which are reputable and trusted brands, the basics must be spot on. And with increasing overhead and cut-throat competition in the hospitality service sector, only the most nimble, observant and attentive will survive.

This is a nice place with good food and ambience.
Went there in the evening so didn't order full course dinner. We had the Signature Peri Peri black burger and their signature chicken tossed in sauces. The black burger was a first for me and it was very delicious. And they also give you four options for the sides to choose from. We chose the potato wedges and grilled vegetables for the sides. The potato wedges we're good and the dip, amazing.  However we didn't like the grilled veggies since they were a bit too undercooked.But  The chicken again was very tasty and 1/4 is enough for two people if you aren't having proper lunch/dinner. We also wanted to order their in house ice creams but unfortunately it wasn't available then. So overall it's a good visit.

Located on the 4th Floor of the Acropolis Mall this is the sole Barcelos outlet in the city. There is a wide assortment of food to choose from and most of the items tried are decent enough. The flame grilled chicken was excellent and should definitely be tried on a visit to this place.This place serves Portuguese cuisine which is a welcome addition to the city. Ambiance is great and the place has got a positive vibe to it.Seats are also comfortable, pricing was reasonable and the staff were also courteous and well mannered. Overall the place can definitely be given a try.

Well previously looking at its reviews I felt somewhere this place is Underrated.But my confusion went away as I myself visited this place today.They serve Portuguese food.To be honest we were warmly welcomed by some courteous staffs.And I also admit that the ambiance of the place is also extraordinary.Moving on we ordered Chicken wings,1/4 Peri peri Chicken,Chicken espetada.All dishes were served within a very short time.I was very happy.Chicken wings were tasty.The other two were utter disappointment.Chicken pieces of espetada were literally as hard as rock.It would break someone's head if you throw them.Next the 1/4 Peri peri Chicken which was also not cooked properly.It was a whole chicken breast platted very nicely to make our mouth water.But as soon as we took a bite we realized that the dish is a complete bluff.Sorry to say I didn't expect that atall.And anyway I didn't collect much strength to order any burger dish or desert further. Amidst all these while my friend and I was trying to take pictures of that exclusively decorated dish called Chicken Espetada, one staff (wearing specs)came rushing and started serving the food on our plate without even asking our permission.And to me it was extremely rude of him to behave in such a snobby manner despite of noticing that we were taking pictures of the dish.However I rated 2.5 accepting the fact of it's looks,some decent staffs and also remarkable decoration of the dishes.But if I had to mark on basis of food I wonder what I would give coz I expected a lot more from this place.

Lastly I request the Management to ask the chefs to take time and cook the food.Flavours are good,decoration is nice but the only problem is of cooking.Give adequate time to preparations.That's ALL.

I love Barcelos, as is obvious from the rating.
It's located in Acropolis, and is my favorite restaurant there.
The ambience is great. I don't remember the decor in details, but it was all wonderful to have around.
I ordered a cheesecake shake and a platter of mini burgers. The burgers resembled Krabby patties and were simply perfect in terms of taste and appearance. They were served with crisp fries and a yummy dip.
The shake was pretty good too. But there was a miscommunication. Apparently our waiter heard blueberry cheesecake instead of cheesecake shake? He insisted I ordered a cheesecake (I didn't) and seemed annoyed to have to take it away, so minus half for the service I experienced.
A bonus is their varieties of Peri Peri sauce available at each table. I tried each one without shame, and they were, forgive the pun, awesomesauce.
I'll go back as soon as I save enough to be able to!

I visted Barcelos after several reviews from my friends, trying for the first Portuguese food was indeed yummy and worth a try!!
The menu is sumptous and cannot be concluded in a single visit.
I tried chicken thighs roasted and Barcelos Signature Chicken roast 1/2 with one otato wedges, Virgin Mojoto and black forest & chocolate ice cream the food is worth a mention.
 
The prices are reasonable however due to GST final prices go a bit higer the entire platter pinched 1600+, however I would come back again to try the sizzlers and burgers next time!! Until then this place is indeed worth a try!!

Being a Portuguese food lover ,specially the peri peri preparations, Barcelos was in my list for a long time since it started operations in Kolkata. Due to the unavailability of Nandoz which was the first restaurant that introduced me to the Portuguese food, I was expecting to have a good time here like my time at nandos which would seem like the perfect alternative.

And to my dismay I was disappointing like anything.

The menu first of all has a lot of sangria options to choose form, which are basically different mix and match of cocktails.
Not wanting to have alcohol, I turned onto the food menu and ordered the house specials wings and chicken soup.
The wings were okayish. No where near the nandos one, but decent start. The soup was so tangy, I could not finish the entire thing. Had to soup(pun intended) chicken out of it.

Next up, the main course : Its why you would go to a Portuguese joint. The peri peri whole chicken.

We ordered for the veri peri which means it was 1 flovour below the hottest chicken flavour.

This disappointed me completely. The chicken felt like half grilled. The fine layer of peri peri crust which you normally associate with the while chicken was tasteless.

did not feel like ordering anything after this bad experience. could not complete the food also.

Price wise quite okay.
Ambience Nice.

Ambience, good..hospitality, good.... food quality, good... the only issue is the variety.. Although you get a wide range of pasta, the choice of appetizer is limited just as the choice of main course.. fishetarians like me might get a bit disappointed once they are done with surfing the menu that leaves you with just a couple of main dishes to choose from. Those who prefer chicken might be in a better position. Now the good part is, it draws less crowd than chilies, which results in faster service.

Food is very good. We had those colourful mini chicken burgers with mashed potatoes as a side and chicken wings with medium spicy flavours. The food is undoubtedly tasty and the presentation skills and ambience are also up to the mark. In dessert we had cheesecake with brownie and ice-cream. This was amazing in taste too but just felt that apart from other food items this desert, (with has a scoop of ice-cream ready to melt anytime) should be served on a normal plate and not on the wooden slab or whatever that's called. Presentation of desert was beautiful but it kind of got messy with the chocolate sauce and melted ice-cream. But overall I really recommend this place. I didn't have any drinks so I can't comment on that.

Located in the top floor of Acropolis mall,Barcelos is a treat to indulge in some super awesome Portuguese food.
The waiter was courteous enough to recommend us some exciting dishes 
We had Peri Peri Chicken,chicken Espetada,chicken picante and in drinks...Brain Haemorrhage,peachy lemon iced tea, oreo shake and Heineken beer.
All the foods were exceptionally good to taste!

For starters, we ordered Drumsticks (9 pieces). The chicken was properly cooked and very juicy.

For the main course, we ordered Garlic Fish served with Paella Rice and Vegetables, 4 Chicken Mini Burgers, Cheesy Chicken Wrap, Family Meal Platter (for 4-6 people). Among all these dishes, the Garlic Fish was probably the best. The Basa Fish was well cooked and soft, the rice was just perfect. The vegetables, however, were terribly under-boiled. The beans and the baby corn tasted completely raw. The Chicken Wrap was okay. Nothing special about it. The Burgers were slightly dry.¬†

The Family Meal Platter had 8 pieces of Peri Peri Chicken and was served with 2 glasses of coke, one bowl of vegetables, and one bowl of paella rice. I have no idea why it's called a family platter for 4-6 people - it's barely enough for 3 people. There are probably just 4 tablespoons of rice. The vegetables had the same problem. They were under-cooked.

They served the Chicken Wrap and Mini burgers with a side of fries. The dip tasted pretty great but the fries weren't. For one, they hadn't peeled the potatoes. And judging by the amount of fries with each dish, they use one medium sized potato. Barely enough fries.

The ambiance is brilliant. No complaints. The staff is polite and courteous. However, they're slightly aloof. We had to holler 2-3 times on the average when we wanted something (water, napkins, new order, etc.)

Summing up, this place isn't bad. But it isn't great either. Items are terribly overpriced. I wouldn't have minded if the food was filling, but it wasn't.

Yesterday was my son's birthday. So went to Barcelos for lunch. It was an awful experience with all stale food. Even the salted vegetables were stinking and became sour. Even I found the waiters were not trained as much and when asked for the details of the dishes gave all wrong information. Worst place in Kolkata to have food. I would sincerely like to request the management to look into it. The same brand in Delhi Gurgaon region are happening places with very good food. 


After this experience..... Today something wonderful happened. 

It was really wonderful on your part to send us the cute cake. We all loved it. We will surely visit you soon. And it's great to see that the shops in Kolkata too are taking customer relationship management seriously. Good work.  Touched.

One of the four restaurants right at the top of acropolis mall.. barcelos have one of the largest restaurant chains in the world. The ambience is decent along with the old school wooden decor. Service was quick and good. We had two Portuguese cocktails -poncha Jura and Bermuda..both were typical fruit cocktails ,a bit on the sweeter side,but good nonetheless. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and peri peri grilled chicken as starters..mushrooms had been a tad bit undercooked. THe chicken was perfectly grilled and you have a choice regarding the spiciness of the peri peri sauce.in main course,we had grilled fish sizzler .The taste was average but the quality of fish was really good and once again,they really grilled it well.
Would recommend it for the peri peri chicken

I always wanted to be here and so I went on 10th of June with my family to Barcelos. I feel so sorry to say this,but there was not a single person to attend us. We were not provided even with the menu card.We were served water only once.We had no tissues and had to ask for them thrice ,after which finally they gave us some tissue. And everytime we wanted something,we have to call them and still the staffs were ignorant of us. I had high hopes from this joint but I was highly dissapointed. The food was overall good but the service was not at all satisfactory.

Almost everything on their menu is made of their own peri peri sauce. Hearing the good reviews from my friends, I came here to check it out. Ordered their signature dish which was the grilled chicken in peri peri sauce and it was quite bland, if I must add. Their sauces available with the dish, made the dish a little better but it still lacked the signature ingredient; the peri peri. Another point I must add, they charge service charge in their bill when an order has been passed by the Supreme Court clearly stating that service charge should not be charged and it is the customers choice how big a tip he wants to give to the people who have served him.

Though not a big fan of middle eastern cuisine, I have still visited this restaurant twice now.. Perfectly located at Acropolis Mall, this has added to the themed restaurant count in our City.. The ambiance is undoubtedly great, mind blowing decor.. We tasted their peri peri hottie burger out of curiosity! The color is definitely the star point but taste is class apart too! We had 1/2 chicken with 2 sides and chicken trinchado with rice which has it's pure Portuguese origin.. The pocket pinch was a bit high but the food makes it worth it..

Then we had ordered for four chicken mini burgers of colour pink black white and one normal one... Taste of the burgers were just not good... It was not at all juicy or soft... It was tight and extra cheese they was too pricey... Overall expirience was not that great

The burgers were really amazing specially the red one and the grilled chicken was delicious.
These are the two must try dishes when you visit the place. It's‚Äã a bit pricey but the taste of the food makes up for it.
Looking forward to visiting the place again soon.

Barcelos was in my wishlist for a long time. I went there for lunch with my cousins. The decor is simple and minimalistic. We ordered the following:
Drinks: Bermuda, Poncha Jura, Ola, Tipo Tinto, Strawberry Basil Bajitos, Passion Fruit Caipirinha, Long Island Iced Tea, Traditional Portuguese Sangria and Classic Mojito. The drinks were very refreshing.
Food: Chicken wings(this had a very distinct flavour and is a must try), Pita with Baba Ganoush, Boneless chicken thighs with onion and pepper(I did not like it much), Fish kebab and 4 chicken mini burgers(this one is a must try).
There is a separate smoking room but they do not have a restroom so you have to go out of the restaurant in case you need to use one.
Food: 4/5
Decor: 3.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Staff: 4.5/5

When I opted for Barcelo someone told me "pachtaoge". And pachtaoge I did. The wanna-be-Nando's menu doesn't have the x-factor or any factor. Food is just food, which not acceptable anymore considering the variety and culinary innovation Kolkata is providing. The drinks are average. Compared to its nearby competitors like Hoppi & Chili's Barcelo's cocktail falls flat. The sangria's add ons do not hide the cheap wine they are made of. The "molecular" cocktails are, trust me, not even connected to molecular gastronomy. Even if I could turn blind towards the food and drinks, the service is 0.5/5. The ppl waiting on u do not have the slightest idea of what they r serving. They cannot make out the diff between peach & rose flavours. The third dish we order never arrived on the table (luckily not even in the bill). Coz the person taking the order forgot to place it in the first place. No serviettes on the table. The crockery seemed awkwardly vintage due to lack of maintenance. The decor is mediocre thanks to the their confusion between Spanish/Portuguese paintings & newspapers from indian-independance-era and London phone booth smoking room!

This place was in my wish list since long. So finally we decided to give it a try. BARCELOS named after a Portuguese town. It serves Portuguese and some continental delicacies. Ambiance adds on and decor is pretty cool, the world map, paintings, retro clock and the smoking room resembles the London phone booth.The dim lights were quite good.
Service was okayish and the person who was attending‚Äã us could not give us a proper detail on the offers which were going.

Coming to the food and drinks part:

KIWI COOLER: (4.5/5) Molecular Gastronomic preparation it was. I found this drink perfect for summer days. It was very refreshing and flavourful.

5 INGREDIENT‚Äã PORTUGUESE SANGRIA: (4/5) It tasted good

CHICKEN MINI BURGERS: (4/5) This place is famous for their coloured mini burgers, it comes in four colours red, brown, white and black. The burgers were meaty enough and we took it one sidded, which came with potato wedges (we found it saltless) and a dip. Red and Black were Mutton burgers. I found the Red one best among them. The colour of the burgers came from organic substances (it was not done artificially).
Peri peri sauces were available on the table from mild to spicy. The overall bill came for around 1450/-.
Would like to visit again to try out other dishes.

This restaurant is located in one of our favourite malls in Kolkata, hence we often end up having a meal at Barcelos.

Generally, the Non- Veg Burgers and Chicken preparations are good. However, more than once we were served overcooked dishes. I think they need to work upon the consistency a bit.

Overall, a good place to enjoy Middle Eastern cuisine.

I ordered 
1. Stuffed chicken kebab (2.5/5) - with an expectation that meat will be soft and cheesy ,as they mentioned the cheese -jalapeno stuffing ... But chicken pieces were very chewy and stuffing and quantity didn't amuse me...
2, Bercelo's¬† spl burger of four different variants Black and red with Lamb patty, and other two with chicken..with one side-Potato wedges ( 3.5/5) - burger buns tasted almost same and dry.. meat was stiff... Best thing served with it was four diff flavors of Sauces... Super peri and tangy lemon added actual taste in it....

Barcelos is located on the top floor of acropolis mall. It was in my visit list fr a quite long time. Finally i visited the place last week with a friend of mine.
Firstly the ambience of the place is very sophisticated i loved the decor. The staffs are cordial .
I tried the mini burger platter with one side. The side included fries. And a sauce. The burger came in 3 different colours red ,black, white, brown. But the brown was nt in stock so they gave us a choice to choose a burger and we choose the red one.
The burgers were too cute.
And the different burgers were different in taste.
I loved the red burger a lot. As it was a mixture of spices and great to taste. Taste of white burger i didnt like much.and black was ok type. So if i visit the place nxt tym i will definately go with the red burger.decoration of the platter was cute. And coming to the price. We paid around 650 ruppes fr the platter. So it is kind of expensive.
Yeah once in a while trying burgers and food is good in barcelose

Well I had some food coupons from little app and didn't meet a few of my close people for a long time so we decided to give this place situated in Accropolis mall a visit . This is really good place with some worth mentioning good people. It has a nice interior with comfortable sitting area even if you are in a large group. Also they has a old school telephone booth themed smoking area which gives this place another charm. They gave us two plates of chicken wings and a plate of fish kebab with nine pints of beer against our coupons. Both of the dishes gave some goosebumps‚Äã to our taste buds .apart from that we ordered a few drinks as well. And they gave us two more chicken wings as a complement. I would love to visit them again to check out their different delicacies from the menu.

We visited this restaurant on a hot summer afternoon on a Saturday, and we were excited to¬†try out this restaurant. ¬†We were pleasantly surprised by the¬†decor and the comfortable seats. The chicken wings that we ordered as appetizers were succulent, fresh and really made us crave for the main course. For the main course, we ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and the chicken peri peri¬†sizzler. The spaghetti was well made, though the meatballs could have been a little tastier. The chicken sizzler was flawless though. But the cake was taken by the Cucumber white sangria- I never knew that any alcoholic drink could be so refreshing.

But I am disappointed with the fries. Too oily, underfried and unseasoned. Hence no 5 today

Had ordered online through Zomato,ofcourse, for a Half Chicken with two side dishes.

Firstly, the packing was horrendous.  It reminded me  of packing household materials through a Movers and Packers establishment. I had no idea, honestly,  that food could be packed in such a shabby manner. It does require a whole lot of effort to pack food so shabily that the food becomes inedible. 

The mashed potato was so severly mashed while packing that it could not be salvaged despite the most sincere efforts as it was oozing/spilling out from the alumunium foil in which it was sent. Had to literally scrape off the food from the foil leaving the better part inside.

The chicken roast or whatever they have named it was some rudely hacked pieces of chicken, boiled in hot water, grilled a little and dipped in their "secret sauce". It was completely tasteless.

The saving grace was the coleslaw which tasted like coleslaw. 

Am enclosing some pictures depicting the manner of packing food. The establishment should seriously consider the above feedback and work towards improving the same.

Good ambiance, comfortable seating and courteous staff. Food quality is pretty good. But it's certainly not value for the money. It's too expensive to be honest. We tried the chicken stir fry, chicken trincado with rice, chicken esparata and chicken steak. Tastes were  average. Chicken stir fry was good. They have choices for the kind of spices you like in each dish.

Wanted to try the burgers for a very long time and hence found myself at Barcelos this evening. For starters we ordered the grilled fish which was good, the fish fresh and the marination of very Peri sauce helped enhance its flavours. However, everything after that kind of went downhill. Hoping the starters would be a good experience as well, we ordered the chicken stuffed kebabs, but even though the chicken was soft and well-cooked, the flavours were flat and I would not  recommend it. We braved our way to the main course.... I ordered the Peri Peri Bloody Red...which was in one word 'a let down' (well three words). The bun was dry and the chicken not too juicy either. The side of grilled veggies too was not pleasing at all, the veggies being dehydrated. The peri peri chicken sizzler had less of chicken and more of vegetable mush. The rice too was uncooked. Regardless of the food, the staff were polite and competent at service. The ambience good. I would really request management to step up their game in terms of food, given the competitive scenario in the city at present. 
Lastly, the Portuguese sangria is definitely worth trying.

Good ambience. A perfect joint for friends and family. I went there with a friend excited to try out their mini burgers The food tasted even better than it looked. The grilled fish was mind blowing. The marination was perfect. For starters we had hummus n pita bread. This is the best hummus me n my friend have had so far in kolkata. There goes another thumbs up. The only downside was that the waiters don't really help you while choosing the dishes, as in explaining exactly how much would be enough for 2 people n etc, hence you would definitely end up ordering too much on your first visit. But we got it packed n savoured the rest at home. And it's too pricey for the amount you get, but good portugese dishes isn't something you'd get everywhere in the city.

Vastly enjoyed their fried chicken with various types of peri  peri sauce - sinful. And the berries cheese cake wound up a very satisfactory meal with vows on the part of our senior gang to roll up again soon. No one was a smoker but the little smoking cabin was specially cute and thoughtful. CHEERS.

Looking forward to a different experience , we decided to try out Barcelos (named after the Portuguese town of Barcelos). Mainly serving Portuguese and various Mediterranean delicacies, this joint is located on the fourth floor of Acropolis Mall. The decor is pretty nice, the illuminated world map on one of the walls being one of the real highlights of this place. The service is very good... The floor manager was very polite and courteous and the service attendants were upto the job. The place was pretty crowded but that did not deter them from performing well.
The food was good. We ordered a couple of molecular drinks like Kiwi Kooler, Berry Cucumber, Tangy Mango. The starters consisted of Stuffed Chicken Kebabs and Pear and Chicken Salad. For mains, we ordered Cheese Chicken Espetada, Grilled fish with rice and Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt dip.
The molecular drinks were amazing especially Berry Cucumber. Starters were ok.... Standard but nothing exceptional. The mains were good, especially the Espetada, which was in addition presented in a unique manner. The Chicken Cataplana went pretty well along with the yogurt dip. Another important bit to remember, when here is to use the various peri sauces that they have on the table, along with the food at an optimum. The four varieties of sauces added a tangy extra bit to the flavours and made the food more special to us.
In the end, for desserts, we ordered Tiramisu (an Italian delight) and Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream. Variety... Yes....Flavours... A big Yes. The desserts were impressive indeed.
A first visit that went pretty well. Hope to be back here for more soon.

Well.. I am sure many of you would differ with my rating for Barcelos.. But the fact is I didn't like the preparations. The place is nicely done. So ambience is good. Service is okay.. though I would say it can improve. I had ordered peri peri chicken...but honestly speaking I liked Nandos preparation more. It somehow tasted bland here. I didn't try the coloured burgers..so not sure how they taste. Overall I think it's a one time visit. There are much better options available in that mall.

Overall a moderate experience @ Barcelos.

Service was slow. Water wasn't served for the first 10mins. A couple of reminders helped. Tutti Frutti made us wait for 25mins.

Portuguese Chicken Lemon soup (check the name) tasted nice.

Greek salad was too little. A plate is not enough to feel the taste if two of you are out there. 7 to 8 shredded pieces of chicken.

The Sweet Fresh Lime Soda tasted nice and unique. It had a sweet fragrance which I have got nowhere till now. It was soothing.

The traditional South African Peri Peri Chicken, Super Spicy did not win my heart. My heart goes to Nandos.
The dish @ Barcelos tasted bitter in between.

Tutti Frutti was nice to finish off today's lunch.

Let me start by mentioning the point that if I've to judge this joint by it's food quality and ambience it's definitely a 4.5. What took away their points is service. And when i say service, i don't mean the attitude or behaviour of the waiters. They were all well behaved and very polite. What was lacking was expertise. They were messy to say the least. One of them even dropped Sangria on my friend while serving. Also they had no clue about the menu. If you had any questions regarding any particular dish or drink he'd run back to the chef or bartender and then come back. However, food was really good. The Chicken Picante and Espetada are a must try. The Sangria was also really smooth. One advice to the management, please hire more equipt waiters.

This isn't a complete review since I had a takeaway from this place...

So on a solitary and humid Kolkata summer night I decided to have a burger... Not in a mood for the typical mcdee I opted for this place which I have never visited before...

The chicken burger that I had ordered was promptly delivered without the protesting follow ups... The delivery guy was well mannered and friendly...

The burner had a juicy succulent chicken patty done to my taste and liking and with a lot of veggies...my only complaint is the accompanying complimentary juice wasn't delivered...I expect the management to take care in home deliveries...

Look out for this space for an update once I have visited this place in person and give a comprehensive review...

Tried Portuguese cuisine for the first time. The mini burgers were really good. Red and Black ones were of mutton and very tasty but the white one was of chicken and a bit flat in taste. The chicken peri peri sizzler comprised of tasty chunks of chicken and veggies but the taste of spices used seemed a bit peculiar. May be I need to develop taste for Portuguese spices. Berry cucumber cooler was very refreshing drink and presentation was nice. Service was quick.

Had ordered chicken stuffed kebab which was average,  i personally didnt like the taste of the stuffing that was put;  Barcelos Signature 1/2 Chicken which was amazing and is a must have; and Peri Peri Chicken Sizzler which was good but also had the same stuffed chicken that we had ordered for starters. Overall a good experience.

Hello! Barcelos happens to be a one if it's kind of a restaurant that serves Afro Portuguese cuisine. I ordered Drum Sticks (4 pcs) & Chicken Trichando Sizzler. Both of the dishes were grilled to perfection and served with the correct amount of spice and specifications. The succulent chicken, the awesome complimentary side dishes were a treat to my senses. I am sure I would definitely come back to try out all what they have to order.

We went there on 2nd apr'17 for the 1st time. Staff were courteous and gave us a warm welcome. We ordered periperi chicken sizzler, mutton kebab sizzler, mini chicken burgers and desserts like brownie, choco fondue with vanilla ice cream etc. Sizzler is not so tasty, quantity of chicken is very less compared mutton kebabs, also mini chicken burger had just 1 strip of chicken in it. Compared to the price i dont why the chicken quantity is so less. The most dissapointing part is they impose 10% service tax without informing customers..when challenged, they change the bill, i.e. always taking chances. You cant force customer on 10% service tax if he/she is not happy, moreover its not mentioned in menu card also. This same trick is used by chillies in acropolis mall also. Overall overpriced items with lack of quality as well as quantity, on top of that malpractice in bills.

I had been waiting to try out the Portuguese joint (only one, I believe) in the city.
Going by the reviews here, I did order a peri peri burger. However, I soon came to terms with reality and realised I should have ordered something mild.
Although the food here tastes great, I would like them to take down the spices a bit.
The oreo shake that I had is the best I've had in town.The ambience is amazing!

This is a tricky one. To start off, don't let the bad reviews scare you off. Experience the food for yourself. I say this because this place serves food that can be selectively palatable. It is not run-of-the-mill fancy cuisine that is adjusted to fit the Indian taste buds. The falafels were very tender and perfect as an appetizer. I ordered the vegetarian Pesto pasta salad, upon which a very helpful server pointed out that I might not find it worth my money if I have never tried and liked it before. I was not expecting it to be as authentic as it was. The combination of pesto, feta cheese, and sundried tomatoes was very refreshing. 5 stars for the salad. I also ordered the lamb burger. The points I would take away is for the disproportionate size of the burger roll to the lamb patty. For a roll that big I expected the patty to at least fill out the bread. It hurt a little because the patty was actually delicious and it was just gone in a few bites and I was left with the bread and lettuce. :( I was able to tell them that directly, however, when I was approached by the very kind chef for my opinion. It was a fantastic gesture on their part to accept praise and criticisms alike, and so graciously.

I do plan to return because their menu is fascinating and I would love to try some of the other things they have to offer. :)

A dinner outside home after a long time. Tucked away in a corner of the topmost floor on Acropolis Mall, Barcelos may not be as popular an option as Chili's and Asia Kitchen but food is undoubtedly good. Almost everything on their menu (except the desserts of course) is based on four variants of the Peri Peri sauce. You get to choose whether you want your food to be cooked in Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri, Very Peri or the Supa Peri. 

After seeing how hot the mild and supa peri were, we decided to order our food cooked in the other two sauces. First up, we ordered the Mutton Kebab based on Tangy Lemon. Very tasty, and quite unlike kebabs in other places. In most other places, mutton kebabs are almost reduced to a paste, but here you get the grainy bits in your mouth which I feel is a more authentic experience.

Main course was Half a chicken Steak with fries for me, and Garlic Fish with Rice for my friend. Both of these were cooked in Mild Peri. Again, good, both of these dishes. Amount is ample, easily fills you up. For desserts we had a Hot Choc Browni with Vanilla Ice cream. As expected, good. All this for around 1600. And yes, the average person will struggle to finish it all up. So value for money this place. That's why it gets a 4.5!!

A pretty awesome place to have a good meal with friends/family. We had the chicken platter in our starter and it was excellent, especially the leg pieces. Next, I had the white burger along with some good ol' JD and 100 Pipers and that was pretty darn good too. Prices are a bit steep but that's okay since the food is brilliant, the ambience is good and the staff is friendly. Will definitely return soon.

Tried Barcelona in acropolis mall  ..and thought the good was quite average. The look and feel of the place is very similar to Nando's the house of Peru Peru chicken. They had a mix of sauce in the table from mild to spicy. Has the stuffed checked kebab which was actually cold, when asked we were told it's served cold.  Honestly it tasted quite bland. The other starter we tried was the drumsticks which was good. We then went for the burger platter and the vegetarian burger. Though they had buns of different colours white black and even red, the filling seemed almost the same or so it seemed like. Tomato and mayonnaise being common in al the burgers. The decor was lively and service was good.

Guess they should stick to their staple biryani and fried rice with chilly chicken!!!!  Their signature grilled chicken and espetada is something that any food lover can write bad about. Have really enjoyed a meal like this after a pretty long time.  Excellent service complements the food and ambiance. Keep it up Barcelos!!!!! Will definitely visit again!!!

The food here is good which is why it's a pity that unlike Chili's they don't do pork or beef dishes. They could at least do buffalo meat burgers.
Anyway, moving on I would give them a 4/5 for their efficient and quick service, decent value for money and good food. When I visited a few months ago they hadn't obtained their liquor license but now I believe they serve alcohol.
We ordered a portion of chicken wings which were juicy but we overestimated their degree of spiciness so we had to apply a smattering of their on-table peri-peri sauces do make the wings more fiery. The chicken espetada had boneless pieces of chicken breast hanging from a skewer in quite a theatrical manner. It wasn't anything extraordinary but wasn't bad either. The combo of 2 mutton and 1 chicken burger looked very attractive and interesting. The taste of the buns differed slightly with each other and the meaty stuffings in between them were delicious. The chicken stuffed pita bread was a bit boring to look at compared to their other dishes but the fieriness and juicy chicken more than made up for the boring presentation.
Overall I had a good time. I still wish they take some inspiration from Chili's and start introducing buffalo meat burgers. Recommended.

Being a sucker for trying out different cuisines, barcelos was a must visit. A bestfriend of mine decided to fulfill my wish by giving her birthday treat there. On entering, we found the place to be absolutely empty, there was a seating place outside which was quite cute, however we chose to sit inside. The place is done up in a simple yet beautiful way. We chose our desired seats and contemplated on our orders. The list was huge. The things we ordered were :
1. Oreo shake
2. Cheese cake shake
3. Three mini burgers - red, black and white with a side dish
4. Chicken Espetada with two sides

Both the drinks were really good. Especially the Oreo shake. I did not quite like the cheese cake shake, but my friend loved it. Now, coming to the most disappointing part, which were the burgers. I am a diehard burger fan and these burgers were a disappointment through and through. The buns were quite stiff and even after adding cheese, the black and the red burger did not impress me at all. The white burger however was good. The Espetada came with quite an innovative presentation, but the chicken pieces were really hard which was quite odd considering the reviews i had read about this dish described them as being soft. The taste was good though, but again nothing worth revisiting again.
The staff was polite, which is a good thing. We sat there for ages and they did not seem to mind at all. I believe the place has potential for improvement, but unless I hear raving reviews about it, I wouldn't go there anytime soon. Maybe the dishes we chose were bad, but for me it wasn't worth the money.

Went there recently with a delegation of 24 Thai representatives from DITP, government of Thailand, for lunch. We were impressed with the ambiance, their service and their food, and our Thai counterparts were surprised that Barcelos was not present in Thailand. Plating and presentation were uniquely different. Special mention must be made for their molecular mock tails, chicken espetada, bhekti and their grilled chicken. A must visit for people, who love great food in an equally great place!!!!

Coming to the food part as it is known for its grilled chicken... It really does it job.... We ordered 1/2 special chicken... It was great!! Indeed awesome taste..!! Though we were little disappointed with the pita ordered...not much happy with  the taste.... The sides - Potato wedges served with a dip was yummy...
And not to forget the desert.... It was delicious.. :) :) 
If you r a lover of CHICKEN... You should try this place...! Its a must...!

Extremely disappointed in the food. We ordered a Greek salad, a chicken platter, two salmon dishes and a 1/4th chicken. 
The food didnt come out in order or on time even though the restaurant was visibly empty. The chicken on the platter was burnt, the salmon was dry and overcooked, even the accompanying risotto was chalky and under done. 
Even though the staff was friendly and hospitable, nothing could salvage the bad overpriced dinner my family and i recieved.

On the Christmas Day not following the trend of standing at a queue at almost all restaurants at Park Street this year I decided to drive my plans to other side of the city n enjoy the eveningüôÇ
I actually wanted to try some different cuisines but staff regretted for their limited food stock as they couldn't serve any of dish which I ordered. I was excited to have their "black burger", chicken espetada which seemed to be quite interesting looking at the menu book but we couldn't have. Having not served any of these dishes we then tried out Chicken Stir Fry and Chicken Trinchado with rice.Both the dishes were good at quality n taste.The interiors are also pretty well designed and clean too. But the service was not prompt,I know the restau was filled with Christmas crowd but we had to wait more than 30 mins for each dish to b served. Would taste those dishes later someday.
This review would b sufficient on my first visit to the place.
Location: Barcelos is located at the top most floor of Acropolis Mall that is just above the mall food court.

This could be potentially a great place but is not. The food is pretty standard for all their outlets however the  floor manager was making a mess of things today. The staff is courteous and makes great recommendation. Decor is very global though the framed newspaper is a great touch. Some of the pictures on the walls are not hung straight .

Went here for lunch to celebrate the birthday of a very special friend! We've been meaning to visit it for a while and we're super excited to finally go. It's located on the top floor of Acropolis mall. The menu reminded me a lot of Nandos! 

Top picks were!
Three chicken burger - one red, one black and one white burger. All tastes slightly different. The red one was more piri piri, black was meaty and white was very mild. Recommend adding cheese to the burgers as this elevates the flavours considerably. The fries on the side were chunky and delicious with a great dip to go along with it

Signature 1/2 chicken - not as packed with flavour but had a great smoky grilled taste none the less

Chocolate Fondant with vanilla ice cream - it was definitely delicious and chocolate-y but it wasn't really a fondant. It was more on the side of a gooey brownie. But it was yumm and the ice cream complimented it well!

The bill of the above along with 2 drinks was  around 1500. Well worth a filling hearty chicken-y meal!

Went here yesterday with friends. We'd ordered a veg platter, a large platter of fries and 2 LIIT. The potions were small and nothing like a platter. The kebabs were bland and nothing like kebabs. The LIIT was okay. The staff was didn‚Äôt serve us well. Disappointed with everything we decided to leave and I refused to pay the service charge. The management repaid the balance of 450 is 10 rupee notes. Utterly disappointed with the whole episode. Pathetic experience. Not recommended, especially for vegetarians.

This is an international brand and in entire Kolkata it's the Acropolis Mall where it's located in on the fourth floor level üìç
Multicolored burgers are somewhat made me opt this place. Right after we made our seats I became discomfort and annoyed. In spite the restaurant was empty when we entered except us and one other the receptionist and the waiter both made us sit at their selected table with our unpleasant mood. Unsure why they didn't allow us to sit elsewhere! Keeping this apart we made our orders with 4 Chicken mini burgers with 2 sides spiced rice and green salads¬† - Which tested horribly worse. Couldn't find anything worth in between two bread pieces top and bottom except one tiny slick chicken piece and stale lettuce! No instinct test could be felt instead only dry breads even being different colors. How could an international brand serve this poor food which costs ‚Çπ530?It doesn't value the money anyhow. In this quick developing hospitality service people are aware of good foods beside good services where foods may not test good some times but good service may keep the place going which was missing. Let me tell you both service and foods were worse, horrible, unprofessional at some point. I felt to walk out at some point for their poor attentiveness and hospitality! However we kept ourselves seated and finished the meals. Our orders followed by Panner trichando rice, Coke and Hot choco brownie with ice cream from desserts. Coke was unlimited but it was worse that every time we needed to call them to refill the glass every time, though it was quite empty still the time was being. We had to wait every time for any of our orders above and after couple of minutes the waiter come with the food and cock to refill the glass. I'm really shocked by such poor, no worse service by this so called international brand. How could they provide such worse service where there they even take service charges separately! It was a worse visit indeed! üò£üò£üòñ
Ambience was nothing extraordinary instead quite simple with a small wall clock and a map to notice.
Service was worse, pathetic, horrible! Foods Nothing tested good to tell you except hot brownie and panner trichando. Rice was stale, dull lacked salt couldn't find any spice either so distasteful! üëéüö´ 
I accidentally spilled my water before the dessert part arrived at the table so I asked the steward if he could clean the table, at length he said ok and at the same time he said he can't do it now as it will take some time so why don't we shift ourselves towards right and have the desserts? However we had to do so. After that when the man came with the dessert he placed it so badly above the water that my dress got spoiled. I disgust I disgust been there! 
After we somehow finished our meal I asked if they have washroom or basin for hand wash the steward told us none of this two are available here but he can give me wet tissue but after couple of minutes he came empty hand and told us sorry they don't have any wet tissues now. So man this is how an international brand use to provide their service! I wished to make a complaint against the service and foods both but Alas! couldn't know how to!! There are tons of posh restaurants with excellent services as well as good testy foods and we foodies can chose from where to go. It was my bad I choose to pay you a visit! ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èüòñ
Wait! It wasn't enough to make us experience worse! üòÇüòñ
Right after we paid the bill and left the joint I found one the stewards followed us and made himself stop at some distance and checked us! I though couldn't understand why on earth the man done so and I ask you how could an international brand keep such poor, untrained stewards who use to follow their customers after they finish the meals?
Will never visit this place again never! ‚ùå‚ùå
No recommendations! Don't go please!

I don't exactly know what it was, but there was something unpalatable about the food. Whether I don't like Portuguese cuisine in the first place I still don't know but I didn't quite like the food. We had the 3 chicken mini burger with mashed potatoes and the peri peri chicken sizzler. The best bit was the cheesecake shake. Loved it.

So this friend of mine told me that this place probably has one of the best burgers in town. I found it hard to believe, considering my all time favorite place for burgers still was BuegerU.

So, I booked my table via Zomato's online booking system(considering the fact it was a weekday, we really didn't need to.) Anyhow, as we stepped in the waiter guided us towards our reserved table and was quite friendly and helpful.
¬†

The decor of this place is quite nice, although a little small. It also has a small lounge kind of an area. The overall atmosphere is pretty okay. Coming to the service, the waiter knew the menu well and was very helpful while picking out items from the menu.¬†

We ordered a 'too much peri peri', a 'fully loaded chicken burger' along with a too 'Mango meets banana' shake. 

So we waited for a while until the food came to our table and right off the bat, let me tell you..these burgers are tall. Taller than anything else I've had in the recent past. It was a struggle, even with my quite big hands to keep the burger together. My friend on the other hand chose a completely different route and took everything apart. She was just not up for the challenge. The burgers tasted pretty good, maybe not the best I have in Kolkata but definitely good. There's one thing though, that threw me off. Apparently, while taking ¬†our orders, the waiter asked if we wanted cheese to be added on to the burgers? I am no connoisseur(yet) but I thought cheese was an integral part of any burger. IF you're reading this Barcelos, fix this up ASAP, please. Anyhow, looking past that the burgers were pretty okay. The fries came an ad-on, yet again but I won't complain since they satisfied my taste buds. The shake was pretty well made too. The quantity was quite sufficient for two to be honest. You also get a wide variety of sauces to choose from, four to be precise

All in all, it was a good experience but expect the bill to be around for 1500 to 2000 rupees for a simple one course meal.

We went today for lunch. We expected a Nandos kind of menu and ambience. The Peri sauce were yum. Caution to the those who have a weak tongue for spicy food: the Super hot Peri sauce is terribly hot. The ambience was really nice and the service swift. We loved the stuffed chicken kebabs and the chicken thighs. Our sangrias were great too. Coming to the 3 chicken burgers- that was a big disappointment. The colors are for show and don't add taste. The burgers had little to no chicken inside! Felt like we were having a veg burger. Otherwise a good day!

The interior is well decorated and the staffs are courteous.
We ordered for a fish steak,Chicken Espeteda and soft drinks.
The fish pieces were succulent and came with spicy rice and veggies.
The hanging dish chicken cheese espetda comes with two sides.We took spicy rice and mashed potato.
Well,the rice and potato did not taste nice.
The chicken pieces were soft and tasted nice.
Service is prompt.Food presentation is neat.

I finally went to Barcelos after craving their delicious colorful burgers for a very long time! And sadly I was disappointed.

We ordered Peri Peri Black Magic(Black bun burger with roasted chicken) and Peri Peri Red Hottie(Pink bun burger with veg patty) along with Oreo and KitKat shakes. On the side of the burger we had ordered a portion of potato wedges with dip.
The shakes were quite good, rich and thick! They were served in nice little jars. I've had better versions of both, but there were good nonetheless. For their price, the quantity should have been more I felt.
The burgers sure looked fabulous and were served well in wooden trays. To much dismay of mine, the buns tasted the same as a regular bun...don't know why I thought they would taste much different. The Veg burger was much better than Non Veg burger - which, in one word, was bland. Thankfully have have 4 sauces accompanying you on your table and Super Peri sauce made the burger much better. The Veg burger was good overall - not spectacular. The wedges were really good! Especially with Super Peri!
The portions were good, one burger with one side is sufficient for 1 person. The price for burgers is okay...feels a little less value for money though.

They have a huge burger menu to offer! And I could only try the tip of the iceberg. Maybe I'll like other burgers/dishes better and so could you! Do try it out :)

It was kind off a cousin reunion after a long time and what good way to celebrate than to eat out. Barcelos was a week or so old and was 'hot cake' in this part of the city. So without second thoughts we decided to give it a try. First things first, the place is particularly decorated and gives u that feel of a burger joint. Courteous staff and a good ambience set us up sufficiently. We tried a sizzler and a lamb burger on recommendation from the guy attending us. Honestly it was in that 'thin red line'. Below it u r disappointed and above it u are satisfied. Infact while driving home I thought to myself whether the food stood out. I m still perplexed.

Try this place out to taste the flavours of Portuguese food. The drinks especially are a treat for your taste buds. A special mention for the Sangria. For appetizers we tried the chicken thighs and mutton kebabs. Both the dishes were exceptionally tasty. There are 4 different sauces they offer your food to be cooked in, 4 sauces have different levels of spice in it. However when it came to the main course, it was bit of a let down. We ordered the 1/4 chicken and the chicken was a little dry. Also we could have enjoyed the food more if the plates were bigger since there's a lot going on, on that plate of food. They also give you a choice of sides along with the main course so if you are two persons and you order a 1/4 chicken with 2 sides, that should be more than enough.
A few very interesting items which are available on the menu are the red and black coloured burgers which are supposedly very healthy. Will definitely try the same next I'm there.

I had been waiting eagerly for this outlet to be opened at Acropolis. After months of waiting visited this Portuguese joint last year and since then I have been quite a regular.
The peri Peri madness has taken the shape of a trend today. And no one makes a better version of peri peri grilled chicken than Barcelos in Kolkata.
Not just grilled chicken but the burgers, the burgers are one of a kind. I had the mini burger platter which was a trio of a black, red and white burger and came with a side of potato wedges.
The best part is the pocket pinch which is not really much. Total value for money.

We have been seeing Barcelos @Acropolis for a while and thought it was a good time to check out the striking Black and Pink burgers that are their star items. Some of our friends were apprehensive of the food colouring used, but the staff assured that the colouring used was from organic ingredients and vegetables which are added before baking... Entirely harmless.

Surprisingly they have introduced Himalayan Trout which is brought in from the Himachal, that none of us knew about earlier.

While the food is great, some events for the weekends can help it be a more happening destination to hangout.

Well it's a long due review as I visited here with my bff last year and never wish to go ever again.

Decor-4/5
Ambience 3.5/5
Food-1/5
Service -2/5
Value for money -1/5

 So the decor makes one feel it's a great place to hangout with scrumptuos food,and a heaven for those chicken lovers,and I too prefer chicken very much and like to try experimental dishes,and after knowing about there peri peri preparation I was more interested and curious about this food stop,the waiter's are very much unprofessional,and have no idea about what they are serving or what's there in the menu,of you ask for any explanation about any dish.
They need a proper training as to how they should behave with the customers that they don't own us and it totally depends upon the customers whether a restaurant excels or not!!!
They do as they wish to and don't follow what the patron is saying.

Coming to the food they served us some smelly chicken preparations which we couldn't eat but had to pay for,for the starter we had the chicken platter which was edible and then for main we had peri peri black magic and a full chicken which were disaster!!!  So we didn't even tried the dessert,instead we went to the Asia kitchen which is beside this outlet and got satisfied!!!!

On 8th of this month i dropped by this Portugese restaurant after hearing a lot about it. I liked the outdoor sitting arrangements though i sat inside. Interior is quite good. Coming to the food I ordered peri peri bloody red burger and white chicken burger. I really liked the burgers and they do not serve processed or frozen chicken. Along with the burger we took one side which includes green salad and grilled veggies. There are a lot more dishes which seemed interesting . But since my friend and i was full we couldn't order anything more. Will surely pay a second visit soon to try the different wraps.

Different cuisines are coming up in the city..barcelos is one if those. Good food ...very sufficient quantify . Nicely maintained and we'll kept. Only one drawback is the slow service provided. Rest is assured. All the way. Must visit          
My second visit to barcelos was very good. I hadn't been aware of the ample space this restaurant had until one of the waiters took m to the end seat surrounded by beautiful painted walls... Nice themes
One must try the red burgers. Just the best among all of my orders. Just one thing was a turn off were the French fries. You get these type of fries in roadside restaurants. Plz improve the quality of fries. Or else everything was superb. Hope to visit soon. .

Its hidden. Almost in a way that Diagon Alley is in London. Hidden in the desolate most corner of the mall its hard to locate unless you know for sure that it exists from the overhanging banner. 
Once inside there are rarely guests to be seen for obvious reasons. Music playing in the background is good and the staffs are as you would expect in such an eatery. 
There's a smoke room inside which is a big plus for the sinners. 
They make there signature grills with one of the 4 sauces,  rather variants of the Peri Peri sauce. You can decide to taste them first before deciding on which one to grill your chicken with. 
Supa Peri,  the one that I went with was literally super hot. My lips were burning for the next few hours. The chicken had not retained its juices probably due to immediate serving. So I would not rate the food highly. 
The waiters came over repeatedly to ask if I was having a good time and if the food was good etc. I doubt if they can do this at this frequency once they are exposed from their hidden alley.

Barcelos is one of the fewest Portuguese and Middle Eastern food joints that the city has.
You can feel the pocket pinch here but honestly it's worth it.

They are famous for their burgers and like others i wasn't disappointed by the taste or the the presentation of the burgers either.

We had ordered Peri Peri chicken, mixed kebabs platters, Chicken Espetada and chicken burger- toasted handmade soft buns filled with chicken fillet, lettuce, tomato and mayo. You can always choose your favourite toppings and other add ons from the menu.

The decor and ambience is lively and pleasant,although the service was bit slow.

Very impressive outlet. Its a new outlet, very trendy decor.
Service and ambience just awesome.
Food is different and they have some very intresting varieties. Well u cant understand all, so the best is to suggest the staff to serve them to their delight. Ofcourse do try the sizzlers, its really hot and good.
One advice for the management: if they could make the seats a little more comfortable.
But surely should be visited more often

Located on the 5th floor of Acropolis is this middle-eastern/portuguese food heaven!
 
Loved the ambience & decor. Great service, staff is really humble and courteous. Brilliant plating!

Shakes are amazing. We also tried the mango and kala khatta from the drinks menu. Chicken espetada is a delight to watch because if the way it is presented-hanging from skewers. Fish kebabs were good; chicken platter was average. Salamon with risotto was really good, the salamon was freshly pink, juicy, tender however risotto was not upto the mark!

We had gone their to celebrate a friend's bday and they were really thoughtful to play a bday song while cake-cutting: really really appreciate the gesture.

All in all,Barcelos is definitely a must try next time you crave for a yumilicious meal to tantalise your taste buds :)

I still can't make out why barcelos doesn't have a 4+ rating at zomato! The ratings given here have made me backout from visiting this place quite often, but finally a few days back I finally went there since I wanted to try something different and was pretty hungry! I have not regretted my decision ever since. The one thing that is very mentionworthy is their presentation and plating of food. I found it amazingly exquisite! The pictures given will show you how it was. This place surely deserves a 4+ rating for their tasty food, decor, courteousness and obviously plating!
Will surely visit again and hope you will too :)

Food was delightfully refreshing.
We had late lunch today but it was worth it. Ordered 1/2 grilled chicken with mild peri sauce..penne pasta with Alfredo sauce and KitKat drink.
Pasta was sensuous with a hint of salty milky creamy  cheese chicken. Loved every bit of it!!
Barcelos' signature dish was equally delicious!
Highly recommended üëçüëç

Barcelos has always been a great food joint for Portuguese and Middle Eastern dishes.

You can feel the pocket pinch here but honestly it's worth it.

The burgers are worth tasting and if you visit here you'll find various kinds of colourful burgers.

We had ordered Peri Peri chicken, mixed kebabs platters, Chicken Espetada and chicken burger- toasted handmade soft buns filled with chicken fillet, lettuce, tomato and mayo. Barcelos provides with varities of sides and add ons.

While the Chicken Espetada skewered chicken with onions, garlic and bell peppers is soft and tender with all the spices and flavors oozing out of it.

This dish is served with two regular sides either fried veggies or rice.

The fried veggies salad is a blend of many flavors, that helps to bring out the tangy spicy 'achari' taste in it.

You also get fries along with a cheesy dip.

And as per your taste and preference you can also add mozzarella cheese and sundried tomato to the dish, making it Cheesy Chicken Espetada.

A pretty and filling starter which you'll only get here, at Barcelos.

Visit this place once to taste delicious Portuguese and Middle Eastern Cuisine, it also has a nice and lovely decor .

Been to this place a couple of days back with a friend of mine who happens to be a chef too. We ordered a dish called hummus and pita which at all did not taste good. And since my friend too is a chef and has cooked such Mediterranean dishes in a number of well renowned hotels, according to him they did not even add the proper ingredients required to prepare the dish. However we also order a chicken steak with veggies and 1/2 chicken with mashed potatoes both of which tasted good enough.
What attracted us the most in this particular place is their friendly behavior. After we finished our meal they came up to us for a feedback about the food. On my friend saying that the hummus did not at all taste as it was supposed to they initially deducted the amout of the dish from the total billing amount. Nevertheless on us requesting not to do so as it was just an honest openion, they included the amount and also gave both of us vouchers where we could avail discount next time we visit the restaurant. Not just that even the chef himself came over and spoke to us in a very friendly tone and overall this place gave us a very warm and comfortable experience. Would love to visit again !

Finally was able to visit barcelos. The decor and seating is very good and comfortable. The service was also good. The best item was Himalayan trout. Would only visit this place again for the trout and the non veg kebab platter. It has quite an extensive menu but only two items of fish and no items of any other seafood. 
The burgers were a big let down. Very dry bread and hard chewy chicken. We had ordered two glasses of sangria. It's served in very small glasses full of fruits hence Hardly any alcohol was there. It's a rip off for the price they are charging. The brownie with ice cream was good. 
Now comes the bill, 40per cent of ur actual amount is added as taxes and service charge!!

One of the bigger and better malls of Kolkata, Acropolis also offers various food joints, Barcelos being one of them. Located on one of the corner spaces of the fourth floor of the mall, Barcleos provides you with a wide and delicious variety of food and drinks.
Alcohol and mocktails are at par with other food joints in Kolkata. Food, starting from Peri Peri burgers to non veg platters, from salads to grilled veggies and chicken/fish all are worth a try.
The service and behaviour of the staff is equally pleasant. Loyalty programs is something that food joints of Kolkata have started and Barcelos is no far away.
I strongly recommend people to try out Barcelos at least twice. This is a place that can be visited with both friends and family

My first visit to this place.
An awesome ambience it has.
Very courteous staff.
I was very keen to taste the colourful burgers.So,we ordered the chicken burger platter with french fries as side dish.
The black and the white oil ones were really juicy and tasty.The red one was little dry.
Then we ordered 1/4 chicken and the Traditional Portuguese Sangria (made up of red wine and brandy) to go with it.
Although I didn't like the sangria as it was too hard for me,but my friend loved it.
This place is a must visit.

well, to start with, I m not much impressed with this particular restaurant. Quite a Known place (thanks to zomato), entered their with quite a high expectation, but nothing came out working in favour except for the high class decor & wall paintings. we ordered 1 chicken steak with potato wedges & mayo dip. Idk what was the hype about? a single lean chunk of chicken breast roasted, along with 10-12 pieces of potato wedges & a smallll bowl of mayo dip. the chicken was not upto the mark, was quite chewy, not at all great in taste, in short, nothing exceptional (as expected going through their price). atlast, the bill arrived and what irritated me more was - a single damn dish costed me 476/- (including tax). i mean what? what was so great in that dish, that I would feel peace while paying for it!? if the dish will be good, its quite natural that the customer would love to pay for what he or she got. but for that crappy dish which was nothing but a single piece of chicken and few potato's? nah! not my cup of tea actualy. they are actualy pricing the dishes in the name of their expensively done decor..which is not accptable (atleast for me).

A new baby in the town has arrived and brought a sensation to our taste buds.Barcelos has finally started serving liquor which took me to there for a taste of the Portuguese sangria .Boy its yumm..bits and pieces of apple and oranges in red wine(though i was hoping for a few peach slices) was presented to me.I have heard a lot about their burger section.Our server suggested that we opt for the black mutton burger with extra cheese and sides of potato wedges and mashed potato.The black sesame burger was moist with a huge mutton patty oozing in cheese.The burger bun has its own flavour which sets it a@part from the others in town.A sweet end to our meal was the berry cheesecake served in a platter beautifully presented with berry compote.A special mention is the small but cute red phone booth smoking zone and the window side table overlooking the road.Well the verdict is we are definitely visiting back for the different portuguese delicacies

Legend is,barcelos has  many stores located in South Africa.it started in 1993 in south africa n made its way in india n finally in Kolkata! The official home for portuguese flavour. The decor is really good. Coming to food we ordered 
 Chicken salad with extra chicken (it was amazing) healthy option it has green apples,eggs and candied walnuts and almonds.
Half chicken done one side (super peri peri) :the chicken was very well marinated as the marinade made the chicken soft succulent with mashed potatoes .
Pocket pinch is moderate.

Located in Acropolis Mall, this place has earned a lot of name for the colorful burgers that it serves. Decided to have all of them and I could not find an option better than the combo platter of 4 mini burgers, all different colors, with 2 sides - where we chose Fries with Dip and Grilled Vegetables. 

The dip served with fries was delicious. The Grilled Vegetables had less of babycorn and more of broccoli that smelled stale and turned out to be a huge turn off for me.

Coming to the burgers, I really liked the white one as it had mayo in it. Red turned out to be really dry even after adding a cheese slice to it, brown tasted good with all its spiciness and black was again average.

An extra 0.5 would definitely go to its ambience. The walls are decorated with beautiful paintings. The bar area is an eye candy.

The berry cucumber,tangy mango,kiwi cooler were served with dry ice.the drinks were smoke-filled,nice in quantity.then black mutton burger was peculiar as the bread was black in colour.i've expected it to be more tasty,more juicy & moreover i feel it to be a little overpriced.the grilled fish sizzler was not up to the mark.it contained only few pieces of fish.moreover the sizzler didn't feel like to be a sizzler.something was missing in the taste.

Well out of all the Barcelos i have tried, this is the worst! Why is Calcutta subjected to pathetic overpriced food? Waiters who are hard of hearing, and no manager makes this place a nightmare! The Peri peri sauce was pathetic - though they claimed it was the standard sauce. The chicken was dry and yukk!! I will never ever visit this place again. The waiters are again extremely rude and not too sure why they have cultivated this attitude. Meaningless overpriced food.

Pathetic experience on New Year eve. Had gone with my parents and wife to the restaurant. Ordered a Non Veg kebab platter and some drinks. Although the restaurant wasn't even half full but the service was still very slow. The platter came around 30 mins later. Had 1 bite into lamb kebab and realized that the inside of the kebab is completely frozen. The restaurant had just microwaved the kebabs and hence it was hot on outside and frozen inside. Had to return the platter and they replaced with new platter. But, they completely destroyed the evening and we left after that. Also being New Year eve, we couldn't get space anywhere else and had to return home.

Finally had a chance to visit Barcelos along with my wife and kid. The diner is located on the top floor of the Acropolis Mall. The place has got a charm of its own with its own unique decor. The staff are most coueteous and efficient. Coming to food there are lots of options and whatever we ordered were very tasty.In other words even if prices are on a little higher side you get your money's worth.Looking forward to visting Barcelos soon.

A RARE NAME BARCELOS AND THE BEST ONE IN TOWN!!!!!
An actractive menu card, i say this because of newly invented and written chicken dishes which definitely find anyone's attention but the price next to it might just be a factor to think about !! Really is it worth it?
Service was not impressive the attendants were late and lost to say the least!!!
Well located in a newly happening mall of KOLKATA acropolis with a decent decor, dim lights and sitting arrangements not much though in number!!
No arguments in accepting the fact peri peri chicken has a great taste with a non spicy avatar somewhat an international approach to it !!! But on ordering Barcelos signature dishes (2 leg chicken pieces) and the hanging chicken kababs in portuguese style which grab my attention on the menu card i found both same in taste !! (6 pieces chicken)
The world healthiest burgers a nice sounding name and surely good one in taste but then look at the price !! 
The drinks are good and good in quantity but prices are on the higher side !!
Surely a fresh and new approach not for everyone though as price is definitely a factor to look in !!
Couples can surely step in and expect 2000 bucks on decent lunch or dinner meal even more!!!
But still the food is really good no doubt so surely you can try this one!!
I have given 3.5 may be when next time i step in barcelos and try sizzlers and other dishes i might update my ratings as price and quantity is a factor to worry about for these highly price dishes!!!
If you liked my review do comment or like!!!

The name itself is so fancy, that it urges you to actually try out the kind of food they serve.
Upon further investigation, I got to know, they serve Mediterranean food and I obviously wanted to go there.

The ambience is serene and calm with dim lights but the music is too loud at times. I personally feel that the tables laid out in coloumns should have a wee bit more space between them.

Service was fast and staff members were humble enough the answer all our queries.

Coming to what we ate :
1)Garlic Fish with Rice @Rs.265.00 (3.75/5) : [Serves 1] This came with a fair portion of indianised mexican rice with 3 portions if grilled Basa fillets and a good portion of grilled vegetables. The fish tasted awesome and was grilled nicely with a good flavour of garlic. The vegetables were delicious but I feel that the rice could have been of better quality.

2)Chicken Pita with 2 Sides @Rs.345.00 (4/5) : [Serves 1] The two sides ordered were Potato wedges (well prepared, very crisp) and coleslaw (delicious). The delectable chicken stuffed fresh pita was beautiful. Really liked it.

3)Mutton Kebab Sizzler @Rs.545.00 (4.25/5) : [Serves 2] 5 medium sized well charred mutton kebabs served with a portion of rice and Mediterranean style grilled vegetables. The kebabs were delicious!

4)Grilled Chicken (1/2)with 2 sides - Creamy mashed potatoes and Rice @Rs.530.00 (4.25/5) : [Serves 1] This turned out to be a beautiful and succulent dish which brings equal excitement to both the eyes and as well as the taste buds. Well smoked soft tender chicken was indeed great to hog on! The accompaniments - the creamy mashed potatoes were spot on but the rice needed some improvement with the quality and taste.

5)Burger Platter @Rs.495.00 (4/5) : [Serves 2] We were served with 4 burgers I.e. 2 chicken burgers and 2 mutton burgers. They do not use artificial colours to colour their buns which is very good initiative.
Starting from the first burger from the left :

i)Normal chicken burger (3/5) : The first burger was a bit too dry for my liking, the bun was over baked and between the buns were 2-3 thick chicken strips covered in cheese and mayonnaise (most probably).

ii) Chicken burger with white buns (4.5/5) : This was juicy and so so good! With 2-3 chicken strips again but with a new dimension of flavour with pineapple and pickled olives. What an amazing combination of sweet and sour.

iii)Mutton burger with red buns (4/5) : This was on the subtler side with a dangerously delicious smokey mutton patty which I asumed was hand pounded and that did make a great difference in terms of taste.

iv)Mutton burger with Black buns (4.25/5) : This was a bit spicy but again delicious.

This dish is a total value for money.

6)Tiramisu @Rs.195.00 (2.75/5) : [Serves 1] Out of everything I tried, this turned out to be a disappointment. The mascarpone cheese was mixed with whipped cream but it was too stiff. The coffee flavour wasn't very prominent as well. Clearly did not enjoy it.

The bill total was Rs.3245.00 [Including 10% Service charge of Rs.247.50, 14.5%vat of Rs.358.88 and 6% service tax of Rs.163.35].

The hole in the pocket is pretty big but this place is worth a try.

Recommended. üòÉüòÉ
Happy eating. ‚úåüèª

Had a great time catching up with my friends at Barcelos, we tried this place with the expectations of great food and a good ambience. Barcelos lived up to the expectation and took good care of us. The nonveg platters were amazing, the sangria bar dished out some great cocktails. The burger were very filling and had some amazing presentation. The lamb burger was juicy, nicely cooked and had some amazing flavour. Highly recommend place for a good drink, finger foods, grilled chicken and heavenly burger. The sangria bar is an added advantage. Thank You @teambarcelos

Had been here on 25th. Seemed like a good place but the service was horrendous. We both ordered a dish each for ourselves. Mine was served but my sister's dish was not served and we were kept waiting for 1 hour. Later they told us it will take more time. The order was for a simple chicken wrap which took ages to prepare. Huge disappointment. Why would someone choose them over Chilli's or Hoppipola i wonder. Bad experience

The place has a lot of promise in terms of interior and the feel. We ordered starters veg and non veg. The non veg was good but the veg item was not that great. The main course (sizzlers) veg and non veg both were just about OK.

Ever since this places opened its doors to foodies, I have been wanting to taste the multicoloured mini burger platter - red and black burgers being the most tempting. They not only look good but taste great too. Had ordered this with 2 sides - potato wedges with dip and spicy rice. Honestly the rice doesn't go well with this and it's good also. So I would suggest you all to skip that and try something else. Other than this everything else we ordered was delightful. Do try the peri peri dishes.

We visited your Acropolis Mall Kolkata outlet for our Christman dinner ! I am sorry, the food was far from our expectation. The service was aweful, we had to ask not only for the menu card but also ask for the cutleries, despite the restaurant being half empty. We ordered a large dish of whole chicken roast with sides. The chicken was unfortunately poorly grilled and was tasteless. We did not dare to order for any other food.

Never thought black burger would taste so delicious. Good customer service and ambience. But one thing  they can improve is the speed of food service, took 15-20 mins to serve 2 burgers... But then again, the awesome burgers made up for it.

With every new mall coming up in Kolkata, so is another big food chain outlet. When Quest Mall decided to host a Michelin Star restaurant and provide the foodies of Kolkata with a taste of authentic Chinese, Acropolis came forward to give us a 'Hoppi' experience and of late, spoil our taste buds with Portuguese spices and grilled chicken. The moment you step into this place, the first thing you notice is the world map and the beautiful lighting around. A soft, soothing or some peppy number music (am not sure of the language) adds to the ambiance. 

Coming to the food, I have tried out the following at this place:

Accompaniments:
Kiwi Cooler and Tangy Mango : Both are pretty good and are different from the regular mocktails served in other places - both in terms of appearance and taste. 

Main Course:

1. Half Chicken done one side : The Chicken, so we'll marinated, mixed with Portuguese herbs and spices and served with mashed potatoes is an absolute delight for chicken lovers like me. They have 4 different sauces to offer, and you are free to choose any, depending on your spicy level. 

2. Chicken Esplanade : This is a hanging chicken dish, consisting of small pieces of chicken breast separated by ball peppers and onions, and mixed with again, the traditional spices. The taste of the chicken, however, isn't very different from the grilled chicken. 

I really wanted to try their burger, but I was somewhat full after devouring so much mashed potatoes and chicken. So, I hope to try the special coloured burgers soon enough. 

Desserts:
1. Tiramisu: This has become one of my favourite desserts, and I believe it needs a lot of effort to make this go wrong. Fortunately, even though they don't offer the best Tiramisu in town, Barcelos doesn't go wrong with this. 

2. Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream: This is for the chocolate lovers. The melting ball of hot chocolate with a spoon of vanilla ice cream is the formula nearly every dessert banks on. 

Overall, Barcelos gives a much-needed break from the monotonous tasting of the limited varieties of cuisines available, and I definitely want to explore their signature dishes further!

My expectations were really very high after hearing and reading reviews and so was waiting to be here from a long time to try the Peri Peri and Portuguese cuisine. But was thoroughly disappointed only in terms of food.
Ambience - is phenomenal. Calm, clean and well decorated

Service - is again great, quick and staff were really polite as well pretty cooperative

Food presentation - very good, they looked to pretty and innovative to be tampered :)

Food style - is unique, the menus, the way its served, definitely among the best you get in this city

Food quantity - sufficient

Food quality - chi is the the most important part, this is disappointing. It looks good, but definitely doesn't taste so. The chicken meat were tough, the lamb gave out a typical smell which could not be digested properly.¬†

Price - it comes in the category of premium restaurants and definitely price is on higher side and not worth the quality.

Definitely disappointed but will go again to try some other menu, and may be can review the place better.

Went for a, Sunday lunch about 2 pm. 1st my son selected a table by the window but the staff told us that reserved by whome no idea we stayed a good 2 hour never saw anybody coming. Now about the service we wait for 30 min or more for the starter's and then also they forgot to bring our drinks. So service is a issue.  Now about the food overall OK. Because of the long wait we lost our interest .

Went on Thursday 17.12.16, it was a mixed felling for me, situated on the top floor of Acropolis mall.
We ordered sizzlers and mushroom gwaloti kebabs. total bill was 870 + tax = 1200 (round off)
Cons: Price is on the higher side in compare to the quantity served. Sizzler served was not at its sizzling condition as we are familiar in mocambo, peter cat, etc. Kebab does not felt as kebab.¬† 
Pros: good ambiance, decor, comfort. no issues if you have a infant/kid , staffs are very very good, you have a smoking chamber inside the house. Service was very prompt. The menu is designed and planned in such a way that What ever you order, for 2 portions, the bill will be approx¬† 1200/- inclusive of tax.

As the name says Portuguese Goodness....and yes it's just that. They specialise in Peri Peri flavour. Half chicken and Chicken Cataplana are among their signature dishes. The right blend of spices and a touch of tanginess makes them delicious. Coming to the service and ambience, the interior of the restaurant has its own Portugese touch. The staff and the service is good.Worth the value of money. A must visit for those who wants to tickle your taste bud.

Visited Barcelos on weekday for lunch. When we entered only 2 tables were occupied so there was no delay in service. Coming to the food we ordered two mocktails along with Chicken Picantte and Mutton Kebab sizzler. We thought of ordering one more item once we finish off those two but food quantity was pretty good esp the mutton kebab sizzler. There were I guess 5 or 6 mutton kebabs served on bed of lots of veggies and rice. A good dish it was. Coming to chicken picantte I ordered the Very Peri one as I love my food to be hot though it was not at all hot. But taste wise can't complain. A chicken breast stuffed with generous amount of cheese , it was super yum. Mocktails were served in big tall glasses. Lastly ordered chocolate trufile cake with ice cream and biscotti to end the lunch on sweet note. Overall it was a good experience. The place is value for money.

Took White Wine with Grapes & Pomegranate and White wine with Minty Magic. Both were good. As appetizers we opted for Chicken Liver with Bun. Tasted awesome. We also ordered Grilled Veggies with Wedges on the side. Presentation in all the cases were good. I need to mention about the Peri sauces one would find on each table. You can find Mild Peri, Very Peri & Super Peri. However, serving time needs to improve a lot. Guys pls improve on that

Coming to food,they have this red and black burgers which are an attraction.
We ordered fish kebab, peri peri black magic and chicken burger with one sides for each burger.
The food was okay, nothing very extra ordinary.
The burgers were good if not very good and we ordered french fries and potato wedges as sides,those were served in good amount.
The fish was okay.
A little overpriced considering the food.
Otherwise it is okay for a one time visit

This place is in my wishlist since long. So finally went there on a saturday evening. Situated on 4th floor of acropolis mall. Yes the first peri peri portugese restro in kolkata. The moment you enter here you will surely fall for this place. The decoration and ambience is so nice. Staffs are v.well mannered.
Now coming to the food had PERI PERI BLACK MAGIC BURGER (with 1 side). For the side chose grilled veggies. This was my first experience of having such type of burger other than the regular ones. Burger was good. The meat inside was juicy and succlucent. The veggies contains sauted brocoli, mushrooms, green and yellow bell peppers. All in one good.
Then took one chicken steak (with 1side). Chose mashed potatoes but the waitress told that it was not available. So took potato wedges. Steak was good but not upto the mark. The meat was juicy. But not like i had before.
Luckily the happy hour was going on (1:1 on beverages). Took Gin. It was actually complimenting both the dishes.
Now the price. For the burger it was really worth the money. But for the steak... NO. The actual bill was 820. But they charge extra 10% service charge, 14.5% on foods, 27% on liquor and again service tax 6%. So the total bill came Rs 1088. Really too much!
Anyways will recommend to visit once. Just to experience the peri peri flavour.

Peri Peri chicken. ....lovely... now I don't need to travel to Gurgaon to have Peri Peri :-).

It also serves alcohol and a very family setup. 

With drinks and for a full stomach of Peri Peri stuff charge per person approx Rs1000. 00

Thanks and keep this up

I had visited the place with high expectation. I read the reviews before so that I have a good idea of what to order. When I ordered for chicken steak I had particularly asked them for skinless chicken as the steak tends to become very hard if it is made with the skin. But they had paid no heed to it. The chicken in all the items we have ordered had 2 things in common. All of them were tasteless and dry.
Thoroughly disappointed.

So Barcelos was on my wish list for a long time. The interiors are inviting. The staff is very courteous. They have 4 varieties of sauces on their table. I loved the tangy lemon one. We ordered for a mini burger platter. It had black beauty, white burger,red burger and the classic one. Garlic bread was just fine. Nothing great. 3 dips served with it was very nice. We had a rice dish which was nice. The rice had a smoky flavour in it. We ordered molecular drinks. Tangy mango and Kiwi Kooler. Both were nice üòÅ
The quantity they provide is not appreciable. Over all a good experience.üëç

Location: situated on the 4th floor of acropolis mall, just mext to kitchen asia owned by mainland china.

Interior designing: When you enter, it is basically all vacant. But it is very pretty. There is also a smoking room that is in a shape of a phone booth. If you go more inside, it has more chairs and tables. Gives pretty nice comfort to sit on.

Food and service: coming to the service, they are really nice and sweet. They cater to your every needs. Coming to the main part, the food, we ordered:
‚Ä¢ The burger platter: we ordered for this as it has 4 different burgers. Red, black, white and original. Two were mutton and two were chicken with two sides. All of them practically taste the same. I expected them to have different flavours so it was disappointed. 
‚Ä¢ cheesy chicken wrap: this one was a total disappointment. The wrap was really hard and we really did not eat it. It was bad. Not worth it.

It is  a pending review. Been to this place to try out some peri peri chicken and some Portuguese cuisine. It was an early dinner so most of the tables were vacant. For starter nothing was available as been told by the waiter due to some kitchen issues. Ok we were fine. So we straight away wanted to had Peri Peri chicken but it was also a NO. The waiter told the chicken needed to prepare this dish is not available. And trust me we were like leaving the place and coming out. But any how stayed back and order for salad. ‚óè Pear and chicken salad. A very sweet one. It was okayish. Nothing much to impress the taste buds. Next ordered ‚óè Grilled half chicken with French fries and mayonnaise. It was tasty and the pieces were big enough. Hot and spicy. Liked it.
‚óè Chicken trinchando. It was a Sizzler. Came up with rice and veggies. Not at all worth it. I didn't liked the preparation. All this were accompanied by ‚óè Kiwi cooler.  Refreshing and chilled. ‚óèIndian classic kala. Same like Masala thums up  type.
Though the inner decor was nice but foodwise I didn't liked the place and even the price was on higher side.

Barcelos - An offbeat restaurant on the lines of Chilli's serving world cuisine.We went for Sunday night dinner and got a seat immediately.We ordered the coloured burgers which is their speciality alongside a grilled chicken piece and lime soda.The burgers were like a mini platter.You may choose various combos with Mutton.The taste was good and filling.Grilled vegetables as sides enhanced the mood.Overall nice food and good ambience.The music could be a little low and not loud as it was.Overall : 4 stars.Cheers...

If you like to experiment with food, then try Barcelos. Been there multiple times already and loved almost everything that we have tried. Chicken Picante stands out as my favorite - moist chicken stuffed with cheese and pepper fillings - and is a meal in itself. If you are visiting in a group of 3 or more, do try the kebab platter (its different from the kebabs we are used to in Mughlai restaurants) and the varieties are exciting.¬†
Most of their sizzlers are good but you can try the Fish sizzler (again because the fish stays moist - feels fresh) and the spices are not overwhelming. If you want something spicy, then try the Chicken Trinchando sizzler. My friends like the chicken salad (try if you can stay on diet, even while dining out) :D
The drinks are tad expensive and nothing out of the world (apart from the presentation).
Barcelos is a good competition to Chilli's and a blessing for foodies like us :)

The ambiance and service everything was good. However I feel that this place is a bit overpriced. I find the quantity food in the sides to be less.
The food menu comprises of the following food categories - burgers and mini burgers, kebabs (with 12 veg options), typical Portuguese and Middle Eastern dishes like Espetada and Arabic Mezze Platter, salads, sizzlers, rice preparations in Afro Portuguese fusions, breads, side dishes, dips, milk shakes, drinks, molecular drinks, fresh juices, hot beverages and desserts.

Visited Barcelos on the 19th of November. Was pretty happy with the experience. It's very rare that when you visit a restaurant they ask you if you're comfortable with the table you're seated at etc. (Special mention to Vijay Yadav!) their portions are huge so go with a group of a 4-6 so that you can try a couple of things and finish them all. 
Their burgers are apparently healthy (no they're not) and look exotic (yes they do). The white one sucks. The black one is really really good and the red one is alright (order the burger platter). 
The sides are insane and I mean it. I personally didn't like the Arabic platter but my bestfriend did so overall I believe I have no qualms In recommending this place (although I strongly feel a couple of things like some of the staff constantly hovering around our table could be done away with + ordered bottomless Coke but their machine went bad so had to wait for a refill). 
Above and beyond that - pretty nice experience and wouldn't mind visiting it again (they have thank you vouchers of ‚Çπ200 customer loyalty game on point!) 

PS : Sampita had no idea about the Little voucher - just to let you know 
It's applicable on the taxed amount and not the untaxed amount. (Would have ended up ordering something else to avail the offer and the experience would have not been so hunky dory)

Fascinated by the colorful burgers and all the reviews, we headed towards Barcelos and ordered a combination of 2 chicken mini burgers(White and Red) and 1 veg mini burger(Brown) in Mild Peri flavor though they didn't let us customize the burger's individual flavor :( along with a Ferrero Rocher milkshake. No doubt the milkshake was amazing with the exact amount of chocolate and hazelnuts to my taste. The chicken burgers were attractive by look but I have to mention, they lacked that special twist, infact had to gulp them with the Tangy Lemon and Very Peri sauce served on our table. Coming to the decor, the world-map-light was catchy and a nice ambience to chill out with friends. But again, the chicken inside the burgers need a bit of taste and flavor Barcelos :)

Compared to its contemporaries, Barcelos isn't as radiating as them but makes up for it by rendering delectable burgers and molecular drinks. 

The four mini chicken burger is enough to fill major portion of your hunger. The red, white and black burger patties are weirdly delicious and worth the innovation. The garlic fish with rice is worth the money. I also think that few dishes are overpriced.

The service is not up to the mark and the extra 10% service charge for nothing is what deters me from visiting the place again.

If there is one thing why Kolkata is Kolkata for its residents and admirers ‚Äì it would be the food. No, I don‚Äôt challenge the people, the culture, but if there is one thing that stands out in this city, it would surely be the culinary joys it has to offer ‚Äì and I am sure many would agree. For a mad-about-food city, the lack of proper global cuisines was always surprising ‚Äì I mean the Chinese, Continental (colonial influence), Mughlai, Bengali, North Indian, and (vegetarian) South Indian cuisines were always available and admittedly superb, but the lack of a proper pan-Asian, or American, or even Lebanese joint was conspicuous for a long time. It is only over the last couple of years that a host of such joints has opened, and have actively contributed in broadening the horizons of food for the people of Kolkata ‚Äì and Barcelos is one of those. It promises Portuguese cuisine, something that is not common at all ‚Äì and I admit that the promise is sacrosanct. What they do, however, is serve continental food with a twist and some west-European flavors, mainly the Piri Piri spice or sauce.

I happened to visit here on a Durgapuja afternoon, and while the crowd stayed at the more renowned Chili‚Äôs and Asia Kitchen, we found ourselves a table at Barcelos. For starters, we ordered the Boneless Thighs with Onions and Peppers, Stuffed Chicken Kebabs, and Cheesy Chicken Fries. The boneless thighs were great, the meat was tender and the marinade was subtle yet flavorful. The fries were good too, with a generous portion of olives along with cheese and chicken strips. However, the best of the starters were the Stuffed Kebabs ‚Äì rolls of chicken breast stuffed with cheddar, jalapenos and olives, grilled to perfection. We were hungry, and the starters flew off our plates. We also ordered a couple of drinks, and the Mango Tango was spicy and yum, really nice.

For the mains, we ordered a Too Much Peri Peri Black Magic Burger, a Red Meaty Burger, a Chicken Espetada, and a Chicken Trinchado Sizzler. The Trinchado, a native Portuguese dish, was the first to arrive on our table, and it was the most mediocre item of the meal. The Chicken was well done, but somehow the flavors of the rice, the chicken steaks and the cheese did not complement each other and felt like having been put together without much thought. I later did a small research on Trinchado, and I doubt that it was cooked the authentic way, which calls for a generous amount of red wine or brandy. However, the mug of grilled vegetables served by the side was absolutely brilliant, and a nice surprise! 

Next up were the burgers ‚Äì and they are unique at Barcelos because of the bun color. We had ordered one black and one red. The Black one was double chicken, and it tasted heavenly! In fact, it surely is one of the best burgers you can find in Kolkata. The Red Meaty was a lamb burger, and it tasted good too ‚Äì however the mutton patty had a faint smell which you generally find in the meat of old goats, and that was a little unexpected. Didn‚Äôt stop us from wolfing it down though! The last of the lot, and fittingly so, was the Chicken Espetada ‚Äì the famous hanging meal of Barcelos. It comes with a hanging skewer with chicken pieces and veggies, coupled with two sides; and we opted for mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. This serving style is pretty darn attractive, and the chicken was really well done and again, subtly flavored with a mild peri-peri sauce. The sides were also quite good, and by the time we were done, the four of us were full. We ended with some Vanilla Ice-cream and Brownies ‚Äì and the ice-cream was really nice. You can‚Äôt go wrong with Vanilla.

Overall, Barcelos is a great place to try out. While some of its preparations may fall short of expectations, the average quality is quite good. It is serving up some different kind of food, so if you are in the mood for something other than the usual Kolkata fare, hit this place. It looks nice too, and I would rate it 4/5. People have written it is overpriced, but I don‚Äôt feel so at all, in fact I guess the pricing is on the moderate side. Before I forget, while at it, do read the Legend of Barcelos ‚Äì quite interesting.

Post movie, we were looking for a place to have our dinner. We were making our way to Hoppipola when we got a glimpse of Barcelos. At first sight, it reminded me of Nando's. We checked out the menu and were happy to see the variety of burgers on display. So decided to make our pit stop there.

The place has both indoor seating and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is not that great. Whereas the indoor decor is nice and soothing to the eye with beautiful painting adorning the walls. The staff is prompt and courteous and is a big help in deciding the menu. So for our dinner, we got the following

1. Black Beauty
2. Red Hottie

Both of these are burgers. Vegetarian burgers on that. You can choose a variety of options with regards to the spiciness and tanginess of the food. You can also choose as to what side dish you want. We went for same old fries and it was amazing!

3. Falafel with Yogurt Dip: nice munching dish!
4. Oreo Shake: very refreshing!

The presentation was nice and the portions were good enough for two people. Hardly anyone was there when we were having our dinner so worked on our favor in terms of having a long winding chat over n number of things.

Totally LOVED the fun concept of colored burgers at Barcelos! The chicken patties in the burgers were beautifully done. I took a platter of their small bite sized red, brown, black & white chicken burgers. 
However the petty Peri Peri Sauces kept on tables didn't excite me too much as the hotness levels didn't match up to my expectations! 
I had also taken a Kiwi Cooler which was a visual treat! It tasted very ordinary but the visual excitement keeps you going! 
The bottomless aerated beverage that I'd ordered was way way way below standards with the aerated level of the beverage totally on the flat side. After repeated requests to serve us with freshly opened aerated beverage, they gave up and instead compensated with a fresh lime soda. Barcelos, you lost your 0.5 points there and my faith in your aerated beverages!
The decor is done well and is a fun place to hang out with friends.

This was a sudden lunch plan and though I was not in a mood to have burgers, 3 of us landed here.
Our order-3 mini veg burgers, Cataplana rice with yogurt dip, Peri Peri paneer kebabs
Peri Peri paneer kebabs-I wonder if they really meant the kebabs. Because they are just plain grilled peri peri paneer. Name aside, it was wonderful and an indication of the better things to come.
Mini Burgers-I had the Black one and the filling was fresh and tasted great. The assortment of sauces at the table ensured that these burgers went off the plates in a flash. The patty was well cooked ,packed with flavor and I particularly loved how it blended with each sauce. My personal favorite being the Mild Peri and Supa Peri.
Special praise for the grilled vegetables side with the burger. I had great grilled vegetables after a long long time.
Cataplana Rice-I didn't expect this dish to be this good especially since I am not a big fan of chickpeas.Its such a wonderful dish with the yogurt dip and its surprising to observe how they came up with yogurt as a dip and yet make it wonderful. The rice had a light fragrance to it and the chickpeas kebabs were wonderful.
Highly recommended.

Overhyped over priced food, nothing to praise like. Definitely not recommended and never going back! Its not well maintained too. Water from a.c. and water speinklers leaking from all over the place. Food is average according to the price (believe me too costly) paid. Chilis is far better and any day preferable. Its like the money paid is justified in Chilis.

Thank you Vijay for an amazing experience at Barcelos! It's my first time here and the hospitality at the dead of night made the already amazing food even better! The Black Burger was delicious.. The trinchado Afro/Portuguese rice dish was yum and the molecular berry cucumber was very 'berry' good! Overall, it was a satisfying end to a great Diwali.. keep up the great work guys :)

This is a very delicious place, situated at the 4th floor of Acropolis. The food was very nice. We ordered the famous cheesy chicken espetada and it was delicious. Also we ordered some mini burgers. Wanted to taste the burgers in different colors of bread and I wasn't disappointed. The ambiance and service everything was good. However I feel that this place is a bit overpriced. I find the quantity food in the sides to be less.

I loved this place a lot. Starting from the ambience to the food. Even the presentation of the food was very good. Compared to other restaurants like Chili's and TGIF, this place is comparatively a tad bit cheaper. 
The mini burgers were very good. So we're the Portuguese kebabs. The peri peri sauce was very different. They had various versions of it like the mild peri and the veri peri. 

Barcelos is located on the fourth floor of Acropolis Mall. I am definitely coming back again to try out the other dishes. Kudos guys...

Their Kala khatta was awesome and about the brownie shake can't really say much as it's my weakness...loved it there. The staffs are warm and friendly.

Peach iced tea was horrible. 
Veg espetada-after 20 mins when they served it the food was freezing cold, when we complained, they again took 20 mins and served freezing cold food again. When we complained, they accepted that they were serving an inappropriately prepared dish to us and also accepted that the manager and owner were aware of this. When we asked them to call the chef, the chef ignored us and chose to laugh at us with the waiters. After 10 mins he came to us and he again accepted the flaws of the food. He also agreed that the management is aware of the problem. The chef is least bothered about the food. It seems that the staff is at war with the management and we are the victims. 
Mini burger- the patties inside were frozen. When we asked for the number of the owner, Mr. Roychoudhury, the person who attended us was unwilling to provide us with the number. 
This restaurant has wasted our dining experience and we returned empty stomach. People should avoid this restaurant.

The first impression of this place is indeed interesting. Myriad paintings on the wall, subtle ambiance, makes it a great weekend haunt . Coming to the food, the impression wasn't as bright as one would expect. The burger I ordered was just about ok. For a high-end joint, with posh interiors and a name to flaunt - one would definitely had expected a little more effort. I tried the famous black burgers - the best thing about them were that they were black and nothing about the taste matched up to the aesthetics. I certainly have to say, i prefer taste over cosmetic value anyday - and a certain other chain definitely fares better on the burger front. The wedges were the only hero here.¬†
About the staff, they generally seemed uninterested, though courteous when they needed to be. The music was great but the TV constantly played Animal Planet which I reckon can be suitable for a waiting room in of a health clinic as opposed to a restaurant. Overall, I wanted to try the place once, and I did.

Visited this place today. Thought of using the little coupin and informed the staff that if they accept little coupon. After eating the food wanted to use the coupon but they said they generated bill and cant use. Very poor behavior and staff very rude and no knowledge how to behave. I have used little and nearbuy coupon at many places and anytime I give them are always ok with any restaurant unless they specifically ask at the beginning. Horrible behavior.

Food is over hyped and over price. One fourth chicken After taxes will cost you 300 approx whixh we can get better tasting 4 PCs hot and cripsy from kfc which is better in taste. The hanging chicken is worst..under cooked and five regular kebab pieced for 450+ after taxes.

Nothing special about taste and horrible staff behavior ...never going back and go only if u want to waste the money which can be better spent

We went around 10pm on a Wednesday, only two other tables were occupied. We wanted to sit more towards the inside but the staff said that section was closed and besides, they were all six seaters. I can understand closing off a section because there aren't enough diners, but why can't two people sit at a table of their choice when almost the entire place is empty and its near closing time, with no possibility of even one six-member dining party coming in? My Barcelos experience thus started on an iffy note.

We ordered the garlic bread, the half chicken, the tangy mango molecular drink and garlic fish with rice (this last being take away). Garlic bread was nothing exceptional. The chicken portions were surprisingly small, this is what Nando's offers when you order their 1/4 chicken. It was good to eat, but the plates are so ridiculously small that with every stab of my knife and fork I was scared of throwing the chicken piece on the table or worse, sending it flying through the air. ¬†Maybe they have these plates to make their portions look bigger? But this needs serious consideration, as it completely ruins the dining experience. The tangy mango drink was really good, but the garlic fish was a let down. Four one-inch pieces of fish in rice with dozens and dozens of green pepper pieces. Maybe they should consider renaming the dish to Green Pepper with rice?¬†

The best take-away from this experience was the Game of Thrones theme song playing on the sound system. Have never heard that version and its great. Overall, did not match up to my high expectations.

So everyone knows about this place and I know it needs no introduction... Ambience is awesome... Deco was mind blowing too... it will surely give you a feel of Barcelos...

Since I didn't tried Portuguese cuisine previously... I can't compare it with anyone... Now coming to the service it was undoubtedly very good... Staffs are courteous... but in my opinion they need to be more attentive...

In the food we ordered for...

‚òÖ Tangy mango drink¬ª¬ª¬ª It tasted good but we expected something more... Since it was a molecular drink...

‚òÖ Berry cucumber drink¬ª¬ª¬ª copy comment from above...

‚ô° Cheesecake shake¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent drink... highly recommended...

‚òÖ Date with orange¬ª¬ª¬ª Okish one nothing extraordinary...

‚ô° Half chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome one... Very tasty... you just need to choose you sauce from their 4 varieties according your taste buds...

‚ô° Mini burgers- 2 mutton, 2 chicken with spicy rice and french fries... we got all the 4 colour buns for our burgers... the mutton burgers tasted awesome... specially with black buns... the chicken tasted good too... french fries were tasty but the spicy rice was a total set back... it was not at all spicy...

‚ô° Chicken espetada¬ª¬ª¬ª Their famous hanging chicken dish... presentation was excellent tasted awesome too...

‚òÖ Peri peri chicken sizzler¬ª¬ª¬ª Didn't liked it at all... expect the chicken nothing in the dish was good... Very unfortunate...

Hence it was and mix experience of good and bad... their are scopes for improvement always... Pocket pinch was considerable...

Portuguese & Middle Eastern Delicacies @ Barcelos, Acropolis Mall, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Occasion: Tasting & Review Session by Invitation

Barcelos, the international restaurant brand, primarily famous for it's grilled Portuguese dishes (read chicken) and Peri Peri sauces, and a proud presence in around 20 countries, has finally opened it's outlet in Kolkata. It's other two Indian presences are in New Delhi and Jaipur.

Situated on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall, Barcelos is an L shaped spacious restaurant with assorted seating arrangements and a bar counter with high stools. Red and yellow sofas stand out, in an otherwise brown-beige setting. Ceiling is black with exposed AC columns. Brown colored wooden tiles adorn the flooring. A small seating area at the far end from the entrance is created on a slightly elevated floor. It enjoys good sunlight and has a nice outside view.

A big wooden world map installation on one of the walls and murals on some other walls look quite nice and noticeable. Some LED TVs are also thrown in to complete the quorum. Nice background music keeps the ambiance live.

Barcelos uses high quality kitchen gadgets to concoct it's signature dishes. All such specialized machines are imported directly from Italy.

Though this chain is primarily famous for it's non veg preparations, enough vegetarian options occupy an ample space on their menu, to cater to the needs of the vegetarian diners.

The food menu comprises of the following food categories - burgers and mini burgers, kebabs (with 12 veg options), typical Portuguese and Middle Eastern dishes like Espetada and Arabic Mezze Platter, salads, sizzlers, rice preparations in Afro Portuguese fusions, breads, side dishes, dips, milk shakes, drinks, molecular drinks, fresh juices, hot beverages and desserts.

When Barcelos opened around 5 months back, it created a buzz in the Kolkata food scene with the introduction of colored burger buns! Their burger buns are available in - red, black, white and brown (the usual color) colors and they don't use any artificial coloring agent. The aforesaid colors are derived by using beetroot, cocoa and coconut respectively. The diners can order their burgers both without or with one or two side dishes, out of the 8 available side dishes! Alternatively, they can order a platter of 3 to 4 differently colored mini burgers. The prices vary accordingly.

Food items presented for tasting were - ¬†

Tangy Mango: Served in a tall glass with a straw, it consisted of 'mango puree mixed with spices and topped up with sprite'. Liquid nitrogen was poured on it live, right on the dining table, to create the visual appeal of cold vapour and fog. The menu lists Tangy Mango under Molecular Drink category, but apart from the liquid nitrogen showmanship, it's actually a nice tangy mocktail, which a single person may find difficult to finish.

Menu Price: Rs. 205/-

Arabic Mezze Platter: An inviting circular brown cane basket or 'tokri' arrived with an array of 5 black egg shaped melamine bowls consisting of - hummus, baba ganoush, peri hummus, yougurt dip and tabouli. Placed within the arc of these bowls were 4 crisp sesame seeds topped falafels, and the arc was completed into a circle with 16 portions of conical pita breads. 5 long triangular lavash were fixated in a vertical position between the aforesaid bowls and the basket.

The platter looked inviting and sumptuous. Falafels were well cooked and crunchy. Pita breads were soft and porous. Lavash portions were also good. All the dips were excellent. Peri hummus and tabouli were new for me.

For those who don't know -

"Peri Peri or Piri piri¬†sauce (used as a seasoning or marinade) is Portuguese in origin. It is made from crushed chillies, citrus peel, onion, pepper, salt, lemon juice, bay leaves, paprika, pimiento, basil, oregano, and tarragon."

"Tabouli or Tabbouleh is a Middle Eastern vegetarian dish traditionally made of tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, bulgur, and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt."

Menu Price: Rs. 295/-

Veg Espetada: This vegetarian avatar of Espatada, a popular Portuguese dish, consisted of a hanging dish skewed with stuffed mushrooms, stuffed potato, marinated paneer and pineapple with onion & bell peppers. The hanging metallic skewer was quite long, which made the dish look quite spectacular. Placed below the skewer was a rectangular black plate full of potato wedges (a side dish) and a dip. The wedges were thick, uniformly cooked and well seasoned. They tasted excellent. In fact, they were one of the best potato wedges that I have had till date.

The marinated food portions were big and juicy. Though their marination was different from the ones that we are normally used to, they tasted quite nice.

Menu Price: Rs. 375/-

4 Veg Mini Burger: 4 diagonally arranged mini burgers, with their burger buns colored in the hues of red, black, white and brown, arrived on a flat wooden tray with a handle, like the one used for serving pizzas. They were accompanied with a side serving of spicy rice, in a circular ceramic bowl.

The burgers constituted of - onion, lettuce, tomato, pickled jalape√±o, peri mayo and aloo patty. Unlike others, aloo patty in the red burger was also red colored. These patties were actually frozen patties, that were fried just before serving.

Apparently, being a franchise, the restaurant finds it difficult to change the cooking protocols, set in place by the restaurant brand. Resultantly, though the burgers looked dainty and beautiful, they lacked the taste of fresh potato mixture and presence of other elements like caramelized onions etc., which assist in making a burger sumptuous and popular.

Upon suggesting, the management did agree to discuss the recipe and cooking modifications required to enhance the taste of their burgers, with the parent company. Hopefully, in near future this beautiful dish of theirs will taste as yummy as their other dishes.

Menu Price: Rs. 445/-

In Barcelos, apart from the other condiments, you will find each dining table laced with 4 variations of Peri Peri, the famous Portuguese sauce. Named as per the varying degree of their chilly content, these sauces are named - Mild Peri, Very Peri, Supa Peri and Tangy Lemon. I tried a small portion of each. It will require some more tryings, before I can develop a taste for them.

The dining experience at Barcelos was quite nice. Staff was warm and hospitable, and quite apt in answering the diners' queries. This kind of staff training is very much expected of the new restaurants offering unusual foreign cuisines or fusion foods. I was glad to witness the same there.

With ample space, extensive platters and appealing beverages, Barcelos seems a cool hangout place to chill out with a group of friends or peers.

Visited Barcelos on 15th Oct with my family...We were all looking forward to visit this interesting place with Afro Portuguese cuisine . ¬†Unfortunately the visit was not all that great. ¬†First the ambiance, the AC was not chilled enough when we entered at around 12.30, perhaps they put it on late and to be fair, it ¬†did ¬†get cool later. The Chairs and Sofa seating were very badly aligned with the Table height. If you sat on the Sofa, you found yourself well below the table and if you chose the chairs you were ¬†reclining too far back.

The food - pretty average overall. They had placards announcing Kolkata Bekti so we ordered the Bekti items as starters. ¬†Being lovers of Bekti fish for years, we found the fish served not really having the authentic taste of Bekti, the pieces seemed to disintegrate when you picked them up with a fork and the flesh inside was rather too fibrous.. ¬†The stuffed chicken kabab was okay but the boneless bekti with parmesan cheese was horribly salty. ¬†The signature Chicken with Peri Peri sauce was pretty average . Spicy rice as a 'side' with some dishes had long but thick coarse ¬†grained rice - when we inquired what rice they use we were told Basmati. I think it was Basketti - a cheaper different variety altogether and not at all suitable to serve at a place like this.

Service was amateurish ¬†and I would not like to blame the young boys and girls ¬†- they were attentive but seemed to lack training. ¬†Slow to bring the food and over quick to clear the dishes when one had barely put down one's spoon/fork. ¬† Pile up of dirty dishes near the kitchen counter in full view of guests was not a pleasant sight to look at.

On the dushomi day we decided to visit this Portuguese restaurant located at the top floor in Acropolis Mall... we were warmly welcomed and seated comfortably, order was quickly served except for the mocktail which they forgot and was given after the bill was placed and that too on reminder... Talking about the food which was very really nice and it was in great quantity... food and decor is really nice but however felt that the staff couldnt manage the population even though the tables weren't full...really looking forward to the improvised service next tym :)

The one n only barcelos in kolkata.. A decent place to go and try something out of the box .. The advertisements of the red, black burgers tempted me to check this out.. We ordered half chicken and 3 mini burger with spicy rice as side dish.. Half chicken was delicious.. The chicken was barbequed n roasted with peri peri sauces.. In the tables they also provided us with varities of tangy, spicy, peri peri sauces.. The types of sauces are the speciality of the dishes.. Every dish is cooked using the sauces.. We tried all the 4 types of peri peri sauces with the chicken.. The mild peri peri tasted nice... The burgers were the best and hence is the main attraction of the place.. Black and red burgers were awesome with spicy sauce and yummy chicken stuffings.. White burger amongst all was the best.. The bread is yummy and soft. White burger was prepared with lots of mayonnaise and cheese with chicken cooked in sauce and stuffed inside.. The place is decently priced.  Quantity is good for the price they charge and its totally worth visiting them..

overhyped , overpriced and UNDER STAFFED !!
we went in group of three for dinner on nabami 2016 and as expected it turned out to be an almost full house. now when you dont have staff to cater the space efficiently , don't fill it up entirely. we waited for like 15 minutes for getting the menu card , another 20 mins for getting attention of the staff for placing the order , the food though came in without much lag , again almost half an hour to clear the cheque. We were so frustrated with the management to get this kind of service even after paying a service charge of 10% on the bill, seeing only 3-4 stewards attending all the tables, the receptionist also helping them apart from handling the front desk.I thought of reporting this , but they don't even have a feedback form in their system.
The food we had was 3 MINI BURGERS (RED/BLACK/WHITE) , CHEESY CHICKEN ESPETEDA , HALF GRILLED CHICKEN WITH PERI PERI SAUCE . these stood nice , well presented and came with one side each as we chose. the Burgers and espeteda are the ones i would like to recommend. For dessert , they restricted us with just two options , none with chocolate in them , we had BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE which fell short of perfection, asking for a long way to improve.
Overall , i was not satisfied with this kind of experience for the price paid , it was okay for a one time go.

Visited this place on Navami afternoon, and it was totally packed. As we needed only two seats, so the wait was comparatively much less as compared to the big gang of friends who had to wait for atleast an hour :P. The ambience, decor everything impresses you the moment you enter Barcelos. The staff is over- friendly , I must say, as they were coming by and asking us if we needed anything else every 15 minutes . ¬†Coming to the food, the mini burger platter is definitely a must try. I ordered for the Red, White and Black burger - ¬†and each tasted much above average, though the black was on the sweeter side. Next, the stuffed chicken kebabs is not that great, it was very bland with regard to the taste, and you need to use the sauces well to get a taste out of it. Now coming to the main dish, Chicken Espetada - This was a true delight, everything was perfect in this dish. The chicken was cooked to perfection , perfect balance of spices and order this dish or any espetada for its presentation :D.
Overall, very nice place and you wont be disappointed by their service and food.¬†
P.S. - Order your side dishes carefully :)

Went there with my family during durga puja. It was rather empty compared to the other food chains adjacent to it and we didn't mind. We ordered a half chicken with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies,chicken Cataplana with youghurt dip, grilled fish sizzler and parmesan crushed betki. The chicken  was soft, juicy and the mashed potatoes was one of the best I ever had. The chicken Cataplana was also good, with the sauteed vegetables. But the best dishes of the evening were the ones with fish.

The only problem we faced was the unavailability of sangria, contrary to what the signs read outside of being Kolkata's only sangria bar. So we had to settle for classic mojito. And also the service was not up to the mark for such a place. But the food was great.

This was the last day in the city and this outlet happened purely because of coincidence. I was just at the acropolis mall¬†when I saw this store. And as the waiter informed it is only present in Delhi, Jaipur and Kolkatta as of now. They have ¬†plans to open an outlet in Mumbai soon so I am glad that I came down this rather exclusive restaurant.¬†

Well, the concept of peri-peri has already been tried by me in the Vasant Kunj outlet of Nandos. The peri peri is divided¬†into 4 categories basis their spice quotient. But the concept of the black burger is something unique and I definitely ¬†wanted to give it a try. So I ordered a peri peri black magic, which was their simplest chicken burger along with a side ¬†of grilled vegetables.¬†

The burger was definitely above average but considering the cold that I had, I wasn't able to make out the subtle flavours¬†within the food. The grilled vegetables (which included capsicum, zuccini and mushrooms) seemed to be fried a bit too much ¬†along with plenty of addition of soy sauce which I am not so much a fan of. ¬†

I will give this place another try whenever I am in the city to try out their black and red burgers.

Hopefully these guys - come soon to other cities ( I refer to the likes of Bangalore and Hyderabad). And guys, please do get an Amex card machine. :D

Portuguese restaurant at the heart of the city has owned its fame through the taste of exotic peri peri spice from Africa. The style of serving the dishes is unique and gives u a fine dining experience. We had the following:

Cheesy chicken fries: piled up from base with French fries, colored peppers n chicken with loaded cheddar cheese n baked with peri peri. Unique flavor makes ur tastebuds feel good.
Full Chicken [Barcelos special]: the whole chicken marinated with different spices roasted till perfection gives a blend of all flavours when u feel the food. Served with mashed potatoes n pepper tossed rice is perfect as a wholesome meal.

Overall, unique taste n blend of spices that flavors the tastebuds to visit again.

One of the Durga Puja days, I visited this place for lunch along with a friend on mine. It's a newly opened restaurant, so did not really know what all food to order. Inspite of new, the place had 15-30 mins waiting due to festive season. However we agreed to sit on bar top, hence we immediately got a place. 

After entering the place, the set up seemes TGIF alike. Due to the festive rush the service wasn't prompt, but all the staffs were very humble and accommodative. The menu looked very unique and delicious. We picked up Cheesy Chicken Espetada (came with 2 side dishes), Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt Dip. From the drinks we got Classic Mojito & Orange Sangria & Nutty Fruity Sunday for dessert. Food and Drinks left us lip smacked, did not give any opportunity to complain. Also I was quite tempted with the Coloured Burgers and Chicken Grills and couple of other items, which I definitely could not try due to appetite. However people around me whoever ordered those seemed like enjoyed eating those as well. I'll wait for my next visit to this place and try out the rest of the items. And not to forget, there non-alcoholic molecular drinks are a treat to the eyes as well as taste buds (I suppose). They have a smoking booth inside the restaurant.

Below goes my individual ratings segment wise:

Food- 5/5
Drinks - 5/5
Service - 4.5/5

Music & Comfy - 3.5/5 (They were busy handling the crowd, this segment remained unnoticed)
Value for Money - 4.5/5

Portuguese cuisine in Kolkata is definitely a crowd puller. The city boasts of some of the best restaurants in the country but all this while it lacked a Portuguese restaurant which has been fulfilled by Barcelos. Located in Acropolis Mall the ambience is just the right kind of escape to kick away your vexatious and enjoy a wholesome with either your family or special someone. Nurturing a penchant for everything exotic it was the colour splash of mini burgers that instantly drew my attention. Although they were mini but it gave me quite a tough time to finish it. The icing on the cake was the myriad range of assorted peri peri sauce that imbued new flavours everytime I added them in rotation! Loved the decor and the configuration of cutleries especially flavoured water. Keep up the good work!

The concept of coloured burger buns is very innovative and cool. We had ordered the 2 chicken 2 mutton platter,out of which the mutton patty with black bun was the best. We had also ordered a grilled fish sizzler and a chicken cataplana with yoghurt dip, both of which were equally good. Among the deserts,we had Tiramisu and a choc truffle cake which were a bit of a letdown, which is why am deducting that 0.5 rating. However, its definitely something new and a must visit. Thumbs up to the ambience.

The one stop place for a perfect continental meal. The place was on my wishlist for a while now and it has realy stood upto its reputation it seems. The ambience was great and the service was fast and apt. When it comes to food, the place is actually up there with the top continental joints in the city. We ordered a Fully stuffed non veg burger with one side, a steak and a cosmoplitan. The burger was a sight to watch and the steak was absolutely fantastic. It is definitely worth the money. A must visit .

After much wait with great expectations we finally landed at Barcelos.
Location: top floor of the Acropolis Mall, beside a number of strong competitors viz. Chili's, Asia kitchen etc.
We went on Nabami afternoon at around 12.15am and to our surprise we were the first and only guest then. Though shortly it started filling quiet fast. 
Ambience: Loved the ambience, hanging lamps, posters. Little more care to be taken for cleanliness. The peri peri sauces' bottles are little sticky due to usage. 
Service: some of the staffs are new and are not fully aware of the menu list, even went totally blank for few seconds sometime!
The foods were served quiet fast though.
Food: We opted for two soft drinks kiwi cooler and mint cooler. Both are absolutely amazing. The presentations are nice. 
4 variety of peri peri sauces are available  , on the basis of their hotness: tangy, mild, very peri, supa peri. We opted for mild peri for all our orders as all the 4 sauces are available on table all the time. 
We chose stuffed chicken kebab as starters. It was quiet bland if one doesn't or sauce separately. The barcelos signature style grilled chicken is just amazing. Little oil, tender chicken, dip and sides as per one's choice...perfect!
Our next selection was chicken picantte that turned out to be a little disaster for us. It's supposed to be stuffed chicken. In stuffing they used bread among other ingredients like cheese, veggies etc which was a little turn off. I don't prefer bread in such form, also the  stuffing was on the sour side. We did not like it.
Price: on the higher side. Meal for 2 costed around 1900Rs.

The ambience is pleasant and service was superb. They are specifically famous for the Peri peri chicken and indeed it was great. You get to select two side dishes or one side dish.  We had a half chicken in peri peri sauce and chose a single side dish which was potato wedges woth peri peri mayo dip and it was also yummilicious. I just loved it. Liquor and a wide range of burgers and smoothies and desserts are also available. We were too full to try those out. Do visit this loveky place if you go to Acropolis  Mall.

Barcelos has a very unique menu. But administration fails quite abit.
The staff is inexperienced which shows. They don't maintain the restaurant well. Heavy iron chairs are really difficult to move. AC doesn't work properly. We wanted to sit in a corner with designed interiors but couldn't as the staff stated the AC doesn't work right in that area. The AC where we eventually Sat was supposed to be working well but I strongly recommend they check on that too.
The food was good though they could use a few more minutes in the oven.( It took a great deal effort to cut the pecanetta bread)
I would really  suggest the administrators take note of their dysfunctional interiors and make some much needed improvements

The home of Portuguese flavour, Barcelos has finally arrived in Kolkata bringing with it the unique and the much talked about Peri Peri taste. Situated at the fourth floor of Acropolis Mall, Kasba, Barcelos has caught everybody's attention from the first moment it arrived with its colourful looking burgers.

Food here is impeccable. From the appetizers section we had ordered their-

*Drumsticks: Big sized legs smeared in a satisfactory layer of peri spices and sauces and served with grilled lines on them. With this they asked us to team up the peri sauces on the table. This item was delectable and is a strong, strong recommendation.

*Boneless Thighs with Onion and Pepper: At first this may seem plain to you, but after teaming this up with peri mayo, this item gets elevated to a whole different level. If I have to describe this dish in one word, nothing comes to mind apart from the word 'delicious'.

Even though we were three people, we were semi full after having this much amount of food. Somehow, even though the quantity of food was normal, it managed to fill our tummy. Next we ordered their main course.

*Garlic Fish with Rice: Basa fish, deboned and cooked to perfection. With a hint of garlic, the fillet fell apart with each bite. Rice was okayish. They could have done a better work with it. However, the fish more or less made up for it. Personally, for me, it did not beat the appetizers.

*Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt Dip: Beautiful presentation. Served in a traditional cataplana was a mix of small chicken pieces with peppers of different colours, chickpeas, olives and mushrooms. Again, I was not much impressed with the rice. However, upon mixing the yogurt dip with rice, it did help in typing the dish together.

By this time, we were very full. The quantity again was normal, but I guess the food was semi heavy which ended up in getting us filled that easy.

For drinks we ordered their popular molecular drinks:

*Tangy Mango: A slurp of your childhood. Tangy mango mixed with spices and served in a theatrical way. The drink was tasty. A perfect end to our dinner.

*However we decided to order one last drink, Kit Kat Shake: Served in a mason jar was a thick Kit Kat Shake. Chocolatey in flavour and good taste-wise, but I personally preferred their Molecular Drink more.

Had heard a lot about Bercelos. So decided to went there today. The ambience was good but during puja one really cant blame for any blemishes. We took burgers, appetizers, main course. I found it ok but nothing out of box. Might be due to the puja rush. But will definitely visit on one of the normal days.

We came here with great expectations. Located alongside such good restaurants, Barcelos seemed promising but it was quite a letdown, frankly because of the lack of taste. We just wanted to have a quick  bite, so we went for the 3 chicken burgers, that were colourful burger buns with chicken and maybe 3 different kinds of sauce, which we guessed from the taste, or maybe they were all the same, but we weren't given the descriptions at all. The dish was not so great. Just coloured buns with chicken, mayo and salad. We had the Trinchado rice. Very little rice with almost a quick homemade chicken with peppers and too many black olives and served in a  weird looking cup that was frankly unappealing. These two and the bill was 900. Ambience, service and staff are no doubt good but the food wasn't up to the mark for my liking.

First impression, a decent ambience with live sports screening and decent staffs.
The food the straight up amazing. We ordered chicken steaks at first, and it was by far one of the best we ever had. Secondly we ordered some burgers and those were amazing as well. The meat here is very well cooked. It's pretty juicy and tasted great. We ordered some beers and cocktails as well and they were made to perfection.
Would surely recommend.

Had been hearing about this joint for quite sometime. Went there on an early Saptami evening. Was a bit disappointed. The chicken was cold and hard. The kitkat shake that we had ordered was just about okay. The LIT wasn't what LIT is supposed to be. Inam not sure if the quantities of gin,White rum, or vodka. It tasted more of soda and lemon. I dont know if this was for the pujas or something but expected more out of it.A bit expensive. Waiters were pretty good and knew their stuff.

To start off. Really liked the food. 
The ambience was amazing. The service of the staff was very friendly and humble. 
Now coming to the food. 
The Boneless chicken thigh was amazing, a different type of conceptual food. The main course was very satisfying as well. I had ordered a 4 chicken burger with French fries and a half grilled chicken with mashed potato. The grilled chicken was fabulous. 
Only one thing, I would prefer more options on the liquor menu to choose from. Hopefully they'll add to it. 
The best part, not all walk-in restaurants have in the city is the SMOKING ROOM. 
To sum it up, I've had a great experience at Barcelos. 
Looking forward to dine again.

Today on mahashasthi thought of having food at the restaurant but to my utter disappointment the food was horrible n so was the service.The music was too loud which all the more ruined my experince.The service was not upto the mark as they were not prompt n had no clue about the food they were serving.I would say guys Chili's is a far better place to dine than Barcelos.The place is too clumsy i have to admit n a bit shaby.To add my list of disappointments at this place they had no washrooms or did they give us finger bowls n instead told us to wipe our hands using tissue papers are u kidding me??Food was horrible however i must say the burger was on point n so were the milkshakes.Thats it rest of the food was horrible n i must say their chicken preparations are dry.If u r only fond of burgers give this place a try or else dont visit this place.The staff there asked for my honest feedback n then had the audacity to ask me as to why i was rating them so poorly n they would in turn lose their jobs.Thats not my problem,one word for my experience-DISGUSTING!!!! Never visiting this place again

barcelos is one fine place to have chicken.located on top floor of acropolis mall,it's making a lot of noise among food lovers.The chicken espatada has the juiciest chicken, with rice and mashed potato.They have an inclination to serve food with piri piri masala,which is actually "peri peri" and can be claim to be both African and Portuguese in origin.anyways,their nitro drinks is another cool feature.We had kiwi kooler and tangy mango,which were bot fizz and flavour.The interior is chic,and the waiters are knowledgeable and courteous.

Had Potugese food in the famous outlet of Nandos in Oman and was craving for it eversince. Barcelos is a good alternative added to the gastro-map of Kolkata...on the top floor of Acropolis mall...Kasba. We tried Chicken Espetada which comes in an interesting decor and grilled chicken which was just perfect juicy and tender. To finish off was th Tangy Mango....their molecular drink...a fuming cold drink of unique blend.....super yummy!!! Only thing is the menu is highly chicken based....fish prawn lamb pork options are very few. You'll hv choice of four grades of Peri-peri sauce......an African pepper sauce....of varying hotness.....to light up your dishes. The glowing world map on the wall with their locations pointed out is an awesome sight as well.

'BARCELOS' is the first Portuguese cuisine restaurant in Kolkata.It is located on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall near Kasba New Market.The ambience of the resaturant is good,many portugese wall paintings are hanging on the wall.I've been there with my lover from two weeks back for dinner.We ordered Molecular Drinks:- 'Kiwi Cooler' & 'Tangy Mango' as a beverages,both are tasty & quantity is good also.Then We ordered Mediterranian Kebabs:- 'Chicken Wings',it is four pieces juicy chicken legs,not so oily,taste is good.We also ordered Barcelos Signature Dish:- '1/2 Chicken by itself',two pieces big chicken with grilled,taste is very good,two pieces chicken is sufficient for two presons.Their service is too fast,they served all the items just same time.Also we ordered Portugese Perfection:- 'Chicken Espetada',it is geting cold for their quick service,presentation is very unique,6 pieces chicken hanging with a spring & they served it with some rice & french fries.Atlast we took Dessert:- 'Chocolate Fondant with vanilla Ice-cream',it is mouthlicking.overall nice experience.Price is expensive.They took additional 10% service charge.

Love the ambiance and the bright decor..!! They are the Peri Peri specialist and this dominates almost all the dishes. Tried both fish and the chicken. The preparations are delicious and the chicken/fish and are absolutely soft and juicy. Only thing that I didn't like was the huge proportion of rice in Chicken sizzlers...the chicken could have been more than the quantity of rice that was served, otherwise food is ¬†good and tasty.¬†
U do not have to wait for long after ordering your food, they are quite prompt.

This place holds quite a surprise for its customers. The interior fashions a contemporary look with dim lighting. There is a beautiful wall piece showing the map of the world with lights. The waiters are courteous and professional enough. 

This place is an expert in preparing its dishes with Peri Peri (also read as Piri Piri) sauces. The menu has a variety of grilled dishes as well. We had ordered Chicken Liver with Garlic roll, Plain Chicken Burger and Peri Peri Bloody Red Chicken Burger. The liver was amazing with all the sauces and the garlic bread roll. The burgers on the other hand could have been better we felt.

We are yet to try something from the grill section. Looking forward to it soon.

if you are looking for trying out Portugese and African cuisines, then please visit this eatery located on the upper level of food court of Acropolis Mall, Kasba. Their cuisines are based on different types of peri peri sauce - a tint of which can be tasted by the guests from the bottles stacked at the dining area before placing the order. The staffs are courteous and helpful. The grilled chicken with less oil are the best ones to try out. The chicken was soft and juicy from inside, but somehow i felt that the flavour of the sauce is too tangy..Love the idea of little cute flag marking the choice of the sauce presented with the dish.

Much like hoppipola, the music was excessively loud. But that was toned down soon after requested.
Now coming to the food, absolute bliss. The chicken, marinated for over 24 hours, is precisely the best chicken in any form. The lemon rice and mini burgers.
Please visit this place to give your tastebuds a different joyride.

The world of Peri Peri comes to Kolkata ! and they should be at home considering Kolkata love for all things hot .

We went for lunch on a weekday . Four of us .

Ambience : Nice place bit of american diner feel .

Service: They are too eager or probably since the place was mostly empty

Food :¬† we tried mostly the house favourites . Started with the Pear & chkn salad . It was excellent and with the right infusion of peri peri sauce just awsum.
Followed it up with Chkn Espetada which is kind of sikh kabab with herbs, rice and veggies .
Next was Chkn Cataploana with yogurt dip a rice dish with chkn and salad and an excellent yogurt based dip .
The ball dropped in the desert section. We ordered the Berries cheese cake which unfortunately was hard and tasteless. We informed the server and they changed it to Chocolate fondant with ice cream at no extra cost .
Overall a nice place for the family . Food is mild and the peri peri sauces are at the table. Be ready to be blows by the Supra Peri ÔÅä
Oh they have a bottomless policy on cokes!!

We had a table booked for 5 persons via Dineout and they had it ready when we arrived and were swiftly accompanied to the table. The decor is quite nice with a couple of tv's displaying various sports channels. 

Coming to the food, we had their signature chicken wings and the Peri Peri Paneer Kababs for starters. The chicken wings were quite different from the normal barbeque wings which are available elsewhere. These had a smoky taste to it and were delicious. The Paneer too was nice but I found it to be a bit bland. For main course we ordered a cheesy chicken espetada, a chicken espetada, a garlic fish with rice, 1/4 th chicken and stir fried vegetables. All the main courses were ample for a single person and they were all perfectly cooked and beautifully served. The only thing that I noticed was that there wasn't much of a difference between the cheesy and the non cheesy espetada. I would have liked to experience some distinct difference in taste between the two which wasn't the case. 

Also for drinks we had ordered Hey Rosy, Kiwi Cooler and the Peachy Iced Tea which were all very refreshing.

The only complain that I have is that the table we sat at had a couch on one side and chairs on the other side. Though the couch by itself was quite comfy but the difference in height was a quite a bit and while eating, you really had to sit up straight in order to ensure you did not spill the food. This also needs to be kept in mind that I am 6 feet tall and had this problem. Someone shorter would definitely have a bigger problem than I did. 

The overall experience was quite satisfying and our server Samprita made sure that we enjoyed our meal to the fullest. The service is hands down one of the best in the city. 

I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to try something different from the usual cuisines we have on offer in the various restaurants in Kolkata.

Ambiance:
Well done place. Chairs are very uncomfortable.leg space can be cramped.
Crockery:
Plates are exactly 4 inch squares metal plates. Very difficult to eat.
Had to ask for a fork and knife as the staff didnt provide any at the table.
Menu:
Some variety would be good. Pictures dont match what you will get at the table so be careful.
Food:
Food was ok, nothing exceptional to write home about. The chicken we ordered was quite small in quantity. They said it would serve two but honestly it couldnt serve one properly.
Service:
Work needed here, staff still need training at the meet and greet counter.

It was a relief for me when I saw Barcelos in Kolkata.. similar to this we have Nandos in Bangalore the concept of peri peri chicken.. this is where you need to go and oder for chicken platter in peri peri sauce and nothing else.. they have four varieties of sauces which are rich in flavor.. to go along.with chicken you need beer which is not an option, so they need to work on that. Ambience is good, staffs need to be wear smile on their faces to make the guests feel comfortable... All the best!!

went to this place yesterday.  nice ambience. food was okay. tiramisu was good. ordered a cheese cake, told him repeatedly about cake, the smiling waiter gave us milk shake. we corrected and the waiter apologized. we told him to cancel the order. the waiter okayed, and then he again brought a strawberry milk shake. we again told that we have not ordered for it. the waiter, smilingly rver, told us that since its his fault, he will not charge for the shake, in other words, its free! we gladly had it. when the bill came, we found out that he has added the shake in the bill. when we went up and told that we had not ordered for it, the barcelos guy, again smilingly,   told that they had made a mistake! didnt return the money! guys if you are thinking about visiting barcelos, god bless u :)

The serviece men cheated on us....they took the order wrong...when we refused to take it on our table...we were told that as the other item was  not available this would be a "complementary".we at first hesitated but took it as a nice gesture. Later we found that was added to the bill. This is a wrost kind of push selling. Such a bad experience.

# Paneer espetada
*Espadetas are served along with two sides which you could choose out of 5 options like mashed potato, french fries, spicy rice, green salad
# Stuffed mushroom kebab
# Non-veg kebab platter : basa fish, chicken, mutton kebabs extremely succulent and tender
# Chicken Ceaser salad
# Greek salad
Main-course:
# Grilled fish with spicy rice: served with saute exotic veggies like zuccini, button mushroom, red n yellow bell pepper, English cucumber cooked in tangy sauce
# Chicken cataplana with yogurt dip
# Lemon fish sizzler
Dessert:
# Brownie with vanilla ice-cream
# Tiramisu
The have got bottles of four different types of peri peri sauces on table. The only thing missing here is liquor. They have confirmed that they have applied for bar license and expecting the same in next couple of month.

This international restraunt has been in my list for quite sometime. Finally got a chance to visit this place last month. It has gota very classy decor and a very cozy ambience. Hostility and the service of the staffs are quite impressive.
Now this not a suitable place for people with a typical Indian taste rather more of a place for experimental foodies. And their speciality is the 'peri peri' sauce which is available in four different level of spices.
We ordered for -
Peri Peri grill chicken ( 1/2 by itself ) - it was nice and a bit different from mostly available grill chicken in other restraunts. I wish the chicken would have been a biy more soft.
Stuffed Mushroom - it was juicy and tasty but I dont think it was freshly cooked as it was served cold.
Garlic fish with rice - It was my favourite among all other. It was really tasty specially the basa which was perfectly cooked.
For desert we wished to have Tiramisu but unfortunaetly they informed that it was not available and it was quite unexpected from such a reatraunt. Anyways we ordered for cheese cake which was quite tasty.
Quantity is as sufficient as of two people.Pocket pinch is generally on the higher side. They charge a service tax of 10%. Overall the visit was a satisfactory one.

A nice and cosy restaurant located inside the Acropolis Mall. This is probably a new joint here as we haven't seen this before. So had to try it out and I would say it did not disappoint us at all. The staff were too courteous and had a smile on their face all the time. We had ordered Arabic Mezze Platter which is basically pitas with a ¬†number of tasty dips. We loved it. We also tried Barcelos Signature Half chicken with sides and Mutton Kebab Sizzler. They were both very tasty and juicy. The portions were awesome and these 3 dishes could happily fill 4 of our hungry tummies. Will definitely go back to try out the other dishes in the menu. the colourful burgers looked interesting.

We went there some months back and thus I may not remember the name of the dish properly.

Firstly I loved the decor, somewhat different than the traditional decorations of restaurants with which we are so accustomed. The guys there were quite helpful.

We ordered read meaty (lamb burger) and black mutton burger along with french fries with dips and bread. Add to these, these was Caesar salad and grape fruit punch and mint blast in drinks. The drinks were really refreshing and the burgers were too yummy. For all of us who knew only chicken burgers, (thanks to KFC) and love burgers, this place is a must.

Do visit and I will surely visit again.

We went to this place for dinner. Being on a weekday the restauran was only half filled. So service were very good propmt. The staffs were aware of preparation and ingredients of the items and that is a very good thing. The ambience is very nice, very brighly lit with comfortable seating. It based on the same concept as Nandoos. I have been to Nandoos in England and I liked this place more because of larger selection of foods. ¬†Burgers and wraps dominate the menu. The black and red burgers are interesting. The bun is made of coco powder and beetroots extract respectively. The lamb patty was very juicy and perfectly cooked. The chicken I found little dry though. The peri peri sauce is also very good but little milder on Indian tastebud unless you go for the hottest one. ¬†All in all a very good place to hang out and spend some time with family and friends.

If u want to try out European cuisine, this is the place to go. The food here is delicious and i must add the ambience is pretty good. The service could have been a tad better I feel. I personally liked the grilled chicken very much and the peri peri chicken Sizzler. The deserts are very good too. I tried the truffle cake with vanilla ice cream.

I am told there is a new South African restaurant in town and my interest is piqued with my mom üòç. There is nothing remotely South African on the menu. I quiz the manager and am told the chain has its origins in South Africa but the food is largely Portuguese. While the menu does not have any one clear direction in terms of roots, there is enough to satisfy every kind of palate. So this Barcelos is famous for its flame grilled Peri Peri menu and has carved a niche for itself by introducing to the discerning foodies their own brand of innovation. 
The ambience is very pleased and calm. The lighting used, the wood planks and the artifacts displayed add up to the comfort. The theme of Portugal is reflected through the interiors of the restaurant. Different varieties of peri-peri sauce dispensers are kept on each table. Choose from their signature chicken dishes which come in portions of a quarter, half or full. range of Lebanese dips and sauces to indulge in at the start of the meal, and the Arabic mezze platter also finds place on the Barcelos menu.This place is highly recommended if you like chicken, but fish and lamb barely skim the menu. There flamed grilled chickens are awesome. Juicy & grilled to perfection. Drinks good perfectly blended, taste good to me. Chef is very friendly and talented. I m very much fish person I was carving more variety on fish after all this is kolkata.

Very trendy, very chic with warm & friendly service. Had their signature coloured burger platter and Peri peri chicken which just fitted the bill to a T for 4 of us; accompaniments were potato wedges & french fries & grilled veggies. But special mention needs to be made of the wonderful mocktails served without which the dinner wouldhave been incomplete - the Kiwi Coolers & Berry cucumber - these were perfect. The pocket pinch worked out to 2900 - not too high not too low! And si, 'a satisfactory evening was had by all'!

Would have given this a 5, if the management was good. The ACs not working, leaking, wooden walls with termites. They don't have washroom inside! Why got no idea. Anyways good parts, the menu! Varieties n varieties of food. Black and red burgers haven't seen anywhere. Molecular drinks (that keeps on bubbling, and added nitrogen on top). Kebabs taste awesome. No alcohol for now. Nice cool interiors. Go again to try so much of food, but hope they work on bad parts

Bringing down the rating from my recent visit here. They reversed the quantity ordered, and server was adamant to rectify the order. Anyways we took what he bought. Portions are so damn small. Money worth 1.5/5.. also tried the red and black Burger's, it tastes no different, and patty was undercooked.. not happy sorry

One of my favorite place. Amazing burgers with peri peri sauces.. Tastes so yummy... Try the sweet and spicy kiwi cooler and cucumber drinks. Ambience is nice with really quick service.
The food was good - the Peri Peri Black Magic and the Red Meaty burgers. And their grilled chicken was super yum! But their 'Supa Peri' dip, supposedly the hottest on their menu, deserves a thumbs down from me - it just wasn't hot.
The theme is unique of the place. They have unique style of the Indian cocktail drinks. The service is good too and the host "Sampita" attend me infront of the restaurants , she give me hearty welcome and the first impression is very nice and awesome for me i love this place very much......

This is my new favourite haunt for grilled chicken. Its located on the top floor of Acropolis Mall. The staff are really friendly. I went on a friday afternoon, the restaurant was pretty empty. They've got a quirky decor. A world map showing the different locations of Barcelos across the world. It specialises in periperi flavored food. The chicken espetada caught my eye on the menu. Also, i saw a few people were being served with this weird contraption on which kebabs were dangling. That turned out to be the espetada. Some of the most delicious chicken i've ever had. Juicy pieces of chicken stuffed with cheese and sauce, served with a dip and two sides of your choice. We also ordered the periperi chicken sizzler served with kebabs and rice. It wasn't as great as the espetada. And two people could easily share a sizzler. The miniburgers looked yummy. They served these red buns and blackened buns. Looking forward to visiting again to try them soon. (:

Last night we went to Barcelos to celebrate my husband and sons birthday.Had booked a table in advance and informed them of the celebrations.
But there was nothing done on their behalf until we reminded them of the same.
Moreover the food was not upto the mark nor was the service.
We ordered for chicken steak and requested them to make sure that it was served without the skin.
When the dish arrived it had the skin on.
When we told the server he just took the dish away without any apologies and got it back in 5 mins -the same piece of chicken with the skin taken off.It was cold without the glaze and taste of a steak.Plus the steak looked raw.
Generally there are 4 Peri Peri sauces on the table.Yesterday there were only 2.
On asking then about the other 2 they said that they did not have it available.Y would a customer ask about this.Isnt the customer supposed to be told about this and apologised for the same.
I have been to Nandos in London which is on similar lines but believe me it stands out tall in terms of food quality,quantity and service.
Overall it was not worth the price we paid and a total disappointment.

Everyone deserves a second chance and Barcelos is no exception. After a horrendous first time experience here, the Barcelos team offered us a complimentary meal for two. But this time they made sure that it would be a pleasant experience for us. Souvik arranged everything for us and Upasana really took good care of us. The food was delivered in time and it was absolutely a bliss. The hospitality of the staff was exceptional. Altogether it was a memorable experience. Things don't need to be perfect as long as you are ready to take criticism and work on things to make it better. Won't be long before I visit this place again.

This franchise is a copy of Nandos. If you know or crave for nandos the Portuguese style peri peri grilled chicken this is the alternative. The food quality and drinks are decent. The chicken quality is not as good as the other franchise. If u haven't tried this type of Mediterranean food it's a must. I'm glad we are getting more and more of foreign cultural food here. The ambience is nice with very welcoming staff. Don't forget about the different sauce which is the main soul of these dishes, choose carefully. And try mutton burgers which taste better than chicken.

All hypes apart. The food is good not great. We tried the mutton kebab. That was well made. The wrap was disappointing. Though the lamb burger made up for it. Mocktails were okay. Not too great. Decor and ambience was upto the mark with helpful and attentive staff. Will I try it again? Probably. Have quite a few bit of the menu unexplored.

Good to have Barcelos in town. Have already been there twice and still have a lot to explore in the menu. The chicken liver with garlic roll is our favourite along with the signature dishes. They bring a different flavour to food. As far as the mocktails go, they are worth trying. Although the Burgers weren't a hit but overall was a good experience.

Heard heard so much about this place,  that we decided to visit it yesterday,  with my colleagues. What strikes you first is the ambiance of this place.  There is so much space here that a lot of children were running about freely.  No where else in kolkata do you find a restaurant with so much space. Service is great,  with very friendly attitude.  Felt at home the moment we entered. 
Coming to the food,  I have to mention that everything was exceptional here. Seen quite a negative reviews about the food.  I have to state that, people reviewing the food negatively should not venture out for anything different.  They should stick to standard Biryani and Chinese food, as there palate is suited for that only.  The grilled chicken with veri Peri is a must try.  Tried black burger with mutton and it was huge,  juicy and great to look at. It seems it is made for two people. Mocktails too were very well presented and different.
Will definitely visit again to try their hanging chicken in skewers. Can't recall the name though,  but looked very enticing.

Planned to visit this new place on 14th August 2016 with my wife. We went for lunch as planned. Both of us ordered Chicken Steak with one side dish( one was with Fries and dip and the other one was with grilled veg). To be very honest this was the WORST chicken steak we had so far. Generally Chicken steaks are soft and tender. But here we found out that the Steak was too hard. It was so hard that it was difficult to cut with a knife as well and chew it. Now coming to the side dish the fries served was not evenly fried. Some of the fries were not cooked properly. The grilled veggies that were served were not up to the mark either.

When we shared our feedback with the person who came with the bill, he just listened and said we will look into this matter, he also offered us this same dish which we didn't take as we didn't wanted to go through the same pain once again. ¬†The Prices are way too high based on the quality of food was offered compared to other restaurants.

I don't think we will ever try this dish here and I strongly recommend my friends not to try this dish as as it will eventually lead to wasting your precious time and money here.

I find all the reviews here eulogising this place a bit more than what it is. Now I know why. More on that later!
So this independence day we decided to dine somewhere new and this was the only place at acropolis mall which we hadn't visited so naturally we zeroed in in barcelos.
The ambiance is simple..nothing too flashy but probably a selfie lover's delight because of the huge illuminated world map at a wall behind.
Now coming to the food. They claimed to be the only peri peri restaurant in town and offering a choice of 4 different types of peri peri sauce for its customers. We decided to go with a black peri peri mutton burger and fries as the side and a chicken steak with mashed potatoes. The burger was good..the patty juicy and the veggies fresh and crunchy. But the fries lacked seasoning and amidst the crowd of 4 bottles of peri peri sauce on the table top, I missed my salt and pepper sprinkler. The chicken steak however was sad. Sad because it was grilled with the skin on (and hence I felt like it was me who had the job of murdering the chicken before devouring it) and the presentation lacked finesse. It was to be honest bland chewy tasteless and a constant struggle to eat. We also ordered a molecular mango drink which was okayish- like your regular mango Panna dressed fancy for prom. And they'd pour liquid nitrogen and create a flashy show of an otherwise average drink. Finally dessert - chocolate ganache with vanilla ice cream..they probably forgot to heat the pastry a bit before serving and hence both the ice cream and the pastry were cold- it failed to create the usual contrasting hot and cold effect that you normally associate when you order things like these.
Finally coming to the waiters- they are polite courteous but but but they would keep suggesting you order whatever they say which is a big turn off. The sad steak and the dessert were all their suggestion. I wanted a rice dish and a chocolate fondant. Moreover they'd request you to add a zomato review then and there which explains the high ratings and people going ga ga over this place.
So the bottomline- happy and content? Not really
Would visit again? Maybe but turning a deaf ear to the waiter's suggestion.

We had Crunchy chicken mix in starters... I loved the cheesy taste n the crunchy texture of lavash. Then we took Whole Chicken peri peri.... Absolutely delicious, spicy yet tender. The mashed potatoes n fries were complementing it perfectly. Lastly in deserts... Tiramisu n Choco truffle cake... Both were heavenly. Overall an amazing experience...

Finally was able to try out the food at Barcelos. The standout items were: the chicken espetada (an appetiser), the chicken trinchando sizzled and the chicken mini burgers.
The food was quiet good and the quality of the chicken stood out. The quality of service was also noteworthy and a special thank you to our server, Raj, whose recommendations were spot on based on our mentioned preferences. Overall the place is worth eating at and the customer service is also great.

My advice is to go here for the chicken only especially if you are tired of kfc & want some variety in chicken..
The ambience & staff are both nice..

This restaurant boasts of an inviting interior with a comfortable dining environment.
3 chicken mini-burgers(red,black,brown), chicken steak,chicken picantte,stuffed chicken kebab,kiwi cooler are some of the delicious picks.
It is advisable to find out more on the content/nature of the food before placing an order. The description on the menu does not provide sufficient insight to someone reading for the first time.For instance,peri peri chicken sizzler and stuffed chicken kebab are so similar that ordering these together can be a monotonous meal!
I'll surely keep in mind to choose my order wisely the next time I drop in.

Went to Barcelos with my wife as I had missed the one in New Delhi. 

We tried the "Family platter for Four", which consisted of one whole of a lovely grilled chicken, along with 4 regular sides and pita bread. We also ordered a platter of 4 small burgers and a bottomless glass of Coke

For sides we had Fries with dip, Wedges with dip, mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. The burgers came with a side of coleslaw 

The Black Mutton Burger and the Red Meaty, were juicy and soft. The chicken ones were not at all juicy. Pretty dry

Barcelos chicken no where stands to Nandos. Parts of the chicken were somewhat burnt, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Neither the sauces, can be compared to Nandos. Still the one sauce that played well on my tongue was the "Spicy Dip"

Unfortunately they don't have a washroom inside the establishment to wash hands. Leave going to take a leak. You will be handed "wet tissues" to wipe your hands

After planning and plotting for quite some time finally had the opportunity to visit this place with my brother.As we entered we were highly impressed by the warm and sober decor of this place.we had cheesy chicken espetada which comes with 2 sides(we had wedges with dip and spicy rice),kiwi cooler( a molecular drink),1/4 th chicken,peri peri bloody red burger,grilled fish with rice.now the presentation of all the dishes were excellent specially the chicken espetada.infact we were completely mesmerized by the look of the dish- juicy chicken pieces hanging from a kebab holder in a sheekh and cheese dripping from it...it was a beautiful sightüòÇ!it had basically the taste of chicken kebab stuffed with tomato(most probably).the burger was very healthy yet delicious and the kiwi cooler i felt was a bit like aampanna but nevertheless it was tasty.now the 1/4 th chicken was delectable and highly recommended.lastly arrived the grilled fish which was really good.it had 5 pieces of soft and tender basa fish fillets along with some grilled veggies(like zucchini,carrot,mushroom) and spicy rice.would definitely like to go back to try out their trout grilled fish.

My didi n I had been eyeing this place for a while.We both are always on the prowl of new restaurants opening up (almost daily :P) on the lanes,bylanes,malls of this food-loving city of ours making Kolkata a paradise for foodies like us. And Barcelos is surely one of those gems.
Situated on the floor above the food court of Acropolis Mall,Kasba which houses other exciting restaurants like Asia Kitchen, Hoppipola, Chilli's, this quiant cafe-like restaurant has nice decor which gives a warm vibe to this place.You can come with your other halves on a romantic evening or with family on a grand dinner maybe. We went there around 7 in the evening and found the place a bit deserted occupied by a group of foreigners on one side n 2 or 3 groups of families n friends occupying tables here n there.That's coz may be of the heavy evening downpour. But I inferred from the appearances of some that they were here for some serious business i.e. to taste good Portuguese food. And I hope they weren't disappointed by the wide n unique range of dishes this place had to offer starting right from the multi colored Burgers to the Trout Fish or other in-house delicacies that they offered. Trust me, we were just overwhelmed to find those kebabs brought in on a kebab holder i.e. with the 'sheekh' attached (refer to the picture below). I saw almost everyone ordering that ---"Cheesy Chicken Espatada" as the waitress suggested in our case. The service was smooth n the staff was quite hospitable.

We ordered Kiwi Cooler,which was really refreshing,(To note: Molecular Drink), Red colored burger (if u r short on budget just try one, without taking the platter of 4, that'll do just fine imo), Cheesy Chicken Espatada, 1/4 Chicken n Garlic Fish served with rice.As we were short on budget we couldn't try the Grilled Trout Fish,instead tried the Garlic Fish which was tender n delicious! My suggestion if u aren't short on budget definitely try the Grilled Trout Fish as its rare in Kolkata.May be I'll come back here for having the Trout Fish another time. :)

Fantastic food and service. Several interesting veg options to choose from and a great collection of sauces. A Value for Money place considering the interesting food and plating. The 4 set burger is a great choice with two starters. The ambience was a bit dull and boring though - the only negative i could find

Went here to celebrate our second Anniversary. Food is pretty awesome and delicious. Especially cheese chicken espetada. The chicken steak was superb also. Of the side dishes we loved the potato wedges and mashed potato. Loved the ambiance. Though a complementary Anniversary cake would have been nice.  All in all i would recommend all to visit this place atleast once.

Headed to this joint at Acropolis Mall after catching a movie. For starters, we ordered two burgers, Peri Peri Black Magic, Peri Peri Bloody Red with Grilled Veggies and a plate of Cheesy Fries. For the main course, we went ahead with Chicken Trinchando Sizzler, Grilled Fish Sizzler and Chicken Steak with mashed potatoes. For drinks, we stuck to 2 Thums Up with unlimited refills.The burgers were pretty nice and the fries were amazing. Sizzler was great too and the chicken and fish chunks were nice and juicy. Quantity was just about right and sizzlers can be shared by two people. Service was prompt and the staff were really courteous. Helped us with the ordering too, something that I really appreciated.Overall a nice experience..would love to go back again sometime!Keep up the good work guys...Cheers!!!

The menu card rightly justifies the menu card  of serving portugese food. However it falls a little short of the expectations set. The food is good,tasty but oily. One needs to choose wisely here. The place has a quaint artistic old school resturant feel. Surely this place won't cater to all kinds of foodies

The news of Barcelos opening in Kolkata was really exciting. So visited with my friends. The place has it's ups and downs.
Decor is average to be honest, nothing too amazing. Music is also ok. Staff was polite and helpful.
Food is good, atleast I personally liked the sauces and flavours. Presentation was quite amazing though. The concept of colourful burgers was quite interesting, though they more or less taste the same. Chicken skewers were delicious. Mocktails were average.
I wouldn't mind going back again.

Their staff Raj was our captain of the desk, his suggestions r really good, the other staff were also equally courteous. Food is really good in taste and the way it is served. Kebabs served were really good in style.all fresh food, and to my surprise  ,it was really full on an afternoon .will be visiting again for sure. Pocket pinch is very fair with the unique tastes.Portuguese dishes r good, nd if u r a spicy lover then these dishes are really salivating.kudos to the entire team at barcelos. See u again soon.

Okay I have been hearing a lot about this place that has opened  in Acropolis mall.So finally we could make it to the place yesterday for dinner.I found an unusual similarity with nando's and being a fan of the same I loved the feeling.
We ordered for a cheesy chicken espetada along with  sides Coleslaw and french fries.Loved it it had tangy flavour because of the stuffed dried tomatoes and the chicken was so soft tender and we'll cooked.
I ordered for on tangy mango reading through the previous reviews and I loved it.
The only thing I didn't like that much was peri peri chicken sizzler I thought it could have been better.

Barcelos; I have been quite keen on visiting to this restaurant but honestly the expectations has gone in vain. 
- Service... No water served on the table even after 7-8 minutes of sitting. 

- Ignorant staff... I have no idea why there are waiters who don't have any idea of the items on the menu. Wrong suggestion of the attendant lead us to have the worst food possible. 

- Food... If anybody ask me to get into this place for a free trial now, I won't go coz I have had the most tasteless sizzler here. Today I realized thE butter rice means plain rice with a teaspoon butter on the rice. That's what the waiter said. Even after complaining he said this is butter rice. Weird. 

-Presentation... Very good. 

But it's not always necessary Jo Dikhta Hain Woh Bikta Hain. I think chili's is the best option for sizzler now. I rated this place 1 only because of its drink. Otherwise it's not worth a visit.

The concept of different coloured burgers is very unique. I was really hoping that they would each taste  different, unfortunately that did not happen. All burger buns taste the same so make sure to take different fillings. Otherwise the food is good. The sauces are amazing. One must try this place for sure.

There is a lot of good Places to eat in Kolkata, but this is for sure one of the really better experiences if you want something extra for your friends.
I got some really interesting and good tastes during the meal here. It was really well prepared, and the result as in the best restaurants. ¬†The restaurant is focusing on its Portuguese idea, and they do it well.¬†
I can recommend this place very warmly, and I do believe that you will find it in same way good and pleasant as me.
 The staff deserve to be mentioned as very service minded and highly skilled - and wow smiling... that is also making the total experience perfect.

We went to try Portuguese dishes. We had stuffed chicken for starters & mint blasts.
For main course: grilled trout fish with 1sides, chicken Picantte & stir fry vegetables. The fish was good, chicken okay. But we found the stir fry vegetables very sour. We couldn't finish it, was so sour for the pineapples.
Overall I found the restaurant good & depending on the location, prices are okay too.
Give it a try for a slight different taste.

With restaurants opening left and right in South Kolkata, it was not a surprise that another big chain opened in the coveted food court of Acropolis Mall, Kolkata, already home to plenty of other giants. Barcelos finally arrived in Kolkata, with all its heritage from Africa, Portugal and many other countries.. 
Even though I was in Kolkata for a few days only, I had made up my mind to try it out.. We went there on  my birthday üéâ, this Monday.

The menu we ordered was not out of the ordinary, and went with their specialities, with Burgers, Molecular drinks, espetadas and peri peri chickens.. Coming to the detailed menu, here we go:

Drinks:
We had 2 molecular drinks, Kiwi Cooler and Tangy Mango, and a regular mocktail, electric blue Fizz.
For those who don't know, molecular drinks are cooled by liquid Nitrogen in front of your eyes, and its a pretty unique experience. All of the drinks were very good, and for the first time in a very long time, I liked all of the mocktails in a single place. The kiwi cooler and Tangy Mango follows their name and sticks to the taste, and the electric blue Fizz had Minty taste.. Overall, one of the most complete mocktail experiences for me..

Starters:
We had cheesy chicken espetadas with French fries and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers.. Its worth to mention that the presentation of the espetadas is quite unique, hanging from the top like kebab pieces in a shop.. The chicken and cheese melted in our mouth straightaway, filled with their exotic spices it was a great experience. They served pretty big 6 pieces in a plate, perfect for our group of 3. The stuffed mushrooms were also perfect, not undercooked, which i find most of the time in restros. The mushrooms had 5 in a portion, which was a bit awkward for us, but it tasted brilliant nonetheless.

Main Course:
4-Chicken Mini Burgers.
One of the most iconic dishes of Barcelos, the mini Burgers were a treat to watch as well as taste. They serve two complementary sides of your choice with the Burgers, so we had grilled veggies and fries to go with it, and the preparation was excellent.. The color of the Burgers were not synthetic and were all organic, white from coconut milk, black from cocoa powder and red from beet root. It is pretty heavy and you should be looking to distribute the dish among 4 if you are planning to visit in a group.
Peri Peri Chicken Sizzler:
We have all heard about the peri peri grilled chicken in Barcelos, so we decided to go for the Sizzler.. And it was HUGE. Generous amounts of mushrooms and chicken on a bed of rice, the quantity is enough for a single person. The Sizzler was great and the rice was also very good, somehow I didn't like the peri peri sauce, but it's not bad and will obviously depend on different people.

Desserts:
We only had one, Chocolate Truffle, the only thing in the dessert menu other than Tiramisu which I wanted to order. I felt the dessert menu could have been better. The Truffle cake was excellent, and it went great with the vanilla scoop of ice cream with chocolate syrup on top. 

The serving time was really fast, and on this note, I would like to point out, that even though the waiters were very friendly and helpful, they did mess up with the timings, and served the starters and main course at the same time.. The pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side, but the food more than makes up for it.

Final verdict: Very much recommended for those who are meat lovers and enjoy exotic dishes and Burgers and want a good fine dining experience.

Visited the place last evening,with a lot of expectation. But sadly,wasn't satisfied with the taste of the food I had. I had ordered a chicken steak and a fish sizzler along with some cola. The steak arrived and I was surprised to see the size of it. It was much smaller than what is served in other similar joints. Then came the sizzler.... Being a foody ,
I anticipated it to be awesome just by the look of it. But sadly I must say,I found it to be one of worst sizzlers I have ever had. The base sauce of the dish(which I found was too much for a sizzler) had an overwhelming tanginess to it. I only could feel the taste of sourness rather than any other. I'm aware of peri peri base being tangy and stuff but it was too much as for me.... The chicken in the steak was tasty though.... Juicy and soft. The behaviour of the staff and service was Cordial and warm though....No issues regarding that..... But as far as the main thing i.e food was concerned-i can say only 1 thing ,'it didn't suit my tastebuds'.

I visit barcelos few days a go after wrapping up mt work. As i was alone so thought of having my lunch in barcelos. But it was very much surprising to see barcelos such a poor condition starting from the food and drinks till the manager.
 I ordered garlic fish with rice and and mango meets banana.  Rice was full of onion and zucchini. Fish had an awful smell which was unbearable. The quality and quantity of shakes have gone down drastically. No favour of mango was there. When i called the manager to know why my food and drinks was not up to the mark. (Dont know the name) He said this was there standard. His body language showed he was least interested in the concern i had. He never bothered that i was enjoying my food. Being a manager it is completely un-professional to behaviour in such a manner. No sense of responsibility was shown there. Was just walking around the restaurant irrespective of  the guest concern. Didnt had any hospitality quality in him.Doesnt know how to speak with his own staff. Was howling in the restaurant and disturbing. Using abusing words and slangs among his own staffs. Never ever seen a manager like this.
In the end after notice he that i had didnt eat my food he offered me a free dessert...????
 Its high time for the barcelos team to act on these issues.

Ok, this review comes a few weeks late and has no pics, but it was a sudden unplanned trip one afternoon with my husband. We were both a bit under the weather, so we went there for a mood lift. We got the non veg kebab platter and it was soooo good. I highly recommend it. They have their own house sauce in four levels of spice. The grilled veggies with the kebabs are quite the best I have had. We had a mocktail as well and a cheesecake for dessert which were both top notch. Prices are high, but you cannot complain about the quality, service or ambience. A must visit for every foodie.

I visited this place with my friend and got a warm welcome from the lady stationed just outside the restaurant. We ordered a full plate of peri peri chicken with potato mash as side dish, and unlimited coke. The dish was absolutely awesome, with the peri peri sauce adding extra delight to our taste buds. A full plate chicken for 2 was definitely heavy for the stomach, but the taste was such splendid that you can't leave even a single piece on the plate. To add to the food, the ambience in the restaurant was superb and so was the service by the waiters. In a nutshell Barcelos is surely the place to be if you want to enjoy roasted chicken!!!

What better way to celebrate Portugal's Euro 16' win than trying out Portuguese cuisine :P Situated on the top floor of Acropolis, the place is pretty cool and the ambiance is nice. We decided to quench our thirst with the Grape Fruit Punch and the Indian Classic Kala Khata. Both were quite refreshing. Then for starters we wanted to order Stuffed Mushroom Kebab but since it was not available, the waiter suggested Mediterranean Grilled Mushroom Skewers and Garlic Fish with rice for the main. The mushroom was awful and bland and once we told a guy from the management about it he instantly offered to serve us two extra mushroom pieces after making it better and he also showed us how to use the peri peri sauces present on ¬†table. The mushroom did not taste much better but kudos to their service for actually caring about their customers. Then we ordered the Chicken wings which was good. Most of the dishes here have a strong flavour of peri spices so if you do not like that flavour you won't have much options here. Finally we decided to end with Berries Cheese cake and Hot Choc Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream and I have only one word to describe the desserts, "Heavenlicious" :D

Heard of this restaurant name from a lot of my friends.....and all of them said one thing in common...glowing reviews of the food they serve and the helpful and cooperative staff....so was quite eager to visit this restaurant for some time...
At last this Saturday it finally happened and I have to say it has been a wonderful experience for me....we ordered the bone less chicken thighs for our starters and the chicken was very well seasoned and juicy and tasted absolutely delightful ...in the mains we ordered the family chicken with four sides which is complimentary...and I can say without a doubt the chicken was the best I have ever had...and the four sides wonderfully complemented the chicken ....the manager requested to try their molecular drinks ...and it was  wonderful and refreshing with the added theatricality obtained from adding liquid nitrogen... overall I have to admit it is one of the best meals I have had in my whole life till now.....and the staffs were very helpful , courteous ....
Being a foodie who likes to try various cuisines I must say it is a must visit for food lovers of this food loving city.....and I hope to again visit them soon...

Tried the Barcelos in Delhi during my stay over there and thought of giving it a try.¬†
I liked the decor over here, and the huge map indicating the Barcelos chain all over the world.
The food is decent here so are the mocktails.
However, I found the service to be bad indeed! We had to request thrice to serve water to us (which is so basic)! ¬†They seemed to be much reluctant while taking orders! The food came in quite late and they were not even apologetic as the wait time promised was way to less. Probably they were lethargic to do that also!
Guys please pull up your socks n work on this part, because in the hotel and hospitality sector, service is unanimously considered to be among the most important parameters.

We'd gone there post watching a movie at cine. I'm disappointed to say the food wasn't even average at best! They had no fries at all, the burger buns felt squib, and neither the veg or the chicken patties/breast was good. We even returned a plate of one of their appetizers. To top it all, there was a piece of bone about two inches in the napkin stand! The experience was really bad and we didn't feel the management could care at all unfortunately. It was one restaurant I was really looking forward to, but a real dampener.

I went to Acropolis mall with a friend and we decided to lunch here .
Situated on the fourth floor this place is an internationally recognised restaurant with its speciality in Portuguese and middle East cuisine. This place will keep on reminding you of the different spices in the world .
The flavours alongside the different spices they provide and the variety of Sauce is why this place stands out .I felt pretty spoilt of choices.
The hospitality is good and the interiors are very spacious .
The devor of the place is minimalistic and elegant with the iconic map of the world on its wall !! Truly I could just not take my eyes of this one :p
The food was peri peri good !! And try this place out only if you are experimental and welcoming to different dishes since this might taste very different than the typical Indian dishes .
Overall the experience was good and we ordered a Chicken steak and a peri-peri chicken dish .
P.S: Try out the dishes mentioned in their speciality menu ! 
We billed at Rs 1250 . The food is adequate but the price is a little on the higher side .

Last night we visited the new portuguese restaurant in acropolis Barcelos.  I am very happy with service and staffs and the ambience. It was my cutie pies birthday. We reached the restaurant at 10.50 pm. But unfortunately their last order was at 10.45 pm. But on special request the manager Mr. Souvik gave us the table. We ordered a family meal and a very big burger with extra pineapple and egg which i forgotten the name. The food was delicious. A small cake with a cute candle Was  given as complimentary birthday desert to my daughter as well. I am very with service and yes the food peri peri grill chicken was very delicious. I thanks to the manager and staffs. We hope to visit there again very soon.

Barcelos a new food treasures in kolkata. Their mini burgers r to die for, we ordered 4 of each colour. Red, black, white, and regular burger. It was jucy and tasty. The grill chicken was amazing. Surver was very courteous.
I noticed in the earlier reviews that few people have complained about the food and service. Beleave me the staff r very helpful and we'll behaved.

They made my evening.

visited the 1st outlet of barcelos in our town. I thought it would be similar to nandos as the same concept to peri peri. But the food is far away better than nandos . i had the portugese roll of nandos and red pepper dip. But  the cheesy chicken wrap with the supa peri was just awesome.  supa sauce is very very hott i just loved it.  The only thing dissapointed me was the drinks. i want to try their flavoured sangria but a bad luck of mine they didnt got the liscence of liquor still.   Hope to visit again :-)

I was a regular visitor of this place until today when I experienced indecent and bad behaviour from the manager of this restaurant .They took atleast 30 minutes to serve me  a dish even.I placed a discount voucher for which I was supposed to get a discount ,instead of giving me a discount on the gross bill they are discounting it from the net bill and they are telling us that before I don't pay they will not be able to give u a discounted bill.After I paid the amount then also they couldn't give me a proper discounted bill instead they are telling that it's their policy .They placed two bottles of kinley packaged drinking water without asking which has a Mrp of ‚Çπ10.00 for which they are charging 50plus taxes,when I asked them to return the server is telling me it's already punched and can't return it.
These restaurants are charging exorbitant rates but are giving such poor services .@avishek mukherjee @parag das

I had to take a few friends out for lunch and i was pretty confused where to go and where not to. I sat at hoppipola to have a drink with my cousin that's when a friend dragged us to Barcelos. Overall a good experience. The food was yumm but we landed up ordering a black burger which didn't suit our taste. The place is beautiful decent interiors but then their sofa seats are very uncomfortable. Would surely go again to taste their Burgers but this time will be a little more careful with the choice of it. I hope i get to eat with comfort the next time.

One of the newest places in the town with rave reviews, and eight hungry souls decided to give it a try one cloudy afternoon. We walked into a tastefully decorated place, lovely wooden interiors and cosy lighting. ¬†The bright red smoking booth reminded me of telephone boxes. With great gusto we ordered the drumsticks and the chicken platter as starters, along with fresh lime soda. The drumsticks were heavenly, with a great smoky flavour and tasted even better accompanied with the tangy lemon sauce. I have to say they serve the best fresh lime soda in the city! For the mains we ordered three full chickens, ¬†three sizzlers, lots of burgers and unlimited coke to go. I had the Too much periperi black magic, and it was AMAZING. A giant juicy affair, with a slice of my favourite pineapple, I could hardly take a full bite of all the layers. The four sauces on the table complimented it really well, especially the veri peri, which left a pleasant burn on ¬†my tongue. The trinchnado sizzler was also well made, with ample vegetables and chicken. ¬†To end it we had tiramisu and the electric blue fizz. The tiramisu was slightly disappointing, but they made it up with the blue fizz. The staff were extremely courteous and helped us choose the dishes. Overall, it is a great place to go if you love chicken and are looking for a different taste. Definitely giving it a second visit. Cheers!

An impromptu visit to this new joint proved to be quite the treat. The lighting, seating and wall decor were easy on the senses with the illuminated atlas of the world pointing out the locations of Barcelos' around the globe being the highlight. While the red chicken burger could've been better, the molecular mocktails : Tangy Mango and Kiwi Cooler were great. Each table has 4 bottles of peri peri sauces graded according to their hotness and having the fries with them is quite the delight.¬†¬†Looking forward to trying their diverse chicken menu next time.

Finally got the time to visit there on Sunday but not enough time to explore the menu so much. 

Ambience : 4/5 
Food : 4/5 
Service 2/5 (hella slow) 

We ordered a chicken wrap, the bread was just too crispy for my liking and overall it wasn't so good. 

Then we had 4 chicken mini burgers with a side of fries with dip. The burgers were satisfactory. 
Liked their sauces. 

Ordered an unlimited cold drink (sprite) but the taste of it was a little weird. Not sure if tasting the peri peri sauces had ruined the taste in my mouth. 

Pocket pinch was on the higher side given the quantity was on the lower. Felt like an over-hyped restaurant.

Gives a feel of a classy place , good ambience yet fails to meet the standards when it comes to food and service. Huge food menu but very average taste wise, service is really slow.. I literally had to wait for 40 mins just for mini burgers. Chicken steak and the side dishes does not come together .. Side dishes came 15 mins later whereas both should be serve together. Overall food and service is disappointing.

Second visit to barcelos and will be leaving with a smile after having a disappointing experience on my previous visit.
Glad to see the improvement in their service which was a drawback a month ago.
Chicken espedata is my all time favourite. It's a must try here at barcelos.
Staff suggested to try chicken trinchado, and it was really good. A balanced mix of tangy and spicy chicken.
Though peri peri chicken sizzler wasn't as good as I expected it to be.
Overall, a nice place to be with friends and family for meal.
Oh yes, do try chicken espedata here!!!

A huge disappointment ...... specially the service...I would rate them in negative for service.
Coming to place, it's spread over a huge area with tastefully done interiors and very casual ambience.
Food is average, we ordered peri peri chicken which was okay , chicken steak which was not up to the mark and burgers which were not so good as expected.
Service is pathetic and slow , they took around 40min to serve each item without the complimentary sides and were very casual in their behaviour and service.
We reached at 1.30 and left at 4.30, which is an example of how slow the service is.Very poor management and almost a harassment for us, for what reason you people are charging such high service charges?????
Per person without drinks is a round Rs950
Sunday lunch ruined , would not recommend at all.
6K for lunch=3 hours of nightmare.

Barcelos is pleasant enough if you are looking for a quiet, laid back time with friends or family. Since they haven't started serving alcohol as yet (not sure if they are going to - my bad forgot to ask), the place is less frequented than it's neighbours. Also, no hot drinks are served, even if they feature on the menu.

As far as the food is concerned, it's decent enough in terms of taste and quantity and the service is quick. However, if you are used to people serving out dishes for you, you will be disappointed. The molecular drinks are cool - both visually and taste-wise. 

The only problem this place might have going forward is that the menu is pretty close to Chilli's, which has an outlet just opposite. Then again, considering the bill I ran up was 1/4th of any of my outings at Chilli's (even if I take into consideration that we did not have alcohol), gives it an edge. 

All Barcelos has to do now is wait and watch how Kolkata foodies treat them.

Visited for a quick evening bite after shopping at Acropolis. Honestly, was blown over by the food. We had ordered the signature grilled chucken with peri peri....one of the best grilled chickens we had in entire India! We also had cheesy fries...which was fries mixed with capsicum, onion and layered with cheese...but still very crispy. The ferrero rocher milk shake was mindblowing. The best part is they have a unlimited soft drink option in just Rs. 100. The other stuff in the menu card looked so appealing that I have to come back here soon üòÄ

The name of the Service staff was Raj and he is someone to be remembered of. He suggested the speciality items of Barcelos (¬†two drinks...one kiwi based and one mango based were amazing) and they were really good. Peri peri sauces are add ons with the lovely cooked fish sizzlers and chicken portions. A must visit everyone. With special thanks to Raj.....you rock man....

What really intrigued me about trying out this restaurant is their colourful burgers. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by pink and black burgers? So finally I had the chance to eat out here tonight. Ambience is cozy, embraced in rustic charm; seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable. Their service is on point, served everything within 20 mins. Coming to the food, we ordered pesto pasta salad( non veg), Chicken Espetada, 3 chicken mini burgers and tangy mango molecular drink,which was highly recommended by the server.
‚Ä¢ Tangy Mango drink - This drink, which was recommended by the server, tasted awesome. With subtle bursts of spiciness infusing the tangy base; very refreshing. 5/5
‚Ä¢ Non-veg pesto pasta salad - This salad was kind of bleh for me, didn't really satiated my taste buds. The chicken pieces are generously added, but the dish altogether didn't work for me. 2.5/5
‚Ä¢ Chicken Espetada - This dish is among one of their best and popular dishes. The kebabs were tender and juicy. Along with the two sides, spicy rice and grilled veg, this dish was the star of the night. Highly recommended! 4.5/5
‚Ä¢ Chicken mini burger - Finally, the dish which enthralled me the most, was a big blunder: buns dry, patties bland. The plating was good, three colourful mini burgers with a side of hot potato wedges and mayonnaise. Well, I learned the hard way that you cannot judge a book by it's cover. 2/5
Though some of the dishes did not live up to the mark, overall it's a pretty decent restaurant serving delicious kebabs and drinks! Give it a try! :)

Barcelos claims that its serve the best peri-peri coated dishes in the world. I wouldn't agree to this but I would definitely agree that they serve the best ones in town(atleast right now) 
Visited this place with a friend of mine on a Sunday afternoon. We immediately got a seat and the staff was very courteous. 
We had ordered - 
‚Ä¢Peri Peri Black burger (split in twos) by itself
And
‚Ä¢ Half chicken in mild peri sauce with one sides(wedges and dip) 
The burger was nice, juicy and they had done justice to that sauce(amazing sauce,by the way)
The chicken too was good but was unevenly divided and drenched in the peri sauce. The wedges were judiciously flavoured, crunchy and overall it was a nice experience. 
As far as the service was concerned )and I mean the service and not the staff). It was slow, very slow. For the aforementioned dishes they took about 1:30 hrs. 
Value for money- 2.5/5. ‚Çπ911 inc tax for these 2 dishes. Bloody expensive,guys!
Happy dining. Do share your experience.

Tried the restaurant yesterday. The ambiance is very nice. Well illuminated and the staff is very friendly. Menu looks very extensive and lots of options. Tried the Chicken steak with wedges. Could have done better with the steak. But the peri sauce was spot on. Their kebabs are quite good. The molecule drinks are must try. You can also get bottomless coke. The damage was Rs 1383 for two. A must visit for sure

The ambience is nice friendly service..must visit place for all those chicken fanatics who had previously run out of places to devour the heavenly flesh of chicken with an awsumly spicy taste..thumbs up barcelos..definitely going to pay you guys a second visit..loads of dishes still left to explore

Barcelos , located on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall in Kasba , offers a unique dining experience that is sure to get your taste buds going. We started off with Chicken wings and Fish kebabs. Honesty , I've never had fish that was this succulent and tasty. A total winner! We followed it up with burgers and Chicken Sizzlers. Didn't try the burgers personally , but the Sizzler was delicious. Stuffed with Chicken , Mushrom and a host of veggies , it was a complete meal and quite different to the Continental version. Would definitely recommend this joint to everyone !

This new outlet offers an interesting blend of Portuguese and middle Eastern cuisine. Spacious and well lit, barcelos is a good restaurant for heavy meals. The quality of service is good and the food quantity is generous. My friends and I had ordered the chicken black burger and red burger which came with two sides of your choice, the cheesy chicken espedata, chicken steak and chicken peri peri sizzler. The portion was filling and the flavours were mild although you can spice it up accordingly with the help of their delicious sauces.

Kolkata now a days turned up to a centre of various cuisines and Barcelos being the newest addition to that. Located at Acropolis mall this food joint serves Portuguese food. The mini burgers with various color, flavour and texture of bread is one unique item which should be tried. The environment is also quiet well. As its newly opened so liquor licence is not available till now but surely would like to go once again when the restaurant is in its full flow coz I won't mind to sip a glass of drink along with few European snacks in such a cozy environment. As per the cost is concerned its not that cheap but also won't create a hole in your pocket. Give it a try if you love exploring new cuisines and ambiences.

Tonight we visited the restaurant for dinner.We ordered the first dish in the menu card,Chicken liver with Garlic roll.We were informed they did not have Garlic roll,so we ordered a Mezze platter with 5 dips,pita n falafel. One of the dips was just plain green chilli paste and inedible as it was extremely spicy. Later I was informed by the waiter, it was red chilli paste and it was suppose to be so spicy which we were not informed earlier. Later we wanted to have the Fantastic Four mini burger of different colours which they themselves said is their signature dish. Well even that was not available. So the list of unavailable items are - garlic rolls, mini burgers, black burger, chicken wraps. Perplexed what to eat as what I wanted from the menu card was not there, I ordered what they had- 1/4 grilled chicken with sprouts and chicken pita wrap with grilled veggies.  Well, the grilled chicken I'am sure was cooked in the morning,warmed up and drizzled with a horrible sauce, sprouts had no sprouting but soaked up pulses. My chicken pita was OK but again the grilled veggies were boiled n drizzled with again some horrible sauce with no salt. Overall a terrible dinner. With ever so increasing price hikes and terrible amount of taxes, such an inedible dinner really hurts our sentiments and our pockets. One or two items not available is acceptable but whatever we wanted to have was not there. Also please taste your food before serving.

It's a new one in Kolkata by the name sounds like Barcelona. Ambience of the plae was good okaish. The staff was cooperative but they had little idea about what they are selling. I had no idea what I was eating I wanted to try something new so I was expecting something different. When the food came it was like any normal fried chicken there was no different flavor. I could have had this some where else also but came for something different here. Drinks were okay again nthg different.....price was reasonable may be because they r new...
One thing which these acropolis people are charging are service charge 10% of ur bill for some it might be new because most of the place do not charge this

The Black bun and White bun burgers are so aesthetically pleasing it's hard to not to order them. We were not disappointed. Huge burgers, undoubtedly vfm, and not loaded with cheese. Their signature peri peri sauces made 'em burgers perfect. The Pesto Pasta Salad was below-average. Very dry and bland. They can improve on their cutlery, it's a disaster for clumsy hands. They can also consider switching to bigger plates if it's not much of an issue, instead of the cheaper alternative of paper table mats which they currently use. If I do visit them again, it would be solely for their burgers.

Coming from humble beginnings with only a single operation found in Pretoria, South Africa in 1993 - Barcelos, International Chain that specializes in Portuguese Peri Peri Grilled Chicken, ¬†is named after a quaint Portuguese town that is famous for an ancient legend of the Barcelos rooster. According to the 17th century legend, a pilgrim seeking food and water in Barcelos, was accused of stealing from a landowner. The pilgrim was sentenced to hang despite his protests of innocence. In a last minute appeal to the judge, who was enjoying a roasted rooster for dinner at the time, the pilgrim boldly stated, "If I am innocent, then that rooster will get up and crow!" Suddenly, a gorgeous scarlet-plumed cockerel rose from the plate, crowing loudly. - Source: :barcelos.co.in

Operational at Acropolis mall, at the 4th floor, they have been quite successful in creating an initial buzz with the kind of detailing that goes on with the food, service and ambience. ¬†you will fall in love with the the chick decor and and overall ambience. Every table has 4 variants of peri peri sauce which is quite innovative. well illuminated world map is quite an attraction.

It was a Monday evening when we decided to check this place out after a shopping spree at Acropolis mall. it was an unplanned late dinner for us, and we were hearing lot of great stuff about the place and trust us, we were pleasantly surprised. The menu was a relief within kolkata with with food joints flooded with italian and chinese food. Specializing in Portuguese and middle eastern cuisine, they have mastered the craft.
We ordered one grilled chicken burger with fries as the side dish, Chicken sizzler and Red bull. ¬†Burger was served in a tray with fries in a tiny fryer. it was juicy to the core and will certainly leave you craving for more. Sizzler were made to perfection. ¬†
Really liked the speedy service, staff courtesy. and everything with so much of perfection.

Highly recommended.¬†

P.S: The kind of menu and ambience they boost, a permanent liquor licence is highly recommended :)

So, around 8 of us dropped in here a few days back and the experience was lukewarm at best. I ordered the peri peri black magic burger along with two side dishes, coleslaw and fries with dip. The buns of the burger were black and somehow, quite crumbly. The filling was nice but the total experience with the burger was ruined because the buns kept crumbling between my fingers. The coleslaw was good and so were the fries. The pricing was also on the higher side, so the quality should have been better. Also, the staff were not very helpful or friendly and were rather eager to watch us leave or so it seemed as they handed us the bill before we were done with our meals. Overall, I believe there is ample scope for improvement.

BARCELOS 
As they say, Barcelos is named after a quaint Portuguese town that is famous for an ancient legend of the Barcelos rooster. Well whatever be the reason the name is pretty cool. :-) It‚Äôs a International Chain that specializes in Portuguese Peri Peri Grilled Chicken. They started operations in Pretoria and have since spread out globally across many countries. 
Opened just a few days back in our city of joy ,located on the top floor of Acropolis Mall , this place has already earned a lot of fame and is going to be a star in the days to come if they continue serving good foods.
The ambience is cool and serene. The walls are decorated with some innovative paintings. It has got a world map on one one of its wall, illuminated with dim neon lights to add to the decor . The staffs were good and courteous. Service was also pretty fast. 
Food :
We ordered the following¬†¬† : 
(i)¬†¬† ¬Ω Chicken with coleslaw 
(ii)¬† Chicken espetada with garlic wedges and fried veges
(iii) Chicken Trinchado with rice
(iv) Tangy Mango
(v)¬† Kiwi Cooler 
Each table had four bottles of peri peri sauces namely ‚Äì mild peri, veri peri ,tangy lemon and supa peri¬† to make your food even more tasty and interesting. ¬†
¬Ω Chicken - The name itself brings a feeling and also being their Signature dish ,we did not hesitate to order it. You get options to choose your sidelines with it - either one or two . We took coleslaw . Served in no time ,it was a brilliant way to start the meal . Two bigggg leg pieces were served perfectly grilled and marinated in peri peri spices ,tasted sinlessly great with the mayonnaised cabbage leaves. ¬†
Chicken Espetada ‚ÄìThis is a typical Portuguese dish usually of large chunks of beef / chicken rubbed in garlic and salt.¬† Espetada roughly translated from Portuguese means "skewered", also commonly referred to as a kebab. It is one hanging dish skewered with pieces or blocks of chicken breasts sandwiched between slices of bell peppers and onions. It was served on a skewer which hangs from a hook on a stand as it is presented to you. Garlic wedges and fried veges came along with a mayonnaise dip¬† with the dish. The concept was something new and will catch your eyes¬† immediately . The chicken pieces tasted great with the siders and it was a thrill to mix it with the various peri peri sauces .A must try if you are at barcelos . 
Chicken Trinchado ‚Äì Another Portuguese dish served in a cup plated on a bed of rice .¬† Trinchado is a classic Portuguese dish that is spicy and very rich with a sauce that will keep everyone quiet for a long while! It had small cubes of chicken teamed with small pieces of veges made in some special sauce to give a thick gravy-ish look, served in a cup. Was really good with the rice . Tried Portuguese foods for the first time and I must say that I am loving it. :-)
Both the drinks were good but I loved the tangy mango .It was a great refreshing drink,absolutely perfect for the summers
Well, A great Portuguese experience. Will definitely visit to their signature burgers .

Finally barcelos arrives in kolkata. Firstly the place is located in really good area which is well connected to every part of the city. Moving on to the restaurant the place is really nice with good ambience and polite staff, the food is really delicious and one of the best for peri peri lovers. Apart from the food and the ambience the restaurant's concept is really good and appealing. There can be a little disappointment for the vegetarian as the options are very limited.

It has already been there in Delhi for quite some time now and finally made its way to Kolkata. The restaurant specializes in Portuguese food and is named after the Portuguese town Barcelos. They're famous for their flame grilled chicken as the name suggests and it is really good, but that part comes later. Firstly, the interior, I liked the ambience. It's quite spacious and has a prettier seating area as you go inside. They have a bar area, although they don't serve alcohol. There's also an adorable smoking zone which looks like a huge telephone booth. Coming to service, the waiters were extremely polite and kind and they make sure that you're fine and enjoying your food, so much sometimes that you can't gulp the food down your throat.
So I went there with my friends, we ordered 3 burgers: peri peri black magic with fries and dip, peri peri red hottie with spicy rice, and a peri peri bloody red by itself which is the one I ordered. Both of the reds were absolutely delicious, although the burger bun wasn't as "red" as it looked on the menu. The filling in all three of them was very juicy and very tasty. The peri peri sauce is out of world delicious! However, I wasn't too happy with the black bun, it was kind of sticky and heavy and didn't taste too well. Also, i expected more out of the spicy rice but it was really ordinary. Overall, I think it's totally worth a visit and I would definitely go again to try out a few other dishes which I've heard about.

PS: I absolutely loved the idea of serving water with mint leaves, it looked classy and gave it a slight minty flavour.

Finally crossed this off the list. It was well worth it. Food is different. Good different. Like Nando's. They are not serving alcohol yet. So we took bottomless cold drinks with our meal.
A very peri black bun chicken burger, half a grilled chicken, both with a side of lovely mashed potatoes. Also, pita bread stuffed with grilled chicken and veggies (with a side of wedges and mayo dip). You also get 4 types of sauces on the table. 3 Peri Peri and a tangy lemon. I personally preferred the Supa-Peri.

The price varies with the no. of sides you take. I wanna try the spicy rice the next time. 
Overall, a good experience. Would love to visit again to try the other dishes.

Loved the food at Barcelos...it reminds me of Nandos which is my fave place to visit in other cities...Kolkata needed it! Nice place to chill with friends. Thankfully it had many veg options contrary to what the name suggests.

A warm place to go with friends and family but not worth the buck. The food is ok, clumsy and very little in quantity. None of the food items were great. The moctails were a saviour. All of the items in molecular moctails are awesome. There is nothing more to this place. May come back for HEY ROSIE.

Had been hearing the hype about this place for a while now.. Finally landed up this weekend. It was quite packed and the ambience was quite nice. Very limited options for vegetarians. Ordered the burger platter which was decent with fancy colour burgers. Was expecting the burgers to be a bit more wow. The bread of the white and brown burger was very fluffy and nice, not so much with the red and black ones. Ordered the pesto pasta salad which was yummy. And  hummus and pita bread where the pita was yumm but hummus lacked a bit flavour, needed more garlic I suppose. In all the service was fast and good and the prices was decent.

Loved their food. Had a guilt free lunch. We ordered chicken drumsticks,  1/2 chicken with potato wedges, kiwi cooler and brownie with vanilla ice cream. On the top of that they really has given us reasons to go back there by providing us a coupon with many offers. Being a health conscious foodie what has attracted me most is their grilled chicken with veri peri. We'll definitely go back and will suggest people to try their food at least once.

Recently visited this place for a special date and it stood up to my expectations big time. If you want a southern hit right in the middle of kolkata. This ia where you might want to be. Good ambience. Food could get a little bland if you like it too spicy but the on the table sauce assortment should help you out with that.

Well it was my first visit though I m not habituated But I m feeling pleased to give feedback, ambience was beyond my expectations and the Black beauty chicken was unique and something different which I had first time, loved it. The chicken black burger which was looking burnt but it was something which you should try there as you won't get anywhere this colorful mouthwatering burger.
Kudos team Barcelos .....

It has been quite sometime that I had been there. This review is kind of an overdue one, although better late than never. I was there with a friend of mines, for a quick snack and a comfortable chat in the evening. We tried the signature dish of barcelos i.e the mini burgers. We ordered 3 chicken ones' , one of the color white, the other of the color red and the last one of the normal bread shade! all of these mini burgers were quite tasty. although, ¬†the white burger needs a special mention cause i liked it the best. It was a strange combination of very soft and tasty chicken, mayonnaise and small pieces of pineapple but the taste was very joyful one. The dips were tasty as well, specially the hot and spicy one. The atmosphere was quite satisfactory. The one downer in our visit was that we didn't get the french fries along with the burgers which we had ordered for cause it was still in the making.

If you are searching for good food with great ambience Barcelos will be the right choice. For the First time I have experienced Portuguese cuisine and trust me it took my heart away. Liked the cozy ambience and the decor, the staffs are really welcoming and humble. Loved their innovative presentation of serving food. Chicken drumstick was superb. I had ordered their signature dish chicken picantte which was overwhelming and merely with any oil. The white burger and mint blast was unequivocally admirable. Overall experience was very good and looking forward to visit again..

Barcelos, a new entrant in Kolkata's food galaxy. This Portuguese joint is a much needed change from the city bursting with Italian & Continental eateries. Liked it's cozy ambience & the decor. The staff were courteous. Loved their molecular mocktails, Tangy Mango is my favourite. The grilled chicken with the Peri Peri sauce was succulent & non oily. The Garlic fish with rice was good but loved their Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt dip. The only disappointment was their Non veg Kebab Platter. Found it a little dry & not so tasty.
The overall experience was good & will be going again very soon.

Ran into this new restaurant in Acropolis mall on the way out of X-men: Apocalypse.
While the ambience and service definitely match the concept, sadly when it came to execution we were a tad disappointed. While it is unfair to compare the restaurant to Chili's, I guess it was inevitable when you look at the menu and the format. However as I said in terms of service, overall experience, and most importantly - quality of food the bar had been set a bit too high. While giving him full marks for enthusiasm our server was unable to clearly explain the theme of the restaurant. For eg. I could not understand their Peri Peri fascination. Anyway keeping in mind it was around 5pm and we were not very hungry, we decided to order a few items that caught our eye which would give us an idea of the place. While the high point of the meal was the healthy Black Mutton Burger we were sorely let down by the Chicken Steak, which had dried out by the time it reached the table, and the Baba Ganoush which had almost no trace of eggplant.
Willing to put this down to teething issues that every new place faces. Since we found it a potentially nice family restaurant I really hope the next time we visit we'd be confident to try out the rest of their menu.

Tried the Chicken Black Magic burger and Barcelos Signature 1/4 grilled chicken in Veri Peri sauce.
Well, I somehow didn't like the taste of the black burger bun, wasn't complimenting the perfectly cooked chicken fillet inside. Tasted a tad bitter rather. But the filling was good. Okayish taste.
The grilled chicken however, has become an absolute favourite. A succulently done chunk of perfectly grilled chicken, with the amazing veri peri mayo, had that distinct taste of smokiness and something that is totally worth the price. If I decide to return to Barcelos, I'll only come for this. Not the burgers.

Came in highly recommended. Popped in one evening. Lot of work put into the decor. And the service was adequate. But the food. Oh the food was so below par. The burgers were really dry with bland overcooked chicken inside. The fish steak had 6 tiny pieces of fish, with bland sides of yellow rice and vegetables. The chicken steak was properly cooked but nothing out of the ordinary. The size of the trout was exaggerated and was not deboned properly. The brownie shake came in like the morning cup of bournvita we used to enjoy when we were in 3rd grade.

They lacked originality, creativity and all in all basic restaurant quality in all of their dishes even after putting up a hefty price tag.

Nice ambience and courteous service. The food tries to pull off a nandos but quite doesn't make the mark. They've tried to be innovative with their healthy and colorful burgers. Which look intriguingly delightful but don't taste that great. The buns happened to be quite dry that crumbled and the taste wasn't something I'd come back for. The grilled chicken was however was succulent and well done. My vote is purely for it.

I was invited to Barcelos the week it opened up in Kolkata but regretfully due to work commitments could not go. Since then it was on my wishlist and a few days back after watching a movie at Acropolis Mall we finally made it to dinner there. I had heard mixed reviews from my friends who had eaten there but as always I visited with an open mind. To start with a bit about Barcelos ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a three decade old International Chain that specializes in Portuguese Peri Peri Grilled Chicken. They started operations in Pretoria (South Africa) and have since spread out globally across sixteen countries. They have four kinds of Peri Peri Sauce ‚Äì three with progressive degrees of heat and a lemon Peri Peri which was my preference as I can‚Äôt have too much spice.

My brother and I recently visited this place. We came out of the movie theatre famished at around 4 pm in the evening. Warmly greeted by the cheerful staff and the cozy ambience, we were quickly taken to our table in an almost empty section of the restaurant. A little help from the staff we managed to order a portion of chicken espeteda, ¬Ω grilled chicken with coleslaw and mashed potatoes on the sides, 2 mutton and 2 chicken mini burgers and a molecular mocktail of peach ice tea. Our wait for food was not long and the wait was filled with good music in the background. 

The portion of serving was really good as it was most suitable for 3 rather than 2. The chicken espeteda was served on a long hanging seekh, the burgers were served in red, black and white buns with distinctive taste, ¬Ω chicken was literally ¬Ω of a chicken and the molecular mocktail was served with a touch of art to it. The sauces were the highlights of the food, ranging from tangy to high heat option. Super peri was our choice of sauce which went really well with the grilled chicken. The food was a concoction of good presentation and taste. 5 stars for food.

Ambience
Barcelos is a well designed restaurant with a mind blowing decor. One of the walls is adorned with the world map! The decor and ambience along with the music works like magic. It is undoubtedly one amazing place for a date or a cool hangout with friends or family.

Service
The staff is extremely jovial and friendly. The services were quick and they didnt give us any opportunity to complain!

Appetizers
In this section,we ordered for mild peri sauce based chicken espetada along with wedges and dip green salad. This dish was a treat to all the 5 senses! The wedges were beautifully fried with delicate flavours that burst in the mouth leaving behind a cherishable taste. The chicken was succulent and adequately flavoured. The dip served along was perfect as well. It is one dish we would recommend to all the foodies out here. And yes, 5/5!

Mocktails
If you are a mocktail freak, Barcelos is your to go location! The molecular drink section is beyond perfect. They simply create mocktail magic, and add the much needed x factor to any usual mocktail we have. We would'nt give out any more spoilers! Go try out yourself! ( what we ordered in this section was Tangy mango and Kiwi cooler. A 5/5 for both of them. )

Main course
There are a wide range of choices available in the menu card, and we chose Peri peri grilled chicken in veri peri sauce. Sadly, we were a bit disappointed with this dish as they had recommended this dish to be their best and yet it turned out to be a usual dish with no such special factor to look out for. We give this dish a 3/5.

It was my brother's birthday. And we decided to visit this new place at Acropolis Mall. Loved the look of the place, brings in quite a casual let-go kinda mood. While choosing what we should order we were completely puzzled. But then with the help of the staff we finally ordered the food items whose pictures I have uploaded. I honestly don't remember the names as I was too busy gossiping and having fun. But I juuuuust loved the grilled chicken. It was perfect! üëå That's exactly how grilled chicken should be. And in drinks I had ordered Tangy mango which was also great! üòã The staff and all the arrangements were pretty good. I am impressed. And the cost is actually reasonable somewhere. So I am going to recommend this place to everyone. Oh not to forget the sauces which were yum! ‚ù§ Keep up the good work guys..

You will feel sad for not being a Portuguese . haha , jokes apart . They just know , how to serve the chicken . I also like the place for it's own gesture and beautiful decoration . I ordered a half cottage chicken with smashed potato . Yes , I know your feeling ¬†! Its wow ! Then I ordered black chicken burger with fries , which is obviously comes with it . The dip was so special that I still feel deep for the dip . And finally , chicken kebabs with coleslaw and green salad . It was the best part of my lunch . I simply can't forget the bites of kebabs . And finally , guys ; be prepare for 30% tax which comes with your food as a nightmare . :-)

A Sunday afternoon can't get better than visiting this South-African food joint serving Potuguese food in kolkata.This new kid on the block packs lots of surprises.The ambience has a nice feel towards the inside with dimly lit yellowish lights.Great vibe actually.Started of with their Indian Classic Kala Khatta,Rose,Berry Cucumber and Electric Blue Fizz (Blue curacao) drinks with liquid nitrogen giving a funky smoky effect.Followed by probably one of the tastiest non-veg sliders out there.We opted for 2 chicken+2 mutton patty sliders.Which were delightfully different coloured.Not just so,they tasted different aswell.Quiet a surprise.The chicken cheese espetada was okay-ish.cz i felt the sliders we had before overpowered them.Lastly we had a Cheesecake smoothie which literally had us smiling. Definite try outs - Indian Classic Kala Khatta,Berry Cucumber drinks,their slider platter and for deserts The cheesecake smoothie and Blueberry Cheesecake is awesome as well :)

Barcelos the place for chicken! Similar to Nandos with its South African Peri-Peri spice but with more variety and bang for your buck. Grilled is the way to go and sauces for every palate. Decor is beautiful and seating is very comfortable with enough room for even large groups. Staff are possibly the politest and most welcoming in the city, the cream of the crop. Food, you guessed it tasty, refreshing and clucking good (all puns intended) you really get what your looking for. Even though the food comes served with a red flag there are no reasons to worryüòâ. The quantity is really good and the price tag doesn't break your bank (4 people eating single side dish meals with unlimited drinks and one desert for 2150‚Çπ). Smokers too have a room to indulge. Great addition to the food circle in Kolkata.

Nandos didn't make it to Kolkata. No problem. We have Barcelos here.
A new star in the constellation. 

Located on 4th floor at Acropolis Mall, Kasba

Great decor. Nice touch of writings, paintings etc. Probably that's how Portugese restaurants are themed. It has a separate smoking zone.

As soon as we entered, one thing was sure, Hospitality was going to be good.

We ordered a Half Chicken, Chicken Espetada and a set of 4 Mini burgers. The waiter, Shadab, was courteous enough to tell us not to order more sideliners since the Espetada already would have 2 of 'em.

The Half Chicken was very juicy and a set of different flavours. You'd consider it bland after having the Half Tandoori chicken. But you've gotta develop a taste for this cuisine.

Chicken Espetada came in a hanging skewer with 2 sideliners being Coleslaw and Potato Wedges. The chicken was a little hard. But the taste enhanced after mixing it with the Peri Sauces.

4 Mini Burgers were pretty good. Never had such colourful burgers. And probably really healthy. The chicken was similar in all. But the Buns changed the taste. On asking we got to know the Red Peri Bun was made with beetroot. Really Healthy.

Then ordered a Too Much Peri Peri Bloody Red. Fully loaded. This probably was Heaven. 2 layers of chicken fillets. And the magic was done by the pineapple slice. That sweet tinge added to greatness.

Kiwi Cooler and Tangy Mango were great accompaniments. A new concept with nitrogen water.

Had to wait for quite a time for the burger. Apart from that. Great service.

A pinch for the pocket obviously. But the cost is basically for the concept. So you don't mind.

Pros - Location. Hospitality. GREAT FOOD. 
Cons - Expensive. Felt the number of staff was less. Once it started gettig crowded, orders took long.

Barcelos for Me is the NANDOS that never made it to Kolkata ...... 
The food is very very good. 
The portions are very very generous. 
It was a first time there so couldn't really try out a lot of things but I feel the food needs that tangy and spicy palate!
Hope to try more from their menu! 
Cheers to Kaushik Roy Chowdhury for this venture! And special mention on their hospitality -it was commendable!

Barcelos is the place which is famous for peri-peri grilled chicken and thier burgur collection.In kolkata i had tried chicken in many places but the chicken is served to me in Barcelos is amazing. Its very soft juicy and healthy also. They are serving hummus also in different style with named peri hummus. I have visited twice in a week and tried the same grilled chicken with mild peri sauce and hummus with pita bread. The food quality is very good but most important to maintain this throughout the journey. I realy appreciate the team of Barcelos to keep this rapo. Specially the standard and service.It was fantastik experience in BARCELOS that 2nd time got a great and better than great service from same staff, its Vijay who made my evening with my family best evening even in busiest day like saturday. Thanks to him for suggesting my wife's favorite icecream and food.

After reading positive reviews 
Went to give this place a try.
The experience was really amazing.
The decor was amazing and so was the quality of the food.
The chicken was tender and soft and had that essence of char grilled.
The mayo dip had the hint of a spicy kick which I loved to be honest.
The mini burgers were amazing
The meat patty being soft and cooked to perfection and the fresh veggies were also spot on.
The chicken espatada was also amazing with carmelaized onions and capsicums.
The attitude of the waiters were really amazing and to be very frank not seen on a daily basis in any Kolkata restaurants.
The brownie shake and kala khatta were also up to mark expected fr Barcelos.
The only reason I'm giving this a half star less because there were certain menu that I wanted to try but was not available so I hope there would be an improvement
Overall a must visit to all the 'chicken' lovers of Kolkata.
Go and gift your tummy a delicious treat :)

Barcelos is a new gem added to the food treasures of Kolkata. An Afro-Portuguese name spreaded all over the world has newly come to Kolkata after Delhi, in India. On the top floor of Acropolis Mall, it's located at a side. The place has a outside sitting area and also inside where it sports an ambiance resembling to the charms of an old countryside pub in Europe. They do not serve alocohol yet due to license issues but that will start soon within one month or so.
One thing I noticed in the earlier reviews that the clients have complained a lot about the service and efficiency. Trust me, I found it to be topnotch. The staffs and all of the personnel were very helpful starting at the gate till we came out. They attended to every problem with a smile and a warm attitude.
We settled in at a inner corner of the restoration where a huge wall had sported a beautiful painting of a country bazaar in Europe.
The ambiance was cosy and nice, tables were well organized with the cutlery and their special Peri peri sauce of different categories.
We were given welcome drinks at first - Kiwi Cooler and Berry Cucumber, these were complimentary for us. Both the mocktails were very good. Loved them to every bit. We loved the Kiwi Cooler so much that we later again ordered one.
For the food, we had a quarter grilled chicken in mild peri sauce as we cannot stand spicy food at all. The chicken was soft, well grilled, spicy outside and white and tender inside. Loved the signature mild peri sauce served at Barcelos.
Next we had ordered a mini burger platter which contained a red, white, black each and a regular burger. There were two chicken and two mutton burger as we chose them to be. But you can also customize according to your wish. They use completely organic products and vegetables to colour the buns and I must say, it's very unique. It's a delight to have these burgers and they are recommended to be healthy as they do not use any oil in the cooking except for the fries and wedges.
Last came a trout fish. I had my trout last when I was in fifth standard at a very quaint cafe in Manali. In Kolkata, whenever I see trout anywhere, it's either very costly or the recipe gives me vibes that it might stink. But here, it was a grilled trout in mild peri again. This Himalayan trout is brought from Delhi, as you hardly get them here in Kolkata. The fish was delicious, awesome. I loved it because I gotta be nostalgic about one of my favourite trips and a very special meal. I must say, that the price of this dish served here is optimum compared to the rarity of the fish.
Last was the blueberry cheescake. This too, was very good. The food was nice. Only one part I think is that their sauces bring a monotony to the dishes. Barcelos plays only with peri peri sauces at cooking. Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri, Very Peri and Super Peri are the table sauces and also used in cooking. So people who cannot withstand the hot peri peri, their options get limited. I think they can work over this in while catering to the foodies in Kolkata.
Important is to note that all the foods here are very healthy as they are completely oil-free, either grilled or baked except for the wedges and fries. So, if you're a foodie but now on a diet due to the doctor's suggestions, then Barcelos is the place for you. And others too, yeah, it's a good place. Worth trying for! You will love it. Happy Dining! :)

Had lunch with friends. The decor is gorgeous and welcoming but food disappoints. The pesto pasta and the sizzler both lacked in terms of perfection and finesse. The drinks didn't taste good. They need to up their game.

We wanted to try a new cuisine when mwe zeroed to explore Barcelos at Acropolis Mall, 4th Floor, Kasba.

We were quite happy with the food and service, moat importantly we loved the way our restaurant manager, Vijay explained us what went into cooking the recipe which gave us confidence in ordering. To my surprise all that we ordered were good for our taste buds.
We tried Chicken Steak and 1/4 pepperoni chicken which is their signature dish.The peri peri was awesome and just so lived by us.

Must must try out.Barcelos

Absolutely in love with their Peri Peri chicken wings. I've already visited this place 4 times in in 1 month just for their wings. The size of the wings are just right and the flavor is too good. If you're into spicy food then you'll love this, no doubt!

I always had this hunch that if anything could beat nandos then it must be Barcelos. To have one such outlet in my city and to have visited it, the feeling is definitely sublime.

The ambience is lively with a mellow odour of charcoal that adds to the excitement if not more to the appetite. Its absolutely as one would expect form a place like Barcelos.

Coming to the food. The menu is varied and one can chose from a variety of delicacies. What is very catchy is that the illustration of the food on the menu exactly matches the one that will be served on your table. One has to chose from 4 signature sauces in which he/she wants the protein to be literally lathered in and grilled.

The sauces being:
1. Tangy lemon (for the weak hearted)
2. Mild peri
3. Very peri
4. Supa peri (Tongue of iron needed more than iron heart)

Think twice before you go for the Supra peri. The initial bites will tingle your taste buds and bring a smile to your face. But as the heat sets in the tingle turns to pain and smile to tears.

One of the best part of the experience were the drinks. Anybody who wishes to experience the theatre created in Heston Blumenthal's dishes must try them. The cold mist from the liquid nitrogen and the fizzy bubbles from the solid carbon dioxide were a spectacle to behold.

The service was very satisfactory and the attendants were very enthusiastic in their approach and their recommendations.

Overall one of the best experiences I have had in Kolkata till date !!

A nice woody looking place which has a relaxed cafe feel to it. On a weekend afternoon, one could chill with some refreshing Mocktail like the kiwi cooler and bite into some juicy chicken with mild Peri, very Peri or supa Peri flavoured sauce - yes you decide how spicy you would like your sauce to be! They even put a cute flag on the dish to announce your ' peri' choice.

The chicken wings and the Barcelos signature chicken in 1/4th size ( they serve 1/2 or full size as well) was very well done. Juicy and soft, the flesh was easily separated from the bones. The accompanying greens sauted in soya sauce and the mashed potatoes were not great and didn't add to the dish. The mayo with the wings was not complimenting the dish; perhaps something minty could have worked well.

From the African Portuguese selection, the fish and rice combo served with veggies was filling but didn't have a distinct flavour.

My recommendation would be to stick to the signature grilled chicken with your choice of Peri

[Intro]
after waiting and waiting finally they're in kolkata,this is their second outlet in india after delhi.i was waiting for this moment i went to acropolish mall few days back while the work process going on,from that day it was in my wishlist,it was huge place and spacious.around 60-68 people can sit and eat at a time,there is not only indoor seating also you can seat outside.there're some lovely wall hangings a clock and a world map which was lovely way decorated by the lighting effects.there is another good thing which touched me a wall paiting not only good it was superb.
[Location]Very east to locate,inside acropolish mall 4th mall food court take another step to 5th floor where the Asia kitchen just beside that you will find it.

[Ambience n interior]well first impression is last impression from interior to ambience it was a lovely experience for me,very classy and well managed decorated the place very well with the lovely style,chairs along with the sofas it is a good combination,i really liked this place,

[Foods]

1. Tangy mango - good to have this type of drinks in this scorching weather,the quantity they served us it was good in a huge glass,added ripe mango flavour consist with crushed ice and ice cubes over it taste was very average,as well as not very smooth.

2. Kiwi cooler - this was lovely, not the presentation part as well as the flavour was brilliant, added extra bit of sweetness taste was lovely, taste was simply awesome it was a superb combination.

3. Chicken wings - as a starter it was just superb i was really shocked while i had it infront of my table it was not only just grilled as well as it almost burned taste was ok excessive amount of heating caused this thing,taste part it was chewable soft eating along with peri peri sauce had a good change of tongue.

4. Chicken espatada - chicken breast marinated with onion and pepper,the texture was lovely,but from the taste point of view it was a disaster they served it very cold,after having a little bite it was just ok,have to serve it hot.

5. Boneless things with onion and peppers - one word it was a lovely dish,chicken positions tossed very well,the flavour was awesome served along with the peri mayo,very soft juicy but again the failure part it was too cold to understand the actual taste.

6. Peri peri black magic - it was a burger mainly consist with peri peri sauce inside portion was filled with vegetables like jalape√±os, tomato,luttuce,chicken portion along with the sauces inside of a bun,really good taste.

7. Peri peri bloody red - cucumber,jalape√±o,tomato, lettuce,cheese slice,peri peri mayo this combination was inside of this lovely burger,taste part it was good the inside things were very fresh,giving a extra bit of salsa along with mild peri peri leaves a unique texture and a awesome combination of tangy and sweet taste.

8. White chicken burger - the bun was very soft and will melt inside your mouth from the first bite,inside portion used extra bit of fresh tomatos,green pepper chili garlic along with iceburg and the chicken breast they used inside of this it was very well cooked the grill part was lovely eating along with the peri peri sauce it was amazing.

[Service]

I think this part a very big disappointment, not for the food part but the serving part,first of all the food they're serving it was good but the thing is keep on asking them how long they will took for a single plate,not even that a plate of burgers they served us after 1 hour, this was a very bad experience i had.

overall this place is good for the food point part it was lovely,the drink burgers as well the chicken wings and chicken espatada was really good,full of flavour,eationg along with the four types of peri peri sauce.wish you all the very best everyone,there're some other lovely foods which i have to try for my next visit.
                                          ...

This new kid in the block is fab. Barcelos has been there in other cities for sometime now, so we were very excited about checking out the outlet in our city. It is situated at Acropolis mall. This has a very unique outdoor sitting arrangement right beside the enclosed section. The place is very well decorated. There are these particular yellow couches I'm really fond of. It is a moderately spacious place. The waiters are extremely polite, courteous and make it a point to make sure that you are fine and enquiring if you like the food (a little too much maybe) üòõ The smoking zone resembles an enlarged phonebooth ( those classic red ones). Coming to the food, like the menu makes it very clear it is the HOME OF PERI PERI. So we had ordered peri peri chicken wings, the famous peri peri black burger, peri peri red burger with wedges and fries on the side. For drinks we opted for the molecular iced tea. The food was good. Chicken wings were really tasty, however I was a little disappointed with the burger. I mean the grilled chicken in peri peri sauce tasted brilliant but the bread was too heavy and makes you feel bloated. The drink had those smokey effect, which was a visual treat. Price wise it is pretty affordable and I'd say value for money. Apart from this the mini burgers are tasty as well. Must visit. üòä

Loved the decor of this cafe but coming to food it couldn't satisfy my taste buds to that extent. The ambiance is great with courteous staff management. We had ordered 3 chicken mini burgers with sprout beans and grape fruit punch. We had to wait for about 15mins after placing the order to get it served. Grape fruit punch was refreshing.

We have had Barcelos three times. Two times we took away and one time we ate in. My husband brought home the falafel in pita and it was the best one I have tasted since being in Kolkata for the last five years. The chicken peri drumbsticks as well as the 1/2 chicken was really flavorful.

We decided to eat in the next time and ordered the mini burgers. Two mutton and 1 chicken. They were really really good. The mutton and the combination of the different flavored rolls added to the flavor of the hamburgers. We had ordered the Mediterranean platter but the fryer was broken so we ended up ordering the chicken platter which included chicken livers, wings, drumsticks and thighs. There was enough on the platter for two people to share. I really enjoy the peri peri sauce that they marinate the chicken in.

Today my husband went to do take away again and we wanted the burgers again. I was surprised to hear that we could not take the burgers away. I don't know the reason, but all items should be allowed on take away. It is the customers prerogative after you explain if the buns run or not if we still want them. We then had to change what we wanted since we could not get the burgers. We ordered the capris salad and it would have been really good if they had put the dressing on side instead of on the salad as it was really soggy when we ate it. We had the veggie pita so far and it was ok. I prefer the falafel pita over all of them.

I do recommend the place. However, they need to add a restroom inside. Even though there is a restroom right around the corner, there should be one located inside the restaurant for their patrons as well as their staff.

I visited this place with very high hopes but came out quite dissapointed. Barcelos is a major food chain, highly popular in Delhi but it failed to satisfy my taste buds. The ambience of the food joint is nice with a huge world map being the main attention seeker. The Staff is corteous but a little slow. Now coming to what we ordered.
Kiwi Kooler
Oreo Cookie Milkshake
Garlic Fish with Rice
Chicken Sizzler
Peri peri black Burger
White chicken Burger 
Berry Cheescake
Tutty fruity sundae
What I found common in all the dishes is that its stuffed with too much boiled veggies which don't taste that good, especially in the sizzler. The burgers where OK ( I was particularly excited about them) not extraordinary, although I loved how they make them in different colours. Both the drinks where very good and I loved the kiwi kooler. The cheesecake had a very hard filling whereas it should have been soft and wobbly. The sundae was good. The reason I didnot like the food was maybe because of  the Portugese cuisine to which I am not used to. But overrall not really worth the money it cost us. I hope they improve in the future since its new in Kolkata and still understanding what people are liking. 
Happy dining peeps :)

In this week I want to visit acroplic mall kasba . I know that,  there was a good new opened restaurant name " Barcelos "  And I just get into the restaurant because I just love to test new food so I was there .
Really impressed by the pleasant sitting arrangement ,gives memorable moments while enjoying food.had a awesome party with red burger and tempting peri peri sauce . But there was a smallcomplain regarding my server..  "UPASANA" she is very unconscious about tacking care of his guest , and most of time she gossip with others server , she forget to attend my table she need to be more careful about this things . By the way my food experience was very good and joyful and I will remember this till the next time when I visit here . Love you Barcelos ‚ù§

Visited this place on a Sunday with some friends of mine. It's located in the Acropolis mall in Kasba. The ambience is really good. We were here for some snacks so we ordered a plate of French fries and a Berry Cucumber and Kiwi Cooler for moctails. They were really good too. A very nice place to hangout and have eat. Will definitely give another visit.

''All that glitters is not gold'' , well it sums up our experience at Barcelos. ¬†It was a complete disaster waiting to happen today! Decor is a clever ploy to distract you from the indifferent and inept service. My server SAMPI was a complete unprofessional and inefficient in her attitude. A server must answer any queries regarding food and billing without making faces and throwing her hands in the air. Other servers are too busy to answer or respond to any complaints. Complaints we had in plenty, even more than the dishes we ordered. How would you like to eat undercooked and old meat, disguised as a kebab in a new dish? It is only in India when you complain that you are told this is the way they make kebabs. Main course like Chicken Cataplana consists of hard chicken and chickpea which is almost not cooked served in a acid inducing gravy. We thought like good Calcuttans that we will wait for the best-dessert. It was the worst thing to come on a plate. A dense, rubbery, frozen piece of chocolate truffle cake served on a wooden plate with an ice-cream that by the time you eat melts on the flat surface. They do not believe in bowls.¬†
When we complained about all these problems, they with apparent apologies decided to give us a discount of Rs.295/-. But, the funniest surprise is the billing. We had ordered two mocktails- Berry Cucumber and Electric Blue Fizz. When the final bill arrived, we paid 14.5% on AERATED DRINKS and 14.5% on FOOD TAXABLE for only MAIN COURSE and 14.5% on DESSERTS "ON THE SAME BILL"!!!
When I demanded an explanation I was told I am paying for ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES and ADDITIONAL SERVICE TAX was being charged for DESSERTS.
I was told that this was BARCELOS'S RESTAURANT POLICY of LEVYING ADDITIONAL VAT and SERVICE TAX for ALCOHOL and DESSERTS. First of all MOCKTAILS ARE NOT ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES and DESSERTS ARE A PART OF MAIN BILL. I spoke to an expert on taxes who said if a restaurant does not have a LIQUOR LICENSE, THEY CANNOT CHARGE YOU ANY ADDITIONAL TAX. This is UNETHICAL MALPRACTICE. Despite the feeble attempts of the management to reassure me of better standards and service, they made no attempt to take our contact details and feedback to eventually call us for an amendment meal which a MCDONALD or KFC would do.¬†
Like Diwali this is a rocket which has completely resulted in a misdirected accident. PLEASE AVOID TO ENSURE YOUR PEACE OF MIND AND SANITY!

I went to 'barcelos' 4-5 days ago with a huge excitement to have the best grilled chicken in the town but i was really disappointed by the behaviour of your manager Mr Kamal Johal,he was very rude and arrogant.The food was good and the other managers and staffs were very well behaved and informative about the menu.The ambience was great but that thing really broke my heart.He is a wastage for your restaurant,he will not take you to the sky instead he will take you underground.

It looks big from outside but it isn't! Slowly gaining popularity... The fact that it's opened an outlet in Kolkata is much to make us happy!

In my opinion, this place is slightly overrated. It might be that my Indian taste buds aren't sufficiently evolved to fully appreciate this, but I wouldn't say the food was something out of the world! We ordered a meat burger with wedges and a quarter chicken with rice. The sides are more basic than the mains, which are decently flavoured. The sauces are interesting though- mild peri, very peri, supa peri and something else I can't recall, in order of how hot they are. The beverages was really good though! We ordered a brownie shake and a cheesecake shake and both were delicious with real brownie n cheesecake chunks wedged in thick shakes in mason jars! The ambience is classy and uncluttered so that's a plus! Overall I think it's a nice place to try out!

Sitting here right now, really not professional and uncourteous. 15 mins for the canned soft drink to reach the table and cocky reply to "how long will the food take??" - everything here takes a minimum of 15 minutes. 

Best of luck Barcelos you guys won't go a long way if you don't fix yourselves. 
Kamal Johal is not the right man to run this place !! Arrogant uselessly for some crap. The can of ginger ale has fungus on it. Please find the photo.

went with a lot of expectations, but can't say I am entirely satisfied. The biggest letdown was more than generous amount of salt in each dish. We ordered drumsticks, Arabic meze platter, mini burgers and grilled trout. all dishes except the meze platter contained peri peri sauce, but the overpowering salty taste marred the individual tastes. the fish was not as fresh as I expected. Portions are good. we asked to pack some of food which we could not polish off ( which was very shoddily done). the brownie vanilla icecream as dessert was so so. the brownie was too dry and sticky ( fortunately it was not salty) 
Barcelos has to go a long way to compete and make it place in Kolkata.

This is a new offspring to Calcutta's Latin Gastronomic vengeance after Chili's and TGIF. A brand from Portugal with an unique selling point of "Chicken" is awkward and equally interesting considering it is the land of Choriz and Bacalhau!

Ambience- Similar to Chilis in sitting arrangement and table arrangement. Simple and soothing being their moto, the restaurant is attractively luminated and adorned with photographs and scenery. The restaurant however was hotter than the outside arena which was a bit of a let down.
Service- Professional servers with proper gestures and knowledge of service. Extremely cordial and down to earth.
Food- The menu card is a Peri Peri and Jalape√±o ladened reminiscent of Latin flavors. We ordered for the 4 Mini Signature Chicken Burgers which came with black, red and white Patty. Loved all of them, while the final one had a KFC feel to it. The Peri Peri Grilled Chicken Sizzler had generous amount of Mozzarella and was immensely tasty and filling. They have the choice of Mild Peri Peri,Spicy Peri Peri and Tangy Lemon sauce and you can easily grab some from the sauce dispenser on the table.The strips of chicken breast though being a tad bit dry was well drenched in the Mozzarella which was a savior. All over the food was extremely good and not so heavy on pocket!
I think they have lived up to their USP of curating good Chicken dishes and I was extremely pleased. Hoping to visit their again.

So this a  South African food chain. New in town so decided to give it a go. 
The decor and ambience is really please, the staffs are very courteous. No complaints there. 
Coming to the food. We ordered a white burger, chicken wrap and grilled chicken. 
The burger was amazing, it is supposedly the healthiest burger as written in their menu when I asked them, they failed to elaborate. 
Anyway the burger was really good for 200 bucks it's really good. 
The peri peri chicken was good too and I didn't like the wraps. 
They tasted pretty ordinary but surely their burger stands out. 
Worthy enough to visit again? Uh.. Probably yes!

Dropped by for dinner on a weekday, got a table easily as there is ample space. Music was a bit loud so its difficult to converse if people sit across the table, could be a little less loud. Ordered chicken picante with french fries for starter. At first look, it was a roll of chicken and did not look to be value for the money. But it was great to taste, with loads of chicken, flavour and condiments but not worth 395 bucks. Next we ordered 2 mutton and 2 chicken mini burgers with wedges and grilled trout fish with spicy rice. The burgers were very succulent, bun was soft, each burger had a different flavour of the bread hence 2 repeats of same meat worked well.  The fish was cooked well, deboned completely but it smelled a little fishy near the head of the fish. But a lovely treat to eat trout which is uncommon on most restaurants menu in town. Ordered a kiwi cooler(molecular mocktail) and cheesecake shake, well cheesecake shake was heavy and served as our dessert with a slice of strawberry cheesecake thrown around but kiwi cooler was a disappointment as there was no molecular angle to drink though it was a refreshing drink in all, with jaljeera, kiwi etc. The 4 peri sauces on the table were fabulous, the veri peri suited my tongue the best and used generously with fries, burger and wedges. The staff many a times seemed a little lost of things, did not notice lack of tissue paper on table as well as left over side plate on the table. Table cutlery was not adequate and it seemed it had not been cleaned too properly before previous customer. Might go again just to try the interesting menu.

South African based restaurant Barcelos opened it's first outlet in posh Khan Market area in Delhi year back.
I was quite excited when I heard that Kolkata is going to be their second outlet in India.

More than 120 outlets in 17 countries which is very renowned and established food chain brand all over the world. Bercelos started off in 1993 in Pertoria.

Finally I scratch it off from my wishlist and checked in to the first outlet of Barcelos at Acropolis Mall.

The interior is done really well,seating is comfortable and gives you the casual dining experience. The world map on the wall with light effect is eye catching.. even the imported different flavored sauce from South Africa is something new to try.

Service is fast but servers are not professional, when I enquired about the dishes they were confused and called up somebody else.

Their food mainly concentrate on authentic Portuguese flavours.
So after all the buzz about their colorful Burger I finally ordered out their famous colorful mini burgers ( Red/White/Black/Brown )
Red Burger - The best tasted Burger out of four buns.The bun was sweet and complimenting the Lamb filling. They even gave a paper how the bun is made and this red bun is made with tomato puree and spices.
Black Burger- The second best out of four buns..the black bun has a spicy taste which is made by spinach and other spices and I found it very delicious with the Lamb filling.

White and brown Burger - I personally didn't find it lips smacking and even the chicken fillings tastes average.

Grilled Trout Fish - The perfect blend of peri peri sauce with the fresh trout fish..just melts in your mouth.

Chocolate Brownie with ice cream - The desert was pretty average nothing extraordinary but as I'm a ice cream lover everything goes well with ice cream and chocolate.

Barcelos is planning to set more than 20 outlets in the metropolitan cities in India in coming five years.That means more portuguese food we'll get to try.
This outlet surely have potential to stand up to the competition but need to upgrade their staff better.

Barcelos is an international chain which now opened their doors to Indian market.
Luckily the First Outlet of Barcelos in Kolkata is just 5 minutes from my home in Acropolis Mall.
It was in my wishlist since last month but finally I gotta visit it in the yesterday evening !!!
It's basically a South African Restaurant serving Portugese cuisine. They are having their House speciality of the 4 Peri Peri flavored sauces they serve namely, Mild Peri, Veri Peri, Lemon Tangy Peri & Supa Peri. Of the above acc. to me Veri Peri is the most mouth watering one,still you guys are having the right to choose your own taste !

We ordered the MINI BURGERS PLATTER of 2 Chicken & 2 Mutton & obvio their speciality 1/2 Peri Peri Chicken.

The mini burger platter is a perfect option for those who want to try all the four burgers at once in smaller portions. These look small but actually are very filling. They serve you with multi colored burger buns and each tastes completely different from the other. The brown burger was the usual burger bun with mayo, tomatoes, lettuce & a regular chicken patty. The red burger bun made with the Beet Root extract was the next one. It had a very interesting tangy sauce in it but the mutton patty though really moist and succulent was a bit smelly . So, highly recommending the chicken patties if it comes to the burger zone! The white burger bun made with the coconut extract was extremely mouth watering with the moist chicken patty & the twist of a pineapple slice in it , made it all the more tasty and tangy . The Best Burger Bun out of the four is the black burger made with the cocoa extract. Though the bun was excellent above all the formers but the smelly mutton patty destroyed the whole flavor of the bun, thus chicken goes the best when it comes to Barcelos Burgers. You can obvio pick from their four Peri peri sauces as per the heat and flavor you want in your burgers. I liked my burgers to be spicy but went with the very peri because the supa peri had a very strong flavor to it which I didn't like much !

Along with the mini burgers platter they give you an option of selecting 2 complementary items outta 8 . Here, we opted for the Spiced Rice which was all total a blunder ( Never ever go for such rice with these kind of portugese cuisines) & Wedges with mayo dip was a perfect complement.

The 1/2 Peri peri chicken was basically the grilled chicken flamed in your choice of sauce, again will recommend you to go for the Veri Peri sauce! They serve it in two pieces, hot , tender & juicy which provides an extreme level of pleasure to your taste !

The staffs were courteous enough to welcome and serve you with a smiling face ! They even replaced our spiced rice with mashed potatoes as we complained for its taste & even gave us a complementary drink of fresh lime soda sweet .

Potugese wooden decor & lights with perfect music, generous behaviour of the staffs and Yummy delicacies make this place a Must Visit for you guys ! Hurry Up ...

This being the first visit to barcelos, i was a bit hesitant whether it would keep up to its name of being one of the worlds best chicken outlets, however soon after i stepped in ,the smile on the service guy's face and the greeting paved way for what would be a memorable experience.

Well, coming to the ambience, the restaurant has a portuguese feel to it with wooden decor, however the music being played did not complement it. House music did pep up the mood though.

Coming to the food, we ordered a set of 4 mini burgers,( 2 chicken and 2 mutton) and we preffered the chicken ones somehow. The white burger with its pineapple stuffing was definitely an awesome surprise. However the red and the black hogwarts spl burger were a close competitor. But i definitely will recommend chicken over mutton anytime!!Thr burgers came with 2 siders.

Coming to the siders, we ordered one wedge with a mayo dip which was nice and the rice which did not go wih the cuisine and our choice of dishes.

@The star of the show was definitely the chicken, half chicken, succulent pieces coated with veri peri sauce, recommend this highly for spicy food lovers. Yes now i know why barcelos is famous.

The icing on the cake was definitely the service, aakash being the person concerned, an absolute gentleman with a bright smile. We even got a complementary sweet lime soda on the house...Yaay!!

The only con apart from music was that the outlet does not have any hard drinks option. Beer would have been a great companion.

Looking forward to more visits and great experiences...Cheers!!

I had first had a taste of their Peri Peri Chicken at Barcelos, Khan Market, New Delhi. The heat, the perfectly grilled chicken served with a generous portion of potato wedges sprinkled with peri-peri powder had made me happy, and when I heard that Barcelos was opening up at Acropolis, I jumped at the chance to meet a few friends on the very first day of its opening. However, as luck would have it, I was late for an appointment, and ended up rushing out, so well, I had to leave with grief in my heart, and a mostly empty stomach. So when I went back a second time, I was determined to sample quite a few things from the menu. For those who are unaware, Barcelos is a South Africa-based chain which is known for its Peri-Peri Chicken.¬†Read more on the blog.

Barcelos...  4* but ..... 

Ok... peri peri .. very peri... mild peri .. its peri peri everywhere ... sometimes its just too much peri peri for me.. 

Food Ordered 

 Chicken Espeteda : Was served first and was just awesome 5* 

 Mini Burgers : 2 mutton + 2 Chicken  : Mutton ones were too good .. chicken was average...'  Burger You '  your grilled chicken burger was better .. But please dont use the peri peri sauce ... 

Half Grilled Chicken : Verry good but will rate 3.5 * , would have rated 5* if it was served first ... 
Nothing wrong with the dish ... quantity was good .. chicken nice and moist .. its just that the peri peri sauce... its the same sause used as with the espeteda .. so overall its of same palate.. 

Baby Meal : Grilled chicken thighs  with fries and juice ..  Tested it ... the peri peri taste was omnipresent (though a very mild one ). 

Pocket Pinch : Its at per with chillis and other international joints ... about Rs. 600 per person without drinks ... so not cheep for sure..

Now to conclude my review its my personal  advice not to order two dishes with peri peri base (any variety of it ) then you might not taste the difference .. and if possible order a drink... it will refresh you between each dish ... 

Service was very good and as expected from a international brand ...

Happy Fooding :)

It is nice to see that the city of joy is opening its gateway to a lot of international restaurants brands to open up and cater to the need of the consumers. And one such addition to the city is "Barcelos", a South Africa based restaurant chain.
Located inside 'Acropolis Mall' at Kasba, the place bears an ambience full of lively charm and energy vibes, that generates an impulse to indulge in. The interior decor reflects a fine taste of aesthetics and add up to the ambience even more.
Regarding the service, the staffs are polite, courteous and well behaved. Specially, Miss Bhavika, deserves a special mention for her good sense of hospitality.
However, apart from some rooster delights, a few of the drinks, and their house special Peri Peri sauces, there are several scopes of improvement I must say. In fact, the visually appealing multicolored burgers, which happens to be a buzzword of their in house delicacy, turned out to be overhyped and failed to meet the expectations, so far the taste is concerned.
Being the flagship branch in a city, I think it is high time they need to buckle up and take serious note of their shortcomings, to improve them accordingly.
The 3.5 rating is only for the service, ambience and some of the food items which tasted good genuinely.

Full marks for interior decor. Great place for a quiet sit-down. As for the main course, the choice is between burgers, wraps, steaks, salads and grilled chicken, all of which qualify as being among the best in the city. The grilled trout comes with a big reputation as well, and must be tried on the occasion of a revisit. The real showstealer however is the kabab platter that preceded the main course. With a variety of peri sauces to go with, there's no way one can go wrong with this.

Really enjoyed my first time at the Barcelos restaurant. The non-veg kebab platter was really delicious and included a terrific assortment of fish and chicken kebabs. For the main course, I opted for Chicken steak with spicy rice and mashed potatoes. The chicken was surprisingly juicy and the rice had a distinct flavor to it. The icing on the cake turned out to be the chocolate truffle which I ordered for dessert. Overall, a worthwhile experience and looking forward to visiting Barcelos again.

Another international food joint opened in Kolkata and for once, it was all about the way the meat was cooked.

Barcelos speaks about the Portuguese way of grilling meat and you get a feel of it right when you enter the amazing restaurant.

There are a ton of choices to indulge your need to have kebabs or burgers or even grilled chicken, it's all there.

The non veg kebab platter was simply incredible and the best thing from there menu were the excellent burgers.
I tried the black burger and it was incredible, the next one in my trial list has to be the red fiery burger.

The chocolate truffle at the end was just the perfect way to end the night. Certainly a place to visit again.

Even a few years back eating out in Kolkata meant hitting the age old joints located in park street, ordering from the same old menu & reluctantly taking a yellow ambassador to return home (20 rs extra if you stayed beyond tollygunge, god save your home was in garia). It was a nightmare if you hit tangra, or park circus for some Chinese or biryani. The city has surely come a long way from that (though you still have to pay 20 rs extra to the regular taxi if it's after 8 in the evening, irrespective of where you stay). Lots of national & international chains have set shop here. Not only MacDonald or KFC, brands from various corners of the world are opening up their stand alone restaurants here. One of the latest addition to the list is Barcelos. A South Africa based chain known for its Portuguese recipes & innovative burgers hit the food lovers in India with its first outlet in Delhi. Kolkata is the second city in the country to welcome Barcelos with open arms.
The chain derives its name from a folk legend of 'barcelos rooster', which originated in a Portuguese town of , no point for guessing, Barcelos. The same rooster can be found in the logo of the restaurant, in fact known as the 'Galo De Barcelos' this is one of the most common symbol of Portugal.
Coming to Barcelos, Kolkata, I was undoubtedly excited when they invited our group PanchPhoron for a food tasting session. However their recent event where they hosted some of the well known bloggers of the city had been a mess, & I was quite sceptical so as to what was awaiting us. Nonetheless it was an opportunity that shouldn't be let down, & we hit the joint with a mixed expectation.
Located in the top floor of Acropolis Mall, Kasba, it's easy to locate. As you approach the outlet, you'll find an outdoor seating arrangement outside the outlet itself, pretty uncommon. However we opted to sit inside, which to say the truth is quite huge going by Acropolis Mall standard. Wood-finished wall & floor, warm lights, colourful sofas all add to the perfection of the arrangement. The best thing to look at in my opinion was the illuminated world map on the wall with barcelos restaurant locations marked on it. Great backdrop for those gorgeous selfies for sure. There's even a bright red smoking booth fashioned after old British phonebooths inside if you feel the need for it. There's also the bar counter, to the left, which for now serves only non alcoholic drinks & molecular gastronomic cocktails.
We opted to seat at the tables on the farthest right, overlooking the geetanjali stadium. In my opinion if any good match is held there in the future, Barcelos would be the perfect place to enjoy it from.
Coming to the food, we were served a variety of molecular mocktails & some of their signature dishes. Molecular Gastronomy is a fancy name given to items where dry ice or liquid nitrogen is added for a novel presentation. In theory its actually about applying molecular concepts of quick freezing/heating of certain elements to cook any dish, which I don't think any of the eateries employ. Any way it's their call to call any dish whatever they want.
We tried the following items, a brief review of which is given below:

Drinks:

Berry Cucumber:
The first molecular drink to hit the tables was this drink prepared with cucumber juice, strawberry syrup, topped with a mix of orange juice & sprite, presented in a margarita glass & garnished with a slice of cucumber to the side. On top of it liquid nitrogen was poured which gave it a chilling temperature & a fuming look. Quite pretty to look at, & refreshing to drink.

Peachy Iced tea:
Freshly prepared iced tea mixed with pureed peach fruit served in a tall glass & garnished with cubes of peach. Not just Iced tea lovers, this can be the favourite among regular mocktail lovers too.

Tangy Mango:
Next item to come to the table was this amazing drink, again served in a tall glass. A perfect blend of ripe mangoes & select spices, topped up with sprite & ice cubes on the top, garnished with a slice of mango on the side. The addition of liquid nitrogen had in fact fused the ice cubes, thankfully the straw helped in getting the tangy mix from below the layer of ice. Another great drink.

Hey Rosey:
Next up was this frozen margarita, rose syrup mixed with cardamom & rose water, topped with sprite & garnished with crushed rose petal. Cool, sweet but extremely Rosey. A word of advice, wait for a few minutes, mix the crushed ice lightly with the syrup at the bottom, then drink it. That way it was a bit better for me.

Indian Classic Kala Khatta:
The last drink to arrive was this mix of pomegranate syrup, lemon juice & spices, topped up with coke. The classic kala Khatta flavour is retained well, the fuming nitrogen adding more to the charm & to the cold.

Food:
After all the amazing molecular mixes it was time for the foods that Barcelos had to offer.

Peri Peri Paneer:
A variation of paneer Kebab, two cubes of cottage cheese in each toothpick along with onion, yellow, green & red capsicum slices, lightly marinated in Peri peri sauce & served with a dip. The paneer felt a bit too salty, except which it was quite tasty.

Grilled Orange with Watermelon Salad:
Lightly grilled orange slices along with cubes of watermelon, served on a bed of lettuce & dressed with basil, honey sauce, this was a bit surprising fruit salad to find in their menu. However it's not as special as it appeared to be. May be I was looking for some more lemony flavour, while the whole dish seemed quite bland to me.

Arabic Mezze Platter:
Next dish to arrive was this cane basket containing small bowls of hummus, yogurt, peri hummus, baba ganoush & tabouli along with falafel & pita slices. Generally served to accompany alcoholic drinks or as an appetizer before the main course as it was in our case. The selection of dips were fine to have with the slices of pita, but the falafel itself was a bit too hard & dry for me. A little softer/spongier inside would have been great.

Chicken Espatada:
A typical Portuguese dish, this was chunks of boneless chicken breast (in place of usual beef), rubbed in garlic & salt, skewered in a long iron stick along with bell pepper & onions & cooked. The dish was even served on the skewer, which was hanging from a hook on a stand & some fries to go with it. Although the thing looked quite interesting, with a thick gravy coating all the pieces of chickens, taste wise it again seemed a bit too salty to me. Must be due to the marination process which is done a day in advance. In any case served hot & dipped in the Peri Peri sauce of your choice, it's a good dish of choice as a starter.

Mini Burgers:
Next up was this signature burger dish of Barcelos. This is the same dish you have been seeing pictures of in Instagram & Facebook. It consists of four chicken burgers, each having distinct taste & of course colours, stuffed generously with grilled chicken on peri peri sauce along with lettuce, tomato, peri mayo, pickled cucumber & jalapenos, served with perfectly cooked potato wedges as sides. The colour of the burgers are totally organic, the red one having the colour from tomato & chili powder while the black one having it from cocoa powder. The taste of these colours weren't overwhelming, and the burgers itself were quite tasty to have.

Peri Peri Grilled Chicken:
Well grilled chicken pieces marinated in their signature peri peri sauce & served with fries.However to add more to the taste it's advice able to have this one along with some more peri peri sauce , bottles of which are present on the table. The pieces of chicken were juicy & tasty, I stuck to the mild peri sauce, fearing the others will be to hot for me.

Desserts:
No meal is ever complete without some sweet desserts.So after the mains it was time for the desserts.

Chocolate fondant with ice cream:
Of course this one needs no introduction, the warm gooey chocolate sauce coming out from inside the small chocolate cake as you bite into it is popularly known as choco lava cake, makes an awesome combo with the scoop of vanilla ice cream which is served alongside

Choco Truffle Cake:
A slice of chocolate cake with alternating layers of milk chocolate & dark chocolate sauce underneath the gooey chocolate sauce on the top. Another great dessert.

Tiramisu:
A popular Italian dessert, made of ladyfinger biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with whipped egg mix, sugar cheese & flavoured with cocoa. The flavour of the coffee gave this one a great kick.

Baked Blueberry Cheesecake:
Lovely blueberry flavoured cheesecake topped with blueberry compote. The sweet & tangy blueberry tasted great, however the cheesecake tasted not that good. Maybe that was because I already had so many good desserts beforehand.

Overall it was a good experience. The molecular drinks, the tasty mains & sweet desserts all complemented each other. The burgers or 'worlds healthiest burgers' as they call it though looked great seemed a bit over hyped as per taste. The paneer & the Espatada could do with a little less salt, while the fruit salad could surely do with some extra tang. Hopefully they will be able to continue the taste & fame they bring with the name. Will surely visit again to try out their other delicacies.Until then,
Happy Eating,
Cheers!

The chicken was different from the regular fare we get here.Though not exactly like Nandoz but nevertheless it was good. The chicken was quiet well done.The flesh cane off the bones without much effort. 
The molecular dring Tangy Mango is a must try.
The staff is courteous & helpful.

Located beside Asia Kitchen on the top floor of Acropolis mall, Bercelos is a nice place to spend some time at if one is a lover of non vegetarian food. The external seats seem but dull but interiors are nicely decorated. We waited to be sat inside as we wanted to experience the ambience.
The menu resembles options at Nandos..lesser variety though. Having started recently they seem to be not fully ready for the crowds though.The people at the front desk struggle a bit to understand preferences and some of the menu cards have pages repeated.Thankfully we met a friend there and got to know that sizzlers there are nice so asked for a different menu that showed sizzlers and others that were missed out on the earlier.
We ordered Kala khatta and a bottomless Coke (cool as it comes at 90 Rs) and 2 chicken and 2 mutton mini burgers with wedges and dip as starter.After repeating our preferred bread it took 2 reminders to get what we had asked for.First time they gave the regular breads which had to be sent back.Then the wedges were forgotten and when asked for..the dip was left out!It arrived with the main course!Any way the burgers were decent.The red bun tasted best...the black one had an earthy taste that was not much to our liking.While I liked the mutton my spouse liked the chicken more.
For mains we ordered half chicken in a tangy lemon dressing and peri peri sizller with a veri peri dressing(the 2nd level of heat amongst 3 options).
Sizzler was so so..but had too much of zuccini and carrots.I liked the chicken and could not finish all and had to carry half of the portion home.
Overall a decent experience but they desperately need to improve their service.

Whoever has eaten at Nando's (in or out of India) and likes their grilled chicken - well, Barcelos is the place to be. The menu has quite a few choice of starters like kebabs, humus dips, but the star item is the flame grilled chicken with your choice of spicy sauce and sides.

Highs - The mashed potato side was buttery smooth and the drinks were refreshing. The decor and ambience were nice and chilled out. 

On the lows - The food was cold, and grilled chicken isn't good enough unless its piping hot. I guess they didn't grill it fresh and just reheated and served it, which isn't expected for that money and that wait. Also though the chicken was well coated in sauce - it wasn't seasoned well enough. They just need to turn up the volume on flavour and seasoning!!

P. S. try the Peachy Ice Tea for a little theatre and drama üòâ

Good menu, but the good things end 
We ordered a kabab platter but the kababs were cold. 

The ordered a rice dish with saut√©ed veggies which was very average. 

Bar has not started. But I guess with time they will improve on their quality.

Looking to visit again after sometime

Okay, this one isn't¬†a good experience at all.
FOOD: 2/5
To begin with, none of the sidelines were available!¬†No fries with burgers...imagine!¬†For mains we ordered 1/2 Chicken which was good, but again very dry.Thanks to the choice of sauces which made it edible for me. ¬†For starters we ordered 4 Chicken mini sliders. Honestly, the black and red breads¬†did not please our taste at all.Although the Black Burger is recommended, and we ordered based on reviews, but it failed my expectations.All the sliders had dry patty.For beverage - Kiwi kooler was good, but on the tangier side and Oreo shake.We had also, ordered a Peri Peri Black Magic, but cancelled since our experience with the sliders were not too great!
Honestly, everything seemed so off that we had to land up to the food court at the mall to fill our tummy!
SERVICE: 3/5
Service is good, but staff needs a little more training. Our tables hardly had cutlery and tissues. Had to keep asking for the same. The manager came in to check on us¬†when we told him about our experience. Also, just remembered the choice of crockery is bad (read uncomfortable).
AMBIENCE and DECOR: 4/5
Ambience is nice and quirky. If you are a smoker you will like the Smoking Booth beautifully done.The bar is really nicely done with high stools. We had taken a window seat, so the view of area was nice.
Seems to me like a one time visit, since it opened newly in Kolkata.Maybe when they start their drinks would visit them again.

Food ordered:
1) 4 Mini Burgers (Chicken)
2) Peachy Iced Tea
3) Hey Rosey
The presentation of the food was good. 
Along with the Burgers we ordered two sides: potato wedges with dip and coleslaw. The wedges tasted heavenly and the dip was well prepared. The Burgers were nicely done. Except I did not like the sauce inside the red Burger and the white Burger tasted a bit weird. The four sauces on the desk were awesome. 
Peachy Iced Tea was nice. The colour was perfect and tasted good too.
The best part was the 'Hey Rosey'. It was heavenly. The blend, the texture, the taste everything was so perfect. A must try. 
The staff were courteous. Service was prompt.

Barcelos happened very suddenly. I wasnt expecting to see an outlet here in kolkata. It was my brother who pointed out and we were immediately drawn towards it. When it comes to peri peri i only know one place and thats nandos. But this portugese restraunt is no less. The staffs are super friendly, well informed and active. 

The ambiance is good. Not a big fat space but very beautifully done & attractive. We went at around 8pm and by 9 the place was flooding in. The new hot spot for foodies. FYI no alcohol is available. 

Now coming to food: we ordered the brownie milkshake which was good but way to thick and heavy. If i had to gulp down the whole alone i wouldn't be able  to eat  so choose wisely guys while ordering for a drink or two.
Next we ordered their signature dish in 1/4 chicken , mild peri peri sauce with potato wedges and a cheese dip. I have to say it was amazingly done. The chicken , the sauce was so well blended that you just cannot find any fault. A must try i must say. Next was their mini burgers 2 chicken 2 mutton with mashed potatoes. Now let me tell you they serve burgers in four colours and each burger bun has a different taste. The red bun is sweet and the colour comes from beet root, the black is cocoa and little bitter in taste, the white is made of coconut and the brown is a normal bun. From the four the red and white tastes the best but however their mutton and chicken patty failed to impress me. The mutton had a very muttony smell which is found usually when mutton is not well done or marinated but am sure the smell does not bother people who are hard core mutton lovers. The chicken patty was hard and not juicy at all which made the whole eating process little tuff as the buns were soft but one has to hold tight and bite hard to chew off the burger. So yes i did not find it appealing at all. I tasted all of their peri sauces and i still feel nandos is the best. 

Price was ok considering the fact that its located in acropolis.

To rescue our taste bud, came their Peri Peri Chicken, their most signature dish, the flame grilled chicken with Peri peri sauce off coarse was just the opposite in taste. The chicken was quite juicy and moist and perfectly grilled. I drizzled their Tangy lemon sauce(served at the table) on grilled chicken and it remarkably changed the taste and I enjoyed every bite of it. Its highly recommended for the first time go-ers who love chicken. As this joint is famous for its grilled chicken, the signature dish of 1/4 chicken, 1/2 chicken, full chicken, chicken steak are a must try. These can be selected with one or two side dishes which include spicy rice, mashed potatoes, green salad etc.

hospitality of all the staff members are very nice and we meet to the host ,she is a girl name Sampita Das.
She help me out about the accommodation at the restaurant she is a very nice girl ¬†and then a girl took our order she have a very good communication skills .... and at last we enjoy a lot.......

Plus Points about Barcelos:

1. An awesome array of dishes

2. Both Vegetarian and non-vegetarians options are present

3. Kid's Menu available

4. Awesome ambiance, perfect for a relaxed family day-out/friend's hangout

5. Great service and quite pocket-friendly
Mine one and only recommendation to Barcelos is to add some Portuguese desserts in the menu, because first of all Kolkatans are famous for their sweet tooth and second of all, as much I know Portuguese have sweet  tooth too and are very famous for their Egg Custard and Arroz Doce or rice pudding and for some pastry shops.

This is the 3rd Barcelos outlet among India after New Delhi. 
Barcelos is named after Portugal city and they are very famous in Rooster items, so I finally visited and tried.

‚óèLocation‚óè
Top Floor of the Acropolis Mall beside Asia Kitchen. 

‚óèAmbiance and Deco‚óè
Walls are decorated with oil paintings and lighting was quite exquisite. 
Ambiance was very good also.

‚óèDrinks‚óè
Ferrero Rocher Shake- Very nice with a topping of Ferrero Rocher choclate. 

Kiwi Cooler- Its a molecular drink made of kiwi syrup and ice with a topping of kiwi fruit. Taste was spicy and energetic. 

‚óèStarters‚óè
While I waited for main course to come I ordered Mutton Kebab. Which was quite different from other restaurants. Minced mutton was cooked properly, very juicy and soft.

‚óèMain course‚óè
In main course I tried 1/2 grilled chicken.
Grilled chicken has skin which am not fond of so beware. If you don't eat skin of chicken then try not to order grilled chicken. Taste was very good. Tried with tangy lemon and mild peri sauce.

Black beauty and Bloody Red Burger: Its was chicken burger and with colourful bun. Those burgers were there speciality. It was a let down for me. Very average taste.. 

‚óèService‚óè
My server was Upasana who did a great job. She is very humble and efficient. 
All food was served within 13 mins of ordering. Which I didn't expected after seeing horrible reviews regarding slow service.

‚óèVerdict‚óè
Barcelos opened couple of weeks ago so they are improving day by day. Don't go for there ratings just try them. 
Kudos to Team Barcelos for bringing the chain in City of Joy.

Well this is the first time I tried out South African cuisine. And I would say that I loved it. I loved the way the espetadas were served and presented. They tasted delicious. We had peach ice tea , kiwi fruit drink, virgin mojito and bottomless Coke. We had their pita bread with hummus and I must say its the freshest pita bread I've ever had. It was warm and grilled just like bread should be. The hummus was green because of cilantro with a few chickpeas and olive oil. It was out of this world. For the mains my friends ordered the half roast chicken , chicken steak and their famous burgers. The chicken roast and steak were good and were both served with this spicy and creamy sauce that went really well with it. My friend had a vegetarian red burger which was good , it had a nice and thick potato patty with veggies in it. Another friend ordered the two chicken two mutton burger and he said that the mutton ones were better. What I had was the three chicken mini burgers. They were white , red and black. The red colour of the bread comes from beetroot and the black comes from ground coffee. The Bread was really soft and airy. The red burger had two normal cooked chicken slices with tomatoes , lettuce , mayonnaise. The chicken was juicy and a bit tangy. The black burger was spicy with a different seasoning. The White burger was different too and had a slice of orange in it ! Now normally I don't like sweet and savoury together , but this was exceptional. It had this sweetness in it and at the same time the salty and spicy chicken was there to complement it. Each main dish was served with potato wedges which were really crispy on the outside and soft and mushy inside , just how they're supposed to be. On the table were kept four types of dressings mainly piri piri and lemon. The espetadas were served with a salad with barbeque dressing which I absolutely loved. I would love to come back here again and highly recommend it to people who love meat , mayo and burgers !

I don't know why I never heard of Marcelos in Acropolis Mall in discussions that included Chilli's or Hopipola. I'll open with how I felt about this place, and I'll give it to you straight - it's one of the best I have tried recently. The restaurant specialises in chicken items, but I could see mutton and veg preparations on the menu, which seemed tempting. Nevertheless, i tried chicken dishes only. Their special chicken platter for 4 was sumptuous, and left us completely full,not mention that it was absolutely delish! The smoky flavour from the char-grilled skin was absolutely heavenly. I tried their molecular mocktail - my first molecular delight - and it left me excited and satisfied! The dry ice gave the drink a touch of magic, with foams flowing out of the glass, and bubbles forming in the glass from the bottom for as long as the drink lasted. I felt like a child, amazed by the show. The servers were polite, and interacted with a smile every time. The service was really fast. The decor was amazing, and the ambience was great. I'm planning on returning soon!

Ever since I saw the banner at Acropolis mall nearly a month back I was eagerly waiting for Barcelos to open. Off course a good news that after New Delhi, their 2nd outlet opened here in Kolkata.



Its inside the Acropolis Mall, Kasba. Its a 5minutes drive from Ruby General Hospital towards Gariahat, on the top floor. Its a nicely decorated resturant. We were invited there as part of Calcutta Instagrammers team by Barcelos.We got our table and were attended to impromptu. The staff were very friendly and really courteous.

Overall Experience:

We were served few molecular drinks. Tasted¬† the rosy flavor "Hey Rosey" at first. Personally I don't like much sweet drinks, and it was basically rose syrup with spices & rose water. Also tried "Tangy Mango Drink" which was spicy and tangy, personally I loved it. These molecular beverage drinks looked quite spectacular with the liquid nitrogen coming out from the glass. A photography session soon began.

In the table there were 4 sauce bottles. 3 types of Peri Peri (imported from south Africa as we were informed)- Mild Peri, Supa Peri and Veri Peri and one Tangy Lemon Sauce. 

The menu was a surprise for me as menu was not present in our table. The starter was Chicken Espetada. It was chicken kebab hanging with green peeper and onion and was served with finger chips and dip. Along with it, came a one veg ‚ÄúArabic Mezze Platter‚Äù consisting of Hummus, baba ganause, Peri Hummus , Yogurt Dip, Tabouli, Falafel, Lavash with 3 Pitas. It was delicious.


Then came our main course. We were served "Grilled Trout Fish" with yoghurt dip and french fries. The fish properly done and was extremely fresh.

Then they served their signature item. The mini burger combo(2 veg and 2 non-veg combo). They were colorful. I‚Äôve never had black, pink or white burgers. But tastes of these were surprisingly similar. But, this dish was really good and I will recommend.

Then another signature dish "1/2 Chicken" was served to us. It tasted really great. The chicken was juicy and when when we experimented tasting it with Hot peri peri sauce it was absolutely amazing.

Then we waited for the desert, but as it was not served after sometime we left. 

Barcelos is definately Recommended for kolkattans.

‚ÄúThe Idealisation of the¬†Barcelos¬†rooster derived from a legend concerning a galego who was sentenced to hang despite his protests of innocence. In a last minute appeal to the judge, who was having dinner at that time, the condemned man made a bold statement :. If his claim of innocence was true, the roasted rooster resting on the judges plate would get up and crow. Suddenly, a glorious scarlet-plumed cockerel rose from the plate crowing loud and long. The man was obviously acquitted.‚Äù

Situated at acropolis mall, kasba; this place is brilliant decor wise. Food quality is awesome. Milk shakes are tasty and serves in mason jars. We had kebabs which was quite good and so were the burgers. Black and Red burgers are unique here. Must try: any molecular drink. Not at all pocket friendly, then again good things come at a price . üòâ

I was very excited when i first heard that Barcelos has opened in Kolkata at Acropolis Mall, Kasba. If you wanna beat this hot summer and add a refreshing taste to your buds, the drinks like hey rosey, tangy mango are a must try.Among the food, you could try the chicken sizzlers, burgers with peri peri sauce.The desserts are the best according to me.Chocolate Fudge Cake with hot brownie and ice cream is a must try.Good food, Good music and a great decor. Barcelos is a place everyone should visit.

They specialise in chicken and peri peri... and no doubt they are excellent in these departments.. i would have given a 5 out of 5 if only these two things i had experienced. But their service was horrible. They were adequately staffed but all waiters were serving all the tables... so there was utter confusion amongst themselves. They offer unlimited soft drinks for a certain price.. 4 of us opted for that but everytime we asked to refill the glasses.. they took away the four glasses and returned with three of them.. You place some order and they bring something different... and one last suggestion... dont try their desserts.. the description and photos in the menu card will allure you to take one but they are just horrible.. there are so many dessert options in acropolis mall and you can go for them instead.. but thumbs up for the chicken and peri peri..

Juicy chicken, moist fish, buttery paneer. The cook on everything is spot on. 
What's better is you get to choose your level of spicy from tangy lemon to mild peri to very peri to fiery peri.. Fear not, if you chose a flavour too spicy, u have the option of changing the palate coz all the 4 sauces are there on your plate.
I disagree with the rating of 3.8 completely coz this place delivers as per itz promise: perfectly cooked chicken!

A newly opened restaurant at Kasba, 
Highly keen on trying Barcelos, I finally did but however it wasn't that impressive. 
I'm going to skip right to the pros and cons. 

Pros
1)The items on the menu are fairly priced and provide one with a wide option to choose from. 

2) Their milkshakes are worth every penny and goes well with the food. 

3) The Staff are friendly 

Cons 

1) The food over there isn't very great they try to add too much sauce and over do their chicken dishes hence making it rubbery 

2) The music is very loud and jarring .

Nothing exceptional. Over priced food. Too loud and irrelevant music. Staff intrusive. Food takes time. The overall experience stands at a moderate one. Being in the mall, gives it an advantage, but quality is so so. I ordered for a 1/4th chicken grill with rice by side. Nothing to die for. Decor is good.  One time go.

Nice modern decor, and unorthodox kind of food,(Portuguese) makes Barcelos, a special one. Their chicken wings with the beri beri sauce, and their mocktail, hey rosy is highly recommendable, so any one who is bored of that same kind of food North Indian and Chinese should check this one, you won't be disappointed. Still there is no bar, but I guess it will open shortly. 
P. S- Try not to wear red polo tees, as you may be mistaken for a stuff.

Barcelos in Acropolis mall has a good ambience. The mock tails are good; you have the option to have molecular mock tails where they would pour liquid nitrogen on the drink.

Food tastes okay, nothing exceptional though!

Was super excited to visit this oh-so-talked about restaurant chain, but I must say didn't leave a great after taste. 

The ambience is amazing. Loved the cozy decor. The waiter need to be a little more attentive and most importantly they need to know what they are serving their customers. 

The much sought after Peri Peri Black Magic is an Epic Fail for newcomers. The bread was stale and fell apart the moment you held it. They changed the burger to a white bread however, the taste wasn't that exciting. With Chillis right next to them, they need to up their burger game. 

The garlic fish with rice was super bland and the sauted vegetable were no less appetising. So nuh-uh. Not happening for me. 

The Cheesy Chicken Espetada was the ONLY and an absolute winner.  I shall go back to this place only for this number. Also, the much awaited firs Sangria Bar in Calcutta! 

All in all - they need to work on it so much more. It will be a shame if a brand like this does not survive for its quality.

I have more negative points to share than the positive ones. I am utterly disappointed with the service-be it providing plate,cutlery or refilling water or providing a prompt response to people when they literally have to shout out to catch their attention. And to top it all at the end of our dinner suddenly somebody dropped by a bag a of leftover at our table-only to realise that it was meant for some other table. When asked to recommend the dishes-the lady seemed lost and just asked us to make up our minds-waiters should be well versed about the menu they serve-everyone of them seemed so lost and confused! Very very peri ..oops..poor service is what I can associate with this place now.
Coming to the food only boneless thighs were worth a mention-fantastic 4 burgers were good,grilled trout,grilled fish were not significant enough. The peri peri sizzler however tasted pretty good.

Can't give a better rating right now-coz I feel they need to notch up their skills a hell lot to stay put in this competition coz people of Kolkata already have access to way better food joints!

We ordered for chicken livers with garlic roll, and unfortunately came to know that garlic roll is not available. So, instead of garlic roll landed up with chicken liver with handmade soft buns, the red ones, which they serve with burgers. As for the drinks, we went with herb hint and grape fruit punch, ideal we thought for the chicken Barcelona signature dishes with mild peri peri sauce. Fortunately, it was not disappointing at all, I loved the drinks which gelled well with the signature Barcelona dish. However, chicken liver was somewhat of a disappointment. So a -1 there. Otherwise, worth a try. The ambience is perfect for romantic dinner or a getaway with your friends. Service is really nice as they kept on asking about the food. So we were quite comfortable.

I was recently invited by Barcelos for a tasting session. Being a vegetarian stepping into a restaurant known for its non vegetarian food makes me a little apprehensive about what I might get. But I was willing to give it a go at least. Since we had been invited for the tasting session there was a preset menu available for us and were asked to choose our drinks. I picked the Hey Rosey as the combination of rose and cardamom flavors sounded very interesting to me especially since I love that spice. But I will say that it was not to my liking as I could not taste the cardamom plus the combination of the rose syrup and sprite made it too sweet. It was quite pretty to look at it but thats about it.¬†

Next came a platter of panner skewers which I liked quite a lot. The paneer was flavorful and well grilled giving it a bit of a crisp. I love smokey flavored food and very few places get it right. But Barcelos made me very happy on that front. Next came the Veg ¬†Espetada which was just so interesting! Veg versions were served with fries while the non veg had wedges. There were these thick chunky pieces along with the paneer which I thought was potato but turned out it was pineapple! Tangy, spicy and smokey pineapple! So so good. This dish was my absolute favorite. ¬†

Next came the Mediterranean platter which had a lovely assortment of dips and pita bread. I had to stop myself from polishing it off as there were still more items on the tasting menu. The Veg Trinchado with rice was ok. Though I did like the saucy panner gravy but it became a bit bland when I had it with the rice. We finished our meal with a rich truffle slice.¬†

I ¬†was extremely happy with my meal especially all the smokey food I got to eat. Me and my friends are already making plans of going there quite soon as we want to try out the burgers. I read a lot of bad reviews for the place so was not expecting anything but I was pleasantly surprised. Do check it out as the food is quite good.

The very interesting caption ‚Äúflame grilled chicken‚Äù by Barcelos and my love for grilled chicken items inspired me to review the recently launched restaurant at Acropolis Mall, Kolkata. Though I didn‚Äôt have much knowledge about Portuguese cuisine but can say Portuguese food is known for being lusty and robust as the cuisine is easy to prepare, and uses very basic ingredients. I was excited when got an invitation for a lunch and to represent Kolkata Food Blogger along with my co-bloggers Debjani , Indrani and Indrajit at . I must mention that after New Delhi ‚ÄòBarcelos‚Äô opened their second outlet in Kolkata at Acropolis Mall (4th floor) Kasba.¬†
¬†¬† ¬†This restaurant is a unique experience which you can‚Äôt miss to get the recreated taste of authentic Portuguese cuisine and of course they also pride themselves in the use of their different signature Peri Peri sauces (which they imports from ‚ÄòSouth Africa‚Äô.) You can choose your own level of spices for sure because each table is appeared with four different tests of ‚ÄòPeri-Peri sauces‚Äô ‚Äì Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri, Very Peri and Supa Peri.¬†¬† ¬†
¬† The restaurant is quite traditional and classy with yellow lighting around and paintings around the wall depicts the Portuguese culture and society. Bercelos Kolkata is quite specious with sitting together and enjoyment for dinner and lunch .We were served with their molecular drinks like green coloured ‚ÄúKiwi Cooler‚Äù in a tall glass which was made by Kiwi Puree swisted with spices and sprite served with fresh kiwi fruit as garnish. The second one was ‚ÄúHey Rosey‚Äù served in a stylish short round glass made off with rose syrup mixed with cardamom and topped with rose petals. Though personally I don‚Äôt like rose essence based drinks due to much domination of rose syrup, but they had balanced it withcardamom powder very nicely makes it much different. The last drink served was ‚ÄúTangy Mango‚Äù made off with tangy mango puree mixed with spices and topped up with sprite and mango slices. At the time of serving the pouring of liquid nitrogen gave a soothing look and nice heavenly presentation.

¬† ¬† ¬†In the starter they served one veg ‚ÄúArabic Mezze Platter‚Äù consists of Hummus, baba ganause, Peri Hummus , Yogurt Dip, Tabouli, Falafel, Lavash with 3 Pitas. For reference one plate of ‚ÄúArabic Mezze Platter‚Äù is sufficient for two.

The non-veg starter was a chicken one. You can say this one as their star Dish called ‚Äúespetada‚Äù ‚Äì that is basically a large chunks of chicken served on a long hanging skewer along with my loved one French fries with lettuce mayonnaise dip.

¬† ¬† ¬†As per the main course they served ‚ÄòTrout Fish‚Äô with a yogurt dip and French fries. They suggested a spice yellow rice along with ‚ÄòTrout Fish‚Äô which is really light and tasty. I did not like that one though it was my very own thought but many people find it very interesting and unique. 

¬† ¬† ¬†I loved ‚ÄúGrilled chicken with Peri ‚Äì Peri sauce‚Äù was really juicy and soft.

¬†The most unique I found was coloured burger. I have chosen chicken stuffing inside though there are four different veg and non-veg options. I tested both Red and Black Buns (Burger Buns), they explained that they use tomato powder with chili flakes, whole meal flour to bring the red colour and for the black one they use Roasted wheat, herbs, spinach extract and whole meal flour. In case of veg burger they explained it is not deep fried and so it is not crispy compared to other burger.

¬† Briefing my review I must say the overall presentation and hospitality was remarkable and an ideal place for peri peri lover a unique place to enjoy the authentic Portuguese cuisine. So thumbs up for this food joint.

Founded back in 1993 in Pretoria, South Africa, Barcelos is now a leading name in food chains and is the recent addition in Kolkata‚Äôs food hubs after Delhi in India. Barcelos specializes in serving food prepared in traditional way with the dose of health and goodness. They try to maintain the old food traditions and probably that is the main reason I was attracted to the joint even before going there! I visited the newly open food joint along with 3 fellow food bloggers from Kolkata Food Bloggers and here I am with my experience! Now the question is whether I found myself satisfied or not! Well I am to some extent and I am not a bit as well! After all we represent the country which believes in ‚ÄúAtithi Devo Bhava‚Äù (The guest is equivalent to God‚Äô) and we represent that country which believes in ‚ÄúPehle Darshandhari Phir Gunbichari‚Äù (look matters a lot even sometimes more than quality) as well and to my surprise this particular joint matches with both! Modern and minimalist interior and decorated with beautiful naturalist pictures Barcelos is obviously getting goodie points from me and some more goodie points for the amazing food presentation! Now coming to the hosting part, I think that is something the food joint need to re-search and research a bit for their own sake at least in the branch that I visited in Kolkata at Acropolis Mall. Customers need a glass of water after all! Now coming to the food, loads of goodie points from me and few minus as well!

Quite new in Kolkata's food scenario, Portuguese and Middle eastern Cuisine has come in the name of "Barcelos", a newly opened Food Chain who are famous for their flame grilled food from Portugal, house of Peri Peri. Located at the top most floor of Acropolis mall in Kasba, it's very easy to locate. Barcelos opened its first store in Pretoria, South Africa back in 1993. Using recipes mastered by the Portuguese hundreds of years ago, the flame grilled flavours became so popular that Barcelos can be found now in Worldwide and India is their newest destination. In India, Kolkata is their second outlet just after Delhi.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† When we, Kolkata Food Bloggers, got invited for a bloggers review meet at Barcelos, I had a faint idea of the famous peri peri sauce and Portuguese Cuisine but honestly speaking, I've never tasted them before. So I got excited and went there with lot of excitement with three of my other food blogger friends from Kolkata Food Bloggers. After reaching any restaurant, my eyes always revolves around the interior of the place. This time too, I went on to check the interior of Barcelos and got pleased with their Modern wooden decor with two full-walled painting of the city of Barcelos and their social life. In one wall, they have the world map showing the countries and cities, Barcelos is opened highlighted with yellow light. And in one corner, they kept a red colored closed booth for smokers which is very similar to London Phone booths. So the ambiance and seating couches are quite comfy for a relaxed family eat-out or friends hangout and this is obviously going to be a plus-point for Barcelos.
¬†¬† Once you are seated, each table gets their four signature Peri Peri sauces(directly imported from South Africa) served at the table. Three types of Peri Peri sauces are named according to their spice level are - Mild Peri, Very Peri and Supa Peri where Supa Peri is the spiciest and a Tangy lemon sauce beside the Peri Peri sauces. At first, we four were served the four glasses of mocktails or as they call it their "Molecular drinks" - First one was "Kiwi Cooler" served in a tall glass which is basically Kiwi puree twisted with spices and sprite/soda added. The second one was "Hey Rosey" served in a short round glass made up of rose syrup mixed with cardamom and topped with rose petals and sprite/soda. And the Third one was "Tangy Mango" served also in a tall glass where tangy mango puree seasoned with spices and Sprite/soda added. As all these were molecular drinks, servers very eagerly were pouring liquid nitrogen us after serving on the table, which was giving the drinks a smokey effect. I tried the Tangy Mango one and it was a bit too tangy according to my taste but overall not so bad and quite refreshing. Other than few more mocktails, they have quite a few cocktails or drinks with alcohol too for alcohol lovers. 
¬†¬†¬† After drinks were served,¬† it was time for appetizer and the servers brought a big basket full of goodies which they call "Arabic Maze Platter" which consists of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Peri Hummus,Yogurt Dip, Tabouli, Falafel, Lavash with 3 Pitas. The platter is sufficient for 2-3 people if you are not hungry like lion. Along with it, came the non-vegetarian starter, which is by the way their one of Portuguese signature dish, Chicken Espetada, is basically flame grilled bite-sized chicken breasts, onion and bell peppers skewed on a hanging long skewers which is served on your table and you have to pull out from the skewers to serve yourself with some crispy french fries and lettuce mayonnaisee dip. It will be a crowd-pleaser that I'm sure as the whole appetizer part has surely won my heart. 

¬†¬†¬† There is also Veg Espetada available for Vegetarian crowds. Also some more Portuguese exotic dishes are shining bright with exotic names on their menu card which you have to try out on our own risk as we havn't tasted those. Just kidding...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After these yummy appetizer, they brought in some coloured burgers which I havn't seen or heard before. As a food blogger, I've heard a lot about different whole-grain burgers but never heard or seen any colored burger which has all natural color and no artificial color. A good innovation I would say in the Burger World. They also have some amazing number of wraps, Middle-eastern Pitas along with a huge variety of Burgers. The list of burgers are also not a few, some are regular burger, some are colored burgers made with whole wheat, what they call, "World's Healthiest Burger". This colored burgers already made a buzz and a must-try main coarse item in Barcelos. The fact that made these burgers healthy is that they are made with all natural colors and wholemeal flour. The Red bun is made of tomato powder, chilli powder and wholemeal flour. The black bun is made of roasted wheat, spinach extract, herbs and wholemeal flour. The white buns are made of milk powder, coconut and plain flour. The buns tasted really healthy and tasty filled with veg and chicken patties along with peri peri sauce, pickled jalapenos, onions and cucumbers etc. We 4 were served 4 of these healthy burgers and we had to take one bite from each to taste all of them. 2 of them were veg and 2 of them were non-veg. Anyway, all of the burgers were juicy and soft but each of them tasted quite similar having peri peri sauce inside them. I personally don't like much sauces and mayonnaise in my burgers, but my friends found them quite appetizing and Its highly recommended. But I must say, those black, red and white buns were melt-in-the-mouth texture.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† For the main course, we were served Grilled Trout Fish (another signature Portugese dish) with yoghurt dip and french fries. They suggested to try the fish with a mildly spiced yellow rice. The fish was fresh but found a bit under-cooked and I didn't like the preparation at all even with the rice which was also very mild to my taste. I love grilled fish but this preperation was nothing like it, I'm really sorry to say that there was nothing to taste other than their peri peri sauce. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† To rescue our taste bud, came their Peri Peri Chicken, their most signature dish, the flame grilled chicken with Peri peri sauce off coarse was just the opposite in taste. The chicken was quite juicy and moist and perfectly grilled. I drizzled their Tangy lemon sauce(served at the table) on grilled chicken and it remarkably changed the taste and I enjoyed every bite of it. Its highly recommended for the first time go-ers who love chicken. As this joint is famous for its grilled chicken, the signature dish of 1/4 chicken, 1/2 chicken, full chicken, chicken steak are a must try. These can be selected with one or two side dishes which include spicy rice, mashed potatoes, green salad etc. 
¬†¬†¬† After we were done with this, we were almost full but still waiting for the next or last coarse, dessert to come just like other International food joints. But after 20 minutes of waiting when nobody served anything else, we decided to leave the place. But I realized later that they didn't offer any dessert as they don't have much of a dessert in the menu card other than some milkshakes. Nothing to worry, Other than the dishes mentioned here, Barcelos offers a huge array of food like, a huge list of appetizer, veg and non-veg sizzlers, awesome salads, Special Kid's menu also some Afro-Portuguese fusion dishes. 

Plus Points about Barcelos:

¬†¬† 1. An awesome array of dishes
¬†¬†¬† 2. Both Vegetarian and non-vegetarians options are present
¬†¬†¬† 3. Kid's Menu available
¬†¬†¬† 4. Awesome ambiance, perfect for a relaxed family day-out/friend's hangout
¬†¬†¬† 5. Great service and quite pocket-friendly

My recommendation :
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mine one and only recommendation to Barcelos is to add some Portuguese desserts in the menu, because first of all Kolkatans are famous for their sweet tooth and second of all, as much I know Portuguese have sweet¬† tooth too and are very famous for their Egg Custard and Arroz Doce or rice pudding and for some pastry shops.

Went for dinner tonight. The decor is simple and nice. Staff are courteous. However they need to be little more professional in the service -- brought appetisers and main course almost at the same time; and then fretted that the potato wedges served as the sides to the main course would get soggy of we took too much time to finish the appetisers! However their politeness covers up a little for the sloppiness. 

What we tried --
1. Non veg assorted appetiser platter -- It has generous portions of chicken, fish and mutton. Enjoyed with the peri peri sauce and dip. 

2. Mini burgers with both mutton and chicken -- Very soft and juicy. 

3. Quarter chicken -- chose the very peri rub and the chicken was soft, juicy and flavourful. 

5.  Tiramisu -- soft, melt in the mouth and rightly flavoured. 

We carried back home --
1. Chicken trinchado with rice
2. Garlic fish with rice

We are yet to try those. But they look appetising. Also the packing is done very nicely and securely. So if you ever want to take out food from Barcelos, packaging would not create any hindrance.

After having heard a lot about this new outlet, we decided to give it a try this Sunday afternoon, and the entire experience was surreal.
Ambience was brilliant, with brilliant lighting and music. Ordered molecular drinks, tangy mango and hey rosy. My daughter's went crazy with the smoke effect emanating from the drinks.
Chicken Espetada  and chicken picante were out of the world, a taste, we had never experienced before. Kids absolutely loved the coloured mini burgers.
Overall a very unique sense of presentation, very courteous staff, great ambience and an unforgettable experience. Can't wait to get back with entire family again.

I first saw the banner at Acropolis mall nearly three months back and since then, I've been eagerly waiting for Barcelos to open. In case you are unaware, Barcelos is an international restaurant chain that has outlets in 16 countries including India. The food served is Afro-Portugese and their speciality is the flame grilled peri peri chicken. 

I was invited by Barcelos for a tasting and was really impressed by their menu. I started off with a Tangy Mango Drink  with mango puree, sprite, spices and lots of ice. This is part of the molecular beverage menu so the drink looked quite spectacular with the liquid nitrogen coming out from the glass.If you love spicy and tangy drinks, you will like this.

Next up was the Chicken Espetada, a Portuguese special and I loved this one. The menu describes it as a hanging dish skewed with chicken breast, onions and peppers and served with potato wedges. The chicken was juicy and grilled to perfection. If you want to spice it up, add any of the four variants of peri peri sauce placed on the table. 

The other two dishes I tried were the Mediterranean platter and the Grilled Trout. I loved the dips in the platter specially the Baba Ghanoush & Hummus but the pita bread was dry and thick. The Grilled Trout was by far my favorite. Basically a whole trout, deboned and grilled with sauces served with a salad. The fish was very fresh and again, grilled to perfection. For dessert, I had a rich and sinful chocolate truffle cake.

I loved the cheery ambience of the place and the servers were attentive and extremely helpful. Will surely go back to Barcelos and this time, will try their famous burgers.

As their website states : This restaurant is named (and also symbol-ed) after a quint Portuguese town; famous for an ancient legend of the Barcelos rooster. With it's exotic name and Portuguese offerings Barcelos is one of a kind in Kolkata. This newly opened restaurant has definitely sparked the interest of the food lovers all across the city. 

Located inside Acropolis Mall, beside Asia Kitchen; this place is easy to find. I went to this place with a bunch of friends. As I entered, I was warmly greeted. The place was quite humongous. and divided into distinctive sections. One section had lots of wall art with a brick pavement kind of finish. I was myself sitting below a glowing map of the world with countries having barcelos marked in red. An elaborate cocktail counter, lots of paintings, huge clocks and wall art gave the place a distinctive look. 

Service was quite excellent. The manager Vijay Kumar Yadav was attentive and helpful. Our server Ritwika were gracious, knew her basics(considering that the place has opened for just 2 weeks), and diligent. 

Now the food. Well firstly, the presentations of almost all the dishes were quite splendid. 

* Tangy Mango Drink : This was a molecular drink, so lots of smoke with liquid nitrogen. Wow presentation(had to take a video :P) ! It came in a elongated, V-shaped glass. The menu said : GARNISHED WITH MANGO SLICE ( well this wasn't there). Apart from its very flamboyant look, this drink tasted mediocre; mainly tangy and spicy. It had mango puree, sprite, lots of ice(too much).

*Berry Cucumber Drink : This was another molecular drink with DHUYAN DHUYAN, DHUYAN HI DHUYAN . This was a red colored drink and came in a golbet sort of glass. With strawberry syrup, cucumber toppings, sprite and orange juice, this drink was refreshing. But in my opinion, both the molecular drinks were a disappointment, apart from the presentation.

* Cheesecake Shake : Best drink of the evening. This came a big jar shaped glass with a chunk of cheese cake as garnish. Made of vanilla ice cream, cheesecake, peanuts, and crushed ice, this drink was a HIT. It was thick, creamy & aptly sweet. This is a must try. 

* Date with Orange : This drink had more to offer than just the pun in its name. It also came in a big jar, with dates as garnish. It was deliciously thick & creamy. The flavors of orange, vanilla ice cream, coconut and crushed ice blended well. An yummilicious drink indeed.

* 1/2 Chicken : This was primarily grilled chicken with a chef special sauce. It came with some french fries and mayonnaise. Immersed in chef special sauce the chicken looked quite enticing and tasted palatable. They also offered 4 kinds of sauces(order of their hotness) : Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri,Very Peri,Supa Peri. All the sauces tasted good, especially the Supa Peri went perfectly with the chicken. The french fries tasted good, they were crispy and the mayonnaise sauce was thick. 

*Mini Burger - 2Mutton-2Chicken with a Portion of Spicy Rice and French Fries : This platter consisted of 4 multi-colored mini burgers(2 of each flavor), rice in a small bowl & french fries. With so many color variations this burger platter looked very alluring. I had to take a billions picture to satiate the budding photographer in me. Ritwika kindly dissected the burgers for us and we immediately dug in. Well, with a heavy heart I must say that while I had great expectations, all went down the drain with the first bite. The bread itself was not soft. The chicken burger was bland and came with some grilled chicken, mayo sauce and lettuces. The mutton burgers were definitely the better ones. The mutton patty was far tastier and blended well with the red sauce inside. The spicy rice bowl had nothing spicy about it and came in a small bowl. it was mainly flavor-less yellow colored rice with some zucchini and capsicum. I didn't like its taste.

We decided to end our evening soon(meaning without dessert), since we had to leave early ! I congratulate the team on their efforts. Welcome Barcelos to the City of Joy; hope you have joyous journey here! :)

Very disappointed. The d√©cor is fantastic. And the food us just the opposite. We ordered for all the signature dishes and were sooo let down. It was like all the items were so similar. There is like nothing except the peri peri sauce which seemed so over hyped. Nandos is much much superior. Very very disappointed

Barcelos has opened up their new outlet in Acropolis Mall, Kasba . Off course a good new for us Kolkattans that after New Delhi, they‚Äôve chosen Kolkata for their 2nd outlet in India- good news. Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù

How to reach and when to reach:

Its inside the new mall-baby in town Acropolis Mall, Kasba and bang on Rajdanga Road. While going from Ruby General Hospital towards Gariahat, a 3-4 minutes drive and its on your right hand side. Get in and go up to the top floor. Its just there. Its an all-day outlet. Spic and span, nicely decorated- just the way its expected. We were invited there from KFB team. Thanks Team Barcelos.

Experience:

For mocktails, we were served a molecular drinks each and for me, probably they assumed I would love the rosy flavor, and it was Hey Rosey for me. It was basically rose syrup with cardamom and rose water. As it was a molecular mocktail, hence, some fizz was mandatory and the servers tried their best to give us the experience‚Ä¶ Doesn‚Äôt matter if I didn‚Äôt like the taste much, the presentation was fantastic.

For condiments, on table, there were 4 types of sauces. 3 types of Peri Peri (supposedly exported from south Africa)- Mild Peri, Supa Peri and Veri Peri and one Tangy Lemon Sauce.

Presumably, Barcelos had a pre-defined set menu in mind and as the menu was not presented to us beforehand, it remained a surprise element for us (at least me) throughout the meal. The starter was Chicken Espetada. In a layman‚Äôs language, it was chicken kebab hanging with green peeper and onion on two sides and great to look at. It was served with finger chips and dip as sides. It was delicious. Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù Along with it, came a one veg ‚ÄúArabic Mezze Platter‚Äù consists of Hummus, baba ganause, Peri Hummus , Yogurt Dip, Tabouli, Falafel, Lavash with 3 Pitas. Its safely enough for 3 persons to start with. The dips were interesting.

¬†
Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù Till this point of time, we were not served water. Probably we were served the mocktail, hence, we were supposed to be satiated by it. anyway, its time for the main course now. And, for the main course, we were served Grilled Trout Fish with yoghurt dip and french fries. The fish was fresh, extremely fresh and chef was eager to offer us the freshness quotient. Such that, it smelled slightly fishy (this is in true sense and I am not joking here). Next time, anybody visits this place and orders the same, please make sure, you mention this to be full-done, else the freshness-quotient is bound to hit your senses. The marination was somewhat similar to the chicken espetada, but whatever. We were served yellow rice along with it, which was basically a tasteless pilaf and can easily be avoided.¬†

The next dish was their signature item. The mini burger combo. It was 2 veg and 2 non-veg combo. Out of these 4, the burgers were the highlighted ones. I‚Äôve never had black, pink or white burgers. The tastes were remarkably different. But, the chef again was extremely consistent. Such that, the fillings for the non-veg burgers were strikingly similar. Nevertheless, the dish was really good and highly recommended.

Finally, the dish of the day arrived. 1/4th chicken (grilled) with their secret marination. It was a closely guarded secret in this joint and the chicken was seriously good- juicy and tender. But one word of caution. Remember, we are used to instruct those roadside chicken fry stalls ‚ÄúBoss, give me breast piece and not leg‚Ä¶.‚Äù, the pure reason being the portion size. Its the same story here. Order them specifically for a breast piece, because that piece is considerably larger than the leg piece. But again its your call, unlike the dry breast piece, leg piece is much much juicier. Hence, choice is yours. Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù‚Ä¶. The tumblers were over and they clearly are saving water and in turn, going the ‚Äúenvironment-friendly way‚Äù.

We were full and waiting for the dessert. But, god thought otherwise. Barcelos was taking care of our calorie counter and hence, omitted dessert for us. And we kept on waiting. After sometimes, we left and while leaving, probably the longing for desserts was evident on our faces‚Ä¶. They asked us for the same and being ‚ÄúBhadralok‚Äù, we politely denied. Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù was still the question on our minds.

Finally, I can suggest that go there. have their burger combo- its really good and chicken espatada is also pretty decent. Definitely, worth a visit.

Last weekend tried this new restaurant opened in Acropolis. The Portuguese cuisine is quite different delicacy in Kolkata, so had to try it. The ambience is very bold and colorful. We ordered chicken drumsticks, mutton sizzler,  brownie shake and all the foods were tasty and the staffs are really really cheerful and helpful.

Expensive food!
(surprisingly expensive keeping in mind the quantity)
Sauces are nothing to boast about.

The variety of burger buns are good but the pricing seems unjustified. 

Not many options available for vegetarians.

I went to the much talked about Barcelos on its opening night and repeated my visit this weekend.. I wanted to check the consistency before I wrote a review.

First impression- the place has a casual yet contemporary look which I like. The staff were friendly and overall looked an feel was welcoming.

The menu is a refreshing change to the current offering in the city. The falafel platter was excellent. As expected the falafel was crispy outside and soft inside, the dips had an interesting twist to them and I not being a egg plant fan cleared the portion happily.
Let's admit that chicken is by far the most cooked protein in the world.. so its all about¬† the sause and boy does Barcelos have the sause..loved all the levels of sauce..It added a nice dimension to the grilled flavour of the chicken,more so the thing that I liked the most was that the sauces allowed customization as per my mood.
I even tried the rice item in the menu and unlike many places the did not serve over cooked thick grain rice. The rice was light¬†and flavourful.
The main attraction for me however was the colourful burgers..They had unique taste, I had tasted nothing like it before. It's a welcome break from the repetitive kind of burgers available these days..its a must try.

There are things beyond the food iv loved about the restaurant.. There attention to details and customer centric approach has impressed me. The London telephone booth designed smoke room is one of them. A restaurant serving drinks have often found customers craving for smoke and the only way to get it fixed in a mall is to leave the mall itself, the addition of the booth does the job.

Over all I would happily hang out with my friends and family and enjoy a non pocket pinching evening.

Newly opened and situated at the top most floor of Acropolis Mall, so its very easy to locate and when you find the place you find tons of happiness with it too.
A fantastic restaurant with an awesome environment. The serving persons are too nice.
Tired their sizzlers and the molecular drink, it was just mind blowing. Will surely visit this one again to try out their other dishes.
Price is slightly high, Quantity is enough.
Inner decoration is just WOW. Seat are comfy. Serving time is good enough. Large enough to hold a crowd. Really one of the coolest restaurants I have visited.¬†
Overall a really nice experience.

Visited this place during puja, found their food quality degrade a bit. My salmon was too salty, my friends chicken was half cooked, they took too much time to replace that dish. And in the end the frsh lime soda was worse than the street vendors selling nimbu paani. Really disappointed.
Last update about this place - never again visiting this place.

Already being a fan of portuguese cuisine since visiting 'Nandos' during my London days and then back in India at New Delhi, Barcelos added a new height to my portuguese experience. We visited on a leisurely Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was more than half empty. However it filled up gradually with curious people sneaking in and hence an advanced table reservation during weekend nights might be a good idea. The interiors were sober and classy. My daughter liked the world map they portrays on the wall. They pride themselves in the use of signature peri peri sauces (you can select from a range of 4 levels of hotness), delicious burgers and nonetheless their signature grilled chicken dishes.We had ordered the Cheesy Chicken Espetada and their signature Whole Grilled Chicken. The Chicken Espetada consisted of juicy and extremely delectable chicken pieces on a skewer with capsicum and onions.The spicy rice and fries on the side really went well with chicken. Though the quantity of sides could be a little more. Considering you are sharing the dish amongst 3 people, it was really less. Whole chicken was tenderly marinated and grilled to perfection. The use of sauce did full justice. We also ordered chocolate shake which was really good, as well. The taste of food itself deserves full marks but I would still rate it at 4 because of the slow service. We were kept waiting for our order for a good 25-30 minutes with the restaurant less than half full in the beginning. I just wondered how long it might take had it been during the busy evening with more people around. Other than that,Barcelos is a must visit for people loving portuguese food or those who dare to try out a new cuisine.

Barcelos is a fantastic hangout and food joint in my city, Kolkata. It has introduced itself few days back.. They came up with our very known Portuguese style food and those Peri Peri Sauces. We had tried Chicken Burger with Fries and Chicken Peta. Extremely good food. Ambience is really very nice. And pricing is absolutely pocket friendly. Though they don't serve alcohol, but does not bother if I get these good food :)

I was already a fan of portuguese cuisine after visiting 'Nandos' in the UK but Barcelos just took my love for portuguese a step further.I have minor complaints with their service as they invited us into the restaurant to be seated,only to tell us to get up moments later as someone else had reserved the table earlier. Inspite of such minor service flaws, Barcelos is an experience you cannot miss.
             The interiors are minimalistic and classy.They pride themselves in the use of the signature peri peri sauces (you get to choose your own level of spice with each dish),delicious burgers in attractive colored buns,and obviously their famous chicken dishes which are to die for.
     We had ordered the Chicken Espetada and Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt Dip.

The Chicken Espetada - It consisted of juicy and extremely delectable chicken pieces on a skewer with capsicum and onions.The rice and saut√®d grilled vegetables on the side really went well with chicken.

Chicken Cataplana - This dish was a sizzler consisting of grilled chicken shreds with rice and grilled vegetables. The yogurt dip and the sauces in this dish were absolutely lipsmacking.It was one of the best dishes I have tasted in a while.

I have deducted .5 here just for the slight lack in service.Other than that,Barcelos is a dream come true and a must visit for anyone who loves to experiment with their food.

So after reading rave reviews about this place, finally went to Barcelos yesterday. It's the newest addition to Acropolis Mall's food joints and also the first and only restaurant to have al fresco seating. We however chose to sit inside. There is a big map of the world with roosters marking the spots where Barcelos has spread its wings. The d√©cor is good as is the ambience. 
We ordered chicken espetada with spicy rice and wedges with dip on the side, 3 chicken mini burgers with french fries and dip on the side. The espetada is a hanging chicken skewer Portuguese dish while the three burgers are not the usual brown but red,black,white instead! But they are made with natural ingredients as informed by our waitress. The red one is made from tomato and beetroot puree,the black one from cocoa and spinach extracts while the white one is slow roasted.You can choose among tangy lemon,mild peri,veri peri and supa peri sauces from the table and also to put in your dish.Overall i loved the food and will be back soon to try out more dishes.
P.S. The plates are a little small and not too sturdy.

Food Bloggers Meet at Barcelos

It was a pleasant afternoon on Saturday when I reached Barcelos at Acropolis Mall to attend a blogger‚Äôs meet organized by the management, and that was the day we had been waiting for. Food Bloggers Meet at Barcelos (a newly opened restaurant). Me and my three food blogger buddies were united to attain that event together. The event was declared to be started from 2:00 PM onward and it continued till 4:00 PM.

What We Expected

As being professional food bloggers we used to attain countless events like that and habituated of the event procedure, the welcome gesture of the authority and all. So a warm welcome was quite expected at the beginning. Usually, such food tasting events start with a welcome drink which normally served within five to ten minutes just after the guests arrive. And then the special starter items of that restaurant are used to be served next half an hour. Then we are served with the best dishes of their menu and last but not the least the yummy desserts are dished up. We expected the same or may be better from Barcelos.

What We Got

But it‚Äôs very woeful to say that we got disappointed at the very first as the welcome procedure was too much informal. The restaurant authority was not concerned about that. However, that way the event began. It was the time for the welcome drink and again, they disappointed us by serving only three welcome drinks at 2:50 PM. As we were four people together, we demanded another drink, which was served by them after another half an hour, this gross negligence by the steward and staff in general was really embarrassing.

We had a small introductory talk with management and got informed that over 40% dishes in their menu are Veg. So I planned to give some try on their veg items. We also got informed that there will be another bloggers meet where few bloggers from Delhi are coming for reviewing Barcelos, Kolkata.

We ordered two veg burgers and two non-veg burgers accompanied by few veg and non-veg starters. While we were expecting starters on the table, they served us one veg and three non-veg burgers, which again a very gross negligence, as we had ordered two veg burgers. They skipped starters and interrupted the usual genre of presentation. Though we continued anyhow, but service was extremely slow. The replacement burger reached our table after one hour, awful. Veg burger was bit dry and missing the flavour and crunch, I didn‚Äôt like it at all.

The next item, Veg Platter, a mixed platter of different kebabs accompanied with stuffed mushrooms, potatoes, paneer and grilled vegetables; was again atrocious and was not palatable even with peri peri sauce. The Veg Espetada that followed was possibly the only food item that had some class. It was a hanging dish skewed with stuffed mushrooms, marinated paneer with onions & peppers with two regular sides. It had really interesting flavours and full credit goes to the chef for successfully playing with spices and herbs; however it was a tad too salty and bitter.

Finally at 4:10 they could not even serve the half of the items which were put for photo-shoot and tasting, we lost our patience as they were taking forever to serve and informed it to the restaurant authority. We were offended by the service and realized that we did nothing but just wasted a whole afternoon in such a poor place. We were extremely unsatisfied and decided to leave the place and did the same.

Verdict

In today's competition if anyone opt out for a business which is totally customer based then he / she should be concerned about the customer's convenience first. Especially when you are running a restaurant then it is equally important to maintain effective hospitality besides the food quality. There are so many restaurants in the market which are famous among people as they are aware of using the right Mantra which compiles both the food quality and good hospitality. We wonder that if it‚Äôs really possible for Barcelos (which is just a start up) to survive in the market in today's age of competition by being this much unprofessional.

Overall I had a very unhappy experience. Service and customer satisfaction is surely not on their priority list, which is a must for hospitality industry. This is a matter to worry about!!

Horrible experience. Never going back again. First of all they took 10 minutes to give water. We ordered for one mini burger, one one-fourth chicken and one chocolate milkshake. The burger came after 25 minutes but to our utter disappointment, the chicken didn't come even after 1 hour 30 minutes. Finally we had to call for the cheque after asking them several times for the chicken. The staff seemed confused and were not aware of the orders.

The latest addition to Acropolis Mall. Barcelos is the ultimate destination for chicken lovers and would feature very well if it starts serving Alchohol too. Portuguese food without wine or beer is kind of incomplete.

I had been to the place with my fiance and my aunt. A treat to my aunt was long overdue and I had heard quite some reviews for this place, so all in all it was the perfect plan to go there.

We were quite excited to try the place and so were everyone else which was evident by the long waiting time.

We got our table and were attended to impromptu. The staff were very friendly and really courteous . A special mention to our server for the day Akash, he was really always available for any small request and I seriously appreciate it.

Coming to the food we started off with mocktails , The Electric Blue Fizz, The Grape Fruit Punch and the evrgreen Pineaple Juice.
We were quite confused with what to order as the menu was filled with mouth watering delights and once again it was Akash to the rescue who guided us and we had the Chicken Espentada and Barcelos special half chicken. I loved the food and the variety of
Peri Peri sauces available at the table.

The chicken was a bit dry for my taste. But yes it was delicious. Service time was surprisingly fast and we had food on our tables within minutes of ordering.

Loved the decor and the ambience. The food was top grade and the mocktails were out of this world. Would have surely given a 5 if not for the long waiting. Nevertheless a good experience looking forward to more awesome visits.

P.S its a good idea to reserve your table on weekends as this place has a huge rush.

I visited this place with a friend at about 8pm on a Sunday. We had to wait for around 15 mins before we got a table. Well,that was fine for us 'cause we had heard a lot about this place and were quite excited about it. But sadly,it failed to make a good impression. We were given black-coloured plates which were full of finger prints and spots,quite prominent over the black color- after requesting to change them,twice,a lady came up to us and said that that is their cleanest best! We had already placed the order,otherwise we would have come out. Anyway,the food- Cheesy Chicken Espetada and a "Molecular Mocktail" weren't that special- they are only charging for the presentation. The ambience is also not that phenomenal- the wooden chairs are pretty uncomfortable,the table is too cluttered,the menucards are tattered...I'm sorry,but Barcelos- really dissapointed.

game for south African taste sprinkled all over Portuguese cuisine? Or maybe you adore a dash of cocoa in your burger or juicy tender grilled chicken with peri peri sauce? Well if you nod your head affirmatively or even feel your taste buds suddenly active, the obvious place to flock is barcelos in acropolis mall in kasba,Kolkata. the one of its kind with sangria bar boasting 21 flavours, you can drool from a long list of food items like world's healthiest burgers-black bun¬†containing roasted wheat, herbs or red bun with tomato powder,chili¬†flakes or even white bun containing milk¬†powder coconut and plain flour. infact barcelos marinates its chickens 24 hrs before flame grilling them, no doubt the chicken is juicy,tender,well cooked and the spices well permeated actually through every¬†layer.i tried chicken espetada,chicken peri peri and tangy mango drink,and as they¬†claim,i too agree that chicken peri peri is one their signature dishes.The four different types of peri peri sauce accentuate the already greatly cooked meal.If I talk about their shakes and juices you can gulp for instance KitKat shakes,ferraro rocher shakes(all chocolate lovers unite) or even tiramisu,roasted almond &dark chocolate or irish cream whipped with vanilla ice cream. Parched?¬†please try their molecular drinks--well going back to chemistry classes--solidified ice, liquid nitrogen and your drink--the threesome unleash the heavenly feeling of ambrosia. great staff, great food, great ambience, and well within budget--barcelos is a 'must visit' eatery either with family or friends anytime, anyday between 11am to 11pm.

Barcelos- what more can I say?
On a more serious note, the aroma of the signature Peri Peri chicken hits you even before you walk into the restaraunt. Kind of an appetite builder for sure! Cozily done up with wooden interiors and a European style theme, a well designed hang out.
The food speaks for itself. A must try- the signature chicken pieces, which can be customised with a sauce of your choice. My personal favourite would be the veri peri :) 
Also, the hanging kebab is delicious. Moist, succulent boneless chicken pieces on a skewer, with your choice of sides.
Being accompanied by vegetarians, I even had a chance to sample their dishes. Can safely say this place has a good (and delicious) variety for vegetarians as well. 
All in all, a must visit !! Cheers guys !

Horrible experience. Will never visit again. The food had no taste as such except containing much salt. Ordered for simple mineral water which was also forgotten by the staff. Their normal water tasted bad as well.

Loved the food. A complete paradise for chicken lovers. Honestly Kolkata needed a good peri peri place and the wish has been granted. For me this is going to be one of the best places to eat in Kolkata. Waiting for alcohol licence and then it would be peri peri chicken and beers for me.

This restaurant has opened recently at Acropolis mall in Kasba. We dropped in here around 8 pm last Monday. The ambience was really nice. Welcoming staff, cozy big bright coloured sofas, smoking booth, spacious interiors. Everything was perfect. We were really hungry and quickly started discussing what to eat. The staff helped us with the orders. We were 7 very hungry people. Ordered a full chicken which was supposedly Barcelos speciality. We after that ordered burgers and sizzlers. The burgers came with one side or with two as ordered. They had 6-7 options for the sides. We stuck to fries and wedges and dips though. The Red meat burger, the peri peri bloody red burger, the too much red meat burger were really tasty. The full chicken- 7 huge portions of chicken cooked with an tangy peri peri flavour was just deletable. What we didn't like at all was the sizzler. It was more of a not so tasty rice and less of meat. But, the main reason which would make me think twice before going back to Barcelos ever again would be the ABSOLUTELY bad service. They have way too many confused staff. The food was served almost an hour after being ordered. And that too not together. The staff were even worse at following instructions. Not only us, the tables nearby also had the problem with the service. Next would be the desserts. Barcelos sure serves the most over priced desserts in Kolkata.
I definitely hope that they improve on their service, or sadly they won't be able to survive at Acropolis Mall with Chili's being just in the corner.

This newly opened restaurant is located in the 4th Floor of Acropolis Mall.

The hostess greeted us and ushered us in the restaurant which was pretty empty on a Saturday late afternoon. She even explained their speciality and signature dishes which is the peri peri Chicken.

The first thing which you would notice is a world map in golden lights at the far end wall opp the entrance.

The ambience and decor is quite good with street paintings and paintings hanging in the walls.

Ordered Stuffed Chicken Kebab as appetizer / starter dish, which is quite good. They basically serve Portuguese dishes in African spices. Almost all their dishes are prepared using the sauces - Mild Peri, Tangy Lemon, Supa Peri & Veri Peri with varied levels of spices.

We ordered 1/4 Chicken and Chicken Steak after taking the order their head cook came back to us saying though they have Chicken Steak available but as they dont have the best portion so requested us to go for something else, hence went for 1/2 chicken instead.

As per their description of both 1/4 Chicken and 1/2 Chicken - "Chicken marinated in our secret recipe sauce & grilled upto perfection" - Really very well cooked and made spicy with their signature sauces.
1/4 Chicken
1/2 Chicken
We ordered the above dishes with Mashed Potato - quantity of mashed potato was less in comparison to other restaurants.
Apple Juice

Really liked it. Will look forward to their Coloured (Red & Black) Burgers on my next visit.

Well, after coming back to city from Mexico this was my first visit to a place where the foods reminded me the style of Mexican food... Barcelos has unique sauces or salsas by which you can customize the flavour of your food according to your taste buds... I loved the drinks... they are amazing and unique in taste... lovely ambience... warm attending people to serve you the best... give it a shot with your family and friends...

Uniqueness is the keyword here in Barcelos. We started with an amazing refreshing Kiwi Cooler mocktail made with Kiwi puree and  spices, what a summer cooler it was. Then we had Chicken Espetada which was yumm  it was perfectly marinated and grilled with onions and peppers. The Bun of Burgers were perfectly stuffed which were in various colors ranging from red, white and black. Also try the Peri Peri Sauces they are amazing and it really enhance the taste of the food. In the end we tried the Himalayan Trout fish, the dish was highly delectable it was properly marinated and baked with peri sauce. The ambiance, service and the staffs all are very good here. I will highly recommend this place.

The location of this restaurant is perfect, with ample parking space at the mall you don't have to worry about parking your car. Just park at the basement and take the elevator directly to the 4th floor to reach with metres of the gate.Once you enter you will just simply fall in love with the ambiance, perfectly laid tables in three separate sections makes it easy for you to sit according to your group size.¬†Just order and relax with some Kiwi Coolers or Berry Rose Margarita and within minutes, you will be served fresh grilled chicken, fish and other hot favourites¬†that you can choose from the menu. Trust me you will be spoilt for choice when it comes to Barcelos.Be sure to try their signature dish Chicken Peri Peri, Hilamayal Trout, Kebabs etc. My favourite were the coloured burgers especially the black burger.¬†You can always customise the dish with different levels of spiciness which the kitchen staff will then prepare according to your choice.¬†With a great ambience and a really very courteous staff, you will surely have a wonderful time here.

The newly opened Barcelos had been on my cards ever since it opened in the Acropolis Mall at Kasba. I finally managed to visit the place and boy did I love it. The Barcelos rooster was ever so welcoming and so was the decor and the staff. The place is done up in a very chilled out manner and reminded me of a Spanish movie set. The walls had old Spanish streets painted and framed newspapers from the early 20th century.

Food and drinks:
For the drinks we were served fancy molecular drinks, smoked up with dry ice. Included in it were the Berry Rose Margarita, Tangy Mango and the Kiwi kooler. I loved the Tangy Mango. The Berry Rose Margarita was extremely well presented and garnished with rose petals and is great for someone with a sweet tooth.
Coming to the food, one of their biggest USPs is the presentation...its indeed one of the best I have ever seen. The food here is Afro - Portuguese, therefore it serves Portuguese food in African spices. Everything on the menu can be customised using four different spices, namely, Mild Peri, Peri Peri, Very Peri and Super Peri, with increasing levels of spice. The colored burgers and the Chicken kebabs were my personal favourites. The Kebabs were served as pendulums and were super interesting, so was the grilled trout.
The Peri sauces are served on the tables so one may even customize the levels of spice further.

What an experience and lunch at Barcelos!! Oh my God! Seriously that was amazing! This is yet another stupendous paradise of exquisite delicacies for the food lovers of the city of joy!  While at Barcelos I was simply awestruck at the presentation, beautiful interior decoration that brings in a piece of foreign touch, soothing ambience and a great combination of yummy dishes has added to one of my memorable days in life.
The dishes that was served were really finger licking and of zenith quality alongside being healthy too. The list of dishes were varied from soft drinks to desserts. Kiwi kooler and tangy mango both were too good. Excellent fish kebabs, chicken drumsticks, chicken espeteda as appetizers are worth a praise for their tastes. CHICKEN ESPETEDA was the speciality and really was of a superlative degree. Then in the main course the 1/2 chicken and fish sizzler added to the list. All the way, each and every taste of the delicacies were a greet to the taste buds. Not to forget the numerous dips! There were too many of them like mango chili, pesto, spinach etc and all were so unusually tasty. Nevertheless the members and staffs were very jovial with a smile on their face always. This piece of Food Paradise is really a treat to the people of Kolkata.
Good luck for all the future efforts.

BARCELOS which has recently opened in Acropolis Mall,Kasba is definitely on it's way to establish itself as the recent sensation for the food lovers. Straight away starting with the appetizers to main course till the desserts,none of them can be put to second or third. Starting off with Molecular Drinks has been included in the menu which sounds interesting in itself,under that Tangy Mango has been able to prove it's worth a bit more than Kiwi Kooler. Being a little bit more specific on the starters if one wants a dry one, Chicken Wings will be a great pick. While the other part of the folks will be genuinely satisfied with Chicken Drumsticks. On the other hand Chicken Espeteda which has already established itself as the special attraction of this newly opened Restaurant - BARCELOS. Fish Fantasy includes Fish Sizzler and Fish Kebabs both of which are equally tasty delicacies. Well the Desserts has always been a cherry on the top for all the food lovers. So in that case anything between Brownies or Tutty Fruity would be a nice pick :)
Good Luck!

Location - The restaurant is situated at the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall. 

Food- Peri Peri chicken and Chicken Espatada are one of the key dishes of this place. 

We ordered the Tangy mango and Kiwi kooler. I didn't much like the Tangy mango but the Kiwi kooler was good. 

Then we ordered the Mini 4 burgers. Never in my life I thought that burgers can be so colorful and was tasty too. Thoroughly enjoyed the color play. 

Then coming to the  Peri Peri chicken which is undoubtedly the best dish of  this outlet. The chicken was very succulent and properly grilled. And then comes the 1/2 (chicken breast marinated with their signature peri sauces). Boy it was spicy! Another dish which I loved here was the Grilled Trout fish. I'm not a big fan of fish. But trust me guys this is one of the tastiest fish dish I ever had. The whole thing was aptly grilled and the sauces made it more luscious.

Overall I really loved this place. The staff was courteous and service was remarkable. Loved the interior. Ambience was pretty good. 

Lastly if you're bored with Chinese and Indian dishes, I highly recommend this place for those people who wants to try something new. 

Note: The pictures are gonna speak for themselves.

Great interior with high quality food. ¬†Not only food but also the service was good. I was really tired of with KFC and Mc Donald's Big burgers and eagerly searching for a different flavor. I got colorful burgers and kababs with great taste and it was so special to have it with my besties. The World Map was incredible. I also like Tangy Mango and Chicken Espeteda. Even deserts're so yummy. Over all it was a great experience. I am planning for a dinner with my family. Great place for foodies. Highly recommended.

Finally!!!! I have been  waiting for barcelos to open.  I totally love peri peri and was super excited to have the fare here.  The first thing I tasted were the 4 signature sauces  which ranged from the mild lemon being the mildest to supa  peri,  which is totally  up my alley. 

We tried some molecular  beverages,  hey rosey was the most spectacular one. 

Coming to the food,  I'd suggest one goes or a very peri or a super peri, the grilled chicken is cooked to perfection and so is the trout which had been de boned.  Excellent presentation of the fish. 

The burgers are very soft with a brioche like consistency and are one of its kind.  The Mediterranean platter was stunner,  the peri hummus and the baba ghanouj was delicious.  The falafel was cooked well. 

Coming to the ambience,  very pretty,  and the staff is also very warm and courteous 

I'm really looking forward to another visit soon.

Cheers!!

With a lot of excitement decided to hit this place..The interiors looked descent specially ¬†the map on the wall probably highlighting the foreign essence ¬†and the staff was very wel¬†behaved¬†n friendly. Nice ambiance.....service is also very nice.....but the¬†food! Its it very tasty but little monotonous , flavors n variation are limited i think ....was expecting more , because its my first time with Afro-Portuguese cuisine. However We ordered cheesy chicken espanada, 1/2 chicken( chicken breast marinated in their delicious siganature peri sauce and grilled to perfection)!! The chicken espananda had a very innovative presentation, served as hanging chicken skewers with mozarella cheese, onions, bell peppers and sun-dried tomato. the grilled chicken was good. Presentation n garnishing is really awesome.Drinks with fog effect r just like ..OMG!!!it was fab.. New thought new concept in kolkata ...had really enjoyed a lot,but portion served per dish at Barcelos is less compared to its price.
¬† ¬†however..... being a foodie,must try....

Outstanding is the word. Well, first of all a big Thank You to the Barcelos team for coming over to Calcutta; the city needed such diversity.¬†
Well, honestly speaking, I was kinda skeptical to begin with but the Kiwi kooler changed the mood altogether. It was a great start and pretty much the signs of things to come. The PERi PERi Black Beauty was the surprize package; I loved it. By the way, the Grilled Trout Fish tastes superb with the Mild Peri sauce; that, for me of the pick of the evening. However, one needs to make a judicious choice of the sauces to pair with the food that you order; I really liked the mild peri variant.¬†
The ambiance is amazing; some beautiful wall art and some classy wall-hanging to compliment the same. Great evening indeed; highly recommended.

Courteous staff, quality food and chicken grilled to perfection. Their ambiance is nice and cozy. The smoking room reminds you of  London phone booth and the food reminds you of Nando's Peri Peri Chicken. We got a Cheesecake on the house! The Tiramisu was perfect and 'melt in the mouth'.

The staff members are close to friends when you go in, with a lovely smile and a warm welcome. Many people won't like pure Portuguese cuisine/food. But, I would highly recomend going there if you want to try something new and exciting. I would recomend "Barclos" again and again if you want to try real Portuguese food. :-D

Acropolis a newest mall in town wih handful of decent restaurants. In those they added a star which is none other than a international restaurant and trend setter- Barcelos.  Location is good and entrance makes it premium. Interiors r unique and fresh for Kolkata market. Mix of colors and European architect inspiration make it very lively. Music is good though. Now we come to food which is again new and fresh for Kolkata. Portuguese and Mediterranean food is simply awesome. Presentation of each dish is expctionaly well. We have tried lots of variety but each dish is good undoubtedly. And still lot more to explore in future visits. Drinks with fog effect r just like theater. It engage u for sure. We r talking about Barcelos and not bkack Burger how is that possible. Extremely great concept and taste. Just can't ask for more. Highly recommended. Must visit .

Not up to the mark. Had a fully loaded chicken burger and a chicken cheesy wrap. Too much jalapeno in the wrap. The chicken inside the burger wasn't great either. Service needs to improve big time. The sides were served after I was almost halfway through with the burger. Not sure if I'm coming back again. The peri peri sauces were authentic though.

Peri Peri-lous !!!
A T2 Page 3 report on this newly launched restaurant made me curious. So I went out on the next day of Vote Results. I would give an excellent rating for the decor and ambiance, further animated with a friendly staff who kept on suggesting their signature dishes, explaining South African and Portuguese cuisine and its Peri Peri sauces. So far so good.... But....
As far as the food is concerned, I didn't find much variation among the plates we had ordered ... Chicken Picantte (portion was less), Chicken Peri Peri Sizzler ( presentation was clumsy and cumbersome), and Chicken Trinchado with Rice.
My final impression is that the restaurant is theoretically sound, if not in its practical execution !

Barcelos left us awestruck!! Newly opened up on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall, this chicken retreat will amaze you by its sheer variety of lip-smacking rooster delights. The restaurant is themed around medieval europe and there is a map of the world on one of the walls, beautifully lit up. The waiters are very courteous and the service is pretty efficient. We ordered cheesy chicken espanada, cheesy chicken wrap, a combo of four of their signature mini burgers and 1/2 chicken( chicken breast marinated in their delicious siganature peri sauce and grilled to perfection)!! The chicken espananda had a very innovative presentation, served as hanging chicken skewers with mozarella cheese, onions, bell peppers and sun-dried tomato. We totally loved the burger combo which came in different colours and tasted just as colourful, the different tastes blending to create an orgasm in your mouth!! The cheesy chicken wrap (chicken strips, mozarella cheese and creamy mayo in a blanket of tortille bread) as also a revelation!! Also you get to choose sides of your choice- be it potato wedges, french fries, mashed potatoes, grilled vegetables or spicy rice. The desserts were not as impressive. While the tiramisu was really tasty, the berries cheesecake was a bit coarse and the chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream was okayish!! However for the love of their marvellous chicken and the delicious food..this place has the potential to be the NEXT big hangout for all meat lovers!! Keep up the great work, guys!! Looking forward already to my next visit!

nice ambience.....good waiters.....but the food! Did not find it very tasty. Guess it's because its my first time with Portuguese cuisine. However the grilled chicken was good. Got a fish sizzler and of of the fish pieces were burnt on one side and tasted bitter.

Luved dere ambience and decoration. The world map marking Barcelos throughout d world is cool. The staffs were friendly and guided us with our selection. The Peri Peri sauces ( mild to sup) on each of the table and dere colored burgers really enhanced my taste buds. We ordered Very Peri Black Magic burger, ( 2 mutton+2 chicken) Mini burger, Hey Rosey, Cheesecake Milkshake. We were quiet satisfied wid food n service. However bun on the lower side tends to break as a result hands were messy...it would be great if finger bowl was made available.
Play some music that will be great for Barcelos.
Will visit again Barcelos.

Barcelos has now spread it arms and has made its way to the city of joy Kolkata. Where huge crowds welcomed this new entrant, all were thrilled to taste their very famous Peri Peri Chicken.
Thoroughly enjoyed the burgers, especially the color play. That was the sole purpose of my visit. A cosy setting with a friendly staff and good food, what more do you need from a place. Another dish which I would recommend is the Chicken Espatada. To make your meal a little more hearty do order their Wedges and Spicy Rice.

Craving for something that is rich in taste and satiates your taste buds, then this place is your pit stop.

With a lot of excitement decided to hit this place on my Hubby's birthday..
The interiors looked descent and the staff was friendly 
We ordered four different dishes namely steak,sizzler,peri peri signature dish and the Burger platter.
The steak was chewy and very hard.One could  hardly cut through it .On request the staff decided to change it and get a fresh new one which was a complete disaster.It was served burnt.One does not expect a joint at there reputation to serve a portion which is burnt.The sizzler  was below normal,veggies were dry,stale n bitter.Even homemade steaks are better to taste.
The Burger platter is the only thing which turned out to be a little good but nothing really great.
The items are overpriced and the servings are very small.
The mocktails are so average that will only make u regret ordering one.
No recommendations for this place and definitely not going to this place again which only left a bad taste in my mouth.

Although the ambiance is good..  I was very disappointed with the food.. The chicken breast piece which they served in the steak was not fresh n it was so hard that it was even difficult to cut it with a knife.. On taking up this issue they said they would replace it.. But after a few minutes they brought the same piece which now had been burnt from the underside due to Over cooking n tasted even worse..  Highly disappointed with the quality and taste of the at such prices.. Even the mocktails lacked in taste.. won't suggest this place to anyone.

So new restaurant in town. A totally unique and different menu. Very nice ambience, quite spacious and with comfortable seating.
We ordered the veg kebab platter. It was not all impressive. I would suggest to my veggie friends to give it a miss. 
We then ordered a Red Peri Peri burger and the black burger. I must say that the bread is really soft and had a very different taste. The burgers are quite good. And the sauces which accompany are quite good. I liked the potato wedges served with it. They were crispy and really nice.
My friend ordered their chicken starter which is served on a vertical skewer. According to him the taste is something unique and a chicken lover would love it.
We ordered the tiramasu. It was very basic, give it a miss.
Overall I would say their burgers are quite good. 
The service needs to be stepped up. I din like the plates they used to serve. They wobble a lot and they don't look clean.

Very disappointing... We ordered for chicken steak, burger platter, veri peri sizzler and 1/4 chicken roast. The chicken in the steak was first undercooked. On taking it up with the staff they took it away and brought it back saying it was redone. This time they burnt it!! Not even a bite could be had bcoz of the burnt smell... The sizzler was equally bad.. The veggies were almost raw. The only dish we somewhat liked was the burger platter but that too is nothing extraordinary. Even their mocktails are not worth a mention. Can't imagine a restaurant to go wrong with a drink as simple as a fresh lime soda. Not coming here anymore for sure.

I have always loved Peri Peri chicken and that too at Barcelos. We all got to know about the recent opening of Barcelos at Kolkata and were too excited for it. 

Just 6 days of  operations and such a great popularity. Already waiting has started at the outlet. As usual we ordered our Peri Peri chicken platter and the Espatada. Both were perfect and right as should be. 

I also loved their coloured burgers. The red ans the black being my favourite. The drinks menu is also quite nice with ample choice of mocktails and shakes.

Don't get too excited about the burger! Think Chicken Espetada!

So, finally it happens. The Perri Perri a.k.a the black burger has come to town. As a burger lover, I was looking forward to seeing what this beast of a burger actually tastes like. Well, 1st experience wasn't that great, the bun broke into a million pieces. The chicken was good but not great. Specially the Chicken Espetada. It is beautiful. Won't say the food is bad, but it can most certainly be way better.

Service: friendly
Environment: nice
Recommend dish: Chicken Espetada

P.s can't wait to try the milk shakes, cause they look and sound heavenly. Bubble gum shake? I mean are you kidding me?

The best Peri peri chicken in the world comes to Kolkata at last. Opened just 5 days back this outlet is already bustling with huge crowds. I have always been a fan of Peri Peri chicken and Black burger as I had tried them Delhi many a times.

I had to wait for 15 minutes just to get seated in this outlet as their was a huge rush. We ordered the usual Peri Peri chicken with supa peri sauce and our usual Coloured slider burgers. OMG the same taste and I must say it was way better. The Black burger with lamb patty is the best in the world.

The healthiest option to have in non vegetarian food. No oil and fat used only flame grilled.

They have a wide variety of mocktails as well. Keep rocking Barcelos.

Food is absolutely rubbish here. The restaurant seems to have been started by novices who haven't got their act together !

We tried the Kiwi Cooler which seemed to be a sugar syrup mixed with chat Masala. The grape fruit punch was far better though.

We tried the 1/2 Chicken by ITS, highly recommended by the staff there. It was full of salt and couldn't be eaten. We also tried the Chicken Espeteda which was tasty and soft, but again full of salt.

Overall it was quite a miserable experience for us. It will be difficult to erase this bad memory and have the courage to visit here again.

Good Luck !!

Visited the restaurant with family the day after it opened. It was the most disappointing experience ever. Having visited the same restaurant in Delhi, I had expected the service and food to be of high quality but, I was proved wrong. Both restaurants, even though they belong to the same chain, are poles apart.
1) We were served rock hard burgers
2) The bread used in the burgers was stale
3)They did not put any cheese or any other vegetables in the burger which the menu mentioned, the burger contained only the patty
4) The molecular peach iced tea did not contain the nitrogen that is supposed to be put in every molecular drink and nor did it contain the peach pieces that are supposed to be there.
5) Sides that we ordered with the burger were not served at all 
6) There were six of us and one of our burger's were served after all had completed there meal 1.5 hrs after the order had been placed.
 
In short everything went wrong and what had started off as a family dinner ended as a disaster. The food was unsatisfactory and the service was depressing, not something expected from such a famous chain. This restaurant is not ready to serve yet. They spoilt both our mood and their image.They can do much better.

Barcelos have established their outlets as the right place for quality food with no compromise in quality. Always leaves you craving another visit.

Great ambiance, great food and service. Love the  items on the Barcelos menu especially the addition of the Mini Burgers...yum the grilled options are also nice and the fact that now you can choose a filet of Trout Fish  is a wise option.¬†

Thanks you Barcelos

I love burgers and was very excited about trying Barcelos, a South African eatery, which has reinvented the traditional burgers and painted our burger dreams red! (I just had to!!). Besides their signature colored burger buns, Barcelos is also famous for its flame grilled menu. Thankfully, the flame grilled menu has also given vegetarians a good enough reason to rejoice. They have a wide range of vegetarian offerings along with chicken and mutton items and some lamb and fish dishes as well. ...

Kudos Team Barcelos.!!!!

For a multi national chain, and opening just 3 days ago, they really should get some research done.
 I went with relatives who were already a regular at the Botswana joint and honestly its a disaster, even for them.q

We ordered the family platter with sides of potato wedges and dips. After a quick 10 mins, we were served.
The chicken was rock hard. They claim that their food is "always fresh and grilled", but all I found was microwaved frozen food. It had no indications of ever seen the inside of a grill.
The chicken wings were seriously hard. Let alone use steel cutlery, it was a challenge to chew!!
I think we just paid for the excellent potato wedges with the dip. That was the only item thats freshly prepared.
Ambience: 8/10
Service: 8.5/10
Food: 4/10 and guys I'm being generous.

It was a bust man.

Welcome to the world of peri peri! Being fairly new to Portuguese and middle eastern cuisine I set off for this experience to Barcelos yesterday afternoon. As you enter the first thing that strikes you is the nicely done decor. The bar area looks very inviting but we have to wait a month or two before the place gets their liquor licence I guess. Till then you can enjoy their amazing and varied mocktails .As you look right You see a London style ph booth which serves the purpose of smoking room and a really nice 3d painting on the wall at the right corner.

Sitting areas all look nice and comfy. There are brightly done sofas which adds to the decor.

Coming to food , the most important thing...I have just one word, fantastic!!! We had ordered chicken sizzlers and chicken espetada...they were nice and succulent. The unique thing is the peri peri sauces in the table. There are 4 varieties and depending on your taste buds you can go for the mild peri all the way up to supa peri!!!! Yummm! Next time I wish to try the black burger which is one of their signature dishes!!

Coming to servicing.... The waiters were courteous and hospitable. However since the restaurant has opened just two days back, they will definitely get used to serving faster and being more attentive. I feel the food should be served a tad faster.
The food is really competitively priced since I had expected a much higher bill!! This is definitely another huge plus point!
Overall the experience is wonderful and I am definitely going back again!

One of the worst outlets for food that I have come across !! Expecting the same level of competency and the quality of food as they serve at Delhi I was taken aback !! The waiters are incompetent in taking orders and none of our orders came the way we wanted. We were served pathetic peach ice tea which was supposed to molecular but it wasn't for which the excuse given was Kolkata doesn't have supplies for it !! A truly spoilt birthday dinner. I would strongly recommend to wait till the waiters are trained enough !!

Ambience is very good. Lights and environment are very soothing and calm to sit and spend time with your partner or friend for a long time, what we did actually.

Now come to food. Specialty is they have four types of sauces and you need to understand those sauces very important to order your food which actually decide the taste of your food. 

We order wings with peri peri sauce,chicken wrap both are very tasty and taste is unique.
Good part is they are serving unlimited cold drinks.
We also ordered fish with chicken two main course with rice.fish was really tasty.

When we are coming out manager came to us took the feedback personally and also told us what we can order next time , I believe he understood by our face expression that we are going to visit them next time very soon.

Latest addition to the much talked about Acropolis Mall is Barcelos, started its operations on 14th May'16. Hazelnut coloured ambiance and warm light makes the interior little less sparky. Separate bar section right now only serving mocktail till bar license is in place. There is a smoking booth available for smokers, resembling the design of London's telephone booth. Barcelos is known for its sauces they use and on table one can see 4 different varieties of sauces ranging from mild to fiery hot flavour.

Ordered Chicken Steak and Cheesy Chicken Espetada. Thick breast pieces provided with steak dish was chewy, fibrous and lack marination. Main reason could be they provided chicken with its skin on. Kind of turn off for me immediately. 

Cheesy Chicken Espetada is claimed to be a Portugese dish with five chicken pieces hanging from a skewer. Taste was wonderful too. Chicken was succulent with distinct taste of their sauces and mozarella cheese. This dish is known as their "handing wonder of the world". With both the dishes french fries and potato wedges were provided as sides. Other options available as sides including spicy rice can be avoided. 

We were looking for sizzlers but informed by server its not available for the day. However after 5 mins we could witness sizzlers were served on other tables. 

Servers seems to be completely loss with zero relevant experience and their nervousness on the opening day was clearly visible on their face. For serving glass of water servers had to be chased. Long way to go for Barcelos to compete with their next door neighbout Chili's. Portion served per dish at Barcelos is pathetically less compared to its price at higher side. Price for 2 dishes were INR 1005.

I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is not bad at all. The Peri Peri grilled chicken , grilled trout , all the molecular drinks etc are excellent. The Burgers are not bad either but the service of this place is horrible. All our side orders were mixed up with other¬† dishes' sides.Some of the sides came much later. One of the burgers came 20 minutes later than the other dishes.Some of the food wasn't hot whereas some of the food had perfectly fine temperature. Also we waited more than 40 minutes for our mains which is totally not acceptable at a classy restaurant in a high end mall. Don't know what to say about my experience.Also I am not sure whether I will visit this place again .

I fail to understand why the owners would be in such a hurry to open a restaurant without providing proper training and adequate knowledge to the staff? While it's great that Kolkata is opening its doors to new ideas and concepts in F&B but really sad that in doing so a lot of important aspects are taken for granted. Something as basic as a fresh lime soda was not served as per the request. The staff had no idea what the menu entailed and thus ended up noting down wrongly. Dishes were served cold. Overall service was sluggish and inept. In a business where first impressions are everything, this place does not leave a lasting one.

As a first glance one would consider it to be another fast food joint. 

But as one get reading the menu, one begins to feel the difference. Contrary to what we know burgers here come with healthy at the same time yummy grilled filling. 

The most interesting, innovative and MUST TRY part is the RED and BLACK Burgers. Apparently, real Cocoa goes into the BLACK BURGER. For the RED one, you get real beet and tomatoes.

Pros. 
Food was very good and wholesome. Albeit a bit cold but still flavor on the chicken was brilliant 

Cons.

Unfortunatley cons are more but u have high score did to food quality and to be fair they have opened a day back only 

Service needs huge overhaul. The service was road side dhaba type to say the least.  Had to order for  water,  tissues,  fork,  spoon and literally everything. Food came first,  water second,  tissue third, and then finally fork to eat food. Wrong  order was another issue.   Advice : do try the rice dish and don't go with good service expectation in near future but for go. It'd a blast of flavors.

WHAT MATTERS IS GOOD FOOD THAT IS DEFINITELY AVAILABLE

All excited about the launch of Barcelos in town , we set off for a bloggers invite at barcelos for lunch. Barcelos in the home of Peri Peri. Peri peri belongs to the capsicum family and grows in Africa.Barcelos masters in Portuguese delicacies especially their flame grilled flavours. They bring about a concoction between African spices culminating it with Portuguese cuisine.

Location : 4th floor of the Acropolis mall.

Decor and ambience : the decor is quite impressive. We were alloted a table through which we could glimpse in the whole viee of gitanjali stadium. The walls were painted with different scenes froms old portugal, which was indeed nostalgic. The worn away brick walls just suited in the scene. The huge clock, the world map, the raised bar, the skewers, the wooden table and chairs were quite evidently giving it an old European feel. 

Staffs : The major problem that we faced was with the staffs. A drink ordered at 3.10 pm reached our tables at 4.10 pm. None of the non-vegetarian dishes were being served until and unless it was being summoned for. The staffs seemed least bothered to serve. Finally we walked out without tasting half of the set menu being tasted which was a sheer disgrace. A brand which seemed so promising was a major turn off for the staff support. 

Coming on to whatever least we could taste, was quite new, fresh and tempting. Not to forget their four different sauces- mild peri , tangy lemon, very peri peri and supa peri peri. To begin with -
Drinks:

1. Tangy mango - tangy mango puree mixed with spices and topped up with sprite. This was a real summer booster to beat the heat.
2. Kiwi kooler - kiwi puree mixed swisted with spices and sprite. This was the numero uno of the noon. This is refreshing, and the whole concept of kiwi puree was really exciting in a way. This is definitely recommended.

Kebabs:

1. Chicken wings - these are chicken wings layered with peri spices, grilled with peri sauce and served with peri mayo. This was interesting. It was soft , succulent and the chicken skin coating was a killer. If tried with very peri peri sauce ,  a definitive hit.

2. Chicken espatada - a hanging chicken skewed with chicken breast , onions, peppers. Was even interesting. This is an age old portugese cuisine. But this was served to us when it was cold. so did not really evoke the deadly burst in my taste buds.

3. Boneless thighs with onion and peppers - boneless chicken thighs skewed with onions and peppet and served with peri mayo was served to us when we were just about to leave. However it did created a great feeling.
 
Burgers:

The burgers were innovative a find. These quirky burgers initially made me curious as to how the taste would be. But it did taste great. 

1. Peri peri black magic - bun, peri mayo, pickled jalapeno, lettuce, tomato, onions and chicken fillet with very peri peri sauce was a killer. From what I felt , it was an absolute new addition to the food industry. A definitive recommendation.

2. Peri peri bloody red - bun, peri mayo, pickled cucumber, salsa, thousand islands, jalapeno, lettuce, tomato, cheese slice, pineapple, two fillet with mild peri peri leaves you with a feeling of content as well. 

3. White chicken burger - the bun sandwicging mango chilli mayo, iceburg, green pepper, orange, chilli garlic, coleslow, chicken breast was great as well. The pineapple flavour reigned the taste buds , which left me chomping it.

Although my personal favourite was the black burger.

Value for money : the prices are inflated towards the higher end. However, the burgers and chicken can be died for.

The brand looks promising although I feel there needs to be a chnge in the attitude of the staffs. Such a great place to have food should not suffer due to the hospitality being absolutely nil. 

N.B : the review is based on what I have deduced personally.

There would be many people posting pics of food items, but the simple fact is that I was so entrapped in the spell of the amazing food and ambience, that after reaching home only did I rue not clicking a photograph here. To put it simply, every year Kolkata gets a revolutionary food joint (Chili's, ring a bell?). This year it has to be Barcelos! I'm just glad that this global phenomenon launched its first Indian outlet in Kolkata.

Unique Afro Portuguese flavor blend gives Barcelos a unique taste palate to astound us. Had the fortune of visiting it on opening day, and everything went on like a clock work- the servers though new were thorough and helpful.
Before going to the food, a mention must be mentioned of the interiors which was artfully done in with a corner dedicated to the namesake Portuguese village called Barcelos. There is a nice glass front facing the stadium on the outside and looked awesome in the rains. Also there was a Red London phone booth designated as the smoking area.
Coming to the food, we were delighted with the bit of Molecular gastronomy magic in form of Molecular cooler-The Kiwi was yum and the Mango was tangy with a taste and bit like aam-panna but the texture very different.
For starters we had stuffed mushroom skewers which were mushroom with a dollop of mild peri peri sauce and hint of parmesan and basil stuffings.
The main course consisted of Chicken Espetada (skewered chicken with onion and capsicum in veri peri sauce) with a side of spicy rice (aromated like jollop rice) and grilled veggies, Cheesy chicken wrap in veri peri chicken and signature quarter chicken. The chicken pieces were as juicy as it looks and wrap was delightful was a hint of mild peri flavouring.
What made the whole experience every more delightful was the customisability with various flavouring sauces on the table itself. You could add Tangy Lemon , Mild Peri, Veri Peri and Supra Peri sauces (in increasing order of pungency) to adjust the taste to your liking.
We finish off with Tiramisu mouse cake which was a nice round up the whole meal.
There was constant feedback taken by the staff as well as the owner on food taste and flavouring as this was day one.
Well done to the team on this wonderful first day - looking forward to returning soon

There are restaurants serving food and there are places giving you an experience‚Ä¶  Barcelos is the latter of the 2‚Ä¶ one does not go there for just eating‚Ä¶ you go there for the ambiance service and then the food‚Ä¶ the vibes this place gives is so positive and relaxing that having a good time is surety of its own kind‚Ä¶ the place interiors ar so nicely done that taking a walk around is something each one does‚Ä¶ from the red telephone booth shaped smoking room to the world map locating barcelos on the globe.. it is just very stylishly done‚Ä¶ the best part is the portugese corner they have with a village painting and the legend of barcelos‚Ä¶ I made sure to sit there as it just felt right‚Ä¶

Since it was their first day of opening the owners came and chatted with us and asked us for the food and everything‚Ä¶ they are really good people and the staff there is also always polite and always have a smile on their face‚Ä¶.

Coming to the food‚Ä¶ their specialty is their Peri Peri sauces which they give you 4 choices and their chicken‚Ä¶ the sauces are spot on and the taste is divine‚Ä¶ the starters of fries and the hanging chicken and the mezze platter was something to visit this place again‚Ä¶ after a very long time have I had pita hummus baba ganoush and falafel of this taste‚Ä¶ the fries with their Mild Peri and Very Peri is a must try‚Ä¶ my friends informed me that the hanging chicken is also great‚Ä¶ next time I will try the hanging paneer and mushrooms as they looked damn tempting‚Ä¶

Coming to the main course‚Ä¶ the BURGERS!!!!! Oh my god‚Ä¶. Now THIS IS REAL BURGERS!!!! Kolkata was missing a decent place serving real burgers to the people and barcelos has answered that call‚Ä¶ we also called for the cataplana‚Ä¶ which was something new for us and the taste made it a must have every time I visit‚Ä¶

The prices I was surprised to see for this up market place was not every expensive as the black patty veg burger cost like 175 or something which is not expensive at all‚Ä¶

i normally dont publish snaps of a place and i am against it... but there are some places which are different and the view and the food must be shared.... the black bun burger i am sure is a first in Kolkata

OVER ALL‚Ä¶ this place is a must visit for any one enjoying food‚Ä¶ and I cant wait for them to get a bar license after which this place will be a mad house of entertainment‚Ä¶

It was a sudden plan to visit Barcelos.. It has a good ambience and decor... As it was my first time so took recommendations from the waiter...


¬†At first i ordered Chicken Thigh With Onion And Pepper (it was just good) followed by Chicken Livers With Port Roll (i liked the taste) Chicken Red Burger ( i had it, ¬†and it was so juicy and delicious) Chicken Black Burger (fillings differ from the red one and was told it was amazing too) ¬†After filling our stomach to the fullest, it was time for the dessert to come... I ordered Dark Lava Meltdown Cake (presentation of the dish was just woww, and it tasted heaven)¬†


I won't say its a pocket friendly place, slightly overpriced, but its a must visit place... I had a good experience being here...!

The Sangria was superb. I loved the Jamaican flavours especially. The Peri Peri Chicken matched up to the expectations. But the pasta was overhyped and same with the sizzler. The decor and interiors were awesome. But the food was below par. All in all decent experience in my first visit.

The one n only barcelos in kolkata. A decent place to go and try some out of the box. The advertisement of the red black burgers tempted me check this out. We ordered full chicken and 4 chicken mini burger with spicy rice, and French fry as side dish. The full chicken was delicious. The chicken grilled with peri sauce we tried all the 4 types of peri peri sauces with chicken. The burgers were the best and hence is the main attraction of the place. Black and Red burgers were awesome with spicy sauce and yummy chicken stuffing. 4burger was very soft. Quantity is good for the price they charge. We will visit again

Heard a lot about this place but it was nothing extraordinary, rather not even that good. The number of visitors were not even more than 5. The decor was really nice but somewhat food wasn't upto the mark. We ordered 4 mini burgers, the different colored burgers tasted just similar... not difference in flavour, that was a complete thumbs down.

Very very average.... If u just have fancy stuff with fancy name in a fancy place it sells for few days but ultimately for repeat customers it shd b good.... Went twice last yr and nt going again ... On 25th Dec when every place in Acropolis had more than 1hr waiting time this was the only place which had seats vacant and I stl choose nt to go in this place.... U can go to the place once I guess and revisit only if u like it... That is my recommendation

Finally was able to visit Barcelos. The decor and seating is very good and comfortable. The service was also good. The best item was chicken sizzler. Would only visit this place again for the peri peri chicken sizzler and the non veg kebab¬†platter. It has quite an extensive menu but the food was too good. Highly recommended.

Checked in here with my friend. They don‚Äôt serve complimentary accompaniments or bar snacks which encourages one to order one from the menu. You cant have basic peanuts or cheese bites. So we ordered a White sauce pasta the chief ingredient of which was bell pepper of various colours which made it look colourful. It had a sprinkle of mushroom or olive. The White sauce was too less for the pasta to be greased well by it and it lacked every major for it to be called an Italian dish. But they charge you high enough. R/s 261 for handful of it. Better to have the R/s 15 Maggi pasta pack and add your own veggies. The people here don‚Äôt believe in serving well I don‚Äôt know why. They are least cheerful. Handed me a 1.5 ltrs beer pitcher to serve on my own. I served my pasta too. But they sure added service charge in the cheque which my friend later waived considering their pathetic service. The L shaped premises has a good view at the end of the L. 2.5 stars for the view.

Barcelos situated in Acropolis mall has an amazing ambience. The place has a good vibe and the decor is on point. I tried the black burger and the chicken steak over there. The burger was really filling, because of the wholesome chicken breast inside. You can also choose the level of spiciness. They have a separate sides menu from which you can choose two side according to the dish. The place is totally worth the money.

So... I ended up entering this loner place in Acropolis. 
We ordered 4 mini chicken burgers, 1 pinacolada and a on-promotion rum. 
 the pros-
- large space
The Cons-
- driest burgers ever
-hardest burgers ever(check the pic) 
- really tasteless and extra cheese was like sh*t (adding an amul cheese slice) 
- charges are unnecessarily high
-levy exorbitant service charges(no pic as we were so pissed that we forgot to take bill as wee)

A pretty classy place . The traditional flame grilled peri peri chicken is great. The sauces include supa peri, veri peri, mild peri and tangy lemon ( in descending order of spiciness) The peri peri chicken sizzler is good but is not close to the classic flame grilled peri peri chicken. 5 cubes of chicken is served with veggies and rice on a sizzling plate. The blueberry cheesecake like always is good. But not extraordinary. They serve it with a dollop of strawberry ice cream on a cookie.

We had a great experience overall at Barcelos in Acropolis mall, kasba, Kolkata. We went in fact without much expectation, just knowing that they serve black and red burgers. However, the staff were polite and knowledgeable about the menu, service was fast, and the food was delicious. We ordered a pitcher of orange and cloves sangria,  chicken platters, lamb chops,  4 chicken mini burgers and a double layer dark delight. Food was impressive! We liked the ambience of the place as well. Absolutely no complain about this evening at Barcelos.

Barcelos is the new entry in the Kolkata-food-scene, but this internationally spread brand is already famous in many international as well as few Indian cities already.

The d√©cor is minimalistic, rustic and gives a feeling of the road-side cafes one encounter in Europe. Being my first time in any of the Barcelos, and being a lone diner, I did not want to take risk and asked the waiter for recommendations. Upon his recommendation, ordered a peri-peri chicken and a virgin mojito.

Peri-peri chicken was their signature dish, and it was good, but nothing extra-ordinary. I ordered 1/4th chicken portion with one side dish. The price, I felt, a bit on heavier side.

Overall, just an Okay experience.

Food: It was a rollercoaster ride as far as food is concerned. Some things, especially the mutton keema sizzler and garlic fish rice, were pretty good. On the other hand, the soup was disastrous. The chicken wings, although tasty, had not been cut into wingettes and drumettes, making it difficult to eat.
Service: The service was okay. The staff seemed courteous in general, although they didn't do much about our complaints about the soup.
Ambience: The seating was problematic, as we were always having to move the table to get out and go to the restroom. It was loud since the kitchen opened into the main dining area and staff in the kitchen were shouting out completed orders all the time.
Conclusion: I don't see myself planning to visit this place specifically but I wouldn't go so far as to avoid it. In fact, we had come here because Asia Kitchen had a long queue. In a similar situation in the future, I wouldn't mind visiting this place again.

The food was really bad. Apart from the chicken and fish pieces, the peri-peri chicken sizzler and the grilled fish sizzler was pathetic .The long island iced tea was how it is supposed to be ,nothing exceptional. The rice in the sizzler was really very bad, I felt like I wasted my money on food for the first time.
But then again trying something out of the recommended list was a mistake.

We surprisingly got this place less crowded compared to the other adjacent restaurants and cafes. Ordered 4 Chicken mini burgers, Chicken Espetada, Oreo Shake, Tangy Mango smokey molecular drink and two Bira white beers.
The Chicken mini burgers came in white, brown, red and black colors- each had a different flavor. You're supposed to choose a side with it. We chose French fries. Recommended.
The Chicken Espetada looks so tempting and is delicious. Comes with 2 regular sides of your choice. We opted for French fries (again) and Potato wedges. The fries were thicker than usual, and though properly boiled, weren't as tasty. The potato wedges were burnt to some extent. Overall, I found the dish a bit overpriced when tallied with the content.
The Tangy mango smokey molecular drink has got a strong flavor. I liked it. Recommended.
Service is fast and the staffs are cooperative.
Pocket pinch: Rs 2500

One word - HORRIBLE!!
I placed an order for 4 chicken Mini burgers. When it got delivered I found the patty is missing for all - only bread, mayo, and veggies were there. There was no chicken filling. So I tried to contact the restaurant but mailed as none one the numbers worked. Finally i took Zomato help to connect with the restaurant. Now, the person I spoke to was an absolute idiot. He told me to come and collect the party as they don‚Äôt have their own delivery system. Hence they won‚Äôt be able to help me. He also went on to say they made a mistake, and so what?! It happens and they didn‚Äôt do it outspokenly. Obviously!!!! What a mind disturbing chat I had. Finally I lost my temper and patience and was at a loss of words also. At this point in time, Zomato called me back and told me they are refunding the payment. So I got my money back..but had to settle for Maggi as it was already late and I didn‚Äôt have the patience to order anymore. Oh, the zomato delivery guy got lost and so the delivery was delayed by 20+ mins. When I tried to call him, he kept disconnecting my calls. Overall a horrible experience with Zomato also. Swiggy is way better.

Chicken wings starter 9 piece- good

On a special day in Kolkata, we decided to ditch our regular Park Street and go somewhere different. Situated at Acropolis mall, the Barcelos is a nice joint on the top floor of the mall. The mall also has other wide range of restaurants to choose from. On a Sunday afternoon, I was quite surprised to see that the place was empty. Earlier over the call I have already told them about our reservations with the Jain food, however on reaching when I asked about the same the concerned person was quite surprised and we were only left with 2 options to choose from. However, on insisting we got help from the staff soon who checked with the chef and tried to prepare few Jain food for us. 
 
For starters we had the delicious Paneer patty served with veggies. The same was well prepared which melts in the mouth and was the best preparation. For drinks, we didn‚Äôt want to experiment anything and ordered for the simple sweet lime soda. The main course consisted of their famous chicken black burger, classic chicken burger, grilled chicken with mushroom and veggies and grilled salmon. Though there were a lot of options available still, we weren‚Äôt quite satisfied with the food. We found the burger pretty dry and the salmon was nothing extra ordinary baring the fact that the fish was soft and fresh. For the family which had few veg members, had no other option other than trying out simple Paneer prepared the same old way. 
 
Overall the experience was average, however the lady who served us later took extra care and ensured we were comfortable and was prompt too.

I had ordered flame grilled chicken, chicken drumsticks and a cheesecake brownie yesterday. 
The food was nightmarish. 
The flame grilled chicken,which is supposedly a speciallity here,was all bone and no meat. It was absolutely bland and the sauted veggies that came with it was stale and the odour was unbearable. 
The drumsticks were slightly undercooked and the meat didn't seem fresh.
The cheesecake brownie was the only good thing! 

A very bad experience.

Ordered Flame Grilled Chicken, Chicken Drumsticks & Cheesecake Brownie. To start with the good point, the cheesecake brownie is one of the best desserts ever. The drumsticks were decent.

Moving on to the rest of the meal, the entire order was COLD. Though the delivery time was 35mins due to the distance, I can pretty much say that a freshly prepared chicken cannot possibly be this cold. The house special Flame Grilled Chicken was downright tasteless and full of bones. Accompanied the dish were sauteed veggies which were stale, made evident by the strong odour straight out of the box. The French Fries were cold and without any hints of salt. The drumsticks were decent but couldn't save the mood after the massive dislike generated already.

It was a massive letdown.

It's been more than one year and I still remember this place very fondly. Located at the top floor of the Acropolis Mall by the RB Avenue connector, this floor is the Holy Grail for food lovers, Barcelos is one of the flag bearers of European cuisine. You should get a seat here as it has ample seating capacity. We started with 1/2 chicken wings and the orange and clove sangria and the traditional Portuguese sangria. The chicken was very juicy and had the right combination of flavour and spices. The Portuguese sangria wasn't all the good strictly by the taste, the orange sangria was a bit better.
In the main course we ordered Chicken Espedata and
2 mutton and 1 chicken burger combos with Mashed potato sides. The Espedata is a visual treat and we got busy clicking pics from the moment it arrived on the table. It tastes fabulous as well with the bell peppers, the mashed potatoes and the Mayo, ohh just mouth watering stuff. The mutton burgers next were amazing as well and so was their speciality black burger, it was so good that you can go there just to sample their burgers.
All in all we had a wonderful dining experience and it has been our loss to not revisit this one in the last 1 year.

Usually people go to Barcelos to have the black burger or other Portugese exotica. However, yesterday we went at the dinner time, so I wanted to have something wholesome. I ordered the Lamb chops. They were grandly sumptuous in quantity and were served with exotic veggies and khus khus, making it healthy too. 
I was also pleasantly surprised at the variety of sangrias they served.

I had ordered flame grilled chicken, chicken drumsticks and a cheesecake brownie yesterday. 
The food was nightmarish. 
The flame grilled chicken,which is supposedly a speciallity here,was all bone and no meat. It was absolutely bland and the sauted veggies that came with it was stale and the odour was unbearable. 
The drumsticks were slightly undercooked and the meat didn't seem fresh.
The cheesecake brownie was the only good thing! 

A very bad experience.

Ordered Flame Grilled Chicken, Chicken Drumsticks & Cheesecake Brownie. To start with the good point, the cheesecake brownie is one of the best desserts ever. The drumsticks were decent.

Moving on to the rest of the meal, the entire order was COLD. Though the delivery time was 35mins due to the distance, I can pretty much say that a freshly prepared chicken cannot possibly be this cold. The house special Flame Grilled Chicken was downright tasteless and full of bones.

Not sure if it's devil's boon or seraph's bane that I'd landed in this place, unplanned, at all. Overpriced & apt rated, the place is highly roomy(even has outdoor seating, which isn't really needed IMO) with scattered focus lights. The ambience and decor exuding woody notes is really a plus, with a bonus view of Gitanjali stadium if you manage to sit by the glass window panes in the innermost tier, specially at night when the lampposts lit up the stadium grass under stary sky. Albeit, I'm buffaloed by the interior Portugese charm, it's to note how the protagonist viz the dishes performed.
Black Burger: Main striker, served with a regular sides of your pick.
Idk how they make it black tho', by charring it or something. It doesn't affect the taste, rest assured. It was a solid, unadulterated chicken burger deserving a good deal of score.
Flames grilled peri-peri 1/2 chicken: Okay, not a good decision tbh. The flaming wasn't proper rendering the chicken deficiently tenderzied egressing those chewy results. The three sapid sauces don't help at all, meat is practically just buttered, salted, peppered. The mashed potato was blander than usual. The purpose of it is to counteract the richness of the associated main course, yet it stood out for its OTT dullness. As a consequence, we were saturated with the chunky piece of chicken, staring at us. It was tiresome, to speak for the fact.
Blueberry Cheesecake: I believe overpriced dishes should produce such a taste that doesn't make me regret a penny I've invested on it. Kudos, it's just balancing on a wire if I scale. A rigid cheesecake is rare but hey things exist to surprise us. The ice cream topped with a petty cream biscuit was another turn off.

3.6 from me at max. Oh they even charge 10% service tax. Not really inclined towards a second visit, but if I do it'd be to show peeps the idea of a black and a red burger.

Order : Chicken liver with port roll.

Comment : Although Barcelos is known for its peri peri chicken and burgers with buns of uncommon colours, I had chicken liver with port roll at the Baecelos counter (at Ahare Bangla). The port roll is a sweet (with a tinge of garlic) bun while the chicken liver was cooked in what seemed to be a pasinda curry. At 90 bucks, this combo was a winner.

Food : 4.5/5
Ambience : 4/5
Price : 3.5/5

I had been to the Barcelos in Delhi, so had great expectations from the restaurant. I really love their juicy and spicy burgers. 

However, this outlet was disappointing. I ordered black veg burger - it was not hot at all - rather cold. Further, it was quite dry and bland unlike the juicy one i expected. Overall, the place was disappointing.

Barcelos provides you with an extremely comfortable  atmosphere. The interior is very nicely decorated. They offer a Portuguese special and grilled menu. However there weekdays lunch menu which starts from 12p.m.- 4p.m. is the most cost friendly with a complete food course. Truly impressed.

The outer appearance reflects an upmarket joint and so do the prices, but, not the taste....Truth be told!!!!
For a couple of craft beer (1 free with 1), virgin mojito, kebab platter & cheesy chicken wrap, shelled out ‚Çπ1,611/-
If you ask me as to whether the "squeeze was worth the juice" when it comes to quality/taste vs price tags.... Definitely no!!
The food menu wasn't that very comprehensive/varied either....
So with all the polish/lighting/attempted razzmatazz 3/5 is all that could be spared....

I had been yearning to hop into Barcelos from quite some time. Finally visited the place today. And what a disappointment it was! The ambience is good. Other than that there seems to be an issue with almost everything. We ordered a Portuguese sangria n a mint cooler which were decent. I also ordered their popular Black burger which like other reviews I'll also say was dry and tough. Another house speciality that we went for waa Chicken picantte. Well this had major issues. Firstly it's mentioned in the menu that you can oder any 2sides of ur choice. Bt the waiter played smart and placed 2 sides of his own choice. We gt those changed however. Secondl, the dish is supposed to have stuffed cheese inside the chicken. It took us great efforts to figure out the little taste of cheese inside. On top, the chicken was dry and very bland.
Then the dessert. We ordered molten dark chocolate. Man Barcelos deserves a negative marking for this. They charge a whopping rs.275 to serve a tiny chocolate cupcake(the molten chocolate was negligible) and one scoop of chocolate icecream. Seriously u'll cheat like this? And finally the bill. Even in a scenario where we're paying GST, these ppl add service charge in the bill which we refused to pay. Overall a horrible experience. Definitely nt going back!

I was very satisfied to see Portuguese food being served up in Kolkata. Combined with it's perfect ambiance, welcoming staff and over the top menu, it is one place you would definately not want to miss. 

We tried the black pepper chicken steak and the classic buffalo steak. I must say that I was a bit disappointed upon seeing the cut of the steak served. I was definately expecting a better cut. But the quality waa perfect. You should definately try the different sauces with your barbeque or steaks. All are promisingly intriguing and unique.

I ordered their famous black mutton burger in mild peri-peri flavour with a side of wedges while chilling at a friend's place.

Frankly,the burger was a huge disappointment.The most distinctive thing about the patty was that it didn't taste like chicken.On the flip side it didn't taste like a beautifully done patty of red meat either.

The wedges were the best part of the meal.

The burger was not at all value for money.At 405+copious amounts of taxes(for dine-in), it's a big no-no.

I'll have to try their chicken cheese espetada and famous grilled chicken to nail down a final verdict.Until then, it is what it is.

American dining in Acropolis Mall, Barcelos provides all the essentials for a decent fast food experience.. ranging from burgers to pastas.. from cocktails to desserts.. it consists of a lot of varieties.. we ordered a 4 burger combo.. we replaced the black one with a red one.. and a couple of beers.. without doubting the quality which was on point.. quantity should be taken care of considering the worth.. Barcelos used to serve adequate quantity when it was new.. maybe a marketing strategy, but that has declined since then !

Rarely do I rate a restaurant a 5 or a 4.5, but Barcelos deserves a 4.5 from at least me because I was content with the food, and I only give high ratings when I'm content and satisfied. Barcelos did not fail to impress or amaze me with its good food.

The restaurant's located on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall and easy to locate. It's popular for its Middle Eastern cuisine and delicious fast food such as their famous Black Burger. The decor consists of murals of global maps, historical European street scenes, sketches etc; a smoking booth's also available.

We were given a separate Chef's special menu, a Portuguese menu and a drinks menu. We opted for the Chicken Espetada, a Portuguese hanging dish made of skewed chicken thighs, onions and peppers, accompanied with one's choice of any two regular sides. The server served the chicken on our plates from the hanging skewer, and one of the attendants was willingly kind enough to take our photographs along with the dish. 

The chicken morsels were extremely delicious, even though I'd chosen them to be non-spicy (one can also go for spicy). The potato wedges and French fries that I'd selected for the sides were fresh, crisp and very tasty dipped in the equally delish dip. One can also utilise the Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri or Super Peri sauces provided at the table. 

In a nutshell, Barcelos is one of those rare places that has won my heart. Would definitely like to revisit to perhaps try their Peri Peri Chicken or the burger. :)

Barcelos is located on the top most floor of the acropolis mall in kasba. We had gone there for dinner.
The ambience is good. The seating arrangements are cozy and the staffs are friendly and helpful. The walls are decorated with pictures of european lifesyles, overlooking the gitanjali stadium its quite a pleasure to dine and enjoy the view.
As for the food we had ordered the famous chicken black burger, grilled fish sizzler, chicken peri peri , blue lagoon, cheese cake, brownie shake and budweiser premium.
We really hard great expectations for the black burger but unfortunately its wasnt upto our expectations. It was good to taste but the bun was quite tough and dry.
Chicken peri peri was good. The portions were quite large and well cooked and tender.
The best was the grilled fish sizzler . It was made of basa fish and was soft and juicy and really of good taste.
The blue lagoon and budweiser were standard drinks.
As for the brownie shake, it was quite refreshing and tasty.
Finally the desert, blueberry cheesecake. It was really great. The cheesecake was topped with blue berry nd the botton was a buiscuit base. Also it was accompanied by strawberry ice cream. The desert was really worth the money.

To sum it up.. its a good restaurant , a bit on the costlier side but a nice place to relax and enjoy with friends.
Ps- they also charge a 10% service charge.

The only drawback I faced at this place was the fact that they don't have a washroom inside the restaurant. One must use the Acropolis mall washrooms which are a bit of a walk from the restaurant. But that's not much of a snag.
Over-all a great experience. Would visit again.

I have become a fan after my 1st visit. This place is way better than chilli's and less crowded which means no waiting time. There space gives off a warm feeling and is airy. It is unlike the american diner experience of congested seating and gaudy decor. There special treat are the 30 odd flavors of sangria. For a wine cocktail fan this is heaven. Service is prompt and may i say very discrete. They do not pester u to order or finish ur meal or try to whisk away ur half finished food. The herb fried chicken was delicious, onion ring turned out to be a bit of a dampner as a few of the rings had a bitter after taste. The red wine and white wine sangria on buy 2 get 1 offer more than made up for the dissapointment of the onion rings. Best to take recommendations from your server for the order. We enjoyed the simple fussili pasta in red sauce with chicken. We were plesantly surprised by complimentary dessert of house ice cream -coconut n paan flavour. Both delicious. I would highly recommend them for their food variety and beverages and their ambience and decor.

Located on the top of Acropolis mall, this has the potential to be a gem of a place.

Ambience: One of the most well thought of decors with lighting which sets the mood. Comfortable seating.

Staff: Very prompt service. Staffs has fair knowledge of what they are serving. At times, too much prompt, which i will mention next.

Food: We had ordered grilled chicken as the place is famous for the same. At the time we visited, their much talked about sangria was not available as they had not obtained the liquor license at that time.
All the four sauces tasted great with the chicken. Beverages were also good.
One down side was they served our mains even before we were half way to our starters. As a result the mains got cold. When we said the same to the waiters, they just didn't have a solution. That was not desirable at all.

Overall: A thumbs up for the food, price is on the higher side. Longing to taste their sangria soon. Deserves at least one visit!

Revisited the place recently. Everything from the taste of food to service has degraded considerably. Had to send back lamb chops since the meat was very undercooked and a saw would be required to cut it. The food tasted very bland and stale. Never going back there again. Thoroughly disappointed.

Highly over priced, average range of cocktails. The fish and chicken both where not properly cooked tasted raw. The good things are the interiors and very polite staff.

Frankly speaking we went there with high expectation and were highly disappointed. Firstly, the people who were serving there were very casual, they did not even offered us water and not even the menu card until we asked for it. We ordered burger platter, but they served it without dips and chips, somebody else came and added this after it was already served. Another item was there of rice and vegetables with Fish. Fish was good, but vegetables were not fresh. Not really want to go back there again. :(

Good ambience. The food is quite good. Would suggest to try the continental. Chicken steak is great.  Could even go for pasta or pizza. Nicely garnished, a little costly, but food for a couple of people and some more.

We visited this joint last year. It was mostly empty at around 5 pm. The decor was nice.
We ordered Chicken drumsticks, Peri Peri Paneer and Flame Grilled Peri Peri Chicken.
The food was disappointing. Hardly average, and grossly overpriced for the quality. The staff was, well, disturbing to say the least. Untrained and too intrusive. Inefficient with orders. We didn't dare to order anything more, fearing that it would be a waste of money. The bill was already high.

Situated on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall, Kasba. Its a pretty well decored and peaceful place with nice ambiance. I liked their detailing on the wall decors and furnitures. The bar is well stocked. They even have a smoking zone. Now lets come to the food. Food is above average, I would not say its great but pretty good but not upto the price that they charge. We ordered Chicken Wings, Grilled Basa Fish & Beer. I would suggest them to improve their service quality as it was below average. The service person dont even know how to pour beer from a pitcher to a beer mug as he filled it with froth! Moreover its a nice place to be with family and close ones though on a bit costlier side. You guys can try it out atleast once.

The look and feel of the restaurant was quite similar to that of Nando's. But taste wise not even close. We were a group of 3 people and ordered a half chicken grilled platter with potato wedges and spicy rice as the sides and 2 mocktails. Firstly, the star of the dish ,grilled chicken was not the star at all. It was overcooked,hard and tasteless. Taste was just ok. Sides were ok too. But the mocktails were awesome. We tried the mango one and the Kolkata special. Forgot the names unfortunately. Price was way too high for the quality they serve.Handwash area should have been there since it's a grill chicken speciality restaurant and I think using fork and knife for eating drumsticks is quite adventurous but that's my opinion . After going through reviews we decided to try this place. If you already love Nando's food don't expect this to be any alternative. Its nowhere near close in terms of taste and portion.

BARCELOS you will always stay in my Favorite List..

Great execution of Food style with justified ambiance.

We have ordered- Chicken Wings,1/2 Chicken with supa peri sauces,mutton keema wrap the red one ,the famous Black Burger(Mutton,My fav) & OREO Shake .

Ambiance: 5 out of 5

Food Quality/Taste: 4 out of 5
Food Style
Maintained at any time : 5 out of 5
Service: 4 out of 5

Still I have some observation after my 2nd time visit :
1. Please try some different type of peri sauce or may be some new one for Chicken wings,its sound bit monopoly for using same type sauce there also.

2. Didn't able to differentiate between VERI PERI & SUPA PERI for 1/2 Chicken section.

3. Billing- Did you really realized that it will impact on your rating after couple weeks of GST implementation. Why you guys generated the bill with SERVICE TAX after having the GST already in the bill!! I have found many comments with same things. When I have had a look on the Bill i found same issue and after complaining it was a new bill again. This is found very bad .

Otherwise again it was a great experience and will have more.

Barcelos, the very name intrigued me to visit the place. It was a long time plan finally made it. We ordered the Tenderloin steak and the chicken peri peri steak. The meat was very well prepared for the Tenderloin steak and was bang on medium rare. It was one of the best done steak I have had till date. The meat was juicy and the sauce was pretty tasty and went well with the mashed potato and broccoli. The chicken steak had a very unique taste, tangy and spicy and a first time for me. Personally I did not like it much but it's worth a shot.

When most restaurants in Acropolis have waiting lines & the food court chairs are all occupied, you are almost certain to find seats at Barcelos. It's the cornermoat restaurant near the lift on the top floor of Acropolis mall. 
There's a seating area outside as well.

Went there twice during Durga Puja & did not face troubles getting a seat. The decor is decent.

I found it a bit weird that the staff would be hearing your conversation and would feel free to chip in. Sorry, but we don't want any eavesdropping.

Didnt eat much here - quick bites only. French fries with dip was decent. Tiramisu, although small in portion tasted alright. 

They restaurant serves mocktails with Liquid Nitrogen Dioxide, commonly called as Dry-ice effect. I may be wrong, but sich drinks looks fraught with risk to me. Suggest not to touch/sip till it stops steaming.

OVER-HYPED. OVERPRICED. BAD FOOD. UNPROFESSIONALLY RUDE STAFF.

I'm not sure if my experience had been affected by the fact that I visited during the Pujas. However, there was no queue or any kind of rush whatsoever which could serve as an excuse for the food & service this bad.

Most of the tables were empty and there were hardly more than 15 customers at the time of our visit.
Our attendant was so unprofessional. He made a mistake in our order - We had ordered 1/2 Flame Grilled Peri Peri Chicken (2 pcs) and he had brought the full one (4 pcs). On pointing it out, he rudely argued with us and said we never asked for 1/2. We still asked if any adjustments could be made as we had also ordered a White Sauce Chicken Penne Pasta and 4 Mini Burgers and there were only 2 of us. But he bluntly refused.

Coming to the food part, if this is the kind of food they generally serve then this place is so over-hyped!

‚Ä¢ Hated the Peri Peri Grilled Chicken. I'm not having it ever again.. not even for free.
‚Ä¢ The pasta was, one word, HORRIBLE. You call that tasteless stuff white sauce penne? I've had bad pastas but this was by far the worst! No seasoning, no SALT! What's wrong with you guys?
‚Ä¢ Mini Burgers were still edible. French Fries were not given to us with the burgers. No idea why! Instead something that looked like mash but turned out to be some dry breadcrumb-like tasteless stuff was served.
Also, we were served the Red, Black and two Brown Burgers. Instead of one White. However, the two tasted different. I guess they were out of white buns so they replaced it with the regular ones (picture attached).

Had we wanted to argue with that rude attendant again, we would've complained. But we didn't see any point and were too tired to be complaining about each and everything. Hugely disappointing!

The price is so high and for this quality of food and service? I regret visiting this place ever. Never coming back. Not even in my nightmares!

After movie, it is my booze place. Let's enter have a cocktail or some beer and gone.

I went twice. 1st day to resolve my burger carving next day to keep calm my meaty madness.

Cinnamon Apple Santeria with 4 mini burgers.

They looks colourful and base bun prepared from different sources of ingredients like cocoa (black) , coconut (white), tomato (red) etc. Good and tasty with tangy pineapple twist. Little bit over pricy.

Next day I kept it simple. Two White Bira (295) affordable.
One herb spice chicken fried (no taste of herbs, oily, hard, chewy)
And then Chicken Picantte( chicken breast roll stuffed with lots of cheese, obviously different kind of cheese mixed in the stuffing. Great place to hang out. They include service charge in the bill, both of the times I told them to exclude. They politely removed it. Service was fast. Little less attaintive staffs.

Neway i will definitely go next time.

Worst experience ever.The  grilled chicken was so so but none of the sides were fresh.Paella rice was not available.So we chose the spicy rice.We remember very well how flavourful it was in Nando's.Here it not only lacks any flavour but also has that unpleasant odour that we get in rice kept in the refrigerator for a very long period of time.It was so detestable.At home we just throw away when it gets that kind of unfresh smell.It also has that dry  grainy type of texture that left over rice in the fridge always has.When we pointed it out they just took it and reheated the same stuff in the microwave.The odour and grainy feel was still there as we know it is quite irreversible unless not boiled again with water.we discarded the rice ultimately.The potato wedges were the only good stuff. So when they offered any other side instead of the rice we chose that .My daughter took a one platter which came with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.Both were equally unfresh.The veggies were rubbery with no taste of any of them and mashed potatoes had that same unfresh smell of foods kept in refrigerator for a very long time.
Go there only for potato wedges...if you are such a big fan of them.
It was a weekend and although the chilies and Asia kitchen (the two other restaurants just around it in the same floor )was as crowded as we always see this one had not a single customer.we are a great fan of  Portuguese food served at Nando's and had thought  many a time  before to give this one a try.
We were a bit apprehensive seeing it without a single customer.Still we thought to give it a try to form our own opinion not being biased about external factors and the experience made our assumption true.Wished not to give any rating as  even the lowest one is showing 1.If possible I would have given it a negative rating.

The decor was really nice , the staffs were really good , and the best part the food ddnt take long . We ordered chicken wings with peri sauce , chicken sizzlers with hummus, Portuguese veg soup, molten chocolate cake with ice cream and tipo tinto . The food was well cooked and the quantity was nice . Really hoping to visiting this place again .

They had taken our old humble chicken to a total different level altogether with their various peri peri options and with a nice exceptional menu. We had started to think what really actually possible more with chickens. Preparations are different and as we heard it is Portuguese. Well, staffs are very efficient and so so courteous. They help you most to have a great experience each time. Go there and fall in love with old chicken again. Huge and generous place to have gala time. Cocktails are up to the mark too. Highly recommended.

Undoubtedly this place was awesome,great food must try in drinks is Sangria and in food is flamed grilled peri peri chicken(spicy),crispy fried fish and stuffed potatoes with mushroom and cheese (veg non spicy). Known for different flavours of sauce ,Barcelos simply the authentic Portuguese cuisine taste which we were looking for.To add to this the ambience is absolutely amazing.Chilled out place to hang out with friends or with your date ;)

Love their ambience specially the one from where we a get a clear view of geetanjali stadium , 
I must appreciate the service of this quarter is great , the people are not only warm but they are very prompt in getting your order 
Of the items I ordered special mention to the sparkling  micromolecular kiwi kooler , their speciality esperatada and the delicious mutton burgers . I must say they serve one of the best mutton burgers in town ..
In cocktails kala khatta will be the one to go for . 

All said and done the price is still on the steeper side

Visited this Portuguese themed restaurant few days back. The ambience, food quality and staff service were really good. There we ordered 1 cappuccino, 1 latte, chicken espeteda (which is a hanging dish skewed with chicken thighs, I fnd it okayish, not too good and not bad either), mutton kebab sizzler (highly recommended) and for dessert we ordered dark lava meltdown and it is absolutely heavenly. Overall pocket pinch was 1750 incl GST.

I have noticed in some reviews people have mentioned about the extra 10% service charge apart from the GST. In that case all you will have to do is to tell them that you are not willing to pay this service charge (as it is optional) and they will prepare a fresh bill without it.

Terrible food. We ordered Portuguese chicken soup, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks and cheese chicken espetada. The soup was thin and bland. The mozzarella sticks had a foul smell and tasted horrible. The wings were tasteless. The cheesy chicken espetada had no cheese. The only good thing was the coke. Would not recommend this place to anyone.

Went here on navami for lunch. To be honest we wanted to go to chili's but because of the long queue there we opted for barcelos which seemed to be relatively less crowded. They gave us a waiting period of 15-20 mins and we got a table after that.
Ambience-- the decor is mainly done in wood, has dim lighting with oil paintings and gives an old European eatery kind of vibe!
Food-- we ordered the kala khatta and tequila sunrise (cocktails), herb crusted chicken and chicken espetada ( 1 of each). The drinks were great! Specially the kala khatta. It was quirky and refreshing. The herb crusted chicken was okayish nothing extraordinary. And honestly I did not find any herb flavour. Just normal crumb fried chicken.
The chicken espetada is one of their signature dishes and looks amazing! It's basically a hanging chicken skewers dish. We took spicy rice and French fries as sides for it. The chicken pieces were juicy and succulent but they did lack flavours and were quite bland. The rice quantity was very very small and tasted average.
Pocket pinch-- 1900 INR for two. They levy an extra 10% service charge apart from the 18% gst.
Overall-- keeping in mind the price they charge, I expected better food quality. But still I would give then another visit to try their famous colorful mutton burgers!

Barcelos was an experience never to be repeated. The service was good but the food was inedible. A simple pita wrap was an epic disaster. Soggy, with dry sad chicken cubes spilling onto the tray, not a hygienic way of serving, the limp lettuce and smear of taziki detracted rather than enhanced it.   
The picture says it all.

I would count Barcelos under one of the more disappointing dining experiences I‚Äôve had. 
It may be attributed to fact that it had just recently opened when I had dropped by for lunch in the middle of a shopping spree at Acropolis, as the recent reviews are not as discouraging. 
We were excited to check out the new restaurant but right from the lack of proper air conditioning to hardly any patrons- it did not give us a good start. Coming to the food, the 4 veg mini burgers dish we ordered was tasty and a good choice off an elaborate menu. The variety of hot sauces on the table added a little kick to meal as well. One observation - the name ‚Äúmini‚Äù may indicate otherwise, but the burgers were regular sized and one would be suggested to order accordingly. 
However, what cannot be ignored is the glacial pace of service and absolutely cold and stale Veg Platter that we were served. The steward was gracious enough to recall that plate of food unfit for consumption. 
The pricing is steep and the portions do not correspond to them. 
I wouldn‚Äôt willingly revisit the place anytime soon, despite the lure of a dedicated sangria menu.

As far as the essence of portugal is concerned, this place undoubtedly the best of all in town!

So on Saptami we had Flame Grilled Chicken PeriPeri, Cheesy Chicken Espatada, Chicken Picante and Chicken Trinchando Sizzler... Among all, Picante was my favourite, full of cheese; ultimate softness to go with spiced rice-yummmmmmmmm

But to review this place, I have to go catergorically

I guess, this place needs to improve in that most important aspect compared to the pocket pinch

We ordered Grape fruit Punch , Chicken Wings , Grilled Chicken Pita and Chicken Espatada . 
The mocktail was awesome, 
Chicken wings were good but some pieces were hard.  
Grilled Chicken Pita was too much spicy, but tasted good.
Chicken Espatada was also good but they do not have anything extra ordinary in taste other than the grape fruit punch .
Service was good though . They charge 28% tax . (Service tax+ gst)

Its located in the top floor of Acropolis Mall. 
Nice ambience with nice food.
We ordered Grape fruit Punch , Chicken Wings , Grilled Chicken Pita and Chicken Espatada . 
The mocktail was awesome, 
Chicken wings were good but some pieces were hard.  
Grilled Chicken Pita was too much spicy, but tasted good.
Chicken Espatada was also good but they do not have anything extra ordinary in taste other than the grape fruit punch .
Service was good though . They charge 28% tax . (Service tax+ gst)

The ambience was perfect and the server's were so helpful in choosing the dishes. The food was lovely. We had the spicy chicken wings which were grilled to perfection. For main course we had the family meal which consisted one whole grilled chicken, two regular sides and drinks. The spices on that grilled chicken were singh and tasty. For dessert we had the chocolate titanium and it was simply divine.

Chicken is something its very easy to prepare but a little lack of precision can ruin the plate. Well if you fonder perfectly cooked chicken, juicy and fleshy you are looking at the right place.

Before getting down to the numbers, let me highlight some special dishes :-

I must recommend the ,

1. Chicken espetada. 

2. Peri Peri chicken (one half with skin)

3. Also, the deserts are painted in the plate, with a delicate palate.

(I am not kidding check the images)

Like Tiramisu, Cheese Cake...

Lets start with the hard part :-

A judge of the palates :- 5/5

Chicken is perfectly cooked. Skins crispy on the outside juicy in-side not too fall-off not too dry. 

They have specialties in highly technical dishes. Which i appreciate hats of to the chef.

A hunger of sight :- 5/5

Plating is marvelous. I am simply awed by the plating of there deserts especially.

Very simple but elegant.

A judge of the environment :- 5/5

A perfect roadside view of ancient Europe. Will make you feel that you are sitting amidst a busy street of Portugal.

A judge by the pocket :- 3.5/5

Its a bit expensive. But i will buy it.

I definitely, recommend this place.  

Ohh... wait a minute, did i mention the Brownie on Ice-cream.¬†
No I forgot... :P

I really like the ambiance and service...pocket pinch is reasonable too but Barcelos has a long way to go when it comes to food. The old menu was good and the new one is impressive too. However, the taste of the food failed to satisfy the taste buds. 

We had ordered a Chicken soup, Penne pasta in white sauce, Herb crusted fish and Mozzarella sticks. 

The chicken soup smelled slightly of raw chicken. The mazzarella sticks had so less cheese that they looked hollow with no filling. The quantity of white sauce in the pasta was disappointing and the dish tasted bland. The herb crusted fish tasted okay though.

Had high hopes about this place but was disappointed. Hopefully they will work on their culinary skills.

Had wanted to visit Barcelos for a long time and finally did so for a Saturday lunch. We were seated in a comfortable spot overlooking the Gitanjali Stadium. The ambiance is good. The staff were extremely hospitable and polite. The service is prompt & professional. 
5/5 for the cheerful and accommodating staff. 
5/5 for ambiance & decors
4/5 for overall food experience. We ordered the following :
Lemon Chicken Portuguese soup - 3/5

Non veg kebab platter - 2/5 it was too hot & spicy and had us literally crying because of its rich spices. An unexpectedly disappointing starter thus. We then explicitly told them to make the rest of the dishes LESS SPICY. 

Garlic butter fish-5/5 this dish was cooked to perfection in all the items-rice, veggies and fish. 

Cheese chicken espateda- 3.5/5 this was their signature hanging dish with fries & colesaw. The chicken kebabs tasted good but the chicken was a bit chewy

Full Chicken - 5/5 this was the best dish according to me.4 Absolutely well cooked tender chicken peices, each portion was a big chunk of solid grilled chicken. Very fulfilling and thumbs up for this item. 

Chicken picantte- 5/5 this was another of their tasty signature dish...consisting of thick solid chicken wrapping up a  cheesy filling. Very well cooked and nicely presented with sides grilled veggies & wedges. 

Molecular drinks- 3.5/5  top class presentation, tastewise okay not so awesome. Hey rosy had ice in excess

Presentation & food garnishing-5/5

Overall a nice and food indulgent weekend experience. The ambiance & pleasant staff hospitality are worth mentioning .Prices are bit on the higher side. I would want to revisit, for their grilled chicken peri peri dish. However if you are visiting for the first time  do mention your level of spicy quotient. Too much or too less may spoil the taste.

"Barcelos" - this Portuguese themed restaurant was residing in my wishlist since ages and after hell lot of hindrance I finally made a landing in the deliciousness. 
Instead of adding some more adjectives to the decor of the restaurant or describing about how conveniently this is positioned , let me jump straight to my and everyone's point of interest 'FOOD'. 
Enticed by the ecstatic reviews of their Peri Peri specialities, we ordered 
#Peri Peri Chicken Wings - 4 moderately sized chicken wings were served in a black platter. They were spiced up to exactly what we instructed the attendant. They were juicy, delicious and satisfactory to our taste buds. A great start for the evening. 
Next we ordered :
#Mini burgers 2 chicken 2 mutton with french fries and mashed potatoes - This multi-coloured platter was a bloom to eyes and gloom to taste. They were nothing but ordinary and quite bland union of meat-lettuce-bread & sauce, though the mutton ones were a bit better than the chickens. Mashed potatoes also lacked the creaminess. A bad end of a good start. 

Overall, an okayish experince. Although, I would love to visit this place again and try out some other dishes to change my conception. 

P.S. I noticed in some reviews that people were complaining about charging an extra service charge alongside GST. All you have to do is tell them that you're not willing to pay the service charge and they'll issue a fresh bill omitting the charge. üòä

We're kind of in a fix trying to write down the experience here; it was definitely not bad, but at the same time, failed to leave a mark. The decor and service is par excellence, but the food was somewhat barely average. We had:

1. Barcelos Special Peri Peri Chicken - 2.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[The breast piece could have been a little kore tender (though the waiter did his best to make us understand that the meat breast piece is always tougher than the leg piece). The sauce was more superficial, and the meat inside was bland meat. The mash would have done with a little more butter]

2. Lamb Chops - 2.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Again, the dish was pretty bland or "incomplete" the moment the barbecue sauce gets cleaned off the meat. It was a lot of peas (as sides) compared to the amount of meat]

3. Oreo shake - 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Vanilla ice cream made the shake thicker in consistency, but still failed to hit the spot. Still better than many oreo shakes around town]

The decor and service is a definite 5‚≠êÔ∏è. Though they charged a 10% Service Charge on the bill, we liked the fact that the personnel attending the table quickly acknowledged it being "optional" (on pointing it out), and presented us with a fresh bill without service charge. 

Overall, I'd say the place is a tad bit pricy compared to the quality of food being served. The only thing worth there would be the bottomless beverage, where a glass of cold drink, purchased once, can be refilled unlimited time. A 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è, just above average experience.

Reading a lot rave reviews about their peri peri speciality, landed here on a weekend.
Hospitality was very top notch but well it was a little cold, the centralised ac literally froze us where we sat down, near their famous street painted wall.
Menu has a lot of specialities and they boast of being the 1st sangria bar in the country.
Ordered their featured molecular kiwi cooler, the catch being dry ice making it smoke on ur table. Starter was a light peach chicken salad, light, sweet with lettuce and eggs and chicken, cleansed the palate, set the mood.
Followed by was the lamb chops which was the best dish of the day served with couscous and peas side, the lamb was succulent and easy while the couscous filled you. Next was the peri peri chicken sizzler which although being their favourite really put me off,served with non descript yellow rice, the veggies were downright near to burned and not at all flavour, the chicken rolls were again a downer, under seasoned. Hoped for a better sizzler.
The table had these four bottles of peri peri in varying degrees, it saved the day at this point.
The biggest downer then was the billing which after GST we thought includes the service charges. Not only did they charge that extra service charge, their was this extra beverage charge although the only thing consumed was a non alcoholoc kiwi cooler. Taxes of over 500 bucks really pinchs your pocket.
Well it was one expensive meal for the taxes but kudos to the service team, you were excellent.

Today on my birthday I had my lunch with my girlfriend at this restaurant which was long in my wish list.
First of all the ambience is amazing.One will definitely fall in love with the ambience instantly.
We tasted garlic basa fish with rice ,along with peri peri 1\4 chicken and the signature chicken espeteda.
Chicken espeteda:The showstopper of today.We opt for french fries with mayo dip and herb rice as two sides among the 4 side dishes available as option.Hanging skewer in front of you.Wat else you need.It tasted awesome.Absolutely delicious.Chicken pieces were a bit hard but they were perfectly cooked with right amount of spice.This dish is a highly recommended absolutely a must try.
1/4 th chicken:The only dissapointing dish of today.Chicken portion was very much chewy and it was not at all good.Lacked proper seasoning.
Grilled fish with rice:Basa fish was cooked to perfection.It had right amount of crust and it was succulent and soft from inside.It was served along with rice and grilled veggies.This dish is also highly recommended.
Coming to staffs they are very much friendly and helpful.Chicken espeteda was redone by the staffs as it become a bit cool as we were busy in finishing other dish.
Conclusion:-
Ambience:4.5/5
Staffs:5/5
Food:3.8/5
Quantity:3.5/5
Price is a bit on the higher side.
Overall a very good restaurant to have date.

A nice place to chill on a summer noon, to make yourself warm on a winter evening and to feel the romance of a rainy afternoon. A wide view of the Gitanjali Stadium through its glass wall gives it an added glamour. You will surely fall in love with Portuguese food here.

1. Black Pepper Chicken
2.Chicken Trinchando Sizzler
3.Grape juice
4. Caipiroska (Vodka cocktail)

Good food and great place to visit for a long chat with friends. The cocktails are especially worth mentioning. Located in Acropolis, the place boasts of a large place. The backs of the chairs are not so comfortable. You may want to sit on the sofa to avoid the chairs. I loved the peri peri chicken. The taste was great. For mains, we ordered the chicken sizzler with humus and tenderloin steak. An unusual combination, the humus went perfectly with the continental chicken sizzler.¬†
I am docking off one point for the value for money quotient but I understand that the location is giving the price.

I visited this place yesterday for a light snacks since I had heard about their very unique concept of colourful burgers.
Unfortunately I was highly disappointed with the food.
We had ordered a black burger and a red burger along with potato wedges and grilled vegetables. The black burger was extremely dry. The red burger was better in that respect. But what turned me off completely was the chicken inside. It was extremely stiff and chewy. Even the grilled vegetable salad wasn't up to the mark as the baby corn had dried up. The only good thing were the potato wedges as they were really crunchy and hot and went very well with the dip.
The ambience was good. The place wasn't crowded at all hence we got our seats as soon as we entered.
The only plus point was the prompt and efficient service. 
The place is indeed overpriced and the food not at all worth the money.

My experience in Barcelos was a good one. I liked their food. I had a grilled chicken which was perfectly done and succulent along with a chicken starter that had olives inside them. We went  during the full day happy hour on Monday and I got a 1:1 on the pitcher of beer that we ordered so it was total value for money. The ambience was nice and the space is large. My one complaint, and the reason for the drop in rating, was that the AC was not cool enough.

Went for lunch with my friend... The ambience and the set up is nice.. The restaurant was almost empty..The staffs were well mannered.. The food menu is quite good and attractive. We ordered for a Chicken and pears salad, it was good not that great because the dressing was not that prominent maybe the balsamic was little less if added a few drops more the taste would have been different. The Black Burger and the Red Burger was good, the breads were fresh, but the cocktails were overpriced in terms of the quantity. Overall the experience was nice except for one thing, nowadays when GST has been implemented then why "10% SERVICE CHARGE"??? I mean what for?? That needs to be removed.. or else everything was nice.....
There can be a second visit only if SERVICE CHARGE is omitted...

Had a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with some authentic Portuguese dishes. I can not comment much about the authenticity but food quality is not bad, quantity is bit less. The stuffs are helpful and courteous, interior is pretty attractive. Chicken olive and Trinchado rice was really different.

Had a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with some authentic Portuguese dishes. I can not comment much about the authenticity but food quality is not bad, quantity is bit less. The stuffs are helpful and courteous, interior is pretty attractive. Chicken olive and Trinchado rice was really different. Overall it is good experience, would like to try some of their other items too in future.

Burger was not that good in taste.. the mocktails were awesome.. !! Their signature chicken was quite good but was a bit undercooked.. !! An average place.. though ambience is very good..!! Quite expensive and not worth the cost..!!

I was also went last Saturday evening with her . Rahul was there to taking care for us . Mom was so much satisfied for his excellent service . Again he suggested all our food . And really it was lovely . 
He was suggested for us Chicken Olivet for the starter and for the Main course Grilled Salmon . The Chicken Olivet was very juicy and Tangy in taste . The best was Grilled salmon . We really enjoyed ..

Good food and fine ambience makes it a nice one to spend quality time. The staff is friendly and guide you well on orders. The food is good and proportioj- decent. We had ordered the non beg platter,  spaghetti with meatballs and fish grill. Like the food. A bit on the higher side,  so picket pinch is sizeable.

The place just made the day better! The moment I walked in it felt great.. A sigh of relief!  The place looks just perfect.. It has three different sections for seating. Coming to the food, we ordered Herb crusted chicken, Chicken wings and Cheesy chicken Espetada. The first one was something not very usual and tasted good with just the required amount of crispness. Chicken wings could have been a little more juicy though it was good for a go.  The last one just took my heart away! The perfect blend of chicken cheese and kabab was the Espetada. It is often called the hanging dish and the name justified. One should definitely give it a try.  Service was great and courteous.  The only thing which brought a mark of may be a bad impression was the extra service charge which was levied on the bill despite GST.  One doesn't expect that from such a dignified place. Though on lodging a complain we were produced a new bill with just GST. 
Thank you :)

Having had a place like Nando's on my favourites list, i went in with high expectations only to be disappointed to a great extent. Normally i would order a chicken espetada but this one rare occasion i had to go vegetarian and ordered the veg one instead.. came with two gigantic cubes of paneer that simply had no flavour or spice inside but was just a big block of bland paneer. The burgers were served with the espetada so by the time we had that, it was cold. More so the breads, though of interesting colour felt seemingly dry. The the chicken burger had no patty in it but just a slice of chicken.Last time i checked, burger joints served burgers with patty and didn't go Mc or KFC on them.  Peri peri sauces have spicy flavour and are generally thick in texture.. these however, too liquidy and felt off for some reason. The kit ka·π≠ shake was nice however. Over all, not so satisfied.

So this review actually combines snippets from my visit here twice. I visited Barcelos first sometime in 2016, shortly after it opened up at Acropolis. Barcelos is one of the less crowded restaurants at Acropolis and it's truly amazing that people haven't really opened up to the idea of Portuguese and African cuisine yet. Kolkata serves a myriad of cuisines and we can certainly accommodate Portuguese and African in that list. 
The decor is simple and chic, the restaurant gives you a sense of space where you can hang around with your friends for a while. 
Now the fare served here relies largely on a selection of Portuguese sauces, namely Peri Peri sauce. They shuttle between four varieties if peri peri. The mild peri peri is do-able; I tasted the hot ones and they can surely burn your lips. The food served here uses one of the four sauces and the spice quotient is well explained by the servers. 
We have tried the chicken salad (it was plain boring), chicken breast and Peri Peri Black Magic Burger during our first visit. The chicken breast came with a side of grilled veggies (my health conscious friend opted for it). The chicken breast was tender, moist and nicely done. The clear winner however, was the burger. The burger consisted of a thick breast of grilled chicken done with moderately hot peri peri sauce, egg, mayo, cheese and pineapple wrapped in a par of fancy looking black buns. The burger was yummilicious. The accompanying fries were crunchy and complimented the burger well. The dinner ended with Tiramisu, but truth be told, I have had much better Tiramisu elsewhere. 
The second visit was more to get chilled beer post a Saturday work out. The food ordered were Chicken Espeteda and Chicken Trinchando Sizzler. The Espeteda is a fancy looking dish with hanging skewers of chicken, bell peppers and onions, served with two sides (you can choose your sides). Frankly, it's quite akin to a chicken kebab stick available at some Indian restaurants and save the fancy presentation, there's little wow factor involved. However, the sizzler was a stunner. There were three decent sized chicken breast pieces, served with rice, veggies and a sauce. The sauce was superb; I can go back simply for the sauce. The chicken was nicely coated in all the spices which lend the chicken a quite delectable flavour. The dish is a far cry from the sizzler served at Park Street and it certainly needs to be tried once. It can truly excite you. 
Service is decent, a tad bit slow though. The prices are moderate and the place can give you a welcome respite if you are tried of having Fajitas or Oriental at the neighbouring restaurants.

This place is a close imitation of one of my favorite fire grill places to eat Chicken with Peri Peri sauce..... you guessed it right "Nandos"!! It was a good experience with a nice ambience and food wasn't pricey too. I don't know somehow I keep comparing this place with "Nandos", although I try real hard not to. Their Peri Peri sauces are good but it definitely can be better. Overall a nice place to eat your fire grilled chicken with some beer on a Friday night.

It's always great to be here!! I have been twice here and intend to visit more to try all that they have to serve.

Chicken Espetada : we ordered French fries and spicy rice as the two side dishes with it. It was lovely. The skewed chickens were tender and delicious.

Chicken picantte : this was a chicken breast and it had a filling. Side's that we ordered were mashed potatoes and fried veggies. This was yummy and tad dry, not on the juicy side.

Fish skewers: a total of five fish chunks were served with a dip. This was finger licking good.

For drinks we had ordered beer and appletini..
Appletini is a vodka that they served with lime and Apple juice. I loved it very much.

Located in Acropolis mall,Barcelos is a restaurant which specialises in portuguese and continetal food.We had heard a lot about this place so we ended up visiting it for lunch one day, we ordered the famous chicken mini burgers which are a platter of coloured (red,white,black,brown) mini burgers which are flavourful and served with fries.The 4 mini burgers along with the fries were quite filling for two of us,for drinks we ordered the Kiwi Cooler which was a perfect spectacle of molecular gastronomy with all of the liquid nitrogen and tasted equally refreshing and then came the five ingredient sangria which was also very attractive and flavourful.
The atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasing and a part of the seating offers a city view and the decor is also impressive with a smoking room resembling the london phone booth and the world map on the wall.The only drawback I found was that the staff were not at all well informed about the current offers and were quite clumsy.

Introduction of Sangria and New food items at Barcelos!

This was the second time I was attending a bloggers meet at Barcelos (Kolkata) over food tasting session. I missed the sizzler launch tasting session few months back for some unavoidable reasons. But this time it was tad different from the previous food tasting session which I attended, since here we dealt with Sangrias, something which very few can ignore! The Kolkata outlet of Barcelos¬†has recently acquired their permanent¬†liquor¬†license. And they have decided to up their game by adding not one but twenty one new flavors of¬†Sangria. I was privileged to be among the very few city bloggers who got a chance to preview this launch. We were shown the art of Sangria making and we tasted some of those awesome Sangrias which were freshly prepared right in front of us. I have always loved Barcelos and with this recent launch they have given me enough reason to fall in love with this place, yet again. Today the modern Indian is well-read, well-traveled and therefore has the capability to appreciate the tastes of various global cuisines. And it has been kept in mind while launching the new food items this time. It has brought flavors from across the world starting from Spain to New Zealand to Brazil so that their patrons can get a global taste sitting right here in their city of joy! New additions to the food menu include dishes like Portuguese Corn Soup, Mozarella Cheese Cigar, Arenccini, Chicken Olivet, Herb Crusted Fish and Risotto with Grilled Salmon just to name a few. I will describe few of these dishes which I tasted at this tasting session, besides the amazing Sangrias which honestly impressed me loads!

After a long time finally gave it a try. First of all d staffs r really courteous, d ambience is good n d food is awesome. We tried d herb crusted chicken in starters, where 6 pieces of chicken strips were served with barbecue sauce n it was pretty good. Tried d muddled pineapple n white peachy sangria in d cocktail section. I liked d white peachy, which  was served with chunks of peach. Finally to d main course, where i got confused. One of their staff helped us out n we went for chicken trinchando sizzler. It came with a side dish which contained cubes of chicken, bell pepper, olive n was a bit sour for my taste. 
Finally came d in-house coconut icecream n its a must try. Its a scoop of coconut flavoured icecream with chunks of coconut in it n its really delicious!!
They charge a service charge of 10%, which is a bit on d higher side in my opinion, bt then again all d fine dining restaurants r charging dat including Chili's, asia kitchen, etc.
Overall a must try!!!

And it was totally worth it. Extremely well behaved & friendly staff who helps you with the menu & takes feedback on every item you taste. The look & feel of this place is mindblowing. So is the food. We ordered 1/2 chicken platter with 2 sides along with fresh lime soda & black forest ice cream. Delicious food which will make you crave for more. It is bit pricey but never mind.. all good things come at a price!

My Review : 4.5/5.0

I live in Bangalore , and all my kolkata friends had been gushing about this wonderful place all year, so during my visit last December , I decided to visit this place¬† with my cousins.
It is in Acropolis Mall, specialized in Portuguese cuisine. One of the main reasons behind it's popularity is that it is first of its kind in kolkata. The place is small, but quite classy.¬† We had ordered few popular items like Chicken Espetada (it is like one hanging dish, specialized one), Chicken 1/4 steak (yummy starters with chicken and potato), Grilled Fish sizzler (treat for bong fish lovers like me), Peri Peri Chicken Sizzler (smoking hot and spicy sauce), Hot Chocolate Brownie (yum dessert) and 
Cheesy Chicken Fries (yum). We had also ordered one drinks which had dry ice giving it a smoky feel (not able to recall name) and classic mojitos
Overall good experience !!!

First time we've visited Barcelos for a Sunday lunch,  Ordered draught beer, red wine based sangria cocktail, French fries, chicken ceaser salad, chicken sizzler with hummus..There were 4 varieties of Piri Piri sauces also which I liked. The ambience was great if you want to enjoy a sumptuous meal in not so noisy environment, I personally loved the decor. The food items were mentioned properly in the menu, also those were clarified clearly by the service person. Next time I want to try pita wraps, mini burgers, chessy alfredo pasta..:)

So, gave this place a visit yesterday. We made the mistake of ordering the appetizer and the main course together without tasting the food first. The service was quick. Rather too quick. Now, because they promptly brought out the food and we were hungry, we thought this was our lucky day. Unfortunately, we couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. The herb crusted chicken was strictly okay and the dip they provided lacked enough zing to cut through the richness of the cutlets. The French Fries served with them had also gone cold and hence lacked the crunch and texture that is the distinguishing characteristic of a good French Fry. Average for the price, but still forgivable. However, more horrors were in store for us! The chicken thigh and onion appetizer we tried next was appalling, lacked proper seasoning and we were shocked to find that the chicken pieces that were served to us were cold and stale. Now since we had ordered everything together, the rest of our food had arrived. So, we moved on to their signature hanging chicken skewer dish, and although it was cold like all their other dishes and accompanied by under seasoned potato wedges, compared to the course before it, it was redemption. However, when we took a bite of the cold chicken steak next, we weren‚Äôt too surprised that the meat was dry, extremely salty and way overcooked. Probably it was stored for a long time, hence the meat got so tough and there was absolutely no crispiness in the soggy skin either. Nevertheless, this dish had one redeemable quality. The spiced rice served with it. Credit where credit is due. It was really good. Moving on, our final course was the Peri Peri Chicken sizzler. This was a one of a kind dish. I have many fond memories of sizzlers of various flavours and types. But what tied all of them together was that the food served was sizzling hot. Forgive my pun. It was a ‚Äòsizzler‚Äô per se, as the charcoal underneath was still hot and some of the sauce was bubbling as a result. Yet, this was a first for me as the same delectable spicy rice above it and the once again rotten pieces of chicken were completely cold and so were the undercooked vegetables served with it. This was a dish where the main protein had gone so rancid that we could not complete it. And finally, although not a rant about quality and quantity which were obviously under par, what was also a bitter pill to swallow was that this restaurant charges 28% tax on the bill. 18% GST and 10% service charge on the untaxed amount. If the food was delicious and memorable, maybe then the extra 10% would have been justified, but for now it isn‚Äôt. In conclusion, I was extremely disappointed because I was hoping my first tasting of Portuguese food would be much better. I hope they resolve their quality control issues because, to stand out amongst a crowd of Asia Kitchen and Chilli‚Äôs in Acropolis Mall, which are reputable and trusted brands, the basics must be spot on. And with increasing overhead and cut-throat competition in the hospitality service sector, only the most nimble, observant and attentive will survive.

This is a nice place with good food and ambience.
Went there in the evening so didn't order full course dinner. We had the Signature Peri Peri black burger and their signature chicken tossed in sauces. The black burger was a first for me and it was very delicious. And they also give you four options for the sides to choose from. We chose the potato wedges and grilled vegetables for the sides. The potato wedges we're good and the dip, amazing.  However we didn't like the grilled veggies since they were a bit too undercooked.But  The chicken again was very tasty and 1/4 is enough for two people if you aren't having proper lunch/dinner. We also wanted to order their in house ice creams but unfortunately it wasn't available then. So overall it's a good visit.

Located on the 4th Floor of the Acropolis Mall this is the sole Barcelos outlet in the city. There is a wide assortment of food to choose from and most of the items tried are decent enough. The flame grilled chicken was excellent and should definitely be tried on a visit to this place.This place serves Portuguese cuisine which is a welcome addition to the city. Ambiance is great and the place has got a positive vibe to it.Seats are also comfortable, pricing was reasonable and the staff were also courteous and well mannered. Overall the place can definitely be given a try.

Well previously looking at its reviews I felt somewhere this place is Underrated.But my confusion went away as I myself visited this place today.They serve Portuguese food.To be honest we were warmly welcomed by some courteous staffs.And I also admit that the ambiance of the place is also extraordinary.Moving on we ordered Chicken wings,1/4 Peri peri Chicken,Chicken espetada.All dishes were served within a very short time.I was very happy.Chicken wings were tasty.The other two were utter disappointment.Chicken pieces of espetada were literally as hard as rock.It would break someone's head if you throw them.Next the 1/4 Peri peri Chicken which was also not cooked properly.It was a whole chicken breast platted very nicely to make our mouth water.But as soon as we took a bite we realized that the dish is a complete bluff.Sorry to say I didn't expect that atall.And anyway I didn't collect much strength to order any burger dish or desert further. Amidst all these while my friend and I was trying to take pictures of that exclusively decorated dish called Chicken Espetada, one staff (wearing specs)came rushing and started serving the food on our plate without even asking our permission.And to me it was extremely rude of him to behave in such a snobby manner despite of noticing that we were taking pictures of the dish.However I rated 2.5 accepting the fact of it's looks,some decent staffs and also remarkable decoration of the dishes.But if I had to mark on basis of food I wonder what I would give coz I expected a lot more from this place.

Lastly I request the Management to ask the chefs to take time and cook the food.Flavours are good,decoration is nice but the only problem is of cooking.Give adequate time to preparations.That's ALL.

I love Barcelos, as is obvious from the rating.
It's located in Acropolis, and is my favorite restaurant there.
The ambience is great. I don't remember the decor in details, but it was all wonderful to have around.
I ordered a cheesecake shake and a platter of mini burgers. The burgers resembled Krabby patties and were simply perfect in terms of taste and appearance. They were served with crisp fries and a yummy dip.
The shake was pretty good too. But there was a miscommunication. Apparently our waiter heard blueberry cheesecake instead of cheesecake shake? He insisted I ordered a cheesecake (I didn't) and seemed annoyed to have to take it away, so minus half for the service I experienced.
A bonus is their varieties of Peri Peri sauce available at each table. I tried each one without shame, and they were, forgive the pun, awesomesauce.
I'll go back as soon as I save enough to be able to!

Visit1: 1st July 2017

I visted Barcelos after several reviews from my friends, trying for the first Portuguese food was indeed yummy and worth a try!!
The menu is sumptous and cannot be concluded in a single visit.
I tried chicken thighs roasted and Barcelos Signature Chicken roast 1/2 with one otato wedges, Virgin Mojoto and black forest & chocolate ice cream the food is worth a mention.
 
The prices are reasonable however due to GST final prices go a bit higer the entire platter pinched 1600+, however I would come back again to try the sizzlers and burgers next time!! Until then this place is indeed worth a try!!

A good Portuguese flame grill resto-pub in Acropolis mall, Kasba.
Enjoyed the ambience.
Loved their food.
Lover their own brewed draught beer.
Got some offers in 4 glasses of draught beer from i.little app and grabbed it.
Ordered 1/2 Grilled chicken with peri peri sauce.
It was really good.
They served french fries with chicken as a complementary side dish.
Beer was also well brewed.
Like to visit again.

Went for a weekday lunch. Have been wanting to try Portuguese cuisine since they opened in this city. We had the 4 chicken mini burgers of different colour breads and chicken espatada. The espatada is amazing, something new to try out. The burgers were good. Would love to try out more of their menu.

Being a Portuguese food lover ,specially the peri peri preparations, Barcelos was in my list for a long time since it started operations in Kolkata. Due to the unavailability of Nandoz which was the first restaurant that introduced me to the Portuguese food, I was expecting to have a good time here like my time at nandos which would seem like the perfect alternative.

And to my dismay I was disappointing like anything.

The menu first of all has a lot of sangria options to choose form, which are basically different mix and match of cocktails.
Not wanting to have alcohol, I turned onto the food menu and ordered the house specials wings and chicken soup.
The wings were okayish. No where near the nandos one, but decent start. The soup was so tangy, I could not finish the entire thing. Had to soup(pun intended) chicken out of it.

Next up, the main course : Its why you would go to a Portuguese joint. The peri peri whole chicken.

We ordered for the veri peri which means it was 1 flovour below the hottest chicken flavour.

This disappointed me completely. The chicken felt like half grilled. The fine layer of peri peri crust which you normally associate with the while chicken was tasteless.

did not feel like ordering anything after this bad experience. could not complete the food also.

Price wise quite okay.
Ambience Nice.

Ambience, good..hospitality, good.... food quality, good... the only issue is the variety.. Although you get a wide range of pasta, the choice of appetizer is limited just as the choice of main course.. fishetarians like me might get a bit disappointed once they are done with surfing the menu that leaves you with just a couple of main dishes to choose from. Those who prefer chicken might be in a better position. Now the good part is, it draws less crowd than chilies, which results in faster service.

Food is very good. We had those colourful mini chicken burgers with mashed potatoes as a side and chicken wings with medium spicy flavours. The food is undoubtedly tasty and the presentation skills and ambience are also up to the mark. In dessert we had cheesecake with brownie and ice-cream. This was amazing in taste too but just felt that apart from other food items this desert, (with has a scoop of ice-cream ready to melt anytime) should be served on a normal plate and not on the wooden slab or whatever that's called. Presentation of desert was beautiful but it kind of got messy with the chocolate sauce and melted ice-cream. But overall I really recommend this place. I didn't have any drinks so I can't comment on that.

The waiter was courteous enough to recommend us some exciting dishes 
We had Peri Peri Chicken,chicken Espetada,chicken picante and in drinks...Brain Haemorrhage,peachy lemon iced tea, oreo shake and Heineken beer.

For starters, we ordered Drumsticks (9 pieces). The chicken was properly cooked and very juicy.

For the main course, we ordered Garlic Fish served with Paella Rice and Vegetables, 4 Chicken Mini Burgers, Cheesy Chicken Wrap, Family Meal Platter (for 4-6 people). Among all these dishes, the Garlic Fish was probably the best. The Basa Fish was well cooked and soft, the rice was just perfect. The vegetables, however, were terribly under-boiled. The beans and the baby corn tasted completely raw. The Chicken Wrap was okay. Nothing special about it. The Burgers were slightly dry.¬†

The Family Meal Platter had 8 pieces of Peri Peri Chicken and was served with 2 glasses of coke, one bowl of vegetables, and one bowl of paella rice. I have no idea why it's called a family platter for 4-6 people - it's barely enough for 3 people. There are probably just 4 tablespoons of rice. The vegetables had the same problem. They were under-cooked.

They served the Chicken Wrap and Mini burgers with a side of fries. The dip tasted pretty great but the fries weren't. For one, they hadn't peeled the potatoes. And judging by the amount of fries with each dish, they use one medium sized potato. Barely enough fries.

The ambiance is brilliant. No complaints. The staff is polite and courteous. However, they're slightly aloof. We had to holler 2-3 times on the average when we wanted something (water, napkins, new order, etc.)

Summing up, this place isn't bad. But it isn't great either. Items are terribly overpriced. I wouldn't have minded if the food was filling, but it wasn't.

Yesterday was my son's birthday. So went to Barcelos for lunch. It was an awful experience with all stale food. Even the salted vegetables were stinking and became sour. Even I found the waiters were not trained as much and when asked for the details of the dishes gave all wrong information. Worst place in Kolkata to have food. I would sincerely like to request the management to look into it. The same brand in Delhi Gurgaon region are happening places with very good food. 


After this experience..... Today something wonderful happened. 

It was really wonderful on your part to send us the cute cake. We all loved it. We will surely visit you soon. And it's great to see that the shops in Kolkata too are taking customer relationship management seriously. Good work.  Touched.

One of the four restaurants right at the top of acropolis mall.. barcelos have one of the largest restaurant chains in the world. The ambience is decent along with the old school wooden decor. Service was quick and good. We had two Portuguese cocktails -poncha Jura and Bermuda..both were typical fruit cocktails ,a bit on the sweeter side,but good nonetheless. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and peri peri grilled chicken as starters..mushrooms had been a tad bit undercooked. THe chicken was perfectly grilled and you have a choice regarding the spiciness of the peri peri sauce.in main course,we had grilled fish sizzler .The taste was average but the quality of fish was really good and once again,they really grilled it well.
Would recommend it for the peri peri chicken

I always wanted to be here and so I went on 10th of June with my family to Barcelos. I feel so sorry to say this,but there was not a single person to attend us. We were not provided even with the menu card.We were served water only once.We had no tissues and had to ask for them thrice ,after which finally they gave us some tissue. And everytime we wanted something,we have to call them and still the staffs were ignorant of us. I had high hopes from this joint but I was highly dissapointed. The food was overall good but the service was not at all satisfactory.

Almost everything on their menu is made of their own peri peri sauce. Hearing the good reviews from my friends, I came here to check it out. Ordered their signature dish which was the grilled chicken in peri peri sauce and it was quite bland, if I must add. Their sauces available with the dish, made the dish a little better but it still lacked the signature ingredient; the peri peri. Another point I must add, they charge service charge in their bill when an order has been passed by the Supreme Court clearly stating that service charge should not be charged and it is the customers choice how big a tip he wants to give to the people who have served him.

Though not a big fan of middle eastern cuisine, I have still visited this restaurant twice now.. Perfectly located at Acropolis Mall, this has added to the themed restaurant count in our City.. The ambiance is undoubtedly great, mind blowing decor.. We tasted their peri peri hottie burger out of curiosity! The color is definitely the star point but taste is class apart too! We had 1/2 chicken with 2 sides and chicken trinchado with rice which has it's pure Portuguese origin.. The pocket pinch was a bit high but the food makes it worth it..

These are the two must try dishes when you visit the place. It's‚Äã a bit pricey but the taste of the food makes up for it.

Barcelos was in my wishlist for a long time. I went there for lunch with my cousins. The decor is simple and minimalistic. We ordered the following:
Drinks: Bermuda, Poncha Jura, Ola, Tipo Tinto, Strawberry Basil Bajitos, Passion Fruit Caipirinha, Long Island Iced Tea, Traditional Portuguese Sangria and Classic Mojito. The drinks were very refreshing.
Food: Chicken wings(this had a very distinct flavour and is a must try), Pita with Baba Ganoush, Boneless chicken thighs with onion and pepper(I did not like it much), Fish kebab and 4 chicken mini burgers(this one is a must try).
There is a separate smoking room but they do not have a restroom so you have to go out of the restaurant in case you need to use one.
Food: 4/5
Decor: 3.5/5
Ambience: 4/5

When I opted for Barcelo someone told me "pachtaoge". And pachtaoge I did. The wanna-be-Nando's menu doesn't have the x-factor or any factor. Food is just food, which not acceptable anymore considering the variety and culinary innovation Kolkata is providing. The drinks are average. Compared to its nearby competitors like Hoppi & Chili's Barcelo's cocktail falls flat. The sangria's add ons do not hide the cheap wine they are made of. The "molecular" cocktails are, trust me, not even connected to molecular gastronomy. Even if I could turn blind towards the food and drinks, the service is 0.5/5. The ppl waiting on u do not have the slightest idea of what they r serving. They cannot make out the diff between peach & rose flavours. The third dish we order never arrived on the table (luckily not even in the bill). Coz the person taking the order forgot to place it in the first place. No serviettes on the table. The crockery seemed awkwardly vintage due to lack of maintenance. The decor is mediocre thanks to the their confusion between Spanish/Portuguese paintings & newspapers from indian-independance-era and London phone booth smoking room!

This place was in my wish list since long. So finally we decided to give it a try. BARCELOS named after a Portuguese town. It serves Portuguese and some continental delicacies. Ambiance adds on and decor is pretty cool, the world map, paintings, retro clock and the smoking room resembles the London phone booth.The dim lights were quite good.
Service was okayish and the person who was attending‚Äã us could not give us a proper detail on the offers which were going.

Coming to the food and drinks part:

KIWI COOLER: (4.5/5) Molecular Gastronomic preparation it was. I found this drink perfect for summer days. It was very refreshing and flavourful.

5 INGREDIENT‚Äã PORTUGUESE SANGRIA: (4/5) It tasted good

CHICKEN MINI BURGERS: (4/5) This place is famous for their coloured mini burgers, it comes in four colours red, brown, white and black. The burgers were meaty enough and we took it one sidded, which came with potato wedges (we found it saltless) and a dip. Red and Black were Mutton burgers. I found the Red one best among them. The colour of the burgers came from organic substances (it was not done artificially).
Peri peri sauces were available on the table from mild to spicy. The overall bill came for around 1450/-.
Would like to visit again to try out other dishes.

This restaurant is located in one of our favourite malls in Kolkata, hence we often end up having a meal at Barcelos.

Generally, the Non- Veg Burgers and Chicken preparations are good. However, more than once we were served overcooked dishes. I think they need to work upon the consistency a bit.

Overall, a good place to enjoy Middle Eastern cuisine.

I ordered 
1. Stuffed chicken kebab (2.5/5) - with an expectation that meat will be soft and cheesy ,as they mentioned the cheese -jalapeno stuffing ... But chicken pieces were very chewy and stuffing and quantity didn't amuse me...
2, Bercelo's¬† spl burger of four different variants Black and red with Lamb patty, and other two with chicken..with one side-Potato wedges ( 3.5/5) - burger buns tasted almost same and dry.. meat was stiff... Best thing served with it was four diff flavors of Sauces... Super peri and tangy lemon added actual taste in it....

Barcelos is located on the top floor of acropolis mall. It was in my visit list fr a quite long time. Finally i visited the place last week with a friend of mine.
Firstly the ambience of the place is very sophisticated i loved the decor. The staffs are cordial .
I tried the mini burger platter with one side. The side included fries. And a sauce. The burger came in 3 different colours red ,black, white, brown. But the brown was nt in stock so they gave us a choice to choose a burger and we choose the red one.
The burgers were too cute.
And the different burgers were different in taste.
I loved the red burger a lot. As it was a mixture of spices and great to taste. Taste of white burger i didnt like much.and black was ok type. So if i visit the place nxt tym i will definately go with the red burger.decoration of the platter was cute. And coming to the price. We paid around 650 ruppes fr the platter. So it is kind of expensive.
Yeah once in a while trying burgers and food is good in barcelose

The Alcoholic Mocktails are awesome..
Loved the place.
Planning to visit again very soon.

Great food and the ambience is all so great. Very quick service. The only thing that was wrong for me was that the French fries were not crisp enough.

Well I had some food coupons from little app and didn't meet a few of my close people for a long time so we decided to give this place situated in Accropolis mall a visit . This is really good place with some worth mentioning good people. It has a nice interior with comfortable sitting area even if you are in a large group. Also they has a old school telephone booth themed smoking area which gives this place another charm. They gave us two plates of chicken wings and a plate of fish kebab with nine pints of beer against our coupons. Both of the dishes gave some goosebumps‚Äã to our taste buds .apart from that we ordered a few drinks as well. And they gave us two more chicken wings as a complement. I would love to visit them again to check out their different delicacies from the menu.

We visited this restaurant on a hot summer afternoon on a Saturday, and we were excited to¬†try out this restaurant. ¬†We were pleasantly surprised by the¬†decor and the comfortable seats. The chicken wings that we ordered as appetizers were succulent, fresh and really made us crave for the main course. For the main course, we ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and the chicken peri peri¬†sizzler. The spaghetti was well made, though the meatballs could have been a little tastier. The chicken sizzler was flawless though. But the cake was taken by the Cucumber white sangria- I never knew that any alcoholic drink could be so refreshing.

I ordered the Arabic Mezze Platter. Very basic/almost below average food. They definitely need to learn how to make proper hummus. Nothing even remotely special to write about really. Delivery was prompt and so was the packaging. Maybe their other stuff is good but I'm not too keen on ordering from here again.

Reminded of Nandos. 

Just went for a good burger and fries! The burger was good, juicy patty as expected. Particularly liked the chicken with herbs and spices and the accompanying tangy tomato garnish. 

But I am disappointed with the fries. Too oily, underfried and unseasoned. Hence no 5 today

Had ordered online through Zomato,ofcourse, for a Half Chicken with two side dishes.

Firstly, the packing was horrendous.  It reminded me  of packing household materials through a Movers and Packers establishment. I had no idea, honestly,  that food could be packed in such a shabby manner. It does require a whole lot of effort to pack food so shabily that the food becomes inedible. 

The mashed potato was so severly mashed while packing that it could not be salvaged despite the most sincere efforts as it was oozing/spilling out from the alumunium foil in which it was sent. Had to literally scrape off the food from the foil leaving the better part inside.

The chicken roast or whatever they have named it was some rudely hacked pieces of chicken, boiled in hot water, grilled a little and dipped in their "secret sauce". It was completely tasteless.

The saving grace was the coleslaw which tasted like coleslaw. 

Am enclosing some pictures depicting the manner of packing food. The establishment should seriously consider the above feedback and work towards improving the same.

Good ambiance, comfortable seating and courteous staff. Food quality is pretty good. But it's certainly not value for the money. It's too expensive to be honest. We tried the chicken stir fry, chicken trincado with rice, chicken esparata and chicken steak. Tastes were  average. Chicken stir fry was good. They have choices for the kind of spices you like in each dish.

Have tired the infamous color burger. One word for it is "disappointment". Again its food for eyes not for the taste buds. And as you see the caesars salad there 4 chicken strips in total.  I had a good laugh after seeing the salad.

Wanted to try the burgers for a very long time and hence found myself at Barcelos this evening. For starters we ordered the grilled fish which was good, the fish fresh and the marination of very Peri sauce helped enhance its flavours. However, everything after that kind of went downhill. Hoping the starters would be a good experience as well, we ordered the chicken stuffed kebabs, but even though the chicken was soft and well-cooked, the flavours were flat and I would not  recommend it. We braved our way to the main course.... I ordered the Peri Peri Bloody Red...which was in one word 'a let down' (well three words). The bun was dry and the chicken not too juicy either. The side of grilled veggies too was not pleasing at all, the veggies being dehydrated. The peri peri chicken sizzler had less of chicken and more of vegetable mush. The rice too was uncooked. Regardless of the food, the staff were polite and competent at service. The ambience good. I would really request management to step up their game in terms of food, given the competitive scenario in the city at present. 
Lastly, the Portuguese sangria is definitely worth trying.

Good ambience. A perfect joint for friends and family. I went there with a friend excited to try out their mini burgers The food tasted even better than it looked. The grilled fish was mind blowing. The marination was perfect. For starters we had hummus n pita bread. This is the best hummus me n my friend have had so far in kolkata. There goes another thumbs up. The only downside was that the waiters don't really help you while choosing the dishes, as in explaining exactly how much would be enough for 2 people n etc, hence you would definitely end up ordering too much on your first visit. But we got it packed n savoured the rest at home. And it's too pricey for the amount you get, but good portugese dishes isn't something you'd get everywhere in the city.

Vastly enjoyed their fried chicken with various types of peri  peri sauce - sinful. And the berries cheese cake wound up a very satisfactory meal with vows on the part of our senior gang to roll up again soon. No one was a smoker but the little smoking cabin was specially cute and thoughtful. CHEERS.

Looking forward to a different experience , we decided to try out Barcelos (named after the Portuguese town of Barcelos). Mainly serving Portuguese and various Mediterranean delicacies, this joint is located on the fourth floor of Acropolis Mall. The decor is pretty nice, the illuminated world map on one of the walls being one of the real highlights of this place. The service is very good... The floor manager was very polite and courteous and the service attendants were upto the job. The place was pretty crowded but that did not deter them from performing well.
The food was good. We ordered a couple of molecular drinks like Kiwi Kooler, Berry Cucumber, Tangy Mango. The starters consisted of Stuffed Chicken Kebabs and Pear and Chicken Salad. For mains, we ordered Cheese Chicken Espetada, Grilled fish with rice and Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt dip.
The molecular drinks were amazing especially Berry Cucumber. Starters were ok.... Standard but nothing exceptional. The mains were good, especially the Espetada, which was in addition presented in a unique manner. The Chicken Cataplana went pretty well along with the yogurt dip. Another important bit to remember, when here is to use the various peri sauces that they have on the table, along with the food at an optimum. The four varieties of sauces added a tangy extra bit to the flavours and made the food more special to us.
In the end, for desserts, we ordered Tiramisu (an Italian delight) and Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream. Variety... Yes....Flavours... A big Yes. The desserts were impressive indeed.
A first visit that went pretty well. Hope to be back here for more soon.

Well.. I am sure many of you would differ with my rating for Barcelos.. But the fact is I didn't like the preparations. The place is nicely done. So ambience is good. Service is okay.. though I would say it can improve. I had ordered peri peri chicken...but honestly speaking I liked Nandos preparation more. It somehow tasted bland here. I didn't try the coloured burgers..so not sure how they taste. Overall I think it's a one time visit. There are much better options available in that mall.

Overall a moderate experience @ Barcelos.

Service was slow. Water wasn't served for the first 10mins. A couple of reminders helped. Tutti Frutti made us wait for 25mins.

Portuguese Chicken Lemon soup (check the name) tasted nice.

Greek salad was too little. A plate is not enough to feel the taste if two of you are out there. 7 to 8 shredded pieces of chicken.

The Sweet Fresh Lime Soda tasted nice and unique. It had a sweet fragrance which I have got nowhere till now. It was soothing.

The traditional South African Peri Peri Chicken, Super Spicy did not win my heart. My heart goes to Nandos.
The dish @ Barcelos tasted bitter in between.

Tutti Frutti was nice to finish off today's lunch.

Let me start by mentioning the point that if I've to judge this joint by it's food quality and ambience it's definitely a 4.5. What took away their points is service. And when i say service, i don't mean the attitude or behaviour of the waiters. They were all well behaved and very polite. What was lacking was expertise. They were messy to say the least. One of them even dropped Sangria on my friend while serving. Also they had no clue about the menu. If you had any questions regarding any particular dish or drink he'd run back to the chef or bartender and then come back. However, food was really good. The Chicken Picante and Espetada are a must try. The Sangria was also really smooth. One advice to the management, please hire more equipt waiters.

This isn't a complete review since I had a takeaway from this place...

So on a solitary and humid Kolkata summer night I decided to have a burger... Not in a mood for the typical mcdee I opted for this place which I have never visited before...

The chicken burger that I had ordered was promptly delivered without the protesting follow ups... The delivery guy was well mannered and friendly...

The burner had a juicy succulent chicken patty done to my taste and liking and with a lot of veggies...my only complaint is the accompanying complimentary juice wasn't delivered...I expect the management to take care in home deliveries...

Look out for this space for an update once I have visited this place in person and give a comprehensive review...

Tried Portuguese cuisine for the first time. The mini burgers were really good. Red and Black ones were of mutton and very tasty but the white one was of chicken and a bit flat in taste. The chicken peri peri sizzler comprised of tasty chunks of chicken and veggies but the taste of spices used seemed a bit peculiar. May be I need to develop taste for Portuguese spices. Berry cucumber cooler was very refreshing drink and presentation was nice. Service was quick.

We ordered two starters and a main course along with a cheese cake milkshake. Biggest challenge was to look into my girlfriends eyes and also not miss the match, haha! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1) cheese chicken fry something 
2) some chicken Trincado rice 
3) another chicken sides
4) cheesecake milkshake 

Overall, would visit again and jump into the grilled section.

Hello! Barcelos happens to be a one if it's kind of a restaurant that serves Afro Portuguese cuisine. I ordered Drum Sticks (4 pcs) & Chicken Trichando Sizzler. Both of the dishes were grilled to perfection and served with the correct amount of spice and specifications. The succulent chicken, the awesome complimentary side dishes were a treat to my senses. I am sure I would definitely come back to try out all what they have to order.

The food was shitty. They don't know how to cook french fries or even burger. I felt pukish after having the food. It's also costly. I could have had much better food with this amount of money. Will never ever visit the place again.

Did not like the food at all...the place seemed posh and all but the main attraction..the food was a downer. It was different but not tasty. Definitely will not give another shot. The only thing good about it was the decor and the mocktail.

We went there on 2nd apr'17 for the 1st time. Staff were courteous and gave us a warm welcome. We ordered periperi chicken sizzler, mutton kebab sizzler, mini chicken burgers and desserts like brownie, choco fondue with vanilla ice cream etc. Sizzler is not so tasty, quantity of chicken is very less compared mutton kebabs, also mini chicken burger had just 1 strip of chicken in it. Compared to the price i dont why the chicken quantity is so less. The most dissapointing part is they impose 10% service tax without informing customers..when challenged, they change the bill, i.e. always taking chances. You cant force customer on 10% service tax if he/she is not happy, moreover its not mentioned in menu card also. This same trick is used by chillies in acropolis mall also. Overall overpriced items with lack of quality as well as quantity, on top of that malpractice in bills.

Great ambience. Food equally good.We ordered chicken steak with two sides: fries with dip and smashed potato. Chicken was just cooked to perfection. The dip was one of the best that i had recently. Smashed potato had just the right amount of butter. We also had grilled trout sizzler and red meaty burger which was also very good. Overall a great place to hangout with friends with good music and great food!

I had been waiting to try out the Portuguese joint (only one, I believe) in the city.
Going by the reviews here, I did order a peri peri burger. However, I soon came to terms with reality and realised I should have ordered something mild.
Although the food here tastes great, I would like them to take down the spices a bit.
The oreo shake that I had is the best I've had in town.The ambience is amazing!

This is a tricky one. To start off, don't let the bad reviews scare you off. Experience the food for yourself. I say this because this place serves food that can be selectively palatable. It is not run-of-the-mill fancy cuisine that is adjusted to fit the Indian taste buds. The falafels were very tender and perfect as an appetizer. I ordered the vegetarian Pesto pasta salad, upon which a very helpful server pointed out that I might not find it worth my money if I have never tried and liked it before. I was not expecting it to be as authentic as it was. The combination of pesto, feta cheese, and sundried tomatoes was very refreshing. 5 stars for the salad. I also ordered the lamb burger. The points I would take away is for the disproportionate size of the burger roll to the lamb patty. For a roll that big I expected the patty to at least fill out the bread. It hurt a little because the patty was actually delicious and it was just gone in a few bites and I was left with the bread and lettuce. :( I was able to tell them that directly, however, when I was approached by the very kind chef for my opinion. It was a fantastic gesture on their part to accept praise and criticisms alike, and so graciously.

I do plan to return because their menu is fascinating and I would love to try some of the other things they have to offer. :)

A dinner outside home after a long time. Tucked away in a corner of the topmost floor on Acropolis Mall, Barcelos may not be as popular an option as Chili's and Asia Kitchen but food is undoubtedly good. Almost everything on their menu (except the desserts of course) is based on four variants of the Peri Peri sauce. You get to choose whether you want your food to be cooked in Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri, Very Peri or the Supa Peri. 

After seeing how hot the mild and supa peri were, we decided to order our food cooked in the other two sauces. First up, we ordered the Mutton Kebab based on Tangy Lemon. Very tasty, and quite unlike kebabs in other places. In most other places, mutton kebabs are almost reduced to a paste, but here you get the grainy bits in your mouth which I feel is a more authentic experience.

Main course was Half a chicken Steak with fries for me, and Garlic Fish with Rice for my friend. Both of these were cooked in Mild Peri. Again, good, both of these dishes. Amount is ample, easily fills you up. For desserts we had a Hot Choc Browni with Vanilla Ice cream. As expected, good. All this for around 1600. And yes, the average person will struggle to finish it all up. So value for money this place. That's why it gets a 4.5!!

A pretty awesome place to have a good meal with friends/family. We had the chicken platter in our starter and it was excellent, especially the leg pieces. Next, I had the white burger along with some good ol' JD and 100 Pipers and that was pretty darn good too. Prices are a bit steep but that's okay since the food is brilliant, the ambience is good and the staff is friendly. Will definitely return soon.

Tried Barcelona in acropolis mall  ..and thought the good was quite average. The look and feel of the place is very similar to Nando's the house of Peru Peru chicken. They had a mix of sauce in the table from mild to spicy. Has the stuffed checked kebab which was actually cold, when asked we were told it's served cold.  Honestly it tasted quite bland. The other starter we tried was the drumsticks which was good. We then went for the burger platter and the vegetarian burger. Though they had buns of different colours white black and even red, the filling seemed almost the same or so it seemed like. Tomato and mayonnaise being common in al the burgers. The decor was lively and service was good.

Very bad experience. Food is substandard but prices are very steep . Needs to improve a lot. Chicken pieces taste like stale meat and whatever dish you choose they taste all the same . Service also needs to improve and the crockery is pathetic . On being told about the crockery they said that since it is black in color so there are scratches . Better buck up

Great food,  Great ambiance and equally brilliant service. Don't know why some people have written negetively about Barcelos. Guess they should stick to their staple biryani and fried rice with chilly chicken!!!!  Their signature grilled chicken and espetada is something that any food lover can write bad about. Have really enjoyed a meal like this after a pretty long time.  Excellent service complements the food and ambiance. Keep it up Barcelos!!!!! Will definitely visit again!!!

The food here is good which is why it's a pity that unlike Chili's they don't do pork or beef dishes. They could at least do buffalo meat burgers.
Anyway, moving on I would give them a 4/5 for their efficient and quick service, decent value for money and good food. When I visited a few months ago they hadn't obtained their liquor license but now I believe they serve alcohol.
We ordered a portion of chicken wings which were juicy but we overestimated their degree of spiciness so we had to apply a smattering of their on-table peri-peri sauces do make the wings more fiery. The chicken espetada had boneless pieces of chicken breast hanging from a skewer in quite a theatrical manner. It wasn't anything extraordinary but wasn't bad either. The combo of 2 mutton and 1 chicken burger looked very attractive and interesting. The taste of the buns differed slightly with each other and the meaty stuffings in between them were delicious. The chicken stuffed pita bread was a bit boring to look at compared to their other dishes but the fieriness and juicy chicken more than made up for the boring presentation.
Overall I had a good time. I still wish they take some inspiration from Chili's and start introducing buffalo meat burgers. Recommended.

Being a sucker for trying out different cuisines, barcelos was a must visit. A bestfriend of mine decided to fulfill my wish by giving her birthday treat there. On entering, we found the place to be absolutely empty, there was a seating place outside which was quite cute, however we chose to sit inside. The place is done up in a simple yet beautiful way. We chose our desired seats and contemplated on our orders. The list was huge. The things we ordered were :
1. Oreo shake
2. Cheese cake shake
3. Three mini burgers - red, black and white with a side dish
4. Chicken Espetada with two sides

Both the drinks were really good. Especially the Oreo shake. I did not quite like the cheese cake shake, but my friend loved it. Now, coming to the most disappointing part, which were the burgers. I am a diehard burger fan and these burgers were a disappointment through and through. The buns were quite stiff and even after adding cheese, the black and the red burger did not impress me at all. The white burger however was good. The Espetada came with quite an innovative presentation, but the chicken pieces were really hard which was quite odd considering the reviews i had read about this dish described them as being soft. The taste was good though, but again nothing worth revisiting again.
The staff was polite, which is a good thing. We sat there for ages and they did not seem to mind at all. I believe the place has potential for improvement, but unless I hear raving reviews about it, I wouldn't go there anytime soon. Maybe the dishes we chose were bad, but for me it wasn't worth the money.

Went there recently with a delegation of 24 Thai representatives from DITP, government of Thailand, for lunch. We were impressed with the ambiance, their service and their food, and our Thai counterparts were surprised that Barcelos was not present in Thailand. Plating and presentation were uniquely different. Special mention must be made for their molecular mock tails, chicken espetada, bhekti and their grilled chicken. A must visit for people, who love great food in an equally great place!!!!

Coming to the food part as it is known for its grilled chicken... It really does it job.... We ordered 1/2 special chicken... It was great!! Indeed awesome taste..!! Though we were little disappointed with the pita ordered...not much happy with  the taste.... The sides - Potato wedges served with a dip was yummy...
And not to forget the desert.... It was delicious.. :) :)

Extremely disappointed in the food. We ordered a Greek salad, a chicken platter, two salmon dishes and a 1/4th chicken. 
The food didnt come out in order or on time even though the restaurant was visibly empty. The chicken on the platter was burnt, the salmon was dry and overcooked, even the accompanying risotto was chalky and under done. 
Even though the staff was friendly and hospitable, nothing could salvage the bad overpriced dinner my family and i recieved.

On the Christmas Day not following the trend of standing at a queue at almost all restaurants at Park Street this year I decided to drive my plans to other side of the city n enjoy the eveningüôÇ
I actually wanted to try some different cuisines but staff regretted for their limited food stock as they couldn't serve any of dish which I ordered. I was excited to have their "black burger", chicken espetada which seemed to be quite interesting looking at the menu book but we couldn't have. Having not served any of these dishes we then tried out Chicken Stir Fry and Chicken Trinchado with rice.Both the dishes were good at quality n taste.The interiors are also pretty well designed and clean too. But the service was not prompt,I know the restau was filled with Christmas crowd but we had to wait more than 30 mins for each dish to b served. Would taste those dishes later someday.
This review would b sufficient on my first visit to the place.
Location: Barcelos is located at the top most floor of Acropolis Mall that is just above the mall food court.

This could be potentially a great place but is not. The food is pretty standard for all their outlets however the  floor manager was making a mess of things today. The staff is courteous and makes great recommendation. Decor is very global though the framed newspaper is a great touch. Some of the pictures on the walls are not hung straight .

Went here for lunch to celebrate the birthday of a very special friend! We've been meaning to visit it for a while and we're super excited to finally go. It's located on the top floor of Acropolis mall. The menu reminded me a lot of Nandos! 

Top picks were!
Three chicken burger - one red, one black and one white burger. All tastes slightly different. The red one was more piri piri, black was meaty and white was very mild. Recommend adding cheese to the burgers as this elevates the flavours considerably. The fries on the side were chunky and delicious with a great dip to go along with it

Signature 1/2 chicken - not as packed with flavour but had a great smoky grilled taste none the less

Chocolate Fondant with vanilla ice cream - it was definitely delicious and chocolate-y but it wasn't really a fondant. It was more on the side of a gooey brownie. But it was yumm and the ice cream complimented it well!

The bill of the above along with 2 drinks was  around 1500. Well worth a filling hearty chicken-y meal!

This is an international brand and in entire Kolkata it's the Acropolis Mall where it's located in on the fourth floor level üìç
Multicolored burgers are somewhat made me opt this place. Right after we made our seats I became discomfort and annoyed. In spite the restaurant was empty when we entered except us and one other the receptionist and the waiter both made us sit at their selected table with our unpleasant mood. Unsure why they didn't allow us to sit elsewhere! Keeping this apart we made our orders with 4 Chicken mini burgers with 2 sides spiced rice and green salads¬† - Which tested horribly worse. Couldn't find anything worth in between two bread pieces top and bottom except one tiny slick chicken piece and stale lettuce! No instinct test could be felt instead only dry breads even being different colors. How could an international brand serve this poor food which costs ‚Çπ530?It doesn't value the money anyhow. In this quick developing hospitality service people are aware of good foods beside good services where foods may not test good some times but good service may keep the place going which was missing. Let me tell you both service and foods were worse, horrible, unprofessional at some point. I felt to walk out at some point for their poor attentiveness and hospitality! However we kept ourselves seated and finished the meals. Our orders followed by Panner trichando rice, Coke and Hot choco brownie with ice cream from desserts. Coke was unlimited but it was worse that every time we needed to call them to refill the glass every time, though it was quite empty still the time was being. We had to wait every time for any of our orders above and after couple of minutes the waiter come with the food and cock to refill the glass. I'm really shocked by such poor, no worse service by this so called international brand. How could they provide such worse service where there they even take service charges separately! It was a worse visit indeed! üò£üò£üòñ
Ambience was nothing extraordinary instead quite simple with a small wall clock and a map to notice.
Service was worse, pathetic, horrible! Foods Nothing tested good to tell you except hot brownie and panner trichando. Rice was stale, dull lacked salt couldn't find any spice either so distasteful! üëéüö´ 
I accidentally spilled my water before the dessert part arrived at the table so I asked the steward if he could clean the table, at length he said ok and at the same time he said he can't do it now as it will take some time so why don't we shift ourselves towards right and have the desserts? However we had to do so. After that when the man came with the dessert he placed it so badly above the water that my dress got spoiled. I disgust I disgust been there! 
After we somehow finished our meal I asked if they have washroom or basin for hand wash the steward told us none of this two are available here but he can give me wet tissue but after couple of minutes he came empty hand and told us sorry they don't have any wet tissues now. So man this is how an international brand use to provide their service! I wished to make a complaint against the service and foods both but Alas! couldn't know how to!! There are tons of posh restaurants with excellent services as well as good testy foods and we foodies can chose from where to go. It was my bad I choose to pay you a visit! ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èüòñ
Wait! It wasn't enough to make us experience worse! üòÇüòñ
Right after we paid the bill and left the joint I found one the stewards followed us and made himself stop at some distance and checked us! I though couldn't understand why on earth the man done so and I ask you how could an international brand keep such poor, untrained stewards who use to follow their customers after they finish the meals?
Will never visit this place again never! ‚ùå‚ùå
No recommendations! Don't go please!

Service ---- 0/5

Ambience - 0/5

Our bill was of 1,365 INR

I don't exactly know what it was, but there was something unpalatable about the food. Whether I don't like Portuguese cuisine in the first place I still don't know but I didn't quite like the food. We had the 3 chicken mini burger with mashed potatoes and the peri peri chicken sizzler. The best bit was the cheesecake shake. Loved it.

After we somehow finished our meal I asked if they have washroom or basin for hand wash the steward told us none of this two are available here but he can give me wet tissue but after couple of minutes he came empty hand and told us sorry they don't have any wet tissues now. So man this is how an international brand use to provide their service! I wished to make a complaint against the service and foods both but Alas! couldn't know how to!! There are tons of posh restaurants with excellent services as well as good testy foods and we foodies can chose from where to go. It was my bad I choose to pay you a visit! ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èüòñ
Wait! It wasn't enough to make us experience worse! üòÇüòñ
Right after we paid the bill and left the joint I found one the stewards followed us and made himself stop at some distance and checked us! I though couldn't understand why on earth the man done so and I ask you how could an international brand keep such poor, untrained stewards who use to follow their customers after they finish the meals?
Will never visit this place again never! ‚ùå‚ùå
No recommendations! Don't go please!

I don't exactly know what it was, but there was something unpalatable about the food. Whether I don't like Portuguese cuisine in the first place I still don't know but I didn't quite like the food. We had the 3 chicken mini burger with mashed potatoes and the peri peri chicken sizzler. The best bit was the cheesecake shake. Loved it.

Heard about their burgers a lot of times. Finally tried their burger in a black bun. The burger was good. The best part is the variety of suaces that they offer according to your taste. The place was crowded. Overall a good experience.

So this friend of mine told me that this place probably has one of the best burgers in town. I found it hard to believe, considering my all time favorite place for burgers still was BuegerU.

So, I booked my table via Zomato's online booking system(considering the fact it was a weekday, we really didn't need to.) Anyhow, as we stepped in the waiter guided us towards our reserved table and was quite friendly and helpful.
¬†

The decor of this place is quite nice, although a little small. It also has a small lounge kind of an area. The overall atmosphere is pretty okay. Coming to the service, the waiter knew the menu well and was very helpful while picking out items from the menu.¬†

We ordered a 'too much peri peri', a 'fully loaded chicken burger' along with a too 'Mango meets banana' shake. 

So we waited for a while until the food came to our table and right off the bat, let me tell you..these burgers are tall. Taller than anything else I've had in the recent past. It was a struggle, even with my quite big hands to keep the burger together. My friend on the other hand chose a completely different route and took everything apart. She was just not up for the challenge. The burgers tasted pretty good, maybe not the best I have in Kolkata but definitely good. There's one thing though, that threw me off. Apparently, while taking ¬†our orders, the waiter asked if we wanted cheese to be added on to the burgers? I am no connoisseur(yet) but I thought cheese was an integral part of any burger. IF you're reading this Barcelos, fix this up ASAP, please. Anyhow, looking past that the burgers were pretty okay. The fries came an ad-on, yet again but I won't complain since they satisfied my taste buds. The shake was pretty well made too. The quantity was quite sufficient for two to be honest. You also get a wide variety of sauces to choose from, four to be precise

All in all, it was a good experience but expect the bill to be around for 1500 to 2000 rupees for a simple one course meal.

We went today for lunch. We expected a Nandos kind of menu and ambience. The Peri sauce were yum. Caution to the those who have a weak tongue for spicy food: the Super hot Peri sauce is terribly hot. The ambience was really nice and the service swift. We loved the stuffed chicken kebabs and the chicken thighs. Our sangrias were great too. Coming to the 3 chicken burgers- that was a big disappointment. The colors are for show and don't add taste. The burgers had little to no chicken inside! Felt like we were having a veg burger. Otherwise a good day!

We dropped in here on Valentine's Day for a quick small lunch.
The interior is well decorated and the staffs are courteous.
We ordered for a fish steak,Chicken Espeteda and soft drinks.
The fish pieces were succulent and came with spicy rice and veggies.
The hanging dish chicken cheese espetda comes with two sides.We took spicy rice and mashed potato.
Well,the rice and potato did not taste nice.
The chicken pieces were soft and tasted nice.
Service is prompt.Food presentation is neat.

I finally went to Barcelos after craving their delicious colorful burgers for a very long time! And sadly I was disappointed.

We ordered Peri Peri Black Magic(Black bun burger with roasted chicken) and Peri Peri Red Hottie(Pink bun burger with veg patty) along with Oreo and KitKat shakes. On the side of the burger we had ordered a portion of potato wedges with dip.
The shakes were quite good, rich and thick! They were served in nice little jars. I've had better versions of both, but there were good nonetheless. For their price, the quantity should have been more I felt.
The burgers sure looked fabulous and were served well in wooden trays. To much dismay of mine, the buns tasted the same as a regular bun...don't know why I thought they would taste much different. The Veg burger was much better than Non Veg burger - which, in one word, was bland. Thankfully have have 4 sauces accompanying you on your table and Super Peri sauce made the burger much better. The Veg burger was good overall - not spectacular. The wedges were really good! Especially with Super Peri!
The portions were good, one burger with one side is sufficient for 1 person. The price for burgers is okay...feels a little less value for money though.

They have a huge burger menu to offer! And I could only try the tip of the iceberg. Maybe I'll like other burgers/dishes better and so could you! Do try it out :)

It was kind off a cousin reunion after a long time and what good way to celebrate than to eat out. Barcelos was a week or so old and was 'hot cake' in this part of the city. So without second thoughts we decided to give it a try. First things first, the place is particularly decorated and gives u that feel of a burger joint. Courteous staff and a good ambience set us up sufficiently. We tried a sizzler and a lamb burger on recommendation from the guy attending us. Honestly it was in that 'thin red line'. Below it u r disappointed and above it u are satisfied. Infact while driving home I thought to myself whether the food stood out. I m still perplexed.

Try this place out to taste the flavours of Portuguese food. The drinks especially are a treat for your taste buds. A special mention for the Sangria. For appetizers we tried the chicken thighs and mutton kebabs. Both the dishes were exceptionally tasty. There are 4 different sauces they offer your food to be cooked in, 4 sauces have different levels of spice in it. However when it came to the main course, it was bit of a let down. We ordered the 1/4 chicken and the chicken was a little dry. Also we could have enjoyed the food more if the plates were bigger since there's a lot going on, on that plate of food. They also give you a choice of sides along with the main course so if you are two persons and you order a 1/4 chicken with 2 sides, that should be more than enough.
A few very interesting items which are available on the menu are the red and black coloured burgers which are supposedly very healthy. Will definitely try the same next I'm there.

The Peri Peri grilled chicken, Arabic Mezze platter and Oreo milkshake are a must try if you are going to this restaurant.The lively ambience  and the smiling courteous staff make the dining experience really enjoyable.I would highly recommend making a visit here.

I had been waiting eagerly for this outlet to be opened at Acropolis. After months of waiting visited this Portuguese joint last year and since then I have been quite a regular.
The peri Peri madness has taken the shape of a trend today. And no one makes a better version of peri peri grilled chicken than Barcelos in Kolkata.
Not just grilled chicken but the burgers, the burgers are one of a kind. I had the mini burger platter which was a trio of a black, red and white burger and came with a side of potato wedges.
The best part is the pocket pinch which is not really much. Total value for money.

We have been seeing Barcelos @Acropolis for a while and thought it was a good time to check out the striking Black and Pink burgers that are their star items. Some of our friends were apprehensive of the food colouring used, but the staff assured that the colouring used was from organic ingredients and vegetables which are added before baking... Entirely harmless.

Surprisingly they have introduced Himalayan Trout which is brought in from the Himachal, that none of us knew about earlier.

While the food is great, some events for the weekends can help it be a more happening destination to hangout.

Well it's a long due review as I visited here with my bff last year and never wish to go ever again.

Decor-4/5
Ambience 3.5/5
Food-1/5
Service -2/5
Value for money -1/5

 So the decor makes one feel it's a great place to hangout with scrumptuos food,and a heaven for those chicken lovers,and I too prefer chicken very much and like to try experimental dishes,and after knowing about there peri peri preparation I was more interested and curious about this food stop,the waiter's are very much unprofessional,and have no idea about what they are serving or what's there in the menu,of you ask for any explanation about any dish.
They need a proper training as to how they should behave with the customers that they don't own us and it totally depends upon the customers whether a restaurant excels or not!!!
They do as they wish to and don't follow what the patron is saying.

Coming to the food they served us some smelly chicken preparations which we couldn't eat but had to pay for,for the starter we had the chicken platter which was edible and then for main we had peri peri black magic and a full chicken which were disaster!!!  So we didn't even tried the dessert,instead we went to the Asia kitchen which is beside this outlet and got satisfied!!!!

On 8th of this month i dropped by this Portugese restaurant after hearing a lot about it. I liked the outdoor sitting arrangements though i sat inside. Interior is quite good. Coming to the food I ordered peri peri bloody red burger and white chicken burger. I really liked the burgers and they do not serve processed or frozen chicken. Along with the burger we took one side which includes green salad and grilled veggies. There are a lot more dishes which seemed interesting . But since my friend and i was full we couldn't order anything more. Will surely pay a second visit soon to try the different wraps.

Different cuisines are coming up in the city..barcelos is one if those. Good food ...very sufficient quantify . Nicely maintained and we'll kept. Only one drawback is the slow service provided. Rest is assured. All the way. Must visit          
My second visit to barcelos was very good. I hadn't been aware of the ample space this restaurant had until one of the waiters took m to the end seat surrounded by beautiful painted walls... Nice themes
One must try the red burgers. Just the best among all of my orders. Just one thing was a turn off were the French fries. You get these type of fries in roadside restaurants. Plz improve the quality of fries. Or else everything was superb. Hope to visit soon. .

Its hidden. Almost in a way that Diagon Alley is in London. Hidden in the desolate most corner of the mall its hard to locate unless you know for sure that it exists from the overhanging banner. 
Once inside there are rarely guests to be seen for obvious reasons. Music playing in the background is good and the staffs are as you would expect in such an eatery. 
There's a smoke room inside which is a big plus for the sinners. 
They make there signature grills with one of the 4 sauces,  rather variants of the Peri Peri sauce. You can decide to taste them first before deciding on which one to grill your chicken with. 
Supa Peri,  the one that I went with was literally super hot. My lips were burning for the next few hours. The chicken had not retained its juices probably due to immediate serving. So I would not rate the food highly. 
The waiters came over repeatedly to ask if I was having a good time and if the food was good etc. I doubt if they can do this at this frequency once they are exposed from their hidden alley.

Barcelos is one of the fewest Portuguese and Middle Eastern food joints that the city has.
You can feel the pocket pinch here but honestly it's worth it.

They are famous for their burgers and like others i wasn't disappointed by the taste or the the presentation of the burgers either.

We had ordered Peri Peri chicken, mixed kebabs platters, Chicken Espetada and chicken burger- toasted handmade soft buns filled with chicken fillet, lettuce, tomato and mayo. You can always choose your favourite toppings and other add ons from the menu.

The decor and ambience is lively and pleasant,although the service was bit slow.

Food is different and they have some very intresting varieties. Well u cant understand all, so the best is to suggest the staff to serve them to their delight. Ofcourse do try the sizzlers, its really hot and good.
One advice for the management: if they could make the seats a little more comfortable.
But surely should be visited more often

Located on the 5th floor of Acropolis is this middle-eastern/portuguese food heaven!
 
Loved the ambience & decor. Great service, staff is really humble and courteous. Brilliant plating!

Shakes are amazing. We also tried the mango and kala khatta from the drinks menu. Chicken espetada is a delight to watch because if the way it is presented-hanging from skewers. Fish kebabs were good; chicken platter was average. Salamon with risotto was really good, the salamon was freshly pink, juicy, tender however risotto was not upto the mark!

We had gone their to celebrate a friend's bday and they were really thoughtful to play a bday song while cake-cutting: really really appreciate the gesture.

All in all,Barcelos is definitely a must try next time you crave for a yumilicious meal to tantalise your taste buds :)

The ratings given here have made me backout from visiting this place quite often, but finally a few days back I finally went there since I wanted to try something different and was pretty hungry! I have not regretted my decision ever since. The one thing that is very mentionworthy is their presentation and plating of food. I found it amazingly exquisite!

Barcelos has always been a great food joint for Portuguese and Middle Eastern dishes.

You can feel the pocket pinch here but honestly it's worth it.

The burgers are worth tasting and if you visit here you'll find various kinds of colourful burgers.

We had ordered Peri Peri chicken, mixed kebabs platters, Chicken Espetada and chicken burger- toasted handmade soft buns filled with chicken fillet, lettuce, tomato and mayo. Barcelos provides with varities of sides and add ons.

While the Chicken Espetada skewered chicken with onions, garlic and bell peppers is soft and tender with all the spices and flavors oozing out of it.

This dish is served with two regular sides either fried veggies or rice.

The fried veggies salad is a blend of many flavors, that helps to bring out the tangy spicy 'achari' taste in it.

You also get fries along with a cheesy dip.

And as per your taste and preference you can also add mozzarella cheese and sundried tomato to the dish, making it Cheesy Chicken Espetada.

A pretty and filling starter which you'll only get here, at Barcelos.

Visit this place once to taste delicious Portuguese and Middle Eastern Cuisine, it also has a nice and lovely decor .

Been to this place a couple of days back with a friend of mine who happens to be a chef too. We ordered a dish called hummus and pita which at all did not taste good. And since my friend too is a chef and has cooked such Mediterranean dishes in a number of well renowned hotels, according to him they did not even add the proper ingredients required to prepare the dish. However we also order a chicken steak with veggies and 1/2 chicken with mashed potatoes both of which tasted good enough.
What attracted us the most in this particular place is their friendly behavior. After we finished our meal they came up to us for a feedback about the food. On my friend saying that the hummus did not at all taste as it was supposed to they initially deducted the amout of the dish from the total billing amount. Nevertheless on us requesting not to do so as it was just an honest openion, they included the amount and also gave both of us vouchers where we could avail discount next time we visit the restaurant. Not just that even the chef himself came over and spoke to us in a very friendly tone and overall this place gave us a very warm and comfortable experience. Would love to visit again !

Finally was able to visit barcelos. The decor and seating is very good and comfortable. The service was also good. The best item was Himalayan trout. Would only visit this place again for the trout and the non veg kebab platter. It has quite an extensive menu but only two items of fish and no items of any other seafood. 
The burgers were a big let down. Very dry bread and hard chewy chicken. We had ordered two glasses of sangria. It's served in very small glasses full of fruits hence Hardly any alcohol was there. It's a rip off for the price they are charging. The brownie with ice cream was good. 
Now comes the bill, 40per cent of ur actual amount is added as taxes and service charge!!

One of the bigger and better malls of Kolkata, Acropolis also offers various food joints, Barcelos being one of them. Located on one of the corner spaces of the fourth floor of the mall, Barcleos provides you with a wide and delicious variety of food and drinks.
Alcohol and mocktails are at par with other food joints in Kolkata. Food, starting from Peri Peri burgers to non veg platters, from salads to grilled veggies and chicken/fish all are worth a try.
The service and behaviour of the staff is equally pleasant. Loyalty programs is something that food joints of Kolkata have started and Barcelos is no far away.
I strongly recommend people to try out Barcelos at least twice. This is a place that can be visited with both friends and family

My first visit to this place.
An awesome ambience it has.
Very courteous staff.
I was very keen to taste the colourful burgers.So,we ordered the chicken burger platter with french fries as side dish.
The black and the white oil ones were really juicy and tasty.The red one was little dry.
Then we ordered 1/4 chicken and the Traditional Portuguese Sangria (made up of red wine and brandy) to go with it.
Although I didn't like the sangria as it was too hard for me,but my friend loved it.
This place is a must visit.

well, to start with, I m not much impressed with this particular restaurant. Quite a Known place (thanks to zomato), entered their with quite a high expectation, but nothing came out working in favour except for the high class decor & wall paintings. we ordered 1 chicken steak with potato wedges & mayo dip. Idk what was the hype about? a single lean chunk of chicken breast roasted, along with 10-12 pieces of potato wedges & a smallll bowl of mayo dip. the chicken was not upto the mark, was quite chewy, not at all great in taste, in short, nothing exceptional (as expected going through their price). atlast, the bill arrived and what irritated me more was - a single damn dish costed me 476/- (including tax). i mean what? what was so great in that dish, that I would feel peace while paying for it!? if the dish will be good, its quite natural that the customer would love to pay for what he or she got. but for that crappy dish which was nothing but a single piece of chicken and few potato's? nah! not my cup of tea actualy. they are actualy pricing the dishes in the name of their expensively done decor..which is not accptable (atleast for me).

Great ambiance, cordial and helpful staff. Me and my friends ordered the Mini Burger Platter, 1/2 Chicken and Drumsticks.. All came reasonably early and the drumsticks were delicious.. But my favorite is ¬†the Mini Burger Platter. Quantity is good. Their Veri Peri, Medium Peri and other sauces were satisfying too.

A new baby in the town has arrived and brought a sensation to our taste buds.Barcelos has finally started serving liquor which took me to there for a taste of the Portuguese sangria .Boy its yumm..bits and pieces of apple and oranges in red wine(though i was hoping for a few peach slices) was presented to me.I have heard a lot about their burger section.Our server suggested that we opt for the black mutton burger with extra cheese and sides of potato wedges and mashed potato.The black sesame burger was moist with a huge mutton patty oozing in cheese.The burger bun has its own flavour which sets it a@part from the others in town.A sweet end to our meal was the berry cheesecake served in a platter beautifully presented with berry compote.A special mention is the small but cute red phone booth smoking zone and the window side table overlooking the road.Well the verdict is we are definitely visiting back for the different portuguese delicacies

Legend is,barcelos has  many stores located in South Africa.it started in 1993 in south africa n made its way in india n finally in Kolkata! The official home for portuguese flavour. The decor is really good. Coming to food we ordered 
 Chicken salad with extra chicken (it was amazing) healthy option it has green apples,eggs and candied walnuts and almonds.
Half chicken done one side (super peri peri) :the chicken was very well marinated as the marinade made the chicken soft succulent with mashed potatoes .
Pocket pinch is moderate.

Located in Acropolis Mall, this place has earned a lot of name for the colorful burgers that it serves. Decided to have all of them and I could not find an option better than the combo platter of 4 mini burgers, all different colors, with 2 sides - where we chose Fries with Dip and Grilled Vegetables. 

The dip served with fries was delicious. The Grilled Vegetables had less of babycorn and more of broccoli that smelled stale and turned out to be a huge turn off for me.

Coming to the burgers, I really liked the white one as it had mayo in it. Red turned out to be really dry even after adding a cheese slice to it, brown tasted good with all its spiciness and black was again average.

An extra 0.5 would definitely go to its ambience. The walls are decorated with beautiful paintings. The bar area is an eye candy.

This one located on the fifth floor of acropolis mall.this is basically a casual dining restaurant chain originating in south africa,with a portugese theme.i have experienced utmost geniality from the staffs of this eatery.such a lovely,heedful staffsüëå.decoration was striking.
The berry cucumber,tangy mango,kiwi cooler were served with dry ice.the drinks were smoke-filled,nice in quantity.then black mutton burger was peculiar as the bread was black in colour.i've expected it to be more tasty,more juicy & moreover i feel it to be a little overpriced.the grilled fish sizzler was not up to the mark.it contained only few pieces of fish.moreover the sizzler didn't feel like to be a sizzler.something was missing in the taste.

Well out of all the Barcelos i have tried, this is the worst! Why is Calcutta subjected to pathetic overpriced food? Waiters who are hard of hearing, and no manager makes this place a nightmare! The Peri peri sauce was pathetic - though they claimed it was the standard sauce. The chicken was dry and yukk!! I will never ever visit this place again. The waiters are again extremely rude and not too sure why they have cultivated this attitude. Meaningless overpriced food.

Pathetic experience on New Year eve. Had gone with my parents and wife to the restaurant. Ordered a Non Veg kebab platter and some drinks. Although the restaurant wasn't even half full but the service was still very slow. The platter came around 30 mins later. Had 1 bite into lamb kebab and realized that the inside of the kebab is completely frozen. The restaurant had just microwaved the kebabs and hence it was hot on outside and frozen inside. Had to return the platter and they replaced with new platter. But, they completely destroyed the evening and we left after that. Also being New Year eve, we couldn't get space anywhere else and had to return home.

Finally had a chance to visit Barcelos along with my wife and kid. The diner is located on the top floor of the Acropolis Mall. The place has got a charm of its own with its own unique decor. The staff are most coueteous and efficient. Coming to food there are lots of options and whatever we ordered were very tasty.In other words even if prices are on a little higher side you get your money's worth.Looking forward to visting Barcelos soon.

A RARE NAME BARCELOS AND THE BEST ONE IN TOWN!!!!!
An actractive menu card, i say this because of newly invented and written chicken dishes which definitely find anyone's attention but the price next to it might just be a factor to think about !! Really is it worth it?
Service was not impressive the attendants were late and lost to say the least!!!
Well located in a newly happening mall of KOLKATA acropolis with a decent decor, dim lights and sitting arrangements not much though in number!!
No arguments in accepting the fact peri peri chicken has a great taste with a non spicy avatar somewhat an international approach to it !!! But on ordering Barcelos signature dishes (2 leg chicken pieces) and the hanging chicken kababs in portuguese style which grab my attention on the menu card i found both same in taste !! (6 pieces chicken)
The world healthiest burgers a nice sounding name and surely good one in taste but then look at the price !! 
The drinks are good and good in quantity but prices are on the higher side !!
Surely a fresh and new approach not for everyone though as price is definitely a factor to look in !!
Couples can surely step in and expect 2000 bucks on decent lunch or dinner meal even more!!!
But still the food is really good no doubt so surely you can try this one!!
I have given 3.5 may be when next time i step in barcelos and try sizzlers and other dishes i might update my ratings as price and quantity is a factor to worry about for these highly price dishes!!!
If you liked my review do comment or like!!!

The name itself is so fancy, that it urges you to actually try out the kind of food they serve.
Upon further investigation, I got to know, they serve Mediterranean food and I obviously wanted to go there.

The ambience is serene and calm with dim lights but the music is too loud at times. I personally feel that the tables laid out in coloumns should have a wee bit more space between them.

Service was fast and staff members were humble enough the answer all our queries.

Coming to what we ate :
1)Garlic Fish with Rice @Rs.265.00 (3.75/5) : [Serves 1] This came with a fair portion of indianised mexican rice with 3 portions if grilled Basa fillets and a good portion of grilled vegetables. The fish tasted awesome and was grilled nicely with a good flavour of garlic. The vegetables were delicious but I feel that the rice could have been of better quality.

2)Chicken Pita with 2 Sides @Rs.345.00 (4/5) : [Serves 1] The two sides ordered were Potato wedges (well prepared, very crisp) and coleslaw (delicious). The delectable chicken stuffed fresh pita was beautiful. Really liked it.

3)Mutton Kebab Sizzler @Rs.545.00 (4.25/5) : [Serves 2] 5 medium sized well charred mutton kebabs served with a portion of rice and Mediterranean style grilled vegetables. The kebabs were delicious!

4)Grilled Chicken (1/2)with 2 sides - Creamy mashed potatoes and Rice @Rs.530.00 (4.25/5) : [Serves 1] This turned out to be a beautiful and succulent dish which brings equal excitement to both the eyes and as well as the taste buds. Well smoked soft tender chicken was indeed great to hog on! The accompaniments - the creamy mashed potatoes were spot on but the rice needed some improvement with the quality and taste.

5)Burger Platter @Rs.495.00 (4/5) : [Serves 2] We were served with 4 burgers I.e. 2 chicken burgers and 2 mutton burgers. They do not use artificial colours to colour their buns which is very good initiative.
Starting from the first burger from the left :

i)Normal chicken burger (3/5) : The first burger was a bit too dry for my liking, the bun was over baked and between the buns were 2-3 thick chicken strips covered in cheese and mayonnaise (most probably).

ii) Chicken burger with white buns (4.5/5) : This was juicy and so so good! With 2-3 chicken strips again but with a new dimension of flavour with pineapple and pickled olives. What an amazing combination of sweet and sour.

iii)Mutton burger with red buns (4/5) : This was on the subtler side with a dangerously delicious smokey mutton patty which I asumed was hand pounded and that did make a great difference in terms of taste.

iv)Mutton burger with Black buns (4.25/5) : This was a bit spicy but again delicious.

This dish is a total value for money.

6)Tiramisu @Rs.195.00 (2.75/5) : [Serves 1] Out of everything I tried, this turned out to be a disappointment. The mascarpone cheese was mixed with whipped cream but it was too stiff. The coffee flavour wasn't very prominent as well. Clearly did not enjoy it.

The bill total was Rs.3245.00 [Including 10% Service charge of Rs.247.50, 14.5%vat of Rs.358.88 and 6% service tax of Rs.163.35].

The hole in the pocket is pretty big but this place is worth a try.

Recommended. üòÉüòÉ
Happy eating. ‚úåüèª

Had a great time catching up with my friends at Barcelos, we tried this place with the expectations of great food and a good ambience. Barcelos lived up to the expectation and took good care of us. The nonveg platters were amazing, the sangria bar dished out some great cocktails. The burger were very filling and had some amazing presentation. The lamb burger was juicy, nicely cooked and had some amazing flavour. Highly recommend place for a good drink, finger foods, grilled chicken and heavenly burger. The sangria bar is an added advantage. Thank You @teambarcelos

Had been here on 25th. Seemed like a good place but the service was horrendous. We both ordered a dish each for ourselves. Mine was served but my sister's dish was not served and we were kept waiting for 1 hour. Later they told us it will take more time. The order was for a simple chicken wrap which took ages to prepare. Huge disappointment. Why would someone choose them over Chilli's or Hoppipola i wonder. Bad experience

Ever since this places opened its doors to foodies, I have been wanting to taste the multicoloured mini burger platter - red and black burgers being the most tempting. They not only look good but taste great too. Had ordered this with 2 sides - potato wedges with dip and spicy rice. Honestly the rice doesn't go well with this and it's good also. So I would suggest you all to skip that and try something else. Other than this everything else we ordered was delightful. Do try the peri peri dishes.

We visited your Acropolis Mall Kolkata outlet for our Christman dinner ! I am sorry, the food was far from our expectation. The service was aweful, we had to ask not only for the menu card but also ask for the cutleries, despite the restaurant being half empty. We ordered a large dish of whole chicken roast with sides. The chicken was unfortunately poorly grilled and was tasteless. We did not dare to order for any other food.

With every new mall coming up in Kolkata, so is another big food chain outlet. When Quest Mall decided to host a Michelin Star restaurant and provide the foodies of Kolkata with a taste of authentic Chinese, Acropolis came forward to give us a 'Hoppi' experience and of late, spoil our taste buds with Portuguese spices and grilled chicken. The moment you step into this place, the first thing you notice is the world map and the beautiful lighting around. A soft, soothing or some peppy number music (am not sure of the language) adds to the ambiance. 

Coming to the food, I have tried out the following at this place:

Accompaniments:
Kiwi Cooler and Tangy Mango : Both are pretty good and are different from the regular mocktails served in other places - both in terms of appearance and taste. 

Main Course:

1. Half Chicken done one side : The Chicken, so we'll marinated, mixed with Portuguese herbs and spices and served with mashed potatoes is an absolute delight for chicken lovers like me. They have 4 different sauces to offer, and you are free to choose any, depending on your spicy level. 

2. Chicken Esplanade : This is a hanging chicken dish, consisting of small pieces of chicken breast separated by ball peppers and onions, and mixed with again, the traditional spices. The taste of the chicken, however, isn't very different from the grilled chicken. 

I really wanted to try their burger, but I was somewhat full after devouring so much mashed potatoes and chicken. So, I hope to try the special coloured burgers soon enough. 

Desserts:
1. Tiramisu: This has become one of my favourite desserts, and I believe it needs a lot of effort to make this go wrong. Fortunately, even though they don't offer the best Tiramisu in town, Barcelos doesn't go wrong with this. 

2. Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream: This is for the chocolate lovers. The melting ball of hot chocolate with a spoon of vanilla ice cream is the formula nearly every dessert banks on. 

Overall, Barcelos gives a much-needed break from the monotonous tasting of the limited varieties of cuisines available, and I definitely want to explore their signature dishes further!

My expectations were really very high after hearing and reading reviews and so was waiting to be here from a long time to try the Peri Peri and Portuguese cuisine. But was thoroughly disappointed only in terms of food.
Ambience - is phenomenal. Calm, clean and well decorated

Service - is again great, quick and staff were really polite as well pretty cooperative

Food presentation - very good, they looked to pretty and innovative to be tampered :)

Food style - is unique, the menus, the way its served, definitely among the best you get in this city

Food quantity - sufficient

Food quality - chi is the the most important part, this is disappointing. It looks good, but definitely doesn't taste so. The chicken meat were tough, the lamb gave out a typical smell which could not be digested properly.¬†

Price - it comes in the category of premium restaurants and definitely price is on higher side and not worth the quality.

Definitely disappointed but will go again to try some other menu, and may be can review the place better.

Now about the service we wait for 30 min or more for the starter's and then also they forgot to bring our drinks. So service is a issue.  Now about the food overall OK.

Went on Thursday 17.12.16, it was a mixed felling for me, situated on the top floor of Acropolis mall.
We ordered sizzlers and mushroom gwaloti kebabs. total bill was 870 + tax = 1200 (round off)
Cons: Price is on the higher side in compare to the quantity served. Sizzler served was not at its sizzling condition as we are familiar in mocambo, peter cat, etc. Kebab does not felt as kebab.¬† 
Pros: good ambiance, decor, comfort. no issues if you have a infant/kid , staffs are very very good, you have a smoking chamber inside the house. Service was very prompt. The menu is designed and planned in such a way that What ever you order, for 2 portions, the bill will be approx¬† 1200/- inclusive of tax.

As the name says Portuguese Goodness....and yes it's just that. They specialise in Peri Peri flavour. Half chicken and Chicken Cataplana are among their signature dishes. The right blend of spices and a touch of tanginess makes them delicious. Coming to the service and ambience, the interior of the restaurant has its own Portugese touch. The staff and the service is good.Worth the value of money. A must visit for those who wants to tickle your taste bud.

Visited Barcelos on weekday for lunch. When we entered only 2 tables were occupied so there was no delay in service. Coming to the food we ordered two mocktails along with Chicken Picantte and Mutton Kebab sizzler. We thought of ordering one more item once we finish off those two but food quantity was pretty good esp the mutton kebab sizzler. There were I guess 5 or 6 mutton kebabs served on bed of lots of veggies and rice. A good dish it was. Coming to chicken picantte I ordered the Very Peri one as I love my food to be hot though it was not at all hot. But taste wise can't complain. A chicken breast stuffed with generous amount of cheese , it was super yum. Mocktails were served in big tall glasses. Lastly ordered chocolate trufile cake with ice cream and biscotti to end the lunch on sweet note. Overall it was a good experience. The place is value for money.

Went there for the first time on a Friday evening. Interiors are good. They had some ongoing offers in Food & Drinks. For drinks we chose their famous Sangrias. Took White Wine with Grapes & Pomegranate and White wine with Minty Magic. Both were good. As appetizers we opted for Chicken Liver with Bun. Tasted awesome. We also ordered Grilled Veggies with Wedges on the side. Presentation in all the cases were good. I need to mention about the Peri sauces one would find on each table. You can find Mild Peri, Very Peri & Super Peri. However, serving time needs to improve a lot. Guys pls improve on that

This was on my wish list for a long time and finally visited today.
The place is nice and has a good ambience.
The staff are courteous.
Coming to food,they have this red and black burgers which are an attraction.
We ordered fish kebab, peri peri black magic and chicken burger with one sides for each burger.
The food was okay, nothing very extra ordinary.
The burgers were good if not very good and we ordered french fries and potato wedges as sides,those were served in good amount.
The fish was okay.
A little overpriced considering the food.
Otherwise it is okay for a one time visit

Situated in the corner most side of the Acropolis mall this place looks decent with nice ambiance and musky wood aura all over, happy hours are only valid on Indian spirits which are handful of them, their burger is a must try, I tried the black magic lacked veggies but the meat was decent enough, tastes amazing with the peri peri sause, price rate is decent enough, pocket pinch for 2 Rs.1500 approx.

This place is in my wishlist since long. So finally went there on a saturday evening. Situated on 4th floor of acropolis mall. Yes the first peri peri portugese restro in kolkata. The moment you enter here you will surely fall for this place. The decoration and ambience is so nice. Staffs are v.well mannered.
Now coming to the food had PERI PERI BLACK MAGIC BURGER (with 1 side). For the side chose grilled veggies. This was my first experience of having such type of burger other than the regular ones. Burger was good. The meat inside was juicy and succlucent. The veggies contains sauted brocoli, mushrooms, green and yellow bell peppers. All in one good.
Then took one chicken steak (with 1side). Chose mashed potatoes but the waitress told that it was not available. So took potato wedges. Steak was good but not upto the mark. The meat was juicy. But not like i had before.
Luckily the happy hour was going on (1:1 on beverages). Took Gin. It was actually complimenting both the dishes.
Now the price. For the burger it was really worth the money. But for the steak... NO. The actual bill was 820. But they charge extra 10% service charge, 14.5% on foods, 27% on liquor and again service tax 6%. So the total bill came Rs 1088. Really too much!
Anyways will recommend to visit once. Just to experience the peri peri flavour.

Finally Kolkata gets a Peri Peri restaurant. And that too a pretty good one. Moderately priced and very good staff and very friendly and helpful. 

Peri Peri chicken. ....lovely... now I don't need to travel to Gurgaon to have Peri Peri :-).

It also serves alcohol and a very family setup. 

With drinks and for a full stomach of Peri Peri stuff charge per person approx Rs1000. 00

Thanks and keep this up

I had visited the place with high expectation. I read the reviews before so that I have a good idea of what to order. When I ordered for chicken steak I had particularly asked them for skinless chicken as the steak tends to become very hard if it is made with the skin. But they had paid no heed to it. The chicken in all the items we have ordered had 2 things in common. All of them were tasteless and dry.
Thoroughly disappointed.

So Barcelos was on my wish list for a long time. The interiors are inviting. The staff is very courteous. They have 4 varieties of sauces on their table. I loved the tangy lemon one. We ordered for a mini burger platter. It had black beauty, white burger,red burger and the classic one. Garlic bread was just fine. Nothing great. 3 dips served with it was very nice. We had a rice dish which was nice. The rice had a smoky flavour in it. We ordered molecular drinks. Tangy mango and Kiwi Kooler. Both were nice üòÅ
The quantity they provide is not appreciable. Over all a good experience.üëç

Location: situated on the 4th floor of acropolis mall, just mext to kitchen asia owned by mainland china.

Interior designing: When you enter, it is basically all vacant. But it is very pretty. There is also a smoking room that is in a shape of a phone booth. If you go more inside, it has more chairs and tables. Gives pretty nice comfort to sit on.

Food and service: coming to the service, they are really nice and sweet. They cater to your every needs. Coming to the main part, the food, we ordered:
‚Ä¢ The burger platter: we ordered for this as it has 4 different burgers. Red, black, white and original. Two were mutton and two were chicken with two sides. All of them practically taste the same. I expected them to have different flavours so it was disappointed. 
‚Ä¢ cheesy chicken wrap: this one was a total disappointment. The wrap was really hard and we really did not eat it. It was bad. Not worth it.

It is  a pending review. Been to this place to try out some peri peri chicken and some Portuguese cuisine. It was an early dinner so most of the tables were vacant. For starter nothing was available as been told by the waiter due to some kitchen issues. Ok we were fine. So we straight away wanted to had Peri Peri chicken but it was also a NO. The waiter told the chicken needed to prepare this dish is not available. And trust me we were like leaving the place and coming out. But any how stayed back and order for salad. ‚óè Pear and chicken salad. A very sweet one. It was okayish. Nothing much to impress the taste buds. Next ordered ‚óè Grilled half chicken with French fries and mayonnaise. It was tasty and the pieces were big enough. Hot and spicy. Liked it.
‚óè Chicken trinchando. It was a Sizzler. Came up with rice and veggies. Not at all worth it. I didn't liked the preparation. All this were accompanied by ‚óè Kiwi cooler.  Refreshing and chilled. ‚óèIndian classic kala. Same like Masala thums up  type.
Though the inner decor was nice but foodwise I didn't liked the place and even the price was on higher side.

I have seen this place advertising about black and red and white burgers but have never been there.. so my friend and me decided to try this place.. well to begin with the food is good and yummy.. though the quantity is dissatisfactory yet the taste is a compensation.. service is a little on the clumsy side yet a visit should be mandatory atleast to try their variety of burgers.

Barcelos - An offbeat restaurant on the lines of Chilli's serving world cuisine.We went for Sunday night dinner and got a seat immediately.We ordered the coloured burgers which is their speciality alongside a grilled chicken piece and lime soda.The burgers were like a mini platter.You may choose various combos with Mutton.The taste was good and filling.Grilled vegetables as sides enhanced the mood.Overall nice food and good ambience.The music could be a little low and not loud as it was.Overall : 4 stars.Cheers...

If you like to experiment with food, then try Barcelos. Been there multiple times already and loved almost everything that we have tried. Chicken Picante stands out as my favorite - moist chicken stuffed with cheese and pepper fillings - and is a meal in itself. If you are visiting in a group of 3 or more, do try the kebab platter (its different from the kebabs we are used to in Mughlai restaurants) and the varieties are exciting.¬†
Most of their sizzlers are good but you can try the Fish sizzler (again because the fish stays moist - feels fresh) and the spices are not overwhelming. If you want something spicy, then try the Chicken Trinchando sizzler. My friends like the chicken salad (try if you can stay on diet, even while dining out) :D
The drinks are tad expensive and nothing out of the world (apart from the presentation).
Barcelos is a good competition to Chilli's and a blessing for foodies like us :)

The ambiance and service everything was good. However I feel that this place is a bit overpriced. I find the quantity food in the sides to be less.
The food menu comprises of the following food categories - burgers and mini burgers, kebabs (with 12 veg options), typical Portuguese and Middle Eastern dishes like Espetada and Arabic Mezze Platter, salads, sizzlers, rice preparations in Afro Portuguese fusions, breads, side dishes, dips, milk shakes, drinks, molecular drinks, fresh juices, hot beverages and desserts.

Visited Barcelos on the 19th of November. Was pretty happy with the experience. It's very rare that when you visit a restaurant they ask you if you're comfortable with the table you're seated at etc. (Special mention to Vijay Yadav!) their portions are huge so go with a group of a 4-6 so that you can try a couple of things and finish them all. 
Their burgers are apparently healthy (no they're not) and look exotic (yes they do). The white one sucks. The black one is really really good and the red one is alright (order the burger platter). 
The sides are insane and I mean it. I personally didn't like the Arabic platter but my bestfriend did so overall I believe I have no qualms In recommending this place (although I strongly feel a couple of things like some of the staff constantly hovering around our table could be done away with + ordered bottomless Coke but their machine went bad so had to wait for a refill). 
Above and beyond that - pretty nice experience and wouldn't mind visiting it again (they have thank you vouchers of ‚Çπ200 customer loyalty game on point!) 

PS : Sampita had no idea about the Little voucher - just to let you know 
It's applicable on the taxed amount and not the untaxed amount. (Would have ended up ordering something else to avail the offer and the experience would have not been so hunky dory)

Fascinated by the colorful burgers and all the reviews, we headed towards Barcelos and ordered a combination of 2 chicken mini burgers(White and Red) and 1 veg mini burger(Brown) in Mild Peri flavor though they didn't let us customize the burger's individual flavor :( along with a Ferrero Rocher milkshake. No doubt the milkshake was amazing with the exact amount of chocolate and hazelnuts to my taste. The chicken burgers were attractive by look but I have to mention, they lacked that special twist, infact had to gulp them with the Tangy Lemon and Very Peri sauce served on our table. Coming to the decor, the world-map-light was catchy and a nice ambience to chill out with friends. But again, the chicken inside the burgers need a bit of taste and flavor Barcelos :)

Compared to its contemporaries, Barcelos isn't as radiating as them but makes up for it by rendering delectable burgers and molecular drinks. 

The four mini chicken burger is enough to fill major portion of your hunger. The red, white and black burger patties are weirdly delicious and worth the innovation. The garlic fish with rice is worth the money. I also think that few dishes are overpriced.

The service is not up to the mark and the extra 10% service charge for nothing is what deters me from visiting the place again.

If there is one thing why Kolkata is Kolkata for its residents and admirers ‚Äì it would be the food. No, I don‚Äôt challenge the people, the culture, but if there is one thing that stands out in this city, it would surely be the culinary joys it has to offer ‚Äì and I am sure many would agree. For a mad-about-food city, the lack of proper global cuisines was always surprising ‚Äì I mean the Chinese, Continental (colonial influence), Mughlai, Bengali, North Indian, and (vegetarian) South Indian cuisines were always available and admittedly superb, but the lack of a proper pan-Asian, or American, or even Lebanese joint was conspicuous for a long time. It is only over the last couple of years that a host of such joints has opened, and have actively contributed in broadening the horizons of food for the people of Kolkata ‚Äì and Barcelos is one of those. It promises Portuguese cuisine, something that is not common at all ‚Äì and I admit that the promise is sacrosanct. What they do, however, is serve continental food with a twist and some west-European flavors, mainly the Piri Piri spice or sauce.

I happened to visit here on a Durgapuja afternoon, and while the crowd stayed at the more renowned Chili‚Äôs and Asia Kitchen, we found ourselves a table at Barcelos. For starters, we ordered the Boneless Thighs with Onions and Peppers, Stuffed Chicken Kebabs, and Cheesy Chicken Fries. The boneless thighs were great, the meat was tender and the marinade was subtle yet flavorful. The fries were good too, with a generous portion of olives along with cheese and chicken strips. However, the best of the starters were the Stuffed Kebabs ‚Äì rolls of chicken breast stuffed with cheddar, jalapenos and olives, grilled to perfection. We were hungry, and the starters flew off our plates. We also ordered a couple of drinks, and the Mango Tango was spicy and yum, really nice.

For the mains, we ordered a Too Much Peri Peri Black Magic Burger, a Red Meaty Burger, a Chicken Espetada, and a Chicken Trinchado Sizzler. The Trinchado, a native Portuguese dish, was the first to arrive on our table, and it was the most mediocre item of the meal. The Chicken was well done, but somehow the flavors of the rice, the chicken steaks and the cheese did not complement each other and felt like having been put together without much thought. I later did a small research on Trinchado, and I doubt that it was cooked the authentic way, which calls for a generous amount of red wine or brandy. However, the mug of grilled vegetables served by the side was absolutely brilliant, and a nice surprise! 

Next up were the burgers ‚Äì and they are unique at Barcelos because of the bun color. We had ordered one black and one red. The Black one was double chicken, and it tasted heavenly! In fact, it surely is one of the best burgers you can find in Kolkata. The Red Meaty was a lamb burger, and it tasted good too ‚Äì however the mutton patty had a faint smell which you generally find in the meat of old goats, and that was a little unexpected. Didn‚Äôt stop us from wolfing it down though! The last of the lot, and fittingly so, was the Chicken Espetada ‚Äì the famous hanging meal of Barcelos. It comes with a hanging skewer with chicken pieces and veggies, coupled with two sides; and we opted for mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. This serving style is pretty darn attractive, and the chicken was really well done and again, subtly flavored with a mild peri-peri sauce. The sides were also quite good, and by the time we were done, the four of us were full. We ended with some Vanilla Ice-cream and Brownies ‚Äì and the ice-cream was really nice. You can‚Äôt go wrong with Vanilla.

Overall, Barcelos is a great place to try out. While some of its preparations may fall short of expectations, the average quality is quite good. It is serving up some different kind of food, so if you are in the mood for something other than the usual Kolkata fare, hit this place. It looks nice too, and I would rate it 4/5. People have written it is overpriced, but I don‚Äôt feel so at all, in fact I guess the pricing is on the moderate side. Before I forget, while at it, do read the Legend of Barcelos ‚Äì quite interesting.

Post movie, we were looking for a place to have our dinner. We were making our way to Hoppipola when we got a glimpse of Barcelos. At first sight, it reminded me of Nando's. We checked out the menu and were happy to see the variety of burgers on display. So decided to make our pit stop there.

The place has both indoor seating and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is not that great. Whereas the indoor decor is nice and soothing to the eye with beautiful painting adorning the walls. The staff is prompt and courteous and is a big help in deciding the menu. So for our dinner, we got the following

1. Black Beauty
2. Red Hottie

Both of these are burgers. Vegetarian burgers on that. You can choose a variety of options with regards to the spiciness and tanginess of the food. You can also choose as to what side dish you want. We went for same old fries and it was amazing!

3. Falafel with Yogurt Dip: nice munching dish!
4. Oreo Shake: very refreshing!

The presentation was nice and the portions were good enough for two people. Hardly anyone was there when we were having our dinner so worked on our favor in terms of having a long winding chat over n number of things.

Totally LOVED the fun concept of colored burgers at Barcelos! The chicken patties in the burgers were beautifully done. I took a platter of their small bite sized red, brown, black & white chicken burgers. 
However the petty Peri Peri Sauces kept on tables didn't excite me too much as the hotness levels didn't match up to my expectations! 
I had also taken a Kiwi Cooler which was a visual treat! It tasted very ordinary but the visual excitement keeps you going! 
The bottomless aerated beverage that I'd ordered was way way way below standards with the aerated level of the beverage totally on the flat side. After repeated requests to serve us with freshly opened aerated beverage, they gave up and instead compensated with a fresh lime soda. Barcelos, you lost your 0.5 points there and my faith in your aerated beverages!
The decor is done well and is a fun place to hang out with friends.

This was a sudden lunch plan and though I was not in a mood to have burgers, 3 of us landed here.
Our order-3 mini veg burgers, Cataplana rice with yogurt dip, Peri Peri paneer kebabs
Peri Peri paneer kebabs-I wonder if they really meant the kebabs. Because they are just plain grilled peri peri paneer. Name aside, it was wonderful and an indication of the better things to come.
Mini Burgers-I had the Black one and the filling was fresh and tasted great. The assortment of sauces at the table ensured that these burgers went off the plates in a flash. The patty was well cooked ,packed with flavor and I particularly loved how it blended with each sauce. My personal favorite being the Mild Peri and Supa Peri.
Special praise for the grilled vegetables side with the burger. I had great grilled vegetables after a long long time.
Cataplana Rice-I didn't expect this dish to be this good especially since I am not a big fan of chickpeas.Its such a wonderful dish with the yogurt dip and its surprising to observe how they came up with yogurt as a dip and yet make it wonderful. The rice had a light fragrance to it and the chickpeas kebabs were wonderful.
Highly recommended.

Overhyped over priced food, nothing to praise like. Definitely not recommended and never going back! Its not well maintained too. Water from a.c. and water speinklers leaking from all over the place. Food is average according to the price (believe me too costly) paid. Chilis is far better and any day preferable. Its like the money paid is justified in Chilis.

I loved this place a lot. Starting from the ambience to the food. Even the presentation of the food was very good. Compared to other restaurants like Chili's and TGIF, this place is comparatively a tad bit cheaper. 
The mini burgers were very good. So we're the Portuguese kebabs. The peri peri sauce was very different. They had various versions of it like the mild peri and the veri peri. 

Barcelos is located on the fourth floor of Acropolis Mall. I am definitely coming back again to try out the other dishes. Kudos guys...

Peach iced tea was horrible. 
Veg espetada-after 20 mins when they served it the food was freezing cold, when we complained, they again took 20 mins and served freezing cold food again. When we complained, they accepted that they were serving an inappropriately prepared dish to us and also accepted that the manager and owner were aware of this. When we asked them to call the chef, the chef ignored us and chose to laugh at us with the waiters. After 10 mins he came to us and he again accepted the flaws of the food. He also agreed that the management is aware of the problem. The chef is least bothered about the food. It seems that the staff is at war with the management and we are the victims. 
Mini burger- the patties inside were frozen. When we asked for the number of the owner, Mr. Roychoudhury, the person who attended us was unwilling to provide us with the number. 
This restaurant has wasted our dining experience and we returned empty stomach. People should avoid this restaurant.

The first impression of this place is indeed interesting. Myriad paintings on the wall, subtle ambiance, makes it a great weekend haunt . Coming to the food, the impression wasn't as bright as one would expect. The burger I ordered was just about ok. For a high-end joint, with posh interiors and a name to flaunt - one would definitely had expected a little more effort. I tried the famous black burgers - the best thing about them were that they were black and nothing about the taste matched up to the aesthetics. I certainly have to say, i prefer taste over cosmetic value anyday - and a certain other chain definitely fares better on the burger front. The wedges were the only hero here.¬†
About the staff, they generally seemed uninterested, though courteous when they needed to be. The music was great but the TV constantly played Animal Planet which I reckon can be suitable for a waiting room in of a health clinic as opposed to a restaurant. Overall, I wanted to try the place once, and I did.

Visited this place today. Thought of using the little coupin and informed the staff that if they accept little coupon. After eating the food wanted to use the coupon but they said they generated bill and cant use. Very poor behavior and staff very rude and no knowledge how to behave. I have used little and nearbuy coupon at many places and anytime I give them are always ok with any restaurant unless they specifically ask at the beginning. Horrible behavior.

Food is over hyped and over price. One fourth chicken After taxes will cost you 300 approx whixh we can get better tasting 4 PCs hot and cripsy from kfc which is better in taste. The hanging chicken is worst..under cooked and five regular kebab pieced for 450+ after taxes.

Nothing special about taste and horrible staff behavior ...never going back and go only if u want to waste the money which can be better spent

We went around 10pm on a Wednesday, only two other tables were occupied. We wanted to sit more towards the inside but the staff said that section was closed and besides, they were all six seaters. I can understand closing off a section because there aren't enough diners, but why can't two people sit at a table of their choice when almost the entire place is empty and its near closing time, with no possibility of even one six-member dining party coming in? My Barcelos experience thus started on an iffy note.

We ordered the garlic bread, the half chicken, the tangy mango molecular drink and garlic fish with rice (this last being take away). Garlic bread was nothing exceptional. The chicken portions were surprisingly small, this is what Nando's offers when you order their 1/4 chicken. It was good to eat, but the plates are so ridiculously small that with every stab of my knife and fork I was scared of throwing the chicken piece on the table or worse, sending it flying through the air. ¬†Maybe they have these plates to make their portions look bigger? But this needs serious consideration, as it completely ruins the dining experience. The tangy mango drink was really good, but the garlic fish was a let down. Four one-inch pieces of fish in rice with dozens and dozens of green pepper pieces. Maybe they should consider renaming the dish to Green Pepper with rice?¬†

The best take-away from this experience was the Game of Thrones theme song playing on the sound system. Have never heard that version and its great. Overall, did not match up to my high expectations.

So everyone knows about this place and I know it needs no introduction... Ambience is awesome... Deco was mind blowing too... it will surely give you a feel of Barcelos...

Since I didn't tried Portuguese cuisine previously... I can't compare it with anyone... Now coming to the service it was undoubtedly very good... Staffs are courteous... but in my opinion they need to be more attentive...

In the food we ordered for...

‚òÖ Tangy mango drink¬ª¬ª¬ª It tasted good but we expected something more... Since it was a molecular drink...

‚òÖ Berry cucumber drink¬ª¬ª¬ª copy comment from above...

‚ô° Cheesecake shake¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent drink... highly recommended...

‚òÖ Date with orange¬ª¬ª¬ª Okish one nothing extraordinary...

‚ô° Half chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome one... Very tasty... you just need to choose you sauce from their 4 varieties according your taste buds...

‚ô° Mini burgers- 2 mutton, 2 chicken with spicy rice and french fries... we got all the 4 colour buns for our burgers... the mutton burgers tasted awesome... specially with black buns... the chicken tasted good too... french fries were tasty but the spicy rice was a total set back... it was not at all spicy...

‚ô° Chicken espetada¬ª¬ª¬ª Their famous hanging chicken dish... presentation was excellent tasted awesome too...

‚òÖ Peri peri chicken sizzler¬ª¬ª¬ª Didn't liked it at all... expect the chicken nothing in the dish was good... Very unfortunate...

Hence it was and mix experience of good and bad... their are scopes for improvement always... Pocket pinch was considerable...

Portuguese & Middle Eastern Delicacies @ Barcelos, Acropolis Mall, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Occasion: Tasting & Review Session by Invitation

Barcelos, the international restaurant brand, primarily famous for it's grilled Portuguese dishes (read chicken) and Peri Peri sauces, and a proud presence in around 20 countries, has finally opened it's outlet in Kolkata. It's other two Indian presences are in New Delhi and Jaipur.

Situated on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall, Barcelos is an L shaped spacious restaurant with assorted seating arrangements and a bar counter with high stools. Red and yellow sofas stand out, in an otherwise brown-beige setting. Ceiling is black with exposed AC columns. Brown colored wooden tiles adorn the flooring. A small seating area at the far end from the entrance is created on a slightly elevated floor. It enjoys good sunlight and has a nice outside view.

A big wooden world map installation on one of the walls and murals on some other walls look quite nice and noticeable. Some LED TVs are also thrown in to complete the quorum. Nice background music keeps the ambiance live.

Barcelos uses high quality kitchen gadgets to concoct it's signature dishes. All such specialized machines are imported directly from Italy.

Though this chain is primarily famous for it's non veg preparations, enough vegetarian options occupy an ample space on their menu, to cater to the needs of the vegetarian diners.

The food menu comprises of the following food categories - burgers and mini burgers, kebabs (with 12 veg options), typical Portuguese and Middle Eastern dishes like Espetada and Arabic Mezze Platter, salads, sizzlers, rice preparations in Afro Portuguese fusions, breads, side dishes, dips, milk shakes, drinks, molecular drinks, fresh juices, hot beverages and desserts.

When Barcelos opened around 5 months back, it created a buzz in the Kolkata food scene with the introduction of colored burger buns! Their burger buns are available in - red, black, white and brown (the usual color) colors and they don't use any artificial coloring agent. The aforesaid colors are derived by using beetroot, cocoa and coconut respectively. The diners can order their burgers both without or with one or two side dishes, out of the 8 available side dishes! Alternatively, they can order a platter of 3 to 4 differently colored mini burgers. The prices vary accordingly.

Food items presented for tasting were - ¬†

Tangy Mango: Served in a tall glass with a straw, it consisted of 'mango puree mixed with spices and topped up with sprite'. Liquid nitrogen was poured on it live, right on the dining table, to create the visual appeal of cold vapour and fog. The menu lists Tangy Mango under Molecular Drink category, but apart from the liquid nitrogen showmanship, it's actually a nice tangy mocktail, which a single person may find difficult to finish.

Menu Price: Rs. 205/-

Arabic Mezze Platter: An inviting circular brown cane basket or 'tokri' arrived with an array of 5 black egg shaped melamine bowls consisting of - hummus, baba ganoush, peri hummus, yougurt dip and tabouli. Placed within the arc of these bowls were 4 crisp sesame seeds topped falafels, and the arc was completed into a circle with 16 portions of conical pita breads. 5 long triangular lavash were fixated in a vertical position between the aforesaid bowls and the basket.

The platter looked inviting and sumptuous. Falafels were well cooked and crunchy. Pita breads were soft and porous. Lavash portions were also good. All the dips were excellent. Peri hummus and tabouli were new for me.

For those who don't know -

"Peri Peri or Piri piri¬†sauce (used as a seasoning or marinade) is Portuguese in origin. It is made from crushed chillies, citrus peel, onion, pepper, salt, lemon juice, bay leaves, paprika, pimiento, basil, oregano, and tarragon."

"Tabouli or Tabbouleh is a Middle Eastern vegetarian dish traditionally made of tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, bulgur, and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt."

Menu Price: Rs. 295/-

Veg Espetada: This vegetarian avatar of Espatada, a popular Portuguese dish, consisted of a hanging dish skewed with stuffed mushrooms, stuffed potato, marinated paneer and pineapple with onion & bell peppers. The hanging metallic skewer was quite long, which made the dish look quite spectacular. Placed below the skewer was a rectangular black plate full of potato wedges (a side dish) and a dip. The wedges were thick, uniformly cooked and well seasoned. They tasted excellent. In fact, they were one of the best potato wedges that I have had till date.

The marinated food portions were big and juicy. Though their marination was different from the ones that we are normally used to, they tasted quite nice.

Menu Price: Rs. 375/-

4 Veg Mini Burger: 4 diagonally arranged mini burgers, with their burger buns colored in the hues of red, black, white and brown, arrived on a flat wooden tray with a handle, like the one used for serving pizzas. They were accompanied with a side serving of spicy rice, in a circular ceramic bowl.

The burgers constituted of - onion, lettuce, tomato, pickled jalape√±o, peri mayo and aloo patty. Unlike others, aloo patty in the red burger was also red colored. These patties were actually frozen patties, that were fried just before serving.

Apparently, being a franchise, the restaurant finds it difficult to change the cooking protocols, set in place by the restaurant brand. Resultantly, though the burgers looked dainty and beautiful, they lacked the taste of fresh potato mixture and presence of other elements like caramelized onions etc., which assist in making a burger sumptuous and popular.

Upon suggesting, the management did agree to discuss the recipe and cooking modifications required to enhance the taste of their burgers, with the parent company. Hopefully, in near future this beautiful dish of theirs will taste as yummy as their other dishes.

Menu Price: Rs. 445/-

In Barcelos, apart from the other condiments, you will find each dining table laced with 4 variations of Peri Peri, the famous Portuguese sauce. Named as per the varying degree of their chilly content, these sauces are named - Mild Peri, Very Peri, Supa Peri and Tangy Lemon. I tried a small portion of each. It will require some more tryings, before I can develop a taste for them.

The dining experience at Barcelos was quite nice. Staff was warm and hospitable, and quite apt in answering the diners' queries. This kind of staff training is very much expected of the new restaurants offering unusual foreign cuisines or fusion foods. I was glad to witness the same there.

With ample space, extensive platters and appealing beverages, Barcelos seems a cool hangout place to chill out with a group of friends or peers.

Visited Barcelos on 15th Oct with my family...We were all looking forward to visit this interesting place with Afro Portuguese cuisine . ¬†Unfortunately the visit was not all that great. ¬†First the ambiance, the AC was not chilled enough when we entered at around 12.30, perhaps they put it on late and to be fair, it ¬†did ¬†get cool later. The Chairs and Sofa seating were very badly aligned with the Table height. If you sat on the Sofa, you found yourself well below the table and if you chose the chairs you were ¬†reclining too far back.

The food - pretty average overall. They had placards announcing Kolkata Bekti so we ordered the Bekti items as starters. ¬†Being lovers of Bekti fish for years, we found the fish served not really having the authentic taste of Bekti, the pieces seemed to disintegrate when you picked them up with a fork and the flesh inside was rather too fibrous.. ¬†The stuffed chicken kabab was okay but the boneless bekti with parmesan cheese was horribly salty. ¬†The signature Chicken with Peri Peri sauce was pretty average . Spicy rice as a 'side' with some dishes had long but thick coarse ¬†grained rice - when we inquired what rice they use we were told Basmati. I think it was Basketti - a cheaper different variety altogether and not at all suitable to serve at a place like this.

Service was amateurish ¬†and I would not like to blame the young boys and girls ¬†- they were attentive but seemed to lack training. ¬†Slow to bring the food and over quick to clear the dishes when one had barely put down one's spoon/fork. ¬† Pile up of dirty dishes near the kitchen counter in full view of guests was not a pleasant sight to look at.

On the dushomi day we decided to visit this Portuguese restaurant located at the top floor in Acropolis Mall... we were warmly welcomed and seated comfortably, order was quickly served except for the mocktail which they forgot and was given after the bill was placed and that too on reminder... Talking about the food which was very really nice and it was in great quantity... food and decor is really nice but however felt that the staff couldnt manage the population even though the tables weren't full...really looking forward to the improvised service next tym :)

The one n only barcelos in kolkata.. A decent place to go and try something out of the box .. The advertisements of the red, black burgers tempted me to check this out.. We ordered half chicken and 3 mini burger with spicy rice as side dish.. Half chicken was delicious.. The chicken was barbequed n roasted with peri peri sauces.. In the tables they also provided us with varities of tangy, spicy, peri peri sauces.. The types of sauces are the speciality of the dishes.. Every dish is cooked using the sauces.. We tried all the 4 types of peri peri sauces with the chicken.. The mild peri peri tasted nice... The burgers were the best and hence is the main attraction of the place.. Black and red burgers were awesome with spicy sauce and yummy chicken stuffings.. White burger amongst all was the best.. The bread is yummy and soft. White burger was prepared with lots of mayonnaise and cheese with chicken cooked in sauce and stuffed inside.. The place is decently priced.  Quantity is good for the price they charge and its totally worth visiting them..

overhyped , overpriced and UNDER STAFFED !!
we went in group of three for dinner on nabami 2016 and as expected it turned out to be an almost full house. now when you dont have staff to cater the space efficiently , don't fill it up entirely. we waited for like 15 minutes for getting the menu card , another 20 mins for getting attention of the staff for placing the order , the food though came in without much lag , again almost half an hour to clear the cheque. We were so frustrated with the management to get this kind of service even after paying a service charge of 10% on the bill, seeing only 3-4 stewards attending all the tables, the receptionist also helping them apart from handling the front desk.I thought of reporting this , but they don't even have a feedback form in their system.
The food we had was 3 MINI BURGERS (RED/BLACK/WHITE) , CHEESY CHICKEN ESPETEDA , HALF GRILLED CHICKEN WITH PERI PERI SAUCE . these stood nice , well presented and came with one side each as we chose. the Burgers and espeteda are the ones i would like to recommend. For dessert , they restricted us with just two options , none with chocolate in them , we had BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE which fell short of perfection, asking for a long way to improve.
Overall , i was not satisfied with this kind of experience for the price paid , it was okay for a one time go.

Visited this place on Navami afternoon, and it was totally packed. As we needed only two seats, so the wait was comparatively much less as compared to the big gang of friends who had to wait for atleast an hour :P. The ambience, decor everything impresses you the moment you enter Barcelos. The staff is over- friendly , I must say, as they were coming by and asking us if we needed anything else every 15 minutes . ¬†Coming to the food, the mini burger platter is definitely a must try. I ordered for the Red, White and Black burger - ¬†and each tasted much above average, though the black was on the sweeter side. Next, the stuffed chicken kebabs is not that great, it was very bland with regard to the taste, and you need to use the sauces well to get a taste out of it. Now coming to the main dish, Chicken Espetada - This was a true delight, everything was perfect in this dish. The chicken was cooked to perfection , perfect balance of spices and order this dish or any espetada for its presentation :D.
Overall, very nice place and you wont be disappointed by their service and food.¬†
P.S. - Order your side dishes carefully :)

Went there with my family during durga puja. It was rather empty compared to the other food chains adjacent to it and we didn't mind. We ordered a half chicken with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies,chicken Cataplana with youghurt dip, grilled fish sizzler and parmesan crushed betki. The chicken  was soft, juicy and the mashed potatoes was one of the best I ever had. The chicken Cataplana was also good, with the sauteed vegetables. But the best dishes of the evening were the ones with fish.

The only problem we faced was the unavailability of sangria, contrary to what the signs read outside of being Kolkata's only sangria bar. So we had to settle for classic mojito. And also the service was not up to the mark for such a place. But the food was great.

This was the last day in the city and this outlet happened purely because of coincidence. I was just at the acropolis mall¬†when I saw this store. And as the waiter informed it is only present in Delhi, Jaipur and Kolkatta as of now. They have ¬†plans to open an outlet in Mumbai soon so I am glad that I came down this rather exclusive restaurant.¬†

Well, the concept of peri-peri has already been tried by me in the Vasant Kunj outlet of Nandos. The peri peri is divided¬†into 4 categories basis their spice quotient. But the concept of the black burger is something unique and I definitely ¬†wanted to give it a try. So I ordered a peri peri black magic, which was their simplest chicken burger along with a side ¬†of grilled vegetables.¬†

The burger was definitely above average but considering the cold that I had, I wasn't able to make out the subtle flavours¬†within the food. The grilled vegetables (which included capsicum, zuccini and mushrooms) seemed to be fried a bit too much ¬†along with plenty of addition of soy sauce which I am not so much a fan of. ¬†

I will give this place another try whenever I am in the city to try out their black and red burgers.

Hopefully these guys - come soon to other cities ( I refer to the likes of Bangalore and Hyderabad). And guys, please do get an Amex card machine. :D

Portuguese restaurant at the heart of the city has owned its fame through the taste of exotic peri peri spice from Africa. The style of serving the dishes is unique and gives u a fine dining experience. We had the following:

Cheesy chicken fries: piled up from base with French fries, colored peppers n chicken with loaded cheddar cheese n baked with peri peri. Unique flavor makes ur tastebuds feel good.
Full Chicken [Barcelos special]: the whole chicken marinated with different spices roasted till perfection gives a blend of all flavours when u feel the food. Served with mashed potatoes n pepper tossed rice is perfect as a wholesome meal.

Overall, unique taste n blend of spices that flavors the tastebuds to visit again.

One of the Durga Puja days, I visited this place for lunch along with a friend on mine. It's a newly opened restaurant, so did not really know what all food to order. Inspite of new, the place had 15-30 mins waiting due to festive season. However we agreed to sit on bar top, hence we immediately got a place. 

After entering the place, the set up seemes TGIF alike. Due to the festive rush the service wasn't prompt, but all the staffs were very humble and accommodative. The menu looked very unique and delicious. We picked up Cheesy Chicken Espetada (came with 2 side dishes), Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt Dip. From the drinks we got Classic Mojito & Orange Sangria & Nutty Fruity Sunday for dessert. Food and Drinks left us lip smacked, did not give any opportunity to complain. Also I was quite tempted with the Coloured Burgers and Chicken Grills and couple of other items, which I definitely could not try due to appetite. However people around me whoever ordered those seemed like enjoyed eating those as well. I'll wait for my next visit to this place and try out the rest of the items. And not to forget, there non-alcoholic molecular drinks are a treat to the eyes as well as taste buds (I suppose). They have a smoking booth inside the restaurant.

Below goes my individual ratings segment wise:

Food- 5/5
Drinks - 5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Ambience - 4/5
Music & Comfy - 3.5/5 (They were busy handling the crowd, this segment remained unnoticed)
Value for Money - 4.5/5
Overall  Rating - 4.5/5
Revisit/Recommend - 5/5 (Definitely)

Portuguese cuisine in Kolkata is definitely a crowd puller. The city boasts of some of the best restaurants in the country but all this while it lacked a Portuguese restaurant which has been fulfilled by Barcelos. Located in Acropolis Mall the ambience is just the right kind of escape to kick away your vexatious and enjoy a wholesome with either your family or special someone. Nurturing a penchant for everything exotic it was the colour splash of mini burgers that instantly drew my attention. Although they were mini but it gave me quite a tough time to finish it. The icing on the cake was the myriad range of assorted peri peri sauce that imbued new flavours everytime I added them in rotation! Loved the decor and the configuration of cutleries especially flavoured water. Keep up the good work!

The concept of coloured burger buns is very innovative and cool. We had ordered the 2 chicken 2 mutton platter,out of which the mutton patty with black bun was the best. We had also ordered a grilled fish sizzler and a chicken cataplana with yoghurt dip, both of which were equally good. Among the deserts,we had Tiramisu and a choc truffle cake which were a bit of a letdown, which is why am deducting that 0.5 rating. However, its definitely something new and a must visit. Thumbs up to the ambience.

The one stop place for a perfect continental meal. The place was on my wishlist for a while now and it has realy stood upto its reputation it seems. The ambience was great and the service was fast and apt. When it comes to food, the place is actually up there with the top continental joints in the city. We ordered a Fully stuffed non veg burger with one side, a steak and a cosmoplitan. The burger was a sight to watch and the steak was absolutely fantastic. It is definitely worth the money. A must visit .

After much wait with great expectations we finally landed at Barcelos.
Location: top floor of the Acropolis Mall, beside a number of strong competitors viz. Chili's, Asia kitchen etc.
We went on Nabami afternoon at around 12.15am and to our surprise we were the first and only guest then. Though shortly it started filling quiet fast. 
Ambience: Loved the ambience, hanging lamps, posters. Little more care to be taken for cleanliness. The peri peri sauces' bottles are little sticky due to usage. 
Service: some of the staffs are new and are not fully aware of the menu list, even went totally blank for few seconds sometime!
The foods were served quiet fast though.
Food: We opted for two soft drinks kiwi cooler and mint cooler. Both are absolutely amazing. The presentations are nice. 
4 variety of peri peri sauces are available  , on the basis of their hotness: tangy, mild, very peri, supa peri. We opted for mild peri for all our orders as all the 4 sauces are available on table all the time. 
We chose stuffed chicken kebab as starters. It was quiet bland if one doesn't or sauce separately. The barcelos signature style grilled chicken is just amazing. Little oil, tender chicken, dip and sides as per one's choice...perfect!
Our next selection was chicken picantte that turned out to be a little disaster for us. It's supposed to be stuffed chicken. In stuffing they used bread among other ingredients like cheese, veggies etc which was a little turn off. I don't prefer bread in such form, also the  stuffing was on the sour side. We did not like it.
Price: on the higher side. Meal for 2 costed around 1900Rs.

The ambience is pleasant and service was superb. They are specifically famous for the Peri peri chicken and indeed it was great. You get to select two side dishes or one side dish.  We had a half chicken in peri peri sauce and chose a single side dish which was potato wedges woth peri peri mayo dip and it was also yummilicious. I just loved it. Liquor and a wide range of burgers and smoothies and desserts are also available. We were too full to try those out. Do visit this loveky place if you go to Acropolis  Mall.

Barcelos has a very unique menu. But administration fails quite abit.
The staff is inexperienced which shows. They don't maintain the restaurant well. Heavy iron chairs are really difficult to move. AC doesn't work properly. We wanted to sit in a corner with designed interiors but couldn't as the staff stated the AC doesn't work right in that area. The AC where we eventually Sat was supposed to be working well but I strongly recommend they check on that too.
The food was good though they could use a few more minutes in the oven.( It took a great deal effort to cut the pecanetta bread)
I would really  suggest the administrators take note of their dysfunctional interiors and make some much needed improvements

The home of Portuguese flavour, Barcelos has finally arrived in Kolkata bringing with it the unique and the much talked about Peri Peri taste. Situated at the fourth floor of Acropolis Mall, Kasba, Barcelos has caught everybody's attention from the first moment it arrived with its colourful looking burgers.

Food here is impeccable. From the appetizers section we had ordered their-

*Drumsticks: Big sized legs smeared in a satisfactory layer of peri spices and sauces and served with grilled lines on them. With this they asked us to team up the peri sauces on the table. This item was delectable and is a strong, strong recommendation.

*Boneless Thighs with Onion and Pepper: At first this may seem plain to you, but after teaming this up with peri mayo, this item gets elevated to a whole different level. If I have to describe this dish in one word, nothing comes to mind apart from the word 'delicious'.

Even though we were three people, we were semi full after having this much amount of food. Somehow, even though the quantity of food was normal, it managed to fill our tummy. Next we ordered their main course.

*Garlic Fish with Rice: Basa fish, deboned and cooked to perfection. With a hint of garlic, the fillet fell apart with each bite. Rice was okayish. They could have done a better work with it. However, the fish more or less made up for it. Personally, for me, it did not beat the appetizers.

*Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt Dip: Beautiful presentation. Served in a traditional cataplana was a mix of small chicken pieces with peppers of different colours, chickpeas, olives and mushrooms. Again, I was not much impressed with the rice. However, upon mixing the yogurt dip with rice, it did help in typing the dish together.

By this time, we were very full. The quantity again was normal, but I guess the food was semi heavy which ended up in getting us filled that easy.

For drinks we ordered their popular molecular drinks:

*Tangy Mango: A slurp of your childhood. Tangy mango mixed with spices and served in a theatrical way. The drink was tasty. A perfect end to our dinner.

*However we decided to order one last drink, Kit Kat Shake: Served in a mason jar was a thick Kit Kat Shake. Chocolatey in flavour and good taste-wise, but I personally preferred their Molecular Drink more.

Had heard a lot about Bercelos. So decided to went there today. The ambience was good but during puja one really cant blame for any blemishes. We took burgers, appetizers, main course. I found it ok but nothing out of box. Might be due to the puja rush. But will definitely visit on one of the normal days.

One of the best places to dine out with friends or family. I went there during the rush hour of the puja's, but the service was really good. We had ordered chicken steak which was really good... The steak was absolutely perfect and worth the price.

We came here with great expectations. Located alongside such good restaurants, Barcelos seemed promising but it was quite a letdown, frankly because of the lack of taste. We just wanted to have a quick  bite, so we went for the 3 chicken burgers, that were colourful burger buns with chicken and maybe 3 different kinds of sauce, which we guessed from the taste, or maybe they were all the same, but we weren't given the descriptions at all. The dish was not so great. Just coloured buns with chicken, mayo and salad. We had the Trinchado rice. Very little rice with almost a quick homemade chicken with peppers and too many black olives and served in a  weird looking cup that was frankly unappealing. These two and the bill was 900. Ambience, service and staff are no doubt good but the food wasn't up to the mark for my liking.

Went there today with my friends @soumik Sensharma , Rahul Maity , Soham Biswas and Shashwat Bhattacharjee, who introduced me to the place.
First impression, a decent ambience with live sports screening and decent staffs.
The food the straight up amazing. We ordered chicken steaks at first, and it was by far one of the best we ever had. Secondly we ordered some burgers and those were amazing as well. The meat here is very well cooked. It's pretty juicy and tasted great. We ordered some beers and cocktails as well and they were made to perfection.
Would surely recommend.

Had been hearing about this joint for quite sometime. Went there on an early Saptami evening. Was a bit disappointed. The chicken was cold and hard. The kitkat shake that we had ordered was just about okay. The LIT wasn't what LIT is supposed to be. Inam not sure if the quantities of gin,White rum, or vodka. It tasted more of soda and lemon. I dont know if this was for the pujas or something but expected more out of it.A bit expensive. Waiters were pretty good and knew their stuff.

To start off. Really liked the food. 
The ambience was amazing. The service of the staff was very friendly and humble. 
Now coming to the food. 
The Boneless chicken thigh was amazing, a different type of conceptual food. The main course was very satisfying as well. I had ordered a 4 chicken burger with French fries and a half grilled chicken with mashed potato. The grilled chicken was fabulous. 
Only one thing, I would prefer more options on the liquor menu to choose from. Hopefully they'll add to it. 
The best part, not all walk-in restaurants have in the city is the SMOKING ROOM. 
To sum it up, I've had a great experience at Barcelos. 
Looking forward to dine again.

Today on mahashasthi thought of having food at the restaurant but to my utter disappointment the food was horrible n so was the service.The music was too loud which all the more ruined my experince.The service was not upto the mark as they were not prompt n had no clue about the food they were serving.I would say guys Chili's is a far better place to dine than Barcelos.The place is too clumsy i have to admit n a bit shaby.To add my list of disappointments at this place they had no washrooms or did they give us finger bowls n instead told us to wipe our hands using tissue papers are u kidding me??Food was horrible however i must say the burger was on point n so were the milkshakes.Thats it rest of the food was horrible n i must say their chicken preparations are dry.If u r only fond of burgers give this place a try or else dont visit this place.The staff there asked for my honest feedback n then had the audacity to ask me as to why i was rating them so poorly n they would in turn lose their jobs.Thats not my problem,one word for my experience-DISGUSTING!!!! Never visiting this place again

barcelos is one fine place to have chicken.located on top floor of acropolis mall,it's making a lot of noise among food lovers.The chicken espatada has the juiciest chicken, with rice and mashed potato.They have an inclination to serve food with piri piri masala,which is actually "peri peri" and can be claim to be both African and Portuguese in origin.anyways,their nitro drinks is another cool feature.We had kiwi kooler and tangy mango,which were bot fizz and flavour.The interior is chic,and the waiters are knowledgeable and courteous.

Had Potugese food in the famous outlet of Nandos in Oman and was craving for it eversince. Barcelos is a good alternative added to the gastro-map of Kolkata...on the top floor of Acropolis mall...Kasba. We tried Chicken Espetada which comes in an interesting decor and grilled chicken which was just perfect juicy and tender. To finish off was th Tangy Mango....their molecular drink...a fuming cold drink of unique blend.....super yummy!!! Only thing is the menu is highly chicken based....fish prawn lamb pork options are very few. You'll hv choice of four grades of Peri-peri sauce......an African pepper sauce....of varying hotness.....to light up your dishes. The glowing world map on the wall with their locations pointed out is an awesome sight as well.

'BARCELOS' is the first Portuguese cuisine restaurant in Kolkata.It is located on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall near Kasba New Market.The ambience of the resaturant is good,many portugese wall paintings are hanging on the wall.I've been there with my lover from two weeks back for dinner.We ordered Molecular Drinks:- 'Kiwi Cooler' & 'Tangy Mango' as a beverages,both are tasty & quantity is good also.Then We ordered Mediterranian Kebabs:- 'Chicken Wings',it is four pieces juicy chicken legs,not so oily,taste is good.We also ordered Barcelos Signature Dish:- '1/2 Chicken by itself',two pieces big chicken with grilled,taste is very good,two pieces chicken is sufficient for two presons.Their service is too fast,they served all the items just same time.Also we ordered Portugese Perfection:- 'Chicken Espetada',it is geting cold for their quick service,presentation is very unique,6 pieces chicken hanging with a spring & they served it with some rice & french fries.Atlast we took Dessert:- 'Chocolate Fondant with vanilla Ice-cream',it is mouthlicking.overall nice experience.Price is expensive.They took additional 10% service charge.

Love the ambiance and the bright decor..!! They are the Peri Peri specialist and this dominates almost all the dishes. Tried both fish and the chicken. The preparations are delicious and the chicken/fish and are absolutely soft and juicy. Only thing that I didn't like was the huge proportion of rice in Chicken sizzlers...the chicken could have been more than the quantity of rice that was served, otherwise food is ¬†good and tasty.¬†
U do not have to wait for long after ordering your food, they are quite prompt.

This place holds quite a surprise for its customers. The interior fashions a contemporary look with dim lighting. There is a beautiful wall piece showing the map of the world with lights. The waiters are courteous and professional enough. 

This place is an expert in preparing its dishes with Peri Peri (also read as Piri Piri) sauces. The menu has a variety of grilled dishes as well. We had ordered Chicken Liver with Garlic roll, Plain Chicken Burger and Peri Peri Bloody Red Chicken Burger. The liver was amazing with all the sauces and the garlic bread roll. The burgers on the other hand could have been better we felt.

We are yet to try something from the grill section. Looking forward to it soon.

if you are looking for trying out Portugese and African cuisines, then please visit this eatery located on the upper level of food court of Acropolis Mall, Kasba. Their cuisines are based on different types of peri peri sauce - a tint of which can be tasted by the guests from the bottles stacked at the dining area before placing the order. The staffs are courteous and helpful. The grilled chicken with less oil are the best ones to try out. The chicken was soft and juicy from inside, but somehow i felt that the flavour of the sauce is too tangy..Love the idea of little cute flag marking the choice of the sauce presented with the dish.

I was bored with the Indian and Chinese around. Decided upon this place with the family.
Much like hoppipola, the music was excessively loud. But that was toned down soon after requested.
Now coming to the food, absolute bliss. The chicken, marinated for over 24 hours, is precisely the best chicken in any form. The lemon rice and mini burgers.
Please visit this place to give your tastebuds a different joyride.

The world of Peri Peri comes to Kolkata ! and they should be at home considering Kolkata love for all things hot .

We went for lunch on a weekday . Four of us .

Ambience : Nice place bit of american diner feel .

Service: They are too eager or probably since the place was mostly empty

Food :¬† we tried mostly the house favourites . Started with the Pear & chkn salad . It was excellent and with the right infusion of peri peri sauce just awsum.
Followed it up with Chkn Espetada which is kind of sikh kabab with herbs, rice and veggies .
Next was Chkn Cataploana with yogurt dip a rice dish with chkn and salad and an excellent yogurt based dip .
The ball dropped in the desert section. We ordered the Berries cheese cake which unfortunately was hard and tasteless. We informed the server and they changed it to Chocolate fondant with ice cream at no extra cost .
Overall a nice place for the family . Food is mild and the peri peri sauces are at the table. Be ready to be blows by the Supra Peri ÔÅä
Oh they have a bottomless policy on cokes!!

We had a table booked for 5 persons via Dineout and they had it ready when we arrived and were swiftly accompanied to the table. The decor is quite nice with a couple of tv's displaying various sports channels. 

Coming to the food, we had their signature chicken wings and the Peri Peri Paneer Kababs for starters. The chicken wings were quite different from the normal barbeque wings which are available elsewhere. These had a smoky taste to it and were delicious. The Paneer too was nice but I found it to be a bit bland. For main course we ordered a cheesy chicken espetada, a chicken espetada, a garlic fish with rice, 1/4 th chicken and stir fried vegetables. All the main courses were ample for a single person and they were all perfectly cooked and beautifully served. The only thing that I noticed was that there wasn't much of a difference between the cheesy and the non cheesy espetada. I would have liked to experience some distinct difference in taste between the two which wasn't the case. 

Also for drinks we had ordered Hey Rosy, Kiwi Cooler and the Peachy Iced Tea which were all very refreshing.

The only complain that I have is that the table we sat at had a couch on one side and chairs on the other side. Though the couch by itself was quite comfy but the difference in height was a quite a bit and while eating, you really had to sit up straight in order to ensure you did not spill the food. This also needs to be kept in mind that I am 6 feet tall and had this problem. Someone shorter would definitely have a bigger problem than I did. 

The overall experience was quite satisfying and our server Samprita made sure that we enjoyed our meal to the fullest. The service is hands down one of the best in the city. 

I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to try something different from the usual cuisines we have on offer in the various restaurants in Kolkata.

Barcelos here we go
Ambiance:
Well done place. Chairs are very uncomfortable.leg space can be cramped.
Crockery:
Plates are exactly 4 inch squares metal plates. Very difficult to eat.
Had to ask for a fork and knife as the staff didnt provide any at the table.
Menu:
Some variety would be good. Pictures dont match what you will get at the table so be careful.
Food:
Food was ok, nothing exceptional to write home about. The chicken we ordered was quite small in quantity. They said it would serve two but honestly it couldnt serve one properly.
Service:
Work needed here, staff still need training at the meet and greet counter.

Stuff under trained. Food below average. The falafel hummus which I have tried at road side shops tastes better. The milkshake was ok ok.
Now the burgers...for which they are famous. Just bogus. In the name of black bun they just serve a little more brown bun. Patty's are average. Sides horrible. Specially the grilled veggies. They were actually disgusting.

It was a relief for me when I saw Barcelos in Kolkata.. similar to this we have Nandos in Bangalore the concept of peri peri chicken.. this is where you need to go and oder for chicken platter in peri peri sauce and nothing else.. they have four varieties of sauces which are rich in flavor.. to go along.with chicken you need beer which is not an option, so they need to work on that. Ambience is good, staffs need to be wear smile on their faces to make the guests feel comfortable... All the best!!

Portuguese dishes that too in Kolkata... Yes, Barcelos has made it a reality. Mostly, got their footprint on African continent, this global restro-chain serves Portuguese & Mediterranean cuisine. The decor is quite impressive. We, a group of 5 people had ordered -
Starter :
# Cheesy chicken espetada - Portuguese kebab delicacy
# Paneer espetada
*Espadetas are served along with two sides which you could choose out of 5 options like mashed potato, french fries, spicy rice, green salad
# Stuffed mushroom kebab
# Non-veg kebab platter : basa fish, chicken, mutton kebabs extremely succulent and tender
# Chicken Ceaser salad
# Greek salad
Main-course:
# Grilled fish with spicy rice: served with saute exotic veggies like zuccini, button mushroom, red n yellow bell pepper, English cucumber cooked in tangy sauce
# Chicken cataplana with yogurt dip
# Lemon fish sizzler
Dessert:
# Brownie with vanilla ice-cream
# Tiramisu
The have got bottles of four different types of peri peri sauces on table. The only thing missing here is liquor. They have confirmed that they have applied for bar license and expecting the same in next couple of month.

This international restraunt has been in my list for quite sometime. Finally got a chance to visit this place last month. It has gota very classy decor and a very cozy ambience. Hostility and the service of the staffs are quite impressive.
Now this not a suitable place for people with a typical Indian taste rather more of a place for experimental foodies. And their speciality is the 'peri peri' sauce which is available in four different level of spices.
We ordered for -
Peri Peri grill chicken ( 1/2 by itself ) - it was nice and a bit different from mostly available grill chicken in other restraunts. I wish the chicken would have been a biy more soft.
Stuffed Mushroom - it was juicy and tasty but I dont think it was freshly cooked as it was served cold.
Garlic fish with rice - It was my favourite among all other. It was really tasty specially the basa which was perfectly cooked.
For desert we wished to have Tiramisu but unfortunaetly they informed that it was not available and it was quite unexpected from such a reatraunt. Anyways we ordered for cheese cake which was quite tasty.
Quantity is as sufficient as of two people.Pocket pinch is generally on the higher side. They charge a service tax of 10%. Overall the visit was a satisfactory one.

A nice and cosy restaurant located inside the Acropolis Mall. This is probably a new joint here as we haven't seen this before. So had to try it out and I would say it did not disappoint us at all. The staff were too courteous and had a smile on their face all the time. We had ordered Arabic Mezze Platter which is basically pitas with a ¬†number of tasty dips. We loved it. We also tried Barcelos Signature Half chicken with sides and Mutton Kebab Sizzler. They were both very tasty and juicy. The portions were awesome and these 3 dishes could happily fill 4 of our hungry tummies. Will definitely go back to try out the other dishes in the menu. the colourful burgers looked interesting.

We went there some months back and thus I may not remember the name of the dish properly.

Firstly I loved the decor, somewhat different than the traditional decorations of restaurants with which we are so accustomed. The guys there were quite helpful.

We ordered read meaty (lamb burger) and black mutton burger along with french fries with dips and bread. Add to these, these was Caesar salad and grape fruit punch and mint blast in drinks. The drinks were really refreshing and the burgers were too yummy. For all of us who knew only chicken burgers, (thanks to KFC) and love burgers, this place is a must.

Do visit and I will surely visit again.

We went to this place for dinner. Being on a weekday the restauran was only half filled. So service were very good propmt. The staffs were aware of preparation and ingredients of the items and that is a very good thing. The ambience is very nice, very brighly lit with comfortable seating. It based on the same concept as Nandoos. I have been to Nandoos in England and I liked this place more because of larger selection of foods. ¬†Burgers and wraps dominate the menu. The black and red burgers are interesting. The bun is made of coco powder and beetroots extract respectively. The lamb patty was very juicy and perfectly cooked. The chicken I found little dry though. The peri peri sauce is also very good but little milder on Indian tastebud unless you go for the hottest one. ¬†All in all a very good place to hang out and spend some time with family and friends.

I am told there is a new South African restaurant in town and my interest is piqued with my mom üòç. There is nothing remotely South African on the menu. I quiz the manager and am told the chain has its origins in South Africa but the food is largely Portuguese. While the menu does not have any one clear direction in terms of roots, there is enough to satisfy every kind of palate. So this Barcelos is famous for its flame grilled Peri Peri menu and has carved a niche for itself by introducing to the discerning foodies their own brand of innovation. 
The ambience is very pleased and calm. The lighting used, the wood planks and the artifacts displayed add up to the comfort. The theme of Portugal is reflected through the interiors of the restaurant. Different varieties of peri-peri sauce dispensers are kept on each table. Choose from their signature chicken dishes which come in portions of a quarter, half or full. range of Lebanese dips and sauces to indulge in at the start of the meal, and the Arabic mezze platter also finds place on the Barcelos menu.This place is highly recommended if you like chicken, but fish and lamb barely skim the menu. There flamed grilled chickens are awesome. Juicy & grilled to perfection. Drinks good perfectly blended, taste good to me. Chef is very friendly and talented. I m very much fish person I was carving more variety on fish after all this is kolkata.

Very trendy, very chic with warm & friendly service. Had their signature coloured burger platter and Peri peri chicken which just fitted the bill to a T for 4 of us; accompaniments were potato wedges & french fries & grilled veggies. But special mention needs to be made of the wonderful mocktails served without which the dinner wouldhave been incomplete - the Kiwi Coolers & Berry cucumber - these were perfect. The pocket pinch worked out to 2900 - not too high not too low! And si, 'a satisfactory evening was had by all'!

Would have given this a 5, if the management was good. The ACs not working, leaking, wooden walls with termites. They don't have washroom inside! Why got no idea. Anyways good parts, the menu! Varieties n varieties of food. Black and red burgers haven't seen anywhere. Molecular drinks (that keeps on bubbling, and added nitrogen on top). Kebabs taste awesome. No alcohol for now. Nice cool interiors. Go again to try so much of food, but hope they work on bad parts

Bringing down the rating from my recent visit here. They reversed the quantity ordered, and server was adamant to rectify the order. Anyways we took what he bought. Portions are so damn small. Money worth 1.5/5.. also tried the red and black Burger's, it tastes no different, and patty was undercooked.. not happy sorry

One of my favorite place. Amazing burgers with peri peri sauces.. Tastes so yummy... Try the sweet and spicy kiwi cooler and cucumber drinks. Ambience is nice with really quick service.
The food was good - the Peri Peri Black Magic and the Red Meaty burgers. And their grilled chicken was super yum! But their 'Supa Peri' dip, supposedly the hottest on their menu, deserves a thumbs down from me - it just wasn't hot.
The theme is unique of the place. They have unique style of the Indian cocktail drinks. The service is good too and the host "Sampita" attend me infront of the restaurants , she give me hearty welcome and the first impression is very nice and awesome for me i love this place very much......

This is my new favourite haunt for grilled chicken. Its located on the top floor of Acropolis Mall. The staff are really friendly. I went on a friday afternoon, the restaurant was pretty empty. They've got a quirky decor. A world map showing the different locations of Barcelos across the world. It specialises in periperi flavored food. The chicken espetada caught my eye on the menu. Also, i saw a few people were being served with this weird contraption on which kebabs were dangling. That turned out to be the espetada. Some of the most delicious chicken i've ever had. Juicy pieces of chicken stuffed with cheese and sauce, served with a dip and two sides of your choice. We also ordered the periperi chicken sizzler served with kebabs and rice. It wasn't as great as the espetada. And two people could easily share a sizzler. The miniburgers looked yummy. They served these red buns and blackened buns. Looking forward to visiting again to try them soon. (:

Last night we went to Barcelos to celebrate my husband and sons birthday.Had booked a table in advance and informed them of the celebrations.
But there was nothing done on their behalf until we reminded them of the same.
Moreover the food was not upto the mark nor was the service.
We ordered for chicken steak and requested them to make sure that it was served without the skin.
When the dish arrived it had the skin on.
When we told the server he just took the dish away without any apologies and got it back in 5 mins -the same piece of chicken with the skin taken off.It was cold without the glaze and taste of a steak.Plus the steak looked raw.
Generally there are 4 Peri Peri sauces on the table.Yesterday there were only 2.
On asking then about the other 2 they said that they did not have it available.Y would a customer ask about this.Isnt the customer supposed to be told about this and apologised for the same.
I have been to Nandos in London which is on similar lines but believe me it stands out tall in terms of food quality,quantity and service.
Overall it was not worth the price we paid and a total disappointment.

The rating would have been lower had the decor and courtesy of the service been anything less than palatable. The food was bearable to be polite. I believe I should have tried something else on the floor.

Everyone deserves a second chance and Barcelos is no exception. After a horrendous first time experience here, the Barcelos team offered us a complimentary meal for two. But this time they made sure that it would be a pleasant experience for us. Souvik arranged everything for us and Upasana really took good care of us. The food was delivered in time and it was absolutely a bliss. The hospitality of the staff was exceptional. Altogether it was a memorable experience. Things don't need to be perfect as long as you are ready to take criticism and work on things to make it better. Won't be long before I visit this place again.

If one is in this part of the town a must visit joint. First thing that strikes you is the ambience. Awesome food.... but you have to got a taste of afro-portugese flavour. Went there with family and friend and tried lots of different varieties. ... special mention grilled trout... grilled fish with mild peri rice...

This franchise is a copy of Nandos. If you know or crave for nandos the Portuguese style peri peri grilled chicken this is the alternative. The food quality and drinks are decent. The chicken quality is not as good as the other franchise. If u haven't tried this type of Mediterranean food it's a must. I'm glad we are getting more and more of foreign cultural food here. The ambience is nice with very welcoming staff. Don't forget about the different sauce which is the main soul of these dishes, choose carefully. And try mutton burgers which taste better than chicken.

All hypes apart. The food is good not great. We tried the mutton kebab. That was well made. The wrap was disappointing. Though the lamb burger made up for it. Mocktails were okay. Not too great. Decor and ambience was upto the mark with helpful and attentive staff. Will I try it again? Probably. Have quite a few bit of the menu unexplored.

Good to have Barcelos in town. Have already been there twice and still have a lot to explore in the menu. The chicken liver with garlic roll is our favourite along with the signature dishes. They bring a different flavour to food. As far as the mocktails go, they are worth trying. Although the Burgers weren't a hit but overall was a good experience.

I have been quite keen on visiting this restaurant,but found it disappointing on terms of food.Now starting with ambiance and decoration,this place is decorated      well with quite average ambiance.The service was too good and the staff were too friendly.They were too cooperative in helping us choosing the right dish.The food was below average in taste but the way they represent it was praiseworthy.

Food-3.5/5
Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-3.5/5

Not worth visiting until you excessively love the cuisine they serveü§óü§ó

Heard heard so much about this place,  that we decided to visit it yesterday,  with my colleagues. What strikes you first is the ambiance of this place.  There is so much space here that a lot of children were running about freely.  No where else in kolkata do you find a restaurant with so much space. Service is great,  with very friendly attitude.  Felt at home the moment we entered. 
Coming to the food,  I have to mention that everything was exceptional here. Seen quite a negative reviews about the food.  I have to state that, people reviewing the food negatively should not venture out for anything different.  They should stick to standard Biryani and Chinese food, as there palate is suited for that only.  The grilled chicken with veri Peri is a must try.  Tried black burger with mutton and it was huge,  juicy and great to look at. It seems it is made for two people. Mocktails too were very well presented and different.
Will definitely visit again to try their hanging chicken in skewers. Can't recall the name though,  but looked very enticing.

Barcelos sucks....ordered 2 mutton 2 chicken burgers...coloured....they came back after 10 mins to inform us ...not in stock....ordered black mutton burger....look at the picture it's brown....waiter came up with innovative solution....blackened bun becomes bitter to taste...hence the've made it brown....Chicken Estepeda was good....as was Kiwi coolers and bottomless Fanta....fantastic ambience, good music, friendly people but shoddy service.....sabche baaje.....24 % vat+ service charge + service tax.....Chili's is way better, tastier and portions are good there....at Barcelos I felt cheated.....dekho it's early days yet and may be we chose the wrong items and came at the wrong time.....but it's our first Portuguese cuisine experience ...do try....

Planned to visit this new place on 14th August 2016 with my wife. We went for lunch as planned. Both of us ordered Chicken Steak with one side dish( one was with Fries and dip and the other one was with grilled veg). To be very honest this was the WORST chicken steak we had so far. Generally Chicken steaks are soft and tender. But here we found out that the Steak was too hard. It was so hard that it was difficult to cut with a knife as well and chew it. Now coming to the side dish the fries served was not evenly fried. Some of the fries were not cooked properly. The grilled veggies that were served were not up to the mark either.

When we shared our feedback with the person who came with the bill, he just listened and said we will look into this matter, he also offered us this same dish which we didn't take as we didn't wanted to go through the same pain once again. ¬†The Prices are way too high based on the quality of food was offered compared to other restaurants.

I don't think we will ever try this dish here and I strongly recommend my friends not to try this dish as as it will eventually lead to wasting your precious time and money here.

I find all the reviews here eulogising this place a bit more than what it is. Now I know why. More on that later!
So this independence day we decided to dine somewhere new and this was the only place at acropolis mall which we hadn't visited so naturally we zeroed in in barcelos.
The ambiance is simple..nothing too flashy but probably a selfie lover's delight because of the huge illuminated world map at a wall behind.
Now coming to the food. They claimed to be the only peri peri restaurant in town and offering a choice of 4 different types of peri peri sauce for its customers. We decided to go with a black peri peri mutton burger and fries as the side and a chicken steak with mashed potatoes. The burger was good..the patty juicy and the veggies fresh and crunchy. But the fries lacked seasoning and amidst the crowd of 4 bottles of peri peri sauce on the table top, I missed my salt and pepper sprinkler. The chicken steak however was sad. Sad because it was grilled with the skin on (and hence I felt like it was me who had the job of murdering the chicken before devouring it) and the presentation lacked finesse. It was to be honest bland chewy tasteless and a constant struggle to eat. We also ordered a molecular mango drink which was okayish- like your regular mango Panna dressed fancy for prom. And they'd pour liquid nitrogen and create a flashy show of an otherwise average drink. Finally dessert - chocolate ganache with vanilla ice cream..they probably forgot to heat the pastry a bit before serving and hence both the ice cream and the pastry were cold- it failed to create the usual contrasting hot and cold effect that you normally associate when you order things like these.
Finally coming to the waiters- they are polite courteous but but but they would keep suggesting you order whatever they say which is a big turn off. The sad steak and the dessert were all their suggestion. I wanted a rice dish and a chocolate fondant. Moreover they'd request you to add a zomato review then and there which explains the high ratings and people going ga ga over this place.
So the bottomline- happy and content? Not really
Would visit again? Maybe but turning a deaf ear to the waiter's suggestion.

We had Crunchy chicken mix in starters... I loved the cheesy taste n the crunchy texture of lavash. Then we took Whole Chicken peri peri.... Absolutely delicious, spicy yet tender. The mashed potatoes n fries were complementing it perfectly. Lastly in deserts... Tiramisu n Choco truffle cake... Both were heavenly. Overall an amazing experience...

Finally was able to try out the food at Barcelos. The standout items were: the chicken espetada (an appetiser), the chicken trinchando sizzled and the chicken mini burgers.
The food was quiet good and the quality of the chicken stood out. The quality of service was also noteworthy and a special thank you to our server, Raj, whose recommendations were spot on based on our mentioned preferences. Overall the place is worth eating at and the customer service is also great.

Not particularly impressed..but then again I have had Nandos which has the whole peri peri menu & they are spot on with their menu & flavours..anyhow the point is here the chicken is tasty & the sauces are good..i tried their chicken pita which was too dry & cold & nt enough dressing..their stuffed mushrooms didn't taste of the cheese at all..& their choc fudge with ice cream was a complete let down..the cake was thick & cold & not at all melt in the mouth..the whole dessert was cold which was not nice at all..
My advice is to go here for the chicken only especially if you are tired of kfc & want some variety in chicken..
The ambience & staff are both nice..

This restaurant boasts of an inviting interior with a comfortable dining environment.
3 chicken mini-burgers(red,black,brown), chicken steak,chicken picantte,stuffed chicken kebab,kiwi cooler are some of the delicious picks.
It is advisable to find out more on the content/nature of the food before placing an order. The description on the menu does not provide sufficient insight to someone reading for the first time.For instance,peri peri chicken sizzler and stuffed chicken kebab are so similar that ordering these together can be a monotonous meal!
I'll surely keep in mind to choose my order wisely the next time I drop in.

in all a great experience.  kudos to the people behind barcelos.  will definitely visit again.

Went to Barcelos with my wife as I had missed the one in New Delhi. 

We tried the "Family platter for Four", which consisted of one whole of a lovely grilled chicken, along with 4 regular sides and pita bread. We also ordered a platter of 4 small burgers and a bottomless glass of Coke

For sides we had Fries with dip, Wedges with dip, mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. The burgers came with a side of coleslaw 

The Black Mutton Burger and the Red Meaty, were juicy and soft. The chicken ones were not at all juicy. Pretty dry

Barcelos chicken no where stands to Nandos. Parts of the chicken were somewhat burnt, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Neither the sauces, can be compared to Nandos. Still the one sauce that played well on my tongue was the "Spicy Dip"

Unfortunately they don't have a washroom inside the establishment to wash hands. Leave going to take a leak. You will be handed "wet tissues" to wipe your hands

After planning and plotting for quite some time finally had the opportunity to visit this place with my brother.As we entered we were highly impressed by the warm and sober decor of this place.we had cheesy chicken espetada which comes with 2 sides(we had wedges with dip and spicy rice),kiwi cooler( a molecular drink),1/4 th chicken,peri peri bloody red burger,grilled fish with rice.now the presentation of all the dishes were excellent specially the chicken espetada.infact we were completely mesmerized by the look of the dish- juicy chicken pieces hanging from a kebab holder in a sheekh and cheese dripping from it...it was a beautiful sightüòÇ!it had basically the taste of chicken kebab stuffed with tomato(most probably).the burger was very healthy yet delicious and the kiwi cooler i felt was a bit like aampanna but nevertheless it was tasty.now the 1/4 th chicken was delectable and highly recommended.lastly arrived the grilled fish which was really good.it had 5 pieces of soft and tender basa fish fillets along with some grilled veggies(like zucchini,carrot,mushroom) and spicy rice.would definitely like to go back to try out their trout grilled fish.

My didi n I had been eyeing this place for a while.We both are always on the prowl of new restaurants opening up (almost daily :P) on the lanes,bylanes,malls of this food-loving city of ours making Kolkata a paradise for foodies like us. And Barcelos is surely one of those gems.
Situated on the floor above the food court of Acropolis Mall,Kasba which houses other exciting restaurants like Asia Kitchen, Hoppipola, Chilli's, this quiant cafe-like restaurant has nice decor which gives a warm vibe to this place.You can come with your other halves on a romantic evening or with family on a grand dinner maybe. We went there around 7 in the evening and found the place a bit deserted occupied by a group of foreigners on one side n 2 or 3 groups of families n friends occupying tables here n there.That's coz may be of the heavy evening downpour. But I inferred from the appearances of some that they were here for some serious business i.e. to taste good Portuguese food. And I hope they weren't disappointed by the wide n unique range of dishes this place had to offer starting right from the multi colored Burgers to the Trout Fish or other in-house delicacies that they offered. Trust me, we were just overwhelmed to find those kebabs brought in on a kebab holder i.e. with the 'sheekh' attached (refer to the picture below). I saw almost everyone ordering that ---"Cheesy Chicken Espatada" as the waitress suggested in our case. The service was smooth n the staff was quite hospitable.

We ordered Kiwi Cooler,which was really refreshing,(To note: Molecular Drink), Red colored burger (if u r short on budget just try one, without taking the platter of 4, that'll do just fine imo), Cheesy Chicken Espatada, 1/4 Chicken n Garlic Fish served with rice.As we were short on budget we couldn't try the Grilled Trout Fish,instead tried the Garlic Fish which was tender n delicious! My suggestion if u aren't short on budget definitely try the Grilled Trout Fish as its rare in Kolkata.May be I'll come back here for having the Trout Fish another time. :)

Headed to this joint at Acropolis Mall after catching a movie. For starters, we ordered two burgers, Peri Peri Black Magic, Peri Peri Bloody Red with Grilled Veggies and a plate of Cheesy Fries. For the main course, we went ahead with Chicken Trinchando Sizzler, Grilled Fish Sizzler and Chicken Steak with mashed potatoes. For drinks, we stuck to 2 Thums Up with unlimited refills.The burgers were pretty nice and the fries were amazing. Sizzler was great too and the chicken and fish chunks were nice and juicy. Quantity was just about right and sizzlers can be shared by two people. Service was prompt and the staff were really courteous. Helped us with the ordering too, something that I really appreciated.Overall a nice experience..would love to go back again sometime!Keep up the good work guys...Cheers!!!

The menu card rightly justifies the menu card  of serving portugese food. However it falls a little short of the expectations set. The food is good,tasty but oily. One needs to choose wisely here. The place has a quaint artistic old school resturant feel. Surely this place won't cater to all kinds of foodies

The news of Barcelos opening in Kolkata was really exciting. So visited with my friends. The place has it's ups and downs.
Decor is average to be honest, nothing too amazing. Music is also ok. Staff was polite and helpful.
Food is good, atleast I personally liked the sauces and flavours. Presentation was quite amazing though. The concept of colourful burgers was quite interesting, though they more or less taste the same. Chicken skewers were delicious. Mocktails were average.
I wouldn't mind going back again.

Kebabs served were really good in style.all fresh food, and to my surprise  ,it was really full on an afternoon .will be visiting again for sure. Pocket pinch is very fair with the unique tastes.Portuguese dishes r good, nd if u r a spicy lover then these dishes are really salivating.kudos to the entire team at barcelos. See u again soon.

Okay I have been hearing a lot about this place that has opened  in Acropolis mall.So finally we could make it to the place yesterday for dinner.I found an unusual similarity with nando's and being a fan of the same I loved the feeling.
We ordered for a cheesy chicken espetada along with  sides Coleslaw and french fries.Loved it it had tangy flavour because of the stuffed dried tomatoes and the chicken was so soft tender and we'll cooked.
I ordered for on tangy mango reading through the previous reviews and I loved it.
The only thing I didn't like that much was peri peri chicken sizzler I thought it could have been better.

Barcelos; I have been quite keen on visiting to this restaurant but honestly the expectations has gone in vain. 
- Service... No water served on the table even after 7-8 minutes of sitting. 

- Ignorant staff... I have no idea why there are waiters who don't have any idea of the items on the menu. Wrong suggestion of the attendant lead us to have the worst food possible. 

- Food... If anybody ask me to get into this place for a free trial now, I won't go coz I have had the most tasteless sizzler here. Today I realized thE butter rice means plain rice with a teaspoon butter on the rice. That's what the waiter said. Even after complaining he said this is butter rice. Weird. 

-Presentation... Very good. 

But it's not always necessary Jo Dikhta Hain Woh Bikta Hain. I think chili's is the best option for sizzler now. I rated this place 1 only because of its drink. Otherwise it's not worth a visit.

The concept of different coloured burgers is very unique. I was really hoping that they would each taste  different, unfortunately that did not happen. All burger buns taste the same so make sure to take different fillings. Otherwise the food is good. The sauces are amazing. One must try this place for sure.

There is a lot of good Places to eat in Kolkata, but this is for sure one of the really better experiences if you want something extra for your friends.
I got some really interesting and good tastes during the meal here. It was really well prepared, and the result as in the best restaurants. ¬†The restaurant is focusing on its Portuguese idea, and they do it well.¬†
I can recommend this place very warmly, and I do believe that you will find it in same way good and pleasant as me.
 The staff deserve to be mentioned as very service minded and highly skilled - and wow smiling... that is also making the total experience perfect.

We went to try Portuguese dishes. We had stuffed chicken for starters & mint blasts.
For main course: grilled trout fish with 1sides, chicken Picantte & stir fry vegetables. The fish was good, chicken okay. But we found the stir fry vegetables very sour. We couldn't finish it, was so sour for the pineapples.
Overall I found the restaurant good & depending on the location, prices are okay too.
Give it a try for a slight different taste.

With restaurants opening left and right in South Kolkata, it was not a surprise that another big chain opened in the coveted food court of Acropolis Mall, Kolkata, already home to plenty of other giants. Barcelos finally arrived in Kolkata, with all its heritage from Africa, Portugal and many other countries.. 
Even though I was in Kolkata for a few days only, I had made up my mind to try it out.. We went there on  my birthday üéâ, this Monday.

The menu we ordered was not out of the ordinary, and went with their specialities, with Burgers, Molecular drinks, espetadas and peri peri chickens.. Coming to the detailed menu, here we go:

Drinks:
We had 2 molecular drinks, Kiwi Cooler and Tangy Mango, and a regular mocktail, electric blue Fizz.
For those who don't know, molecular drinks are cooled by liquid Nitrogen in front of your eyes, and its a pretty unique experience. All of the drinks were very good, and for the first time in a very long time, I liked all of the mocktails in a single place. The kiwi cooler and Tangy Mango follows their name and sticks to the taste, and the electric blue Fizz had Minty taste.. Overall, one of the most complete mocktail experiences for me..

Starters:
We had cheesy chicken espetadas with French fries and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers.. Its worth to mention that the presentation of the espetadas is quite unique, hanging from the top like kebab pieces in a shop.. The chicken and cheese melted in our mouth straightaway, filled with their exotic spices it was a great experience. They served pretty big 6 pieces in a plate, perfect for our group of 3. The stuffed mushrooms were also perfect, not undercooked, which i find most of the time in restros. The mushrooms had 5 in a portion, which was a bit awkward for us, but it tasted brilliant nonetheless.

Main Course:
4-Chicken Mini Burgers.
One of the most iconic dishes of Barcelos, the mini Burgers were a treat to watch as well as taste. They serve two complementary sides of your choice with the Burgers, so we had grilled veggies and fries to go with it, and the preparation was excellent.. The color of the Burgers were not synthetic and were all organic, white from coconut milk, black from cocoa powder and red from beet root. It is pretty heavy and you should be looking to distribute the dish among 4 if you are planning to visit in a group.
Peri Peri Chicken Sizzler:
We have all heard about the peri peri grilled chicken in Barcelos, so we decided to go for the Sizzler.. And it was HUGE. Generous amounts of mushrooms and chicken on a bed of rice, the quantity is enough for a single person. The Sizzler was great and the rice was also very good, somehow I didn't like the peri peri sauce, but it's not bad and will obviously depend on different people.

Desserts:
We only had one, Chocolate Truffle, the only thing in the dessert menu other than Tiramisu which I wanted to order. I felt the dessert menu could have been better. The Truffle cake was excellent, and it went great with the vanilla scoop of ice cream with chocolate syrup on top. 

The serving time was really fast, and on this note, I would like to point out, that even though the waiters were very friendly and helpful, they did mess up with the timings, and served the starters and main course at the same time.. The pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side, but the food more than makes up for it.

Final verdict: Very much recommended for those who are meat lovers and enjoy exotic dishes and Burgers and want a good fine dining experience.

Visited the place last evening,with a lot of expectation. But sadly,wasn't satisfied with the taste of the food I had. I had ordered a chicken steak and a fish sizzler along with some cola. The steak arrived and I was surprised to see the size of it. It was much smaller than what is served in other similar joints. Then came the sizzler.... Being a foody ,
I anticipated it to be awesome just by the look of it. But sadly I must say,I found it to be one of worst sizzlers I have ever had. The base sauce of the dish(which I found was too much for a sizzler) had an overwhelming tanginess to it. I only could feel the taste of sourness rather than any other. I'm aware of peri peri base being tangy and stuff but it was too much as for me.... The chicken in the steak was tasty though.... Juicy and soft. The behaviour of the staff and service was Cordial and warm though....No issues regarding that..... But as far as the main thing i.e food was concerned-i can say only 1 thing ,'it didn't suit my tastebuds'.

I visit barcelos few days a go after wrapping up mt work. As i was alone so thought of having my lunch in barcelos. But it was very much surprising to see barcelos such a poor condition starting from the food and drinks till the manager.
 I ordered garlic fish with rice and and mango meets banana.  Rice was full of onion and zucchini. Fish had an awful smell which was unbearable. The quality and quantity of shakes have gone down drastically. No favour of mango was there. When i called the manager to know why my food and drinks was not up to the mark. (Dont know the name) He said this was there standard. His body language showed he was least interested in the concern i had. He never bothered that i was enjoying my food. Being a manager it is completely un-professional to behaviour in such a manner. No sense of responsibility was shown there. Was just walking around the restaurant irrespective of  the guest concern. Didnt had any hospitality quality in him.Doesnt know how to speak with his own staff. Was howling in the restaurant and disturbing. Using abusing words and slangs among his own staffs. Never ever seen a manager like this.
In the end after notice he that i had didnt eat my food he offered me a free dessert...????
 Its high time for the barcelos team to act on these issues.

Ok, this review comes a few weeks late and has no pics, but it was a sudden unplanned trip one afternoon with my husband. We were both a bit under the weather, so we went there for a mood lift. We got the non veg kebab platter and it was soooo good. I highly recommend it. They have their own house sauce in four levels of spice. The grilled veggies with the kebabs are quite the best I have had. We had a mocktail as well and a cheesecake for dessert which were both top notch. Prices are high, but you cannot complain about the quality, service or ambience. A must visit for every foodie.

I visited this place with my friend and got a warm welcome from the lady stationed just outside the restaurant. We ordered a full plate of peri peri chicken with potato mash as side dish, and unlimited coke. The dish was absolutely awesome, with the peri peri sauce adding extra delight to our taste buds. A full plate chicken for 2 was definitely heavy for the stomach, but the taste was such splendid that you can't leave even a single piece on the plate. To add to the food, the ambience in the restaurant was superb and so was the service by the waiters. In a nutshell Barcelos is surely the place to be if you want to enjoy roasted chicken!!!

What better way to celebrate Portugal's Euro 16' win than trying out Portuguese cuisine :P Situated on the top floor of Acropolis, the place is pretty cool and the ambiance is nice. We decided to quench our thirst with the Grape Fruit Punch and the Indian Classic Kala Khata. Both were quite refreshing. Then for starters we wanted to order Stuffed Mushroom Kebab but since it was not available, the waiter suggested Mediterranean Grilled Mushroom Skewers and Garlic Fish with rice for the main. The mushroom was awful and bland and once we told a guy from the management about it he instantly offered to serve us two extra mushroom pieces after making it better and he also showed us how to use the peri peri sauces present on ¬†table. The mushroom did not taste much better but kudos to their service for actually caring about their customers. Then we ordered the Chicken wings which was good. Most of the dishes here have a strong flavour of peri spices so if you do not like that flavour you won't have much options here. Finally we decided to end with Berries Cheese cake and Hot Choc Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream and I have only one word to describe the desserts, "Heavenlicious" :D

Heard of this restaurant name from a lot of my friends.....and all of them said one thing in common...glowing reviews of the food they serve and the helpful and cooperative staff....so was quite eager to visit this restaurant for some time...
At last this Saturday it finally happened and I have to say it has been a wonderful experience for me....we ordered the bone less chicken thighs for our starters and the chicken was very well seasoned and juicy and tasted absolutely delightful ...in the mains we ordered the family chicken with four sides which is complimentary...and I can say without a doubt the chicken was the best I have ever had...and the four sides wonderfully complemented the chicken ....the manager requested to try their molecular drinks ...and it was  wonderful and refreshing with the added theatricality obtained from adding liquid nitrogen... overall I have to admit it is one of the best meals I have had in my whole life till now.....and the staffs were very helpful , courteous ....
Being a foodie who likes to try various cuisines I must say it is a must visit for food lovers of this food loving city.....and I hope to again visit them soon...

Tried the Barcelos in Delhi during my stay over there and thought of giving it a try.¬†
I liked the decor over here, and the huge map indicating the Barcelos chain all over the world.
The food is decent here so are the mocktails.
However, I found the service to be bad indeed! We had to request thrice to serve water to us (which is so basic)! ¬†They seemed to be much reluctant while taking orders! The food came in quite late and they were not even apologetic as the wait time promised was way to less. Probably they were lethargic to do that also!
Guys please pull up your socks n work on this part, because in the hotel and hospitality sector, service is unanimously considered to be among the most important parameters.

We'd gone there post watching a movie at cine. I'm disappointed to say the food wasn't even average at best! They had no fries at all, the burger buns felt squib, and neither the veg or the chicken patties/breast was good. We even returned a plate of one of their appetizers. To top it all, there was a piece of bone about two inches in the napkin stand! The experience was really bad and we didn't feel the management could care at all unfortunately. It was one restaurant I was really looking forward to, but a real dampener.

I went to Acropolis mall with a friend and we decided to lunch here .
Situated on the fourth floor this place is an internationally recognised restaurant with its speciality in Portuguese and middle East cuisine. This place will keep on reminding you of the different spices in the world .
The flavours alongside the different spices they provide and the variety of Sauce is why this place stands out .I felt pretty spoilt of choices.
The hospitality is good and the interiors are very spacious .
The devor of the place is minimalistic and elegant with the iconic map of the world on its wall !! Truly I could just not take my eyes of this one :p
The food was peri peri good !! And try this place out only if you are experimental and welcoming to different dishes since this might taste very different than the typical Indian dishes .
Overall the experience was good and we ordered a Chicken steak and a peri-peri chicken dish .
P.S: Try out the dishes mentioned in their speciality menu ! 
We billed at Rs 1250 . The food is adequate but the price is a little on the higher side .

Last night we visited the new portuguese restaurant in acropolis Barcelos.  I am very happy with service and staffs and the ambience. It was my cutie pies birthday. We reached the restaurant at 10.50 pm. But unfortunately their last order was at 10.45 pm. But on special request the manager Mr. Souvik gave us the table. We ordered a family meal and a very big burger with extra pineapple and egg which i forgotten the name. The food was delicious. A small cake with a cute candle Was  given as complimentary birthday desert to my daughter as well. I am very with service and yes the food peri peri grill chicken was very delicious. I thanks to the manager and staffs. We hope to visit there again very soon.

visited the 1st outlet of barcelos in our town. I thought it would be similar to nandos as the same concept to peri peri. But the food is far away better than nandos . i had the portugese roll of nandos and red pepper dip. But  the cheesy chicken wrap with the supa peri was just awesome.  supa sauce is very very hott i just loved it.  The only thing dissapointed me was the drinks. i want to try their flavoured sangria but a bad luck of mine they didnt got the liscence of liquor still.   Hope to visit again :-)

I was a regular visitor of this place until today when I experienced indecent and bad behaviour from the manager of this restaurant .They took atleast 30 minutes to serve me  a dish even.I placed a discount voucher for which I was supposed to get a discount ,instead of giving me a discount on the gross bill they are discounting it from the net bill and they are telling us that before I don't pay they will not be able to give u a discounted bill.After I paid the amount then also they couldn't give me a proper discounted bill instead they are telling that it's their policy .They placed two bottles of kinley packaged drinking water without asking which has a Mrp of ‚Çπ10.00 for which they are charging 50plus taxes,when I asked them to return the server is telling me it's already punched and can't return it.
These restaurants are charging exorbitant rates but are giving such poor services .@avishek mukherjee @parag das

I had to take a few friends out for lunch and i was pretty confused where to go and where not to. I sat at hoppipola to have a drink with my cousin that's when a friend dragged us to Barcelos. Overall a good experience. The food was yumm but we landed up ordering a black burger which didn't suit our taste. The place is beautiful decent interiors but then their sofa seats are very uncomfortable. Would surely go again to taste their Burgers but this time will be a little more careful with the choice of it. I hope i get to eat with comfort the next time.

One of the newest places in the town with rave reviews, and eight hungry souls decided to give it a try one cloudy afternoon. We walked into a tastefully decorated place, lovely wooden interiors and cosy lighting. ¬†The bright red smoking booth reminded me of telephone boxes. With great gusto we ordered the drumsticks and the chicken platter as starters, along with fresh lime soda. The drumsticks were heavenly, with a great smoky flavour and tasted even better accompanied with the tangy lemon sauce. I have to say they serve the best fresh lime soda in the city! For the mains we ordered three full chickens, ¬†three sizzlers, lots of burgers and unlimited coke to go. I had the Too much periperi black magic, and it was AMAZING. A giant juicy affair, with a slice of my favourite pineapple, I could hardly take a full bite of all the layers. The four sauces on the table complimented it really well, especially the veri peri, which left a pleasant burn on ¬†my tongue. The trinchnado sizzler was also well made, with ample vegetables and chicken. ¬†To end it we had tiramisu and the electric blue fizz. The tiramisu was slightly disappointing, but they made it up with the blue fizz. The staff were extremely courteous and helped us choose the dishes. Overall, it is a great place to go if you love chicken and are looking for a different taste. Definitely giving it a second visit. Cheers!

An impromptu visit to this new joint proved to be quite the treat. The lighting, seating and wall decor were easy on the senses with the illuminated atlas of the world pointing out the locations of Barcelos' around the globe being the highlight. While the red chicken burger could've been better, the molecular mocktails : Tangy Mango and Kiwi Cooler were great. Each table has 4 bottles of peri peri sauces graded according to their hotness and having the fries with them is quite the delight.¬†¬†Looking forward to trying their diverse chicken menu next time.

Finally got the time to visit there on Sunday but not enough time to explore the menu so much. 

Ambience : 4/5 
Food : 4/5 
Service 2/5 (hella slow) 

We ordered a chicken wrap, the bread was just too crispy for my liking and overall it wasn't so good. 

Then we had 4 chicken mini burgers with a side of fries with dip. The burgers were satisfactory. 
Liked their sauces. 

Ordered an unlimited cold drink (sprite) but the taste of it was a little weird. Not sure if tasting the peri peri sauces had ruined the taste in my mouth. 

Pocket pinch was on the higher side given the quantity was on the lower. Felt like an over-hyped restaurant.

Gives a feel of a classy place , good ambience yet fails to meet the standards when it comes to food and service. Huge food menu but very average taste wise, service is really slow.. I literally had to wait for 40 mins just for mini burgers. Chicken steak and the side dishes does not come together .. Side dishes came 15 mins later whereas both should be serve together. Overall food and service is disappointing.

Second visit to barcelos and will be leaving with a smile after having a disappointing experience on my previous visit.
Glad to see the improvement in their service which was a drawback a month ago.
Chicken espedata is my all time favourite. It's a must try here at barcelos.
Staff suggested to try chicken trinchado, and it was really good. A balanced mix of tangy and spicy chicken.
Though peri peri chicken sizzler wasn't as good as I expected it to be.
Overall, a nice place to be with friends and family for meal.
Oh yes, do try chicken espedata here!!!

A huge disappointment ...... specially the service...I would rate them in negative for service.
Coming to place, it's spread over a huge area with tastefully done interiors and very casual ambience.
Food is average, we ordered peri peri chicken which was okay , chicken steak which was not up to the mark and burgers which were not so good as expected.
Service is pathetic and slow , they took around 40min to serve each item without the complimentary sides and were very casual in their behaviour and service.
We reached at 1.30 and left at 4.30, which is an example of how slow the service is.Very poor management and almost a harassment for us, for what reason you people are charging such high service charges?????
Per person without drinks is a round Rs950
Sunday lunch ruined , would not recommend at all.
6K for lunch=3 hours of nightmare.

Barcelos is pleasant enough if you are looking for a quiet, laid back time with friends or family. Since they haven't started serving alcohol as yet (not sure if they are going to - my bad forgot to ask), the place is less frequented than it's neighbours. Also, no hot drinks are served, even if they feature on the menu.

As far as the food is concerned, it's decent enough in terms of taste and quantity and the service is quick. However, if you are used to people serving out dishes for you, you will be disappointed. The molecular drinks are cool - both visually and taste-wise. 

The only problem this place might have going forward is that the menu is pretty close to Chilli's, which has an outlet just opposite. Then again, considering the bill I ran up was 1/4th of any of my outings at Chilli's (even if I take into consideration that we did not have alcohol), gives it an edge. 

All Barcelos has to do now is wait and watch how Kolkata foodies treat them.

Visited for a quick evening bite after shopping at Acropolis. Honestly, was blown over by the food. We had ordered the signature grilled chucken with peri peri....one of the best grilled chickens we had in entire India! We also had cheesy fries...which was fries mixed with capsicum, onion and layered with cheese...but still very crispy. The ferrero rocher milk shake was mindblowing. The best part is they have a unlimited soft drink option in just Rs. 100. The other stuff in the menu card looked so appealing that I have to come back here soon üòÄ

We ordered chicken steak, greek salad & chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream..
The food is good and the quantity is enough for two...if you want to have in small portion..
The dessert was yumm!!

Visited on last Saturday after reviewing Zomato and find this place with awesome ambience, real good food and very very nice and courteous service staff. The name of the Service staff was Raj and he is someone to be remembered of. He suggested the speciality items of Barcelos (¬†two drinks...one kiwi based and one mango based were amazing) and they were really good. Peri peri sauces are add ons with the lovely cooked fish sizzlers and chicken portions. A must visit everyone. With special thanks to Raj.....you rock man....

What really intrigued me about trying out this restaurant is their colourful burgers. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by pink and black burgers? So finally I had the chance to eat out here tonight. Ambience is cozy, embraced in rustic charm; seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable. Their service is on point, served everything within 20 mins. Coming to the food, we ordered pesto pasta salad( non veg), Chicken Espetada, 3 chicken mini burgers and tangy mango molecular drink,which was highly recommended by the server.
‚Ä¢ Tangy Mango drink - This drink, which was recommended by the server, tasted awesome. With subtle bursts of spiciness infusing the tangy base; very refreshing. 5/5
‚Ä¢ Non-veg pesto pasta salad - This salad was kind of bleh for me, didn't really satiated my taste buds. The chicken pieces are generously added, but the dish altogether didn't work for me. 2.5/5
‚Ä¢ Chicken Espetada - This dish is among one of their best and popular dishes. The kebabs were tender and juicy. Along with the two sides, spicy rice and grilled veg, this dish was the star of the night. Highly recommended! 4.5/5
‚Ä¢ Chicken mini burger - Finally, the dish which enthralled me the most, was a big blunder: buns dry, patties bland. The plating was good, three colourful mini burgers with a side of hot potato wedges and mayonnaise. Well, I learned the hard way that you cannot judge a book by it's cover. 2/5
Though some of the dishes did not live up to the mark, overall it's a pretty decent restaurant serving delicious kebabs and drinks! Give it a try! :)

Barcelos claims that its serve the best peri-peri coated dishes in the world. I wouldn't agree to this but I would definitely agree that they serve the best ones in town(atleast right now) 
Visited this place with a friend of mine on a Sunday afternoon. We immediately got a seat and the staff was very courteous. 
We had ordered - 
‚Ä¢Peri Peri Black burger (split in twos) by itself
And
‚Ä¢ Half chicken in mild peri sauce with one sides(wedges and dip) 
The burger was nice, juicy and they had done justice to that sauce(amazing sauce,by the way)
The chicken too was good but was unevenly divided and drenched in the peri sauce. The wedges were judiciously flavoured, crunchy and overall it was a nice experience. 
As far as the service was concerned )and I mean the service and not the staff). It was slow, very slow. For the aforementioned dishes they took about 1:30 hrs. 
Value for money- 2.5/5. ‚Çπ911 inc tax for these 2 dishes. Bloody expensive,guys!
Happy dining. Do share your experience.

Tried the restaurant yesterday. The ambiance is very nice. Well illuminated and the staff is very friendly. Menu looks very extensive and lots of options. Tried the Chicken steak with wedges. Could have done better with the steak. But the peri sauce was spot on. Their kebabs are quite good. The molecule drinks are must try. You can also get bottomless coke. The damage was Rs 1383 for two. A must visit for sure

Went to this place to elevate my mood after a disastrous viva in the semesters and by golly it lifted up my spirits.. we ordered oreo shake and cheese cake vanilla and both were heavenly after a long time tasted something really palatable.. for the main course we ordered 1/2 grilled chicken barcelos signature style done on both sides..it was juicy spicy and awesomely delicious..the peri peri sauce add an extra zing to the already delicious chicken..and the best part is the inclusion of a smoking booth so all u smokers out there yeah u cn smoke while u wait for ur food!!!
The ambience is nice friendly service..must visit place for all those chicken fanatics who had previously run out of places to devour the heavenly flesh of chicken with an awsumly spicy taste..thumbs up barcelos..definitely going to pay you guys a second visit..loads of dishes still left to explore

Barcelos , located on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall in Kasba , offers a unique dining experience that is sure to get your taste buds going. We started off with Chicken wings and Fish kebabs. Honesty , I've never had fish that was this succulent and tasty. A total winner! We followed it up with burgers and Chicken Sizzlers. Didn't try the burgers personally , but the Sizzler was delicious. Stuffed with Chicken , Mushrom and a host of veggies , it was a complete meal and quite different to the Continental version. Would definitely recommend this joint to everyone !

This new outlet offers an interesting blend of Portuguese and middle Eastern cuisine. Spacious and well lit, barcelos is a good restaurant for heavy meals. The quality of service is good and the food quantity is generous. My friends and I had ordered the chicken black burger and red burger which came with two sides of your choice, the cheesy chicken espedata, chicken steak and chicken peri peri sizzler. The portion was filling and the flavours were mild although you can spice it up accordingly with the help of their delicious sauces.

Kolkata now a days turned up to a centre of various cuisines and Barcelos being the newest addition to that. Located at Acropolis mall this food joint serves Portuguese food. The mini burgers with various color, flavour and texture of bread is one unique item which should be tried. The environment is also quiet well. As its newly opened so liquor licence is not available till now but surely would like to go once again when the restaurant is in its full flow coz I won't mind to sip a glass of drink along with few European snacks in such a cozy environment. As per the cost is concerned its not that cheap but also won't create a hole in your pocket. Give it a try if you love exploring new cuisines and ambiences.

Tonight we visited the restaurant for dinner.We ordered the first dish in the menu card,Chicken liver with Garlic roll.We were informed they did not have Garlic roll,so we ordered a Mezze platter with 5 dips,pita n falafel. One of the dips was just plain green chilli paste and inedible as it was extremely spicy. Later I was informed by the waiter, it was red chilli paste and it was suppose to be so spicy which we were not informed earlier. Later we wanted to have the Fantastic Four mini burger of different colours which they themselves said is their signature dish. Well even that was not available. So the list of unavailable items are - garlic rolls, mini burgers, black burger, chicken wraps. Perplexed what to eat as what I wanted from the menu card was not there, I ordered what they had- 1/4 grilled chicken with sprouts and chicken pita wrap with grilled veggies.  Well, the grilled chicken I'am sure was cooked in the morning,warmed up and drizzled with a horrible sauce, sprouts had no sprouting but soaked up pulses. My chicken pita was OK but again the grilled veggies were boiled n drizzled with again some horrible sauce with no salt. Overall a terrible dinner. With ever so increasing price hikes and terrible amount of taxes, such an inedible dinner really hurts our sentiments and our pockets. One or two items not available is acceptable but whatever we wanted to have was not there. Also please taste your food before serving.

It's a new one in Kolkata by the name sounds like Barcelona. Ambience of the plae was good okaish. The staff was cooperative but they had little idea about what they are selling. I had no idea what I was eating I wanted to try something new so I was expecting something different. When the food came it was like any normal fried chicken there was no different flavor. I could have had this some where else also but came for something different here. Drinks were okay again nthg different.....price was reasonable may be because they r new...
One thing which these acropolis people are charging are service charge 10% of ur bill for some it might be new because most of the place do not charge this

The Black bun and White bun burgers are so aesthetically pleasing it's hard to not to order them. We were not disappointed. Huge burgers, undoubtedly vfm, and not loaded with cheese. Their signature peri peri sauces made 'em burgers perfect. The Pesto Pasta Salad was below-average. Very dry and bland. They can improve on their cutlery, it's a disaster for clumsy hands. They can also consider switching to bigger plates if it's not much of an issue, instead of the cheaper alternative of paper table mats which they currently use. If I do visit them again, it would be solely for their burgers.

Coming from humble beginnings with only a single operation found in Pretoria, South Africa in 1993 - Barcelos, International Chain that specializes in Portuguese Peri Peri Grilled Chicken, ¬†is named after a quaint Portuguese town that is famous for an ancient legend of the Barcelos rooster. According to the 17th century legend, a pilgrim seeking food and water in Barcelos, was accused of stealing from a landowner. The pilgrim was sentenced to hang despite his protests of innocence. In a last minute appeal to the judge, who was enjoying a roasted rooster for dinner at the time, the pilgrim boldly stated, "If I am innocent, then that rooster will get up and crow!" Suddenly, a gorgeous scarlet-plumed cockerel rose from the plate, crowing loudly. - Source: :barcelos.co.in

Operational at Acropolis mall, at the 4th floor, they have been quite successful in creating an initial buzz with the kind of detailing that goes on with the food, service and ambience. ¬†you will fall in love with the the chick decor and and overall ambience. Every table has 4 variants of peri peri sauce which is quite innovative. well illuminated world map is quite an attraction.

It was a Monday evening when we decided to check this place out after a shopping spree at Acropolis mall. it was an unplanned late dinner for us, and we were hearing lot of great stuff about the place and trust us, we were pleasantly surprised. The menu was a relief within kolkata with with food joints flooded with italian and chinese food. Specializing in Portuguese and middle eastern cuisine, they have mastered the craft.
We ordered one grilled chicken burger with fries as the side dish, Chicken sizzler and Red bull. ¬†Burger was served in a tray with fries in a tiny fryer. it was juicy to the core and will certainly leave you craving for more. Sizzler were made to perfection. ¬†
Really liked the speedy service, staff courtesy. and everything with so much of perfection.

Highly recommended.¬†

P.S: The kind of menu and ambience they boost, a permanent liquor licence is highly recommended :)

So, around 8 of us dropped in here a few days back and the experience was lukewarm at best. I ordered the peri peri black magic burger along with two side dishes, coleslaw and fries with dip. The buns of the burger were black and somehow, quite crumbly. The filling was nice but the total experience with the burger was ruined because the buns kept crumbling between my fingers. The coleslaw was good and so were the fries. The pricing was also on the higher side, so the quality should have been better. Also, the staff were not very helpful or friendly and were rather eager to watch us leave or so it seemed as they handed us the bill before we were done with our meals. Overall, I believe there is ample scope for improvement.

BARCELOS 
As they say, Barcelos is named after a quaint Portuguese town that is famous for an ancient legend of the Barcelos rooster. Well whatever be the reason the name is pretty cool. :-) It‚Äôs a International Chain that specializes in Portuguese Peri Peri Grilled Chicken. They started operations in Pretoria and have since spread out globally across many countries. 
Opened just a few days back in our city of joy ,located on the top floor of Acropolis Mall , this place has already earned a lot of fame and is going to be a star in the days to come if they continue serving good foods.
The ambience is cool and serene. The walls are decorated with some innovative paintings. It has got a world map on one one of its wall, illuminated with dim neon lights to add to the decor . The staffs were good and courteous. Service was also pretty fast. 
Food :
We ordered the following¬†¬† : 
(i)¬†¬† ¬Ω Chicken with coleslaw 
(ii)¬† Chicken espetada with garlic wedges and fried veges
(iii) Chicken Trinchado with rice
(iv) Tangy Mango
(v)¬† Kiwi Cooler 
Each table had four bottles of peri peri sauces namely ‚Äì mild peri, veri peri ,tangy lemon and supa peri¬† to make your food even more tasty and interesting. ¬†
¬Ω Chicken - The name itself brings a feeling and also being their Signature dish ,we did not hesitate to order it. You get options to choose your sidelines with it - either one or two . We took coleslaw . Served in no time ,it was a brilliant way to start the meal . Two bigggg leg pieces were served perfectly grilled and marinated in peri peri spices ,tasted sinlessly great with the mayonnaised cabbage leaves. ¬†
Chicken Espetada ‚ÄìThis is a typical Portuguese dish usually of large chunks of beef / chicken rubbed in garlic and salt.¬† Espetada roughly translated from Portuguese means "skewered", also commonly referred to as a kebab. It is one hanging dish skewered with pieces or blocks of chicken breasts sandwiched between slices of bell peppers and onions. It was served on a skewer which hangs from a hook on a stand as it is presented to you. Garlic wedges and fried veges came along with a mayonnaise dip¬† with the dish. The concept was something new and will catch your eyes¬† immediately . The chicken pieces tasted great with the siders and it was a thrill to mix it with the various peri peri sauces .A must try if you are at barcelos . 
Chicken Trinchado ‚Äì Another Portuguese dish served in a cup plated on a bed of rice .¬† Trinchado is a classic Portuguese dish that is spicy and very rich with a sauce that will keep everyone quiet for a long while! It had small cubes of chicken teamed with small pieces of veges made in some special sauce to give a thick gravy-ish look, served in a cup. Was really good with the rice . Tried Portuguese foods for the first time and I must say that I am loving it. :-)
Both the drinks were good but I loved the tangy mango .It was a great refreshing drink,absolutely perfect for the summers
Well, A great Portuguese experience. Will definitely visit to their signature burgers .

Ambience - 5/5
Staff - 4.5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Food - 4.5/5
Value for money ‚Äì 4/5

Pocket Pinch : Rs 2000 for two .

Finally barcelos arrives in kolkata. Firstly the place is located in really good area which is well connected to every part of the city. Moving on to the restaurant the place is really nice with good ambience and polite staff, the food is really delicious and one of the best for peri peri lovers. Apart from the food and the ambience the restaurant's concept is really good and appealing. There can be a little disappointment for the vegetarian as the options are very limited.

So I went there for the first time, I have heard so much about the place but never got a chance to visit. It has already been there in Delhi for quite some time now and finally made its way to Kolkata. The restaurant specializes in Portuguese food and is named after the Portuguese town Barcelos. They're famous for their flame grilled chicken as the name suggests and it is really good, but that part comes later. Firstly, the interior, I liked the ambience. It's quite spacious and has a prettier seating area as you go inside. They have a bar area, although they don't serve alcohol. There's also an adorable smoking zone which looks like a huge telephone booth. Coming to service, the waiters were extremely polite and kind and they make sure that you're fine and enjoying your food, so much sometimes that you can't gulp the food down your throat.
So I went there with my friends, we ordered 3 burgers: peri peri black magic with fries and dip, peri peri red hottie with spicy rice, and a peri peri bloody red by itself which is the one I ordered. Both of the reds were absolutely delicious, although the burger bun wasn't as "red" as it looked on the menu. The filling in all three of them was very juicy and very tasty. The peri peri sauce is out of world delicious! However, I wasn't too happy with the black bun, it was kind of sticky and heavy and didn't taste too well. Also, i expected more out of the spicy rice but it was really ordinary. Overall, I think it's totally worth a visit and I would definitely go again to try out a few other dishes which I've heard about.

PS: I absolutely loved the idea of serving water with mint leaves, it looked classy and gave it a slight minty flavour.

Finally crossed this off the list. It was well worth it. Food is different. Good different. Like Nando's. They are not serving alcohol yet. So we took bottomless cold drinks with our meal.
A very peri black bun chicken burger, half a grilled chicken, both with a side of lovely mashed potatoes. Also, pita bread stuffed with grilled chicken and veggies (with a side of wedges and mayo dip). You also get 4 types of sauces on the table. 3 Peri Peri and a tangy lemon. I personally preferred the Supa-Peri.

The price varies with the no. of sides you take. I wanna try the spicy rice the next time. 
Overall, a good experience. Would love to visit again to try the other dishes.

Had been hearing the hype about this place for a while now.. Finally landed up this weekend. It was quite packed and the ambience was quite nice. Very limited options for vegetarians. Ordered the burger platter which was decent with fancy colour burgers. Was expecting the burgers to be a bit more wow. The bread of the white and brown burger was very fluffy and nice, not so much with the red and black ones. Ordered the pesto pasta salad which was yummy. And  hummus and pita bread where the pita was yumm but hummus lacked a bit flavour, needed more garlic I suppose. In all the service was fast and good and the prices was decent.

On the top of that they really has given us reasons to go back there by providing us a coupon with many offers. Being a health conscious foodie what has attracted me most is their grilled chicken with veri peri. We'll definitely go back and will suggest people to try their food at least once.

It has been quite sometime that I had been there. This review is kind of an overdue one, although better late than never. I was there with a friend of mines, for a quick snack and a comfortable chat in the evening. We tried the signature dish of barcelos i.e the mini burgers. We ordered 3 chicken ones' , one of the color white, the other of the color red and the last one of the normal bread shade! all of these mini burgers were quite tasty. although, ¬†the white burger needs a special mention cause i liked it the best. It was a strange combination of very soft and tasty chicken, mayonnaise and small pieces of pineapple but the taste was very joyful one. The dips were tasty as well, specially the hot and spicy one. The atmosphere was quite satisfactory. The one downer in our visit was that we didn't get the french fries along with the burgers which we had ordered for cause it was still in the making.

If you are searching for good food with great ambience Barcelos will be the right choice. For the First time I have experienced Portuguese cuisine and trust me it took my heart away. Liked the cozy ambience and the decor, the staffs are really welcoming and humble. Loved their innovative presentation of serving food. Chicken drumstick was superb. I had ordered their signature dish chicken picantte which was overwhelming and merely with any oil. The white burger and mint blast was unequivocally admirable. Overall experience was very good and looking forward to visit again..

Barcelos, a new entrant in Kolkata's food galaxy. This Portuguese joint is a much needed change from the city bursting with Italian & Continental eateries. Liked it's cozy ambience & the decor. The staff were courteous. Loved their molecular mocktails, Tangy Mango is my favourite. The grilled chicken with the Peri Peri sauce was succulent & non oily. The Garlic fish with rice was good but loved their Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt dip. The only disappointment was their Non veg Kebab Platter. Found it a little dry & not so tasty.
The overall experience was good & will be going again very soon.

Ran into this new restaurant in Acropolis mall on the way out of X-men: Apocalypse.
While the ambience and service definitely match the concept, sadly when it came to execution we were a tad disappointed. While it is unfair to compare the restaurant to Chili's, I guess it was inevitable when you look at the menu and the format. However as I said in terms of service, overall experience, and most importantly - quality of food the bar had been set a bit too high. While giving him full marks for enthusiasm our server was unable to clearly explain the theme of the restaurant. For eg. I could not understand their Peri Peri fascination. Anyway keeping in mind it was around 5pm and we were not very hungry, we decided to order a few items that caught our eye which would give us an idea of the place. While the high point of the meal was the healthy Black Mutton Burger we were sorely let down by the Chicken Steak, which had dried out by the time it reached the table, and the Baba Ganoush which had almost no trace of eggplant.
Willing to put this down to teething issues that every new place faces. Since we found it a potentially nice family restaurant I really hope the next time we visit we'd be confident to try out the rest of their menu.

Tried the Chicken Black Magic burger and Barcelos Signature 1/4 grilled chicken in Veri Peri sauce.
Well, I somehow didn't like the taste of the black burger bun, wasn't complimenting the perfectly cooked chicken fillet inside. Tasted a tad bitter rather. But the filling was good. Okayish taste.
The grilled chicken however, has become an absolute favourite. A succulently done chunk of perfectly grilled chicken, with the amazing veri peri mayo, had that distinct taste of smokiness and something that is totally worth the price. If I decide to return to Barcelos, I'll only come for this. Not the burgers.

Their minibuns are to die for. We ordered 4, 1 of each colour. Finally got to try a black, red, and white bun, along with the regular bun. It was juicy, and light. The grilled trout and grilled chicken were amazing. Service was quick and courteous. Will definitely be going back.

Came in highly recommended. Popped in one evening. Lot of work put into the decor. And the service was adequate. But the food. Oh the food was so below par. The burgers were really dry with bland overcooked chicken inside. The fish steak had 6 tiny pieces of fish, with bland sides of yellow rice and vegetables. The chicken steak was properly cooked but nothing out of the ordinary. The size of the trout was exaggerated and was not deboned properly. The brownie shake came in like the morning cup of bournvita we used to enjoy when we were in 3rd grade.

They lacked originality, creativity and all in all basic restaurant quality in all of their dishes even after putting up a hefty price tag.

Nice ambience and courteous service. The food tries to pull off a nandos but quite doesn't make the mark. They've tried to be innovative with their healthy and colorful burgers. Which look intriguingly delightful but don't taste that great. The buns happened to be quite dry that crumbled and the taste wasn't something I'd come back for. The grilled chicken was however was succulent and well done. My vote is purely for it.

I was invited to Barcelos the week it opened up in Kolkata but regretfully due to work commitments could not go. Since then it was on my wishlist and a few days back after watching a movie at Acropolis Mall we finally made it to dinner there. I had heard mixed reviews from my friends who had eaten there but as always I visited with an open mind. To start with a bit about Barcelos ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a three decade old International Chain that specializes in Portuguese Peri Peri Grilled Chicken. They started operations in Pretoria (South Africa) and have since spread out globally across sixteen countries. They have four kinds of Peri Peri Sauce ‚Äì three with progressive degrees of heat and a lemon Peri Peri which was my preference as I can‚Äôt have too much spice.

My brother and I recently visited this place. We came out of the movie theatre famished at around 4 pm in the evening. Warmly greeted by the cheerful staff and the cozy ambience, we were quickly taken to our table in an almost empty section of the restaurant. A little help from the staff we managed to order a portion of chicken espeteda, ¬Ω grilled chicken with coleslaw and mashed potatoes on the sides, 2 mutton and 2 chicken mini burgers and a molecular mocktail of peach ice tea. Our wait for food was not long and the wait was filled with good music in the background. 

The portion of serving was really good as it was most suitable for 3 rather than 2. The chicken espeteda was served on a long hanging seekh, the burgers were served in red, black and white buns with distinctive taste, ¬Ω chicken was literally ¬Ω of a chicken and the molecular mocktail was served with a touch of art to it. The sauces were the highlights of the food, ranging from tangy to high heat option. Super peri was our choice of sauce which went really well with the grilled chicken. The food was a concoction of good presentation and taste. 5 stars for food.

Really impressed by the pleasant sitting arrangement ,gives memorable moments while enjoying food.From black and red burger which are supposed to be world's healthiest burger with vegetable colours to the wraps and pitas and grilled trout fish it's an impressive spread. Not to forget the 4 peri peri sauces mild peri, supa peri, veri peri and tangy lemon.

Ambience
Barcelos is a well designed restaurant with a mind blowing decor. One of the walls is adorned with the world map! The decor and ambience along with the music works like magic. It is undoubtedly one amazing place for a date or a cool hangout with friends or family.

Service
The staff is extremely jovial and friendly. The services were quick and they didnt give us any opportunity to complain!

Appetizers
In this section,we ordered for mild peri sauce based chicken espetada along with wedges and dip green salad. This dish was a treat to all the 5 senses! The wedges were beautifully fried with delicate flavours that burst in the mouth leaving behind a cherishable taste. The chicken was succulent and adequately flavoured. The dip served along was perfect as well. It is one dish we would recommend to all the foodies out here. And yes, 5/5!

Mocktails
If you are a mocktail freak, Barcelos is your to go location! The molecular drink section is beyond perfect. They simply create mocktail magic, and add the much needed x factor to any usual mocktail we have. We would'nt give out any more spoilers! Go try out yourself! ( what we ordered in this section was Tangy mango and Kiwi cooler. A 5/5 for both of them. )

Main course
There are a wide range of choices available in the menu card, and we chose Peri peri grilled chicken in veri peri sauce. Sadly, we were a bit disappointed with this dish as they had recommended this dish to be their best and yet it turned out to be a usual dish with no such special factor to look out for. We give this dish a 3/5.

It was my brother's birthday. And we decided to visit this new place at Acropolis Mall. Loved the look of the place, brings in quite a casual let-go kinda mood. While choosing what we should order we were completely puzzled. But then with the help of the staff we finally ordered the food items whose pictures I have uploaded. I honestly don't remember the names as I was too busy gossiping and having fun. But I juuuuust loved the grilled chicken. It was perfect! üëå That's exactly how grilled chicken should be. And in drinks I had ordered Tangy mango which was also great! üòã The staff and all the arrangements were pretty good. I am impressed. And the cost is actually reasonable somewhere. So I am going to recommend this place to everyone. Oh not to forget the sauces which were yum! ‚ù§ Keep up the good work guys..

I ordered a half cottage chicken with smashed potato . Yes , I know your feeling ¬†! Its wow ! Then I ordered black chicken burger with fries , which is obviously comes with it . The dip was so special that I still feel deep for the dip . And finally , chicken kebabs with coleslaw and green salad . It was the best part of my lunch . I simply can't forget the bites of kebabs . And finally , guys ; be prepare for 30% tax which comes with your food as a nightmare . :-)

While I liked it the first time I went, the second time was absolutely horrible. Less number of staff, so they keep making you wait for long time. Chicken not marinated, burgers seemed like a stale bread. Good ambience though. Should improve.

A Sunday afternoon can't get better than visiting this South-African food joint serving Potuguese food in kolkata.This new kid on the block packs lots of surprises.The ambience has a nice feel towards the inside with dimly lit yellowish lights.Great vibe actually.Started of with their Indian Classic Kala Khatta,Rose,Berry Cucumber and Electric Blue Fizz (Blue curacao) drinks with liquid nitrogen giving a funky smoky effect.Followed by probably one of the tastiest non-veg sliders out there.We opted for 2 chicken+2 mutton patty sliders.Which were delightfully different coloured.Not just so,they tasted different aswell.Quiet a surprise.The chicken cheese espetada was okay-ish.cz i felt the sliders we had before overpowered them.Lastly we had a Cheesecake smoothie which literally had us smiling. Definite try outs - Indian Classic Kala Khatta,Berry Cucumber drinks,their slider platter and for deserts The cheesecake smoothie and Blueberry Cheesecake is awesome as well :)

Barcelos the place for chicken! Similar to Nandos with its South African Peri-Peri spice but with more variety and bang for your buck. Grilled is the way to go and sauces for every palate. Decor is beautiful and seating is very comfortable with enough room for even large groups. Staff are possibly the politest and most welcoming in the city, the cream of the crop. Food, you guessed it tasty, refreshing and clucking good (all puns intended) you really get what your looking for. Even though the food comes served with a red flag there are no reasons to worryüòâ. The quantity is really good and the price tag doesn't break your bank (4 people eating single side dish meals with unlimited drinks and one desert for 2150‚Çπ). Smokers too have a room to indulge. Great addition to the food circle in Kolkata.

Nandos didn't make it to Kolkata. No problem. We have Barcelos here.
A new star in the constellation. 

Located on 4th floor at Acropolis Mall, Kasba

Great decor. Nice touch of writings, paintings etc. Probably that's how Portugese restaurants are themed. It has a separate smoking zone.

As soon as we entered, one thing was sure, Hospitality was going to be good.

We ordered a Half Chicken, Chicken Espetada and a set of 4 Mini burgers. The waiter, Shadab, was courteous enough to tell us not to order more sideliners since the Espetada already would have 2 of 'em.

The Half Chicken was very juicy and a set of different flavours. You'd consider it bland after having the Half Tandoori chicken. But you've gotta develop a taste for this cuisine.

Chicken Espetada came in a hanging skewer with 2 sideliners being Coleslaw and Potato Wedges. The chicken was a little hard. But the taste enhanced after mixing it with the Peri Sauces.

4 Mini Burgers were pretty good. Never had such colourful burgers. And probably really healthy. The chicken was similar in all. But the Buns changed the taste. On asking we got to know the Red Peri Bun was made with beetroot. Really Healthy.

Then ordered a Too Much Peri Peri Bloody Red. Fully loaded. This probably was Heaven. 2 layers of chicken fillets. And the magic was done by the pineapple slice. That sweet tinge added to greatness.

Kiwi Cooler and Tangy Mango were great accompaniments. A new concept with nitrogen water.

Had to wait for quite a time for the burger. Apart from that. Great service.

A pinch for the pocket obviously. But the cost is basically for the concept. So you don't mind.

Pros - Location. Hospitality. GREAT FOOD. 
Cons - Expensive. Felt the number of staff was less. Once it started gettig crowded, orders took long.

Barcelos for Me is the NANDOS that never made it to Kolkata ...... 
The food is very very good. 
The portions are very very generous. 
It was a first time there so couldn't really try out a lot of things but I feel the food needs that tangy and spicy palate!
Hope to try more from their menu! 
Cheers to Kaushik Roy Chowdhury for this venture! And special mention on their hospitality -it was commendable!

Barcelos is the place which is famous for peri-peri grilled chicken and thier burgur collection.In kolkata i had tried chicken in many places but the chicken is served to me in Barcelos is amazing. Its very soft juicy and healthy also. They are serving hummus also in different style with named peri hummus. I have visited twice in a week and tried the same grilled chicken with mild peri sauce and hummus with pita bread. The food quality is very good but most important to maintain this throughout the journey. I realy appreciate the team of Barcelos to keep this rapo. Specially the standard and service.It was fantastik experience in BARCELOS that 2nd time got a great and better than great service from same staff, its Vijay who made my evening with my family best evening even in busiest day like saturday. Thanks to him for suggesting my wife's favorite icecream and food.

After reading positive reviews 
Went to give this place a try.
The experience was really amazing.
The decor was amazing and so was the quality of the food.
The chicken was tender and soft and had that essence of char grilled.
The mayo dip had the hint of a spicy kick which I loved to be honest.
The mini burgers were amazing
The meat patty being soft and cooked to perfection and the fresh veggies were also spot on.
The chicken espatada was also amazing with carmelaized onions and capsicums.
The attitude of the waiters were really amazing and to be very frank not seen on a daily basis in any Kolkata restaurants.
The brownie shake and kala khatta were also up to mark expected fr Barcelos.
The only reason I'm giving this a half star less because there were certain menu that I wanted to try but was not available so I hope there would be an improvement
Overall a must visit to all the 'chicken' lovers of Kolkata.
Go and gift your tummy a delicious treat :)

Barcelos is a new gem added to the food treasures of Kolkata. An Afro-Portuguese name spreaded all over the world has newly come to Kolkata after Delhi, in India. On the top floor of Acropolis Mall, it's located at a side. The place has a outside sitting area and also inside where it sports an ambiance resembling to the charms of an old countryside pub in Europe. They do not serve alocohol yet due to license issues but that will start soon within one month or so.
One thing I noticed in the earlier reviews that the clients have complained a lot about the service and efficiency. Trust me, I found it to be topnotch. The staffs and all of the personnel were very helpful starting at the gate till we came out. They attended to every problem with a smile and a warm attitude.
We settled in at a inner corner of the restoration where a huge wall had sported a beautiful painting of a country bazaar in Europe.
The ambiance was cosy and nice, tables were well organized with the cutlery and their special Peri peri sauce of different categories.
We were given welcome drinks at first - Kiwi Cooler and Berry Cucumber, these were complimentary for us. Both the mocktails were very good. Loved them to every bit. We loved the Kiwi Cooler so much that we later again ordered one.
For the food, we had a quarter grilled chicken in mild peri sauce as we cannot stand spicy food at all. The chicken was soft, well grilled, spicy outside and white and tender inside. Loved the signature mild peri sauce served at Barcelos.
Next we had ordered a mini burger platter which contained a red, white, black each and a regular burger. There were two chicken and two mutton burger as we chose them to be. But you can also customize according to your wish. They use completely organic products and vegetables to colour the buns and I must say, it's very unique. It's a delight to have these burgers and they are recommended to be healthy as they do not use any oil in the cooking except for the fries and wedges.
Last came a trout fish. I had my trout last when I was in fifth standard at a very quaint cafe in Manali. In Kolkata, whenever I see trout anywhere, it's either very costly or the recipe gives me vibes that it might stink. But here, it was a grilled trout in mild peri again. This Himalayan trout is brought from Delhi, as you hardly get them here in Kolkata. The fish was delicious, awesome. I loved it because I gotta be nostalgic about one of my favourite trips and a very special meal. I must say, that the price of this dish served here is optimum compared to the rarity of the fish.
Last was the blueberry cheescake. This too, was very good. The food was nice. Only one part I think is that their sauces bring a monotony to the dishes. Barcelos plays only with peri peri sauces at cooking. Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri, Very Peri and Super Peri are the table sauces and also used in cooking. So people who cannot withstand the hot peri peri, their options get limited. I think they can work over this in while catering to the foodies in Kolkata.
Important is to note that all the foods here are very healthy as they are completely oil-free, either grilled or baked except for the wedges and fries. So, if you're a foodie but now on a diet due to the doctor's suggestions, then Barcelos is the place for you. And others too, yeah, it's a good place. Worth trying for! You will love it. Happy Dining! :)

We wanted to try a new cuisine when mwe zeroed to explore Barcelos at Acropolis Mall, 4th Floor, Kasba.

We were quite happy with the food and service, moat importantly we loved the way our restaurant manager, Vijay explained us what went into cooking the recipe which gave us confidence in ordering. To my surprise all that we ordered were good for our taste buds.
We tried Chicken Steak and 1/4 pepperoni chicken which is their signature dish.The peri peri was awesome and just so lived by us.

Must must try out.Barcelos

I always had this hunch that if anything could beat nandos then it must be Barcelos. To have one such outlet in my city and to have visited it, the feeling is definitely sublime.

The ambience is lively with a mellow odour of charcoal that adds to the excitement if not more to the appetite. Its absolutely as one would expect form a place like Barcelos.

Coming to the food. The menu is varied and one can chose from a variety of delicacies. What is very catchy is that the illustration of the food on the menu exactly matches the one that will be served on your table. One has to chose from 4 signature sauces in which he/she wants the protein to be literally lathered in and grilled.

The sauces being:
1. Tangy lemon (for the weak hearted)
2. Mild peri
3. Very peri
4. Supa peri (Tongue of iron needed more than iron heart)

Think twice before you go for the Supra peri. The initial bites will tingle your taste buds and bring a smile to your face. But as the heat sets in the tingle turns to pain and smile to tears.

One of the best part of the experience were the drinks. Anybody who wishes to experience the theatre created in Heston Blumenthal's dishes must try them. The cold mist from the liquid nitrogen and the fizzy bubbles from the solid carbon dioxide were a spectacle to behold.

The service was very satisfactory and the attendants were very enthusiastic in their approach and their recommendations.

Overall one of the best experiences I have had in Kolkata till date !!

A nice woody looking place which has a relaxed cafe feel to it. On a weekend afternoon, one could chill with some refreshing Mocktail like the kiwi cooler and bite into some juicy chicken with mild Peri, very Peri or supa Peri flavoured sauce - yes you decide how spicy you would like your sauce to be! They even put a cute flag on the dish to announce your ' peri' choice.

The chicken wings and the Barcelos signature chicken in 1/4th size ( they serve 1/2 or full size as well) was very well done. Juicy and soft, the flesh was easily separated from the bones. The accompanying greens sauted in soya sauce and the mashed potatoes were not great and didn't add to the dish. The mayo with the wings was not complimenting the dish; perhaps something minty could have worked well.

From the African Portuguese selection, the fish and rice combo served with veggies was filling but didn't have a distinct flavour.

My recommendation would be to stick to the signature grilled chicken with your choice of Peri

[Intro]
after waiting and waiting finally they're in kolkata,this is their second outlet in india after delhi.i was waiting for this moment i went to acropolish mall few days back while the work process going on,from that day it was in my wishlist,it was huge place and spacious.around 60-68 people can sit and eat at a time,there is not only indoor seating also you can seat outside.there're some lovely wall hangings a clock and a world map which was lovely way decorated by the lighting effects.there is another good thing which touched me a wall paiting not only good it was superb.
[Location]Very east to locate,inside acropolish mall 4th mall food court take another step to 5th floor where the Asia kitchen just beside that you will find it.

[Ambience n interior]well first impression is last impression from interior to ambience it was a lovely experience for me,very classy and well managed decorated the place very well with the lovely style,chairs along with the sofas it is a good combination,i really liked this place,

[Foods]

1. Tangy mango - good to have this type of drinks in this scorching weather,the quantity they served us it was good in a huge glass,added ripe mango flavour consist with crushed ice and ice cubes over it taste was very average,as well as not very smooth.

2. Kiwi cooler - this was lovely, not the presentation part as well as the flavour was brilliant, added extra bit of sweetness taste was lovely, taste was simply awesome it was a superb combination.

3. Chicken wings - as a starter it was just superb i was really shocked while i had it infront of my table it was not only just grilled as well as it almost burned taste was ok excessive amount of heating caused this thing,taste part it was chewable soft eating along with peri peri sauce had a good change of tongue.

4. Chicken espatada - chicken breast marinated with onion and pepper,the texture was lovely,but from the taste point of view it was a disaster they served it very cold,after having a little bite it was just ok,have to serve it hot.

5. Boneless things with onion and peppers - one word it was a lovely dish,chicken positions tossed very well,the flavour was awesome served along with the peri mayo,very soft juicy but again the failure part it was too cold to understand the actual taste.

6. Peri peri black magic - it was a burger mainly consist with peri peri sauce inside portion was filled with vegetables like jalape√±os, tomato,luttuce,chicken portion along with the sauces inside of a bun,really good taste.

7. Peri peri bloody red - cucumber,jalape√±o,tomato, lettuce,cheese slice,peri peri mayo this combination was inside of this lovely burger,taste part it was good the inside things were very fresh,giving a extra bit of salsa along with mild peri peri leaves a unique texture and a awesome combination of tangy and sweet taste.

8. White chicken burger - the bun was very soft and will melt inside your mouth from the first bite,inside portion used extra bit of fresh tomatos,green pepper chili garlic along with iceburg and the chicken breast they used inside of this it was very well cooked the grill part was lovely eating along with the peri peri sauce it was amazing.

[Service]

I think this part a very big disappointment, not for the food part but the serving part,first of all the food they're serving it was good but the thing is keep on asking them how long they will took for a single plate,not even that a plate of burgers they served us after 1 hour, this was a very bad experience i had.

overall this place is good for the food point part it was lovely,the drink burgers as well the chicken wings and chicken espatada was really good,full of flavour,eationg along with the four types of peri peri sauce.wish you all the very best everyone,there're some other lovely foods which i have to try for my next visit.

This new kid in the block is fab. Barcelos has been there in other cities for sometime now, so we were very excited about checking out the outlet in our city. It is situated at Acropolis mall. This has a very unique outdoor sitting arrangement right beside the enclosed section. The place is very well decorated. There are these particular yellow couches I'm really fond of. It is a moderately spacious place. The waiters are extremely polite, courteous and make it a point to make sure that you are fine and enquiring if you like the food (a little too much maybe) üòõ The smoking zone resembles an enlarged phonebooth ( those classic red ones). Coming to the food, like the menu makes it very clear it is the HOME OF PERI PERI. So we had ordered peri peri chicken wings, the famous peri peri black burger, peri peri red burger with wedges and fries on the side. For drinks we opted for the molecular iced tea. The food was good. Chicken wings were really tasty, however I was a little disappointed with the burger. I mean the grilled chicken in peri peri sauce tasted brilliant but the bread was too heavy and makes you feel bloated. The drink had those smokey effect, which was a visual treat. Price wise it is pretty affordable and I'd say value for money. Apart from this the mini burgers are tasty as well. Must visit. üòä

Loved the decor of this cafe but coming to food it couldn't satisfy my taste buds to that extent. The ambiance is great with courteous staff management. We had ordered 3 chicken mini burgers with sprout beans and grape fruit punch. We had to wait for about 15mins after placing the order to get it served. Grape fruit punch was refreshing.

We have had Barcelos three times. Two times we took away and one time we ate in. My husband brought home the falafel in pita and it was the best one I have tasted since being in Kolkata for the last five years. The chicken peri drumbsticks as well as the 1/2 chicken was really flavorful.

We decided to eat in the next time and ordered the mini burgers. Two mutton and 1 chicken. They were really really good. The mutton and the combination of the different flavored rolls added to the flavor of the hamburgers. We had ordered the Mediterranean platter but the fryer was broken so we ended up ordering the chicken platter which included chicken livers, wings, drumsticks and thighs. There was enough on the platter for two people to share. I really enjoy the peri peri sauce that they marinate the chicken in.

Today my husband went to do take away again and we wanted the burgers again. I was surprised to hear that we could not take the burgers away. I don't know the reason, but all items should be allowed on take away. It is the customers prerogative after you explain if the buns run or not if we still want them. We then had to change what we wanted since we could not get the burgers. We ordered the capris salad and it would have been really good if they had put the dressing on side instead of on the salad as it was really soggy when we ate it. We had the veggie pita so far and it was ok. I prefer the falafel pita over all of them.

I do recommend the place. However, they need to add a restroom inside. Even though there is a restroom right around the corner, there should be one located inside the restaurant for their patrons as well as their staff.

I visited this place with very high hopes but came out quite dissapointed. Barcelos is a major food chain, highly popular in Delhi but it failed to satisfy my taste buds. The ambience of the food joint is nice with a huge world map being the main attention seeker. The Staff is corteous but a little slow. Now coming to what we ordered.
Kiwi Kooler
Oreo Cookie Milkshake
Garlic Fish with Rice
Chicken Sizzler
Peri peri black Burger
White chicken Burger 
Berry Cheescake
Tutty fruity sundae
What I found common in all the dishes is that its stuffed with too much boiled veggies which don't taste that good, especially in the sizzler. The burgers where OK ( I was particularly excited about them) not extraordinary, although I loved how they make them in different colours. Both the drinks where very good and I loved the kiwi kooler. The cheesecake had a very hard filling whereas it should have been soft and wobbly. The sundae was good. The reason I didnot like the food was maybe because of  the Portugese cuisine to which I am not used to. But overrall not really worth the money it cost us. I hope they improve in the future since its new in Kolkata and still understanding what people are liking. 
Happy dining peeps :)

In this week I want to visit acroplic mall kasba . I know that,  there was a good new opened restaurant name " Barcelos "  And I just get into the restaurant because I just love to test new food so I was there .
Really impressed by the pleasant sitting arrangement ,gives memorable moments while enjoying food.had a awesome party with red burger and tempting peri peri sauce . But there was a smallcomplain regarding my server..  "UPASANA" she is very unconscious about tacking care of his guest , and most of time she gossip with others server , she forget to attend my table she need to be more careful about this things . By the way my food experience was very good and joyful and I will remember this till the next time when I visit here . Love you Barcelos ‚ù§

Visited this place on a Sunday with some friends of mine. It's located in the Acropolis mall in Kasba. The ambience is really good. We were here for some snacks so we ordered a plate of French fries and a Berry Cucumber and Kiwi Cooler for moctails. They were really good too. A very nice place to hangout and have eat. Will definitely give another visit.

''All that glitters is not gold'' , well it sums up our experience at Barcelos. ¬†It was a complete disaster waiting to happen today! Decor is a clever ploy to distract you from the indifferent and inept service. My server SAMPI was a complete unprofessional and inefficient in her attitude. A server must answer any queries regarding food and billing without making faces and throwing her hands in the air. Other servers are too busy to answer or respond to any complaints. Complaints we had in plenty, even more than the dishes we ordered. How would you like to eat undercooked and old meat, disguised as a kebab in a new dish? It is only in India when you complain that you are told this is the way they make kebabs. Main course like Chicken Cataplana consists of hard chicken and chickpea which is almost not cooked served in a acid inducing gravy. We thought like good Calcuttans that we will wait for the best-dessert. It was the worst thing to come on a plate. A dense, rubbery, frozen piece of chocolate truffle cake served on a wooden plate with an ice-cream that by the time you eat melts on the flat surface. They do not believe in bowls.¬†
When we complained about all these problems, they with apparent apologies decided to give us a discount of Rs.295/-. But, the funniest surprise is the billing. We had ordered two mocktails- Berry Cucumber and Electric Blue Fizz. When the final bill arrived, we paid 14.5% on AERATED DRINKS and 14.5% on FOOD TAXABLE for only MAIN COURSE and 14.5% on DESSERTS "ON THE SAME BILL"!!!
When I demanded an explanation I was told I am paying for ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES and ADDITIONAL SERVICE TAX was being charged for DESSERTS.
I was told that this was BARCELOS'S RESTAURANT POLICY of LEVYING ADDITIONAL VAT and SERVICE TAX for ALCOHOL and DESSERTS. First of all MOCKTAILS ARE NOT ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES and DESSERTS ARE A PART OF MAIN BILL. I spoke to an expert on taxes who said if a restaurant does not have a LIQUOR LICENSE, THEY CANNOT CHARGE YOU ANY ADDITIONAL TAX. This is UNETHICAL MALPRACTICE. Despite the feeble attempts of the management to reassure me of better standards and service, they made no attempt to take our contact details and feedback to eventually call us for an amendment meal which a MCDONALD or KFC would do.¬†
Like Diwali this is a rocket which has completely resulted in a misdirected accident. PLEASE AVOID TO ENSURE YOUR PEACE OF MIND AND SANITY!

I went to 'barcelos' 4-5 days ago with a huge excitement to have the best grilled chicken in the town but i was really disappointed by the behaviour of your manager Mr Kamal Johal,he was very rude and arrogant.The food was good and the other managers and staffs were very well behaved and informative about the menu.The ambience was great but that thing really broke my heart.He is a wastage for your restaurant,he will not take you to the sky instead he will take you underground.

It looks big from outside but it isn't! Slowly gaining popularity... The fact that it's opened an outlet in Kolkata is much to make us happy! They serve Kolkata's best burgers..black bread burger to red peri burger to white burger! They have it all...I rate it 4 because I have to go back to try their grilled chicken platters!!

In my opinion, this place is slightly overrated. It might be that my Indian taste buds aren't sufficiently evolved to fully appreciate this, but I wouldn't say the food was something out of the world! We ordered a meat burger with wedges and a quarter chicken with rice. The sides are more basic than the mains, which are decently flavoured. The sauces are interesting though- mild peri, very peri, supa peri and something else I can't recall, in order of how hot they are. The beverages was really good though! We ordered a brownie shake and a cheesecake shake and both were delicious with real brownie n cheesecake chunks wedged in thick shakes in mason jars! The ambience is classy and uncluttered so that's a plus! Overall I think it's a nice place to try out!

Sitting here right now, really not professional and uncourteous. 15 mins for the canned soft drink to reach the table and cocky reply to "how long will the food take??" - everything here takes a minimum of 15 minutes. 

Best of luck Barcelos you guys won't go a long way if you don't fix yourselves. 
Kamal Johal is not the right man to run this place !! Arrogant uselessly for some crap. The can of ginger ale has fungus on it. Please find the photo.

went with a lot of expectations, but can't say I am entirely satisfied. The biggest letdown was more than generous amount of salt in each dish. We ordered drumsticks, Arabic meze platter, mini burgers and grilled trout. all dishes except the meze platter contained peri peri sauce, but the overpowering salty taste marred the individual tastes. the fish was not as fresh as I expected. Portions are good. we asked to pack some of food which we could not polish off ( which was very shoddily done). the brownie vanilla icecream as dessert was so so. the brownie was too dry and sticky ( fortunately it was not salty) 
Barcelos has to go a long way to compete and make it place in Kolkata.

This is a new offspring to Calcutta's Latin Gastronomic vengeance after Chili's and TGIF. A brand from Portugal with an unique selling point of "Chicken" is awkward and equally interesting considering it is the land of Choriz and Bacalhau!

Ambience- Similar to Chilis in sitting arrangement and table arrangement. Simple and soothing being their moto, the restaurant is attractively luminated and adorned with photographs and scenery. The restaurant however was hotter than the outside arena which was a bit of a let down.
Service- Professional servers with proper gestures and knowledge of service. Extremely cordial and down to earth.
Food- The menu card is a Peri Peri and Jalape√±o ladened reminiscent of Latin flavors. We ordered for the 4 Mini Signature Chicken Burgers which came with black, red and white Patty. Loved all of them, while the final one had a KFC feel to it. The Peri Peri Grilled Chicken Sizzler had generous amount of Mozzarella and was immensely tasty and filling. They have the choice of Mild Peri Peri,Spicy Peri Peri and Tangy Lemon sauce and you can easily grab some from the sauce dispenser on the table.The strips of chicken breast though being a tad bit dry was well drenched in the Mozzarella which was a savior. All over the food was extremely good and not so heavy on pocket!
I think they have lived up to their USP of curating good Chicken dishes and I was extremely pleased. Hoping to visit their again.

So this a  South African food chain. New in town so decided to give it a go. 
The decor and ambience is really please, the staffs are very courteous. No complaints there. 
Coming to the food. We ordered a white burger, chicken wrap and grilled chicken. 
The burger was amazing, it is supposedly the healthiest burger as written in their menu when I asked them, they failed to elaborate. 
Anyway the burger was really good for 200 bucks it's really good. 
The peri peri chicken was good too and I didn't like the wraps. 
They tasted pretty ordinary but surely their burger stands out. 
Worthy enough to visit again? Uh.. Probably yes!

Dropped by for dinner on a weekday, got a table easily as there is ample space. Music was a bit loud so its difficult to converse if people sit across the table, could be a little less loud. Ordered chicken picante with french fries for starter. At first look, it was a roll of chicken and did not look to be value for the money. But it was great to taste, with loads of chicken, flavour and condiments but not worth 395 bucks. Next we ordered 2 mutton and 2 chicken mini burgers with wedges and grilled trout fish with spicy rice. The burgers were very succulent, bun was soft, each burger had a different flavour of the bread hence 2 repeats of same meat worked well.  The fish was cooked well, deboned completely but it smelled a little fishy near the head of the fish. But a lovely treat to eat trout which is uncommon on most restaurants menu in town. Ordered a kiwi cooler(molecular mocktail) and cheesecake shake, well cheesecake shake was heavy and served as our dessert with a slice of strawberry cheesecake thrown around but kiwi cooler was a disappointment as there was no molecular angle to drink though it was a refreshing drink in all, with jaljeera, kiwi etc. The 4 peri sauces on the table were fabulous, the veri peri suited my tongue the best and used generously with fries, burger and wedges. The staff many a times seemed a little lost of things, did not notice lack of tissue paper on table as well as left over side plate on the table. Table cutlery was not adequate and it seemed it had not been cleaned too properly before previous customer. Might go again just to try the interesting menu.

South African based restaurant Barcelos opened it's first outlet in posh Khan Market area in Delhi year back.
I was quite excited when I heard that Kolkata is going to be their second outlet in India.

More than 120 outlets in 17 countries which is very renowned and established food chain brand all over the world. Bercelos started off in 1993 in Pertoria.

Finally I scratch it off from my wishlist and checked in to the first outlet of Barcelos at Acropolis Mall.

The interior is done really well,seating is comfortable and gives you the casual dining experience. The world map on the wall with light effect is eye catching.. even the imported different flavored sauce from South Africa is something new to try.

Service is fast but servers are not professional, when I enquired about the dishes they were confused and called up somebody else.

Their food mainly concentrate on authentic Portuguese flavours.
So after all the buzz about their colorful Burger I finally ordered out their famous colorful mini burgers ( Red/White/Black/Brown )
Red Burger - The best tasted Burger out of four buns.The bun was sweet and complimenting the Lamb filling. They even gave a paper how the bun is made and this red bun is made with tomato puree and spices.
Black Burger- The second best out of four buns..the black bun has a spicy taste which is made by spinach and other spices and I found it very delicious with the Lamb filling.

White and brown Burger - I personally didn't find it lips smacking and even the chicken fillings tastes average.

Grilled Trout Fish - The perfect blend of peri peri sauce with the fresh trout fish..just melts in your mouth.

Chocolate Brownie with ice cream - The desert was pretty average nothing extraordinary but as I'm a ice cream lover everything goes well with ice cream and chocolate.

Barcelos is planning to set more than 20 outlets in the metropolitan cities in India in coming five years.That means more portuguese food we'll get to try.
This outlet surely have potential to stand up to the competition but need to upgrade their staff better.

Barcelos is an international chain which now opened their doors to Indian market.
Luckily the First Outlet of Barcelos in Kolkata is just 5 minutes from my home in Acropolis Mall.
It was in my wishlist since last month but finally I gotta visit it in the yesterday evening !!!
It's basically a South African Restaurant serving Portugese cuisine. They are having their House speciality of the 4 Peri Peri flavored sauces they serve namely, Mild Peri, Veri Peri, Lemon Tangy Peri & Supa Peri. Of the above acc. to me Veri Peri is the most mouth watering one,still you guys are having the right to choose your own taste !

We ordered the MINI BURGERS PLATTER of 2 Chicken & 2 Mutton & obvio their speciality 1/2 Peri Peri Chicken.

The mini burger platter is a perfect option for those who want to try all the four burgers at once in smaller portions. These look small but actually are very filling. They serve you with multi colored burger buns and each tastes completely different from the other. The brown burger was the usual burger bun with mayo, tomatoes, lettuce & a regular chicken patty. The red burger bun made with the Beet Root extract was the next one. It had a very interesting tangy sauce in it but the mutton patty though really moist and succulent was a bit smelly . So, highly recommending the chicken patties if it comes to the burger zone! The white burger bun made with the coconut extract was extremely mouth watering with the moist chicken patty & the twist of a pineapple slice in it , made it all the more tasty and tangy . The Best Burger Bun out of the four is the black burger made with the cocoa extract. Though the bun was excellent above all the formers but the smelly mutton patty destroyed the whole flavor of the bun, thus chicken goes the best when it comes to Barcelos Burgers. You can obvio pick from their four Peri peri sauces as per the heat and flavor you want in your burgers. I liked my burgers to be spicy but went with the very peri because the supa peri had a very strong flavor to it which I didn't like much !

Along with the mini burgers platter they give you an option of selecting 2 complementary items outta 8 . Here, we opted for the Spiced Rice which was all total a blunder ( Never ever go for such rice with these kind of portugese cuisines) & Wedges with mayo dip was a perfect complement.

The 1/2 Peri peri chicken was basically the grilled chicken flamed in your choice of sauce, again will recommend you to go for the Veri Peri sauce! They serve it in two pieces, hot , tender & juicy which provides an extreme level of pleasure to your taste !

The staffs were courteous enough to welcome and serve you with a smiling face ! They even replaced our spiced rice with mashed potatoes as we complained for its taste & even gave us a complementary drink of fresh lime soda sweet .

Potugese wooden decor & lights with perfect music, generous behaviour of the staffs and Yummy delicacies make this place a Must Visit for you guys ! Hurry Up ...

This being the first visit to barcelos, i was a bit hesitant whether it would keep up to its name of being one of the worlds best chicken outlets, however soon after i stepped in ,the smile on the service guy's face and the greeting paved way for what would be a memorable experience.

Well, coming to the ambience, the restaurant has a portuguese feel to it with wooden decor, however the music being played did not complement it. House music did pep up the mood though.

Coming to the food, we ordered a set of 4 mini burgers,( 2 chicken and 2 mutton) and we preffered the chicken ones somehow. The white burger with its pineapple stuffing was definitely an awesome surprise. However the red and the black hogwarts spl burger were a close competitor. But i definitely will recommend chicken over mutton anytime!!Thr burgers came with 2 siders.

Coming to the siders, we ordered one wedge with a mayo dip which was nice and the rice which did not go wih the cuisine and our choice of dishes.

@The star of the show was definitely the chicken, half chicken, succulent pieces coated with veri peri sauce, recommend this highly for spicy food lovers. Yes now i know why barcelos is famous.

The icing on the cake was definitely the service, aakash being the person concerned, an absolute gentleman with a bright smile. We even got a complementary sweet lime soda on the house...Yaay!!

The only con apart from music was that the outlet does not have any hard drinks option. Beer would have been a great companion.

Looking forward to more visits and great experiences...Cheers!!

I had first had a taste of their Peri Peri Chicken at Barcelos, Khan Market, New Delhi. The heat, the perfectly grilled chicken served with a generous portion of potato wedges sprinkled with peri-peri powder had made me happy, and when I heard that Barcelos was opening up at Acropolis, I jumped at the chance to meet a few friends on the very first day of its opening. However, as luck would have it, I was late for an appointment, and ended up rushing out, so well, I had to leave with grief in my heart, and a mostly empty stomach. So when I went back a second time, I was determined to sample quite a few things from the menu. For those who are unaware, Barcelos is a South Africa-based chain which is known for its Peri-Peri Chicken.¬†Read more on the blog.

Barcelos...  4* but ..... 

Ok... peri peri .. very peri... mild peri .. its peri peri everywhere ... sometimes its just too much peri peri for me.. 

Food Ordered 

 Chicken Espeteda : Was served first and was just awesome 5* 

 Mini Burgers : 2 mutton + 2 Chicken  : Mutton ones were too good .. chicken was average...'  Burger You '  your grilled chicken burger was better .. But please dont use the peri peri sauce ... 

Half Grilled Chicken : Verry good but will rate 3.5 * , would have rated 5* if it was served first ... 
Nothing wrong with the dish ... quantity was good .. chicken nice and moist .. its just that the peri peri sauce... its the same sause used as with the espeteda .. so overall its of same palate.. 

Baby Meal : Grilled chicken thighs  with fries and juice ..  Tested it ... the peri peri taste was omnipresent (though a very mild one ). 

Pocket Pinch : Its at per with chillis and other international joints ... about Rs. 600 per person without drinks ... so not cheep for sure..

Now to conclude my review its my personal  advice not to order two dishes with peri peri base (any variety of it ) then you might not taste the difference .. and if possible order a drink... it will refresh you between each dish ... 

Service was very good and as expected from a international brand ...

Happy Fooding :)

It is nice to see that the city of joy is opening its gateway to a lot of international restaurants brands to open up and cater to the need of the consumers. And one such addition to the city is "Barcelos", a South Africa based restaurant chain.
Located inside 'Acropolis Mall' at Kasba, the place bears an ambience full of lively charm and energy vibes, that generates an impulse to indulge in. The interior decor reflects a fine taste of aesthetics and add up to the ambience even more.
Regarding the service, the staffs are polite, courteous and well behaved. Specially, Miss Bhavika, deserves a special mention for her good sense of hospitality.
However, apart from some rooster delights, a few of the drinks, and their house special Peri Peri sauces, there are several scopes of improvement I must say. In fact, the visually appealing multicolored burgers, which happens to be a buzzword of their in house delicacy, turned out to be overhyped and failed to meet the expectations, so far the taste is concerned.
Being the flagship branch in a city, I think it is high time they need to buckle up and take serious note of their shortcomings, to improve them accordingly.
The 3.5 rating is only for the service, ambience and some of the food items which tasted good genuinely.

Full marks for interior decor. Great place for a quiet sit-down. As for the main course, the choice is between burgers, wraps, steaks, salads and grilled chicken, all of which qualify as being among the best in the city. The grilled trout comes with a big reputation as well, and must be tried on the occasion of a revisit. The real showstealer however is the kabab platter that preceded the main course. With a variety of peri sauces to go with, there's no way one can go wrong with this.

Really enjoyed my first time at the Barcelos restaurant. The non-veg kebab platter was really delicious and included a terrific assortment of fish and chicken kebabs. For the main course, I opted for Chicken steak with spicy rice and mashed potatoes. The chicken was surprisingly juicy and the rice had a distinct flavor to it. The icing on the cake turned out to be the chocolate truffle which I ordered for dessert. Overall, a worthwhile experience and looking forward to visiting Barcelos again.

Another international food joint opened in Kolkata and for once, it was all about the way the meat was cooked.

Barcelos speaks about the Portuguese way of grilling meat and you get a feel of it right when you enter the amazing restaurant.

There are a ton of choices to indulge your need to have kebabs or burgers or even grilled chicken, it's all there.

The non veg kebab platter was simply incredible and the best thing from there menu were the excellent burgers.
I tried the black burger and it was incredible, the next one in my trial list has to be the red fiery burger.

The chocolate truffle at the end was just the perfect way to end the night. Certainly a place to visit again.

Even a few years back eating out in Kolkata meant hitting the age old joints located in park street, ordering from the same old menu & reluctantly taking a yellow ambassador to return home (20 rs extra if you stayed beyond tollygunge, god save your home was in garia). It was a nightmare if you hit tangra, or park circus for some Chinese or biryani. The city has surely come a long way from that (though you still have to pay 20 rs extra to the regular taxi if it's after 8 in the evening, irrespective of where you stay). Lots of national & international chains have set shop here. Not only MacDonald or KFC, brands from various corners of the world are opening up their stand alone restaurants here. One of the latest addition to the list is Barcelos. A South Africa based chain known for its Portuguese recipes & innovative burgers hit the food lovers in India with its first outlet in Delhi. Kolkata is the second city in the country to welcome Barcelos with open arms.
The chain derives its name from a folk legend of 'barcelos rooster', which originated in a Portuguese town of , no point for guessing, Barcelos. The same rooster can be found in the logo of the restaurant, in fact known as the 'Galo De Barcelos' this is one of the most common symbol of Portugal.
Coming to Barcelos, Kolkata, I was undoubtedly excited when they invited our group PanchPhoron for a food tasting session. However their recent event where they hosted some of the well known bloggers of the city had been a mess, & I was quite sceptical so as to what was awaiting us. Nonetheless it was an opportunity that shouldn't be let down, & we hit the joint with a mixed expectation.
Located in the top floor of Acropolis Mall, Kasba, it's easy to locate. As you approach the outlet, you'll find an outdoor seating arrangement outside the outlet itself, pretty uncommon. However we opted to sit inside, which to say the truth is quite huge going by Acropolis Mall standard. Wood-finished wall & floor, warm lights, colourful sofas all add to the perfection of the arrangement. The best thing to look at in my opinion was the illuminated world map on the wall with barcelos restaurant locations marked on it. Great backdrop for those gorgeous selfies for sure. There's even a bright red smoking booth fashioned after old British phonebooths inside if you feel the need for it. There's also the bar counter, to the left, which for now serves only non alcoholic drinks & molecular gastronomic cocktails.
We opted to seat at the tables on the farthest right, overlooking the geetanjali stadium. In my opinion if any good match is held there in the future, Barcelos would be the perfect place to enjoy it from.
Coming to the food, we were served a variety of molecular mocktails & some of their signature dishes. Molecular Gastronomy is a fancy name given to items where dry ice or liquid nitrogen is added for a novel presentation. In theory its actually about applying molecular concepts of quick freezing/heating of certain elements to cook any dish, which I don't think any of the eateries employ. Any way it's their call to call any dish whatever they want.
We tried the following items, a brief review of which is given below:

Drinks:

Berry Cucumber:
The first molecular drink to hit the tables was this drink prepared with cucumber juice, strawberry syrup, topped with a mix of orange juice & sprite, presented in a margarita glass & garnished with a slice of cucumber to the side. On top of it liquid nitrogen was poured which gave it a chilling temperature & a fuming look. Quite pretty to look at, & refreshing to drink.

Peachy Iced tea:
Freshly prepared iced tea mixed with pureed peach fruit served in a tall glass & garnished with cubes of peach. Not just Iced tea lovers, this can be the favourite among regular mocktail lovers too.

Tangy Mango:
Next item to come to the table was this amazing drink, again served in a tall glass. A perfect blend of ripe mangoes & select spices, topped up with sprite & ice cubes on the top, garnished with a slice of mango on the side. The addition of liquid nitrogen had in fact fused the ice cubes, thankfully the straw helped in getting the tangy mix from below the layer of ice. Another great drink.

Hey Rosey:
Next up was this frozen margarita, rose syrup mixed with cardamom & rose water, topped with sprite & garnished with crushed rose petal. Cool, sweet but extremely Rosey. A word of advice, wait for a few minutes, mix the crushed ice lightly with the syrup at the bottom, then drink it. That way it was a bit better for me.

Indian Classic Kala Khatta:
The last drink to arrive was this mix of pomegranate syrup, lemon juice & spices, topped up with coke. The classic kala Khatta flavour is retained well, the fuming nitrogen adding more to the charm & to the cold.

Food:
After all the amazing molecular mixes it was time for the foods that Barcelos had to offer.

Peri Peri Paneer:
A variation of paneer Kebab, two cubes of cottage cheese in each toothpick along with onion, yellow, green & red capsicum slices, lightly marinated in Peri peri sauce & served with a dip. The paneer felt a bit too salty, except which it was quite tasty.

Grilled Orange with Watermelon Salad:
Lightly grilled orange slices along with cubes of watermelon, served on a bed of lettuce & dressed with basil, honey sauce, this was a bit surprising fruit salad to find in their menu. However it's not as special as it appeared to be. May be I was looking for some more lemony flavour, while the whole dish seemed quite bland to me.

Arabic Mezze Platter:
Next dish to arrive was this cane basket containing small bowls of hummus, yogurt, peri hummus, baba ganoush & tabouli along with falafel & pita slices. Generally served to accompany alcoholic drinks or as an appetizer before the main course as it was in our case. The selection of dips were fine to have with the slices of pita, but the falafel itself was a bit too hard & dry for me. A little softer/spongier inside would have been great.

Chicken Espatada:
A typical Portuguese dish, this was chunks of boneless chicken breast (in place of usual beef), rubbed in garlic & salt, skewered in a long iron stick along with bell pepper & onions & cooked. The dish was even served on the skewer, which was hanging from a hook on a stand & some fries to go with it. Although the thing looked quite interesting, with a thick gravy coating all the pieces of chickens, taste wise it again seemed a bit too salty to me. Must be due to the marination process which is done a day in advance. In any case served hot & dipped in the Peri Peri sauce of your choice, it's a good dish of choice as a starter.

Mini Burgers:
Next up was this signature burger dish of Barcelos. This is the same dish you have been seeing pictures of in Instagram & Facebook. It consists of four chicken burgers, each having distinct taste & of course colours, stuffed generously with grilled chicken on peri peri sauce along with lettuce, tomato, peri mayo, pickled cucumber & jalapenos, served with perfectly cooked potato wedges as sides. The colour of the burgers are totally organic, the red one having the colour from tomato & chili powder while the black one having it from cocoa powder. The taste of these colours weren't overwhelming, and the burgers itself were quite tasty to have.

Peri Peri Grilled Chicken:
Well grilled chicken pieces marinated in their signature peri peri sauce & served with fries.However to add more to the taste it's advice able to have this one along with some more peri peri sauce , bottles of which are present on the table. The pieces of chicken were juicy & tasty, I stuck to the mild peri sauce, fearing the others will be to hot for me.

Desserts:
No meal is ever complete without some sweet desserts.So after the mains it was time for the desserts.

Chocolate fondant with ice cream:
Of course this one needs no introduction, the warm gooey chocolate sauce coming out from inside the small chocolate cake as you bite into it is popularly known as choco lava cake, makes an awesome combo with the scoop of vanilla ice cream which is served alongside

Choco Truffle Cake:
A slice of chocolate cake with alternating layers of milk chocolate & dark chocolate sauce underneath the gooey chocolate sauce on the top. Another great dessert.

Tiramisu:
A popular Italian dessert, made of ladyfinger biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with whipped egg mix, sugar cheese & flavoured with cocoa. The flavour of the coffee gave this one a great kick.

Baked Blueberry Cheesecake:
Lovely blueberry flavoured cheesecake topped with blueberry compote. The sweet & tangy blueberry tasted great, however the cheesecake tasted not that good. Maybe that was because I already had so many good desserts beforehand.

Overall it was a good experience. The molecular drinks, the tasty mains & sweet desserts all complemented each other. The burgers or 'worlds healthiest burgers' as they call it though looked great seemed a bit over hyped as per taste. The paneer & the Espatada could do with a little less salt, while the fruit salad could surely do with some extra tang. Hopefully they will be able to continue the taste & fame they bring with the name. Will surely visit again to try out their other delicacies.Until then,
Happy Eating,
Cheers!
                                          ...

We had our Sunday family lunch at Barcelos this time and we were definitely not disappointed at all. Loved the place, awesome food, courteous staff but service was a tad slow which I'm sure will improve. I for one am definitely going back.

The chicken was different from the regular fare we get here.Though not exactly like Nandoz but nevertheless it was good. The chicken was quiet well done.The flesh cane off the bones without much effort. 
The molecular dring Tangy Mango is a must try.
The staff is courteous & helpful.

Located beside Asia Kitchen on the top floor of Acropolis mall, Bercelos is a nice place to spend some time at if one is a lover of non vegetarian food. The external seats seem but dull but interiors are nicely decorated. We waited to be sat inside as we wanted to experience the ambience.
The menu resembles options at Nandos..lesser variety though. Having started recently they seem to be not fully ready for the crowds though.The people at the front desk struggle a bit to understand preferences and some of the menu cards have pages repeated.Thankfully we met a friend there and got to know that sizzlers there are nice so asked for a different menu that showed sizzlers and others that were missed out on the earlier.
We ordered Kala khatta and a bottomless Coke (cool as it comes at 90 Rs) and 2 chicken and 2 mutton mini burgers with wedges and dip as starter.After repeating our preferred bread it took 2 reminders to get what we had asked for.First time they gave the regular breads which had to be sent back.Then the wedges were forgotten and when asked for..the dip was left out!It arrived with the main course!Any way the burgers were decent.The red bun tasted best...the black one had an earthy taste that was not much to our liking.While I liked the mutton my spouse liked the chicken more.
For mains we ordered half chicken in a tangy lemon dressing and peri peri sizller with a veri peri dressing(the 2nd level of heat amongst 3 options).
Sizzler was so so..but had too much of zuccini and carrots.I liked the chicken and could not finish all and had to carry half of the portion home.
Overall a decent experience but they desperately need to improve their service.

Whoever has eaten at Nando's (in or out of India) and likes their grilled chicken - well, Barcelos is the place to be. The menu has quite a few choice of starters like kebabs, humus dips, but the star item is the flame grilled chicken with your choice of spicy sauce and sides.

Highs - The mashed potato side was buttery smooth and the drinks were refreshing. The decor and ambience were nice and chilled out. 

On the lows - The food was cold, and grilled chicken isn't good enough unless its piping hot. I guess they didn't grill it fresh and just reheated and served it, which isn't expected for that money and that wait. Also though the chicken was well coated in sauce - it wasn't seasoned well enough. They just need to turn up the volume on flavour and seasoning!!

P. S. try the Peachy Ice Tea for a little theatre and drama üòâ

Good menu, but the good things end 
We ordered a kabab platter but the kababs were cold. 

The ordered a rice dish with saut√©ed veggies which was very average. 

Bar has not started. But I guess with time they will improve on their quality.

Looking to visit again after sometime

Okay, this one isn't¬†a good experience at all.
FOOD: 2/5
To begin with, none of the sidelines were available!¬†No fries with burgers...imagine!¬†For mains we ordered 1/2 Chicken which was good, but again very dry.Thanks to the choice of sauces which made it edible for me. ¬†For starters we ordered 4 Chicken mini sliders. Honestly, the black and red breads¬†did not please our taste at all.Although the Black Burger is recommended, and we ordered based on reviews, but it failed my expectations.All the sliders had dry patty.For beverage - Kiwi kooler was good, but on the tangier side and Oreo shake.We had also, ordered a Peri Peri Black Magic, but cancelled since our experience with the sliders were not too great!
Honestly, everything seemed so off that we had to land up to the food court at the mall to fill our tummy!
SERVICE: 3/5
Service is good, but staff needs a little more training. Our tables hardly had cutlery and tissues. Had to keep asking for the same. The manager came in to check on us¬†when we told him about our experience. Also, just remembered the choice of crockery is bad (read uncomfortable).
AMBIENCE and DECOR: 4/5
Ambience is nice and quirky. If you are a smoker you will like the Smoking Booth beautifully done.The bar is really nicely done with high stools. We had taken a window seat, so the view of area was nice.
Seems to me like a one time visit, since it opened newly in Kolkata.Maybe when they start their drinks would visit them again.

Food ordered:
1) 4 Mini Burgers (Chicken)
2) Peachy Iced Tea
3) Hey Rosey
The presentation of the food was good. 
Along with the Burgers we ordered two sides: potato wedges with dip and coleslaw. The wedges tasted heavenly and the dip was well prepared. The Burgers were nicely done. Except I did not like the sauce inside the red Burger and the white Burger tasted a bit weird. The four sauces on the desk were awesome. 
Peachy Iced Tea was nice. The colour was perfect and tasted good too.
The best part was the 'Hey Rosey'. It was heavenly. The blend, the texture, the taste everything was so perfect. A must try. 
The staff were courteous. Service was prompt.

Barcelos happened very suddenly. I wasnt expecting to see an outlet here in kolkata. It was my brother who pointed out and we were immediately drawn towards it. When it comes to peri peri i only know one place and thats nandos. But this portugese restraunt is no less. The staffs are super friendly, well informed and active. 

The ambiance is good. Not a big fat space but very beautifully done & attractive. We went at around 8pm and by 9 the place was flooding in. The new hot spot for foodies. FYI no alcohol is available. 

Now coming to food: we ordered the brownie milkshake which was good but way to thick and heavy. If i had to gulp down the whole alone i wouldn't be able  to eat  so choose wisely guys while ordering for a drink or two.
Next we ordered their signature dish in 1/4 chicken , mild peri peri sauce with potato wedges and a cheese dip. I have to say it was amazingly done. The chicken , the sauce was so well blended that you just cannot find any fault. A must try i must say. Next was their mini burgers 2 chicken 2 mutton with mashed potatoes. Now let me tell you they serve burgers in four colours and each burger bun has a different taste. The red bun is sweet and the colour comes from beet root, the black is cocoa and little bitter in taste, the white is made of coconut and the brown is a normal bun. From the four the red and white tastes the best but however their mutton and chicken patty failed to impress me. The mutton had a very muttony smell which is found usually when mutton is not well done or marinated but am sure the smell does not bother people who are hard core mutton lovers. The chicken patty was hard and not juicy at all which made the whole eating process little tuff as the buns were soft but one has to hold tight and bite hard to chew off the burger. So yes i did not find it appealing at all. I tasted all of their peri sauces and i still feel nandos is the best. 

Price was ok considering the fact that its located in acropolis.

To rescue our taste bud, came their Peri Peri Chicken, their most signature dish, the flame grilled chicken with Peri peri sauce off coarse was just the opposite in taste. The chicken was quite juicy and moist and perfectly grilled. I drizzled their Tangy lemon sauce(served at the table) on grilled chicken and it remarkably changed the taste and I enjoyed every bite of it. Its highly recommended for the first time go-ers who love chicken. As this joint is famous for its grilled chicken, the signature dish of 1/4 chicken, 1/2 chicken, full chicken, chicken steak are a must try. These can be selected with one or two side dishes which include spicy rice, mashed potatoes, green salad etc.

hospitality of all the staff members are very nice and we meet to the host ,she is a girl name Sampita Das.
She help me out about the accommodation at the restaurant she is a very nice girl ¬†and then a girl took our order she have a very good communication skills .... and at last we enjoy a lot.......

Plus Points about Barcelos:

1. An awesome array of dishes

2. Both Vegetarian and non-vegetarians options are present

3. Kid's Menu available

4. Awesome ambiance, perfect for a relaxed family day-out/friend's hangout

5. Great service and quite pocket-friendly
Mine one and only recommendation to Barcelos is to add some Portuguese desserts in the menu, because first of all Kolkatans are famous for their sweet tooth and second of all, as much I know Portuguese have sweet  tooth too and are very famous for their Egg Custard and Arroz Doce or rice pudding and for some pastry shops.

This is the 3rd Barcelos outlet among India after New Delhi. 
Barcelos is named after Portugal city and they are very famous in Rooster items, so I finally visited and tried.

‚óèLocation‚óè
Top Floor of the Acropolis Mall beside Asia Kitchen. 

‚óèAmbiance and Deco‚óè
Walls are decorated with oil paintings and lighting was quite exquisite. 
Ambiance was very good also.

‚óèDrinks‚óè
Ferrero Rocher Shake- Very nice with a topping of Ferrero Rocher choclate. 

Kiwi Cooler- Its a molecular drink made of kiwi syrup and ice with a topping of kiwi fruit. Taste was spicy and energetic. 

‚óèStarters‚óè
While I waited for main course to come I ordered Mutton Kebab. Which was quite different from other restaurants. Minced mutton was cooked properly, very juicy and soft.

‚óèMain course‚óè
In main course I tried 1/2 grilled chicken.
Grilled chicken has skin which am not fond of so beware. If you don't eat skin of chicken then try not to order grilled chicken. Taste was very good. Tried with tangy lemon and mild peri sauce.

Black beauty and Bloody Red Burger: Its was chicken burger and with colourful bun. Those burgers were there speciality. It was a let down for me. Very average taste.. 

‚óèService‚óè
My server was Upasana who did a great job. She is very humble and efficient. 
All food was served within 13 mins of ordering. Which I didn't expected after seeing horrible reviews regarding slow service.

‚óèVerdict‚óè
Barcelos opened couple of weeks ago so they are improving day by day. Don't go for there ratings just try them. 
Kudos to Team Barcelos for bringing the chain in City of Joy.

Well this is the first time I tried out South African cuisine. And I would say that I loved it. I loved the way the espetadas were served and presented. They tasted delicious. We had peach ice tea , kiwi fruit drink, virgin mojito and bottomless Coke. We had their pita bread with hummus and I must say its the freshest pita bread I've ever had. It was warm and grilled just like bread should be. The hummus was green because of cilantro with a few chickpeas and olive oil. It was out of this world. For the mains my friends ordered the half roast chicken , chicken steak and their famous burgers. The chicken roast and steak were good and were both served with this spicy and creamy sauce that went really well with it. My friend had a vegetarian red burger which was good , it had a nice and thick potato patty with veggies in it. Another friend ordered the two chicken two mutton burger and he said that the mutton ones were better. What I had was the three chicken mini burgers. They were white , red and black. The red colour of the bread comes from beetroot and the black comes from ground coffee. The Bread was really soft and airy. The red burger had two normal cooked chicken slices with tomatoes , lettuce , mayonnaise. The chicken was juicy and a bit tangy. The black burger was spicy with a different seasoning. The White burger was different too and had a slice of orange in it ! Now normally I don't like sweet and savoury together , but this was exceptional. It had this sweetness in it and at the same time the salty and spicy chicken was there to complement it. Each main dish was served with potato wedges which were really crispy on the outside and soft and mushy inside , just how they're supposed to be. On the table were kept four types of dressings mainly piri piri and lemon. The espetadas were served with a salad with barbeque dressing which I absolutely loved. I would love to come back here again and highly recommend it to people who love meat , mayo and burgers !

I don't know why I never heard of Marcelos in Acropolis Mall in discussions that included Chilli's or Hopipola. I'll open with how I felt about this place, and I'll give it to you straight - it's one of the best I have tried recently. The restaurant specialises in chicken items, but I could see mutton and veg preparations on the menu, which seemed tempting. Nevertheless, i tried chicken dishes only. Their special chicken platter for 4 was sumptuous, and left us completely full,not mention that it was absolutely delish! The smoky flavour from the char-grilled skin was absolutely heavenly. I tried their molecular mocktail - my first molecular delight - and it left me excited and satisfied! The dry ice gave the drink a touch of magic, with foams flowing out of the glass, and bubbles forming in the glass from the bottom for as long as the drink lasted. I felt like a child, amazed by the show. The servers were polite, and interacted with a smile every time. The service was really fast. The decor was amazing, and the ambience was great. I'm planning on returning soon!

Ever since I saw the banner at Acropolis mall nearly a month back I was eagerly waiting for Barcelos to open. Off course a good news that after New Delhi, their 2nd outlet opened here in Kolkata.



Its inside the Acropolis Mall, Kasba. Its a 5minutes drive from Ruby General Hospital towards Gariahat, on the top floor. Its a nicely decorated resturant. We were invited there as part of Calcutta Instagrammers team by Barcelos.We got our table and were attended to impromptu. The staff were very friendly and really courteous.

Overall Experience:

We were served few molecular drinks. Tasted¬† the rosy flavor "Hey Rosey" at first. Personally I don't like much sweet drinks, and it was basically rose syrup with spices & rose water. Also tried "Tangy Mango Drink" which was spicy and tangy, personally I loved it. These molecular beverage drinks looked quite spectacular with the liquid nitrogen coming out from the glass. A photography session soon began.

In the table there were 4 sauce bottles. 3 types of Peri Peri (imported from south Africa as we were informed)- Mild Peri, Supa Peri and Veri Peri and one Tangy Lemon Sauce. 

The menu was a surprise for me as menu was not present in our table. The starter was Chicken Espetada. It was chicken kebab hanging with green peeper and onion and was served with finger chips and dip. Along with it, came a one veg ‚ÄúArabic Mezze Platter‚Äù consisting of Hummus, baba ganause, Peri Hummus , Yogurt Dip, Tabouli, Falafel, Lavash with 3 Pitas. It was delicious.


Then came our main course. We were served "Grilled Trout Fish" with yoghurt dip and french fries. The fish properly done and was extremely fresh.

Then they served their signature item. The mini burger combo(2 veg and 2 non-veg combo). They were colorful. I‚Äôve never had black, pink or white burgers. But tastes of these were surprisingly similar. But, this dish was really good and I will recommend.

Then another signature dish "1/2 Chicken" was served to us. It tasted really great. The chicken was juicy and when when we experimented tasting it with Hot peri peri sauce it was absolutely amazing.

Then we waited for the desert, but as it was not served after sometime we left. 

Barcelos is definately Recommended for kolkattans.

‚ÄúThe Idealisation of the¬†Barcelos¬†rooster derived from a legend concerning a galego who was sentenced to hang despite his protests of innocence. In a last minute appeal to the judge, who was having dinner at that time, the condemned man made a bold statement :.

I was very excited when i first heard that Barcelos has opened in Kolkata at Acropolis Mall, Kasba. If you wanna beat this hot summer and add a refreshing taste to your buds, the drinks like hey rosey, tangy mango are a must try.Among the food, you could try the chicken sizzlers, burgers with peri peri sauce.The desserts are the best according to me.Chocolate Fudge Cake with hot brownie and ice cream is a must try.Good food, Good music and a great decor. Barcelos is a place everyone should visit.

They specialise in chicken and peri peri... and no doubt they are excellent in these departments.. i would have given a 5 out of 5 if only these two things i had experienced. But their service was horrible. They were adequately staffed but all waiters were serving all the tables... so there was utter confusion amongst themselves. They offer unlimited soft drinks for a certain price.. 4 of us opted for that but everytime we asked to refill the glasses.. they took away the four glasses and returned with three of them.. You place some order and they bring something different... and one last suggestion... dont try their desserts.. the description and photos in the menu card will allure you to take one but they are just horrible.. there are so many dessert options in acropolis mall and you can go for them instead.. but thumbs up for the chicken and peri peri..

The food is pretty good but the service is extremely slow. 30 minutes for a burger and a wrap is just not acceptable! To top the disappointment, they were out of both fries and wedges. Such a joy-kill!

Juicy chicken, moist fish, buttery paneer. The cook on everything is spot on. 
What's better is you get to choose your level of spicy from tangy lemon to mild peri to very peri to fiery peri.. Fear not, if you chose a flavour too spicy, u have the option of changing the palate coz all the 4 sauces are there on your plate.
I disagree with the rating of 3.8 completely coz this place delivers as per itz promise: perfectly cooked chicken!

A newly opened restaurant at Kasba, 
Highly keen on trying Barcelos, I finally did but however it wasn't that impressive. 
I'm going to skip right to the pros and cons. 

Pros
1)The items on the menu are fairly priced and provide one with a wide option to choose from. 

2) Their milkshakes are worth every penny and goes well with the food. 

3) The Staff are friendly 

Cons 

1) The food over there isn't very great they try to add too much sauce and over do their chicken dishes hence making it rubbery 

2) The music is very loud and jarring .

Nothing exceptional. Over priced food. Too loud and irrelevant music. Staff intrusive. Food takes time. The overall experience stands at a moderate one. Being in the mall, gives it an advantage, but quality is so so. I ordered for a 1/4th chicken grill with rice by side. Nothing to die for. Decor is good.  One time go.

Nice modern decor, and unorthodox kind of food,(Portuguese) makes Barcelos, a special one. Their chicken wings with the beri beri sauce, and their mocktail, hey rosy is highly recommendable, so any one who is bored of that same kind of food North Indian and Chinese should check this one, you won't be disappointed. Still there is no bar, but I guess it will open shortly. 
P. S- Try not to wear red polo tees, as you may be mistaken for a stuff.

Barcelos in Acropolis mall has a good ambience. The mock tails are good; you have the option to have molecular mock tails where they would pour liquid nitrogen on the drink.

Food tastes okay, nothing exceptional though!

Was super excited to visit this oh-so-talked about restaurant chain, but I must say didn't leave a great after taste. 

The ambience is amazing. Loved the cozy decor. The waiter need to be a little more attentive and most importantly they need to know what they are serving their customers. 

The much sought after Peri Peri Black Magic is an Epic Fail for newcomers. The bread was stale and fell apart the moment you held it. They changed the burger to a white bread however, the taste wasn't that exciting. With Chillis right next to them, they need to up their burger game. 

The garlic fish with rice was super bland and the sauted vegetable were no less appetising. So nuh-uh. Not happening for me. 

The Cheesy Chicken Espetada was the ONLY and an absolute winner.  I shall go back to this place only for this number. Also, the much awaited firs Sangria Bar in Calcutta! 

All in all - they need to work on it so much more. It will be a shame if a brand like this does not survive for its quality.

I have more negative points to share than the positive ones. I am utterly disappointed with the service-be it providing plate,cutlery or refilling water or providing a prompt response to people when they literally have to shout out to catch their attention. And to top it all at the end of our dinner suddenly somebody dropped by a bag a of leftover at our table-only to realise that it was meant for some other table. When asked to recommend the dishes-the lady seemed lost and just asked us to make up our minds-waiters should be well versed about the menu they serve-everyone of them seemed so lost and confused! Very very peri ..oops..poor service is what I can associate with this place now.
Coming to the food only boneless thighs were worth a mention-fantastic 4 burgers were good,grilled trout,grilled fish were not significant enough. The peri peri sizzler however tasted pretty good.

Can't give a better rating right now-coz I feel they need to notch up their skills a hell lot to stay put in this competition coz people of Kolkata already have access to way better food joints!

We ordered for chicken livers with garlic roll, and unfortunately came to know that garlic roll is not available. So, instead of garlic roll landed up with chicken liver with handmade soft buns, the red ones, which they serve with burgers. As for the drinks, we went with herb hint and grape fruit punch, ideal we thought for the chicken Barcelona signature dishes with mild peri peri sauce. Fortunately, it was not disappointing at all, I loved the drinks which gelled well with the signature Barcelona dish. However, chicken liver was somewhat of a disappointment. So a -1 there. Otherwise, worth a try. The ambience is perfect for romantic dinner or a getaway with your friends. Service is really nice as they kept on asking about the food. So we were quite comfortable.

I was recently invited by Barcelos for a tasting session. Being a vegetarian stepping into a restaurant known for its non vegetarian food makes me a little apprehensive about what I might get. But I was willing to give it a go at least. Since we had been invited for the tasting session there was a preset menu available for us and were asked to choose our drinks. I picked the Hey Rosey as the combination of rose and cardamom flavors sounded very interesting to me especially since I love that spice. But I will say that it was not to my liking as I could not taste the cardamom plus the combination of the rose syrup and sprite made it too sweet. It was quite pretty to look at it but thats about it.¬†

Next came a platter of panner skewers which I liked quite a lot. The paneer was flavorful and well grilled giving it a bit of a crisp. I love smokey flavored food and very few places get it right. But Barcelos made me very happy on that front. Next came the Veg ¬†Espetada which was just so interesting! Veg versions were served with fries while the non veg had wedges. There were these thick chunky pieces along with the paneer which I thought was potato but turned out it was pineapple! Tangy, spicy and smokey pineapple! So so good. This dish was my absolute favorite. ¬†

Next came the Mediterranean platter which had a lovely assortment of dips and pita bread. I had to stop myself from polishing it off as there were still more items on the tasting menu. The Veg Trinchado with rice was ok. Though I did like the saucy panner gravy but it became a bit bland when I had it with the rice. We finished our meal with a rich truffle slice.¬†

I ¬†was extremely happy with my meal especially all the smokey food I got to eat. Me and my friends are already making plans of going there quite soon as we want to try out the burgers. I read a lot of bad reviews for the place so was not expecting anything but I was pleasantly surprised. Do check it out as the food is quite good.

The very interesting caption ‚Äúflame grilled chicken‚Äù by Barcelos and my love for grilled chicken items inspired me to review the recently launched restaurant at Acropolis Mall, Kolkata. Though I didn‚Äôt have much knowledge about Portuguese cuisine but can say Portuguese food is known for being lusty and robust as the cuisine is easy to prepare, and uses very basic ingredients. I was excited when got an invitation for a lunch and to represent Kolkata Food Blogger along with my co-bloggers Debjani , Indrani and Indrajit at . I must mention that after New Delhi ‚ÄòBarcelos‚Äô opened their second outlet in Kolkata at Acropolis Mall (4th floor) Kasba.¬†
¬†¬† ¬†This restaurant is a unique experience which you can‚Äôt miss to get the recreated taste of authentic Portuguese cuisine and of course they also pride themselves in the use of their different signature Peri Peri sauces (which they imports from ‚ÄòSouth Africa‚Äô.) You can choose your own level of spices for sure because each table is appeared with four different tests of ‚ÄòPeri-Peri sauces‚Äô ‚Äì Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri, Very Peri and Supa Peri.¬†¬† ¬†
¬† The restaurant is quite traditional and classy with yellow lighting around and paintings around the wall depicts the Portuguese culture and society. Bercelos Kolkata is quite specious with sitting together and enjoyment for dinner and lunch .We were served with their molecular drinks like green coloured ‚ÄúKiwi Cooler‚Äù in a tall glass which was made by Kiwi Puree swisted with spices and sprite served with fresh kiwi fruit as garnish. The second one was ‚ÄúHey Rosey‚Äù served in a stylish short round glass made off with rose syrup mixed with cardamom and topped with rose petals. Though personally I don‚Äôt like rose essence based drinks due to much domination of rose syrup, but they had balanced it withcardamom powder very nicely makes it much different. The last drink served was ‚ÄúTangy Mango‚Äù made off with tangy mango puree mixed with spices and topped up with sprite and mango slices. At the time of serving the pouring of liquid nitrogen gave a soothing look and nice heavenly presentation.

¬† ¬† ¬†In the starter they served one veg ‚ÄúArabic Mezze Platter‚Äù consists of Hummus, baba ganause, Peri Hummus , Yogurt Dip, Tabouli, Falafel, Lavash with 3 Pitas. For reference one plate of ‚ÄúArabic Mezze Platter‚Äù is sufficient for two.

The non-veg starter was a chicken one. You can say this one as their star Dish called ‚Äúespetada‚Äù ‚Äì that is basically a large chunks of chicken served on a long hanging skewer along with my loved one French fries with lettuce mayonnaise dip.

¬† ¬† ¬†As per the main course they served ‚ÄòTrout Fish‚Äô with a yogurt dip and French fries. They suggested a spice yellow rice along with ‚ÄòTrout Fish‚Äô which is really light and tasty. I did not like that one though it was my very own thought but many people find it very interesting and unique. 

¬† ¬† ¬†I loved ‚ÄúGrilled chicken with Peri ‚Äì Peri sauce‚Äù was really juicy and soft.

¬†The most unique I found was coloured burger. I have chosen chicken stuffing inside though there are four different veg and non-veg options. I tested both Red and Black Buns (Burger Buns), they explained that they use tomato powder with chili flakes, whole meal flour to bring the red colour and for the black one they use Roasted wheat, herbs, spinach extract and whole meal flour. In case of veg burger they explained it is not deep fried and so it is not crispy compared to other burger.

¬† Briefing my review I must say the overall presentation and hospitality was remarkable and an ideal place for peri peri lover a unique place to enjoy the authentic Portuguese cuisine. So thumbs up for this food joint.

Founded back in 1993 in Pretoria, South Africa, Barcelos is now a leading name in food chains and is the recent addition in Kolkata‚Äôs food hubs after Delhi in India. Barcelos specializes in serving food prepared in traditional way with the dose of health and goodness. They try to maintain the old food traditions and probably that is the main reason I was attracted to the joint even before going there! I visited the newly open food joint along with 3 fellow food bloggers from Kolkata Food Bloggers and here I am with my experience! Now the question is whether I found myself satisfied or not! Well I am to some extent and I am not a bit as well! After all we represent the country which believes in ‚ÄúAtithi Devo Bhava‚Äù (The guest is equivalent to God‚Äô) and we represent that country which believes in ‚ÄúPehle Darshandhari Phir Gunbichari‚Äù (look matters a lot even sometimes more than quality) as well and to my surprise this particular joint matches with both! Modern and minimalist interior and decorated with beautiful naturalist pictures Barcelos is obviously getting goodie points from me and some more goodie points for the amazing food presentation! Now coming to the hosting part, I think that is something the food joint need to re-search and research a bit for their own sake at least in the branch that I visited in Kolkata at Acropolis Mall. Customers need a glass of water after all! Now coming to the food, loads of goodie points from me and few minus as well!

Quite new in Kolkata's food scenario, Portuguese and Middle eastern Cuisine has come in the name of "Barcelos", a newly opened Food Chain who are famous for their flame grilled food from Portugal, house of Peri Peri. Located at the top most floor of Acropolis mall in Kasba, it's very easy to locate. Barcelos opened its first store in Pretoria, South Africa back in 1993. Using recipes mastered by the Portuguese hundreds of years ago, the flame grilled flavours became so popular that Barcelos can be found now in Worldwide and India is their newest destination. In India, Kolkata is their second outlet just after Delhi.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† When we, Kolkata Food Bloggers, got invited for a bloggers review meet at Barcelos, I had a faint idea of the famous peri peri sauce and Portuguese Cuisine but honestly speaking, I've never tasted them before. So I got excited and went there with lot of excitement with three of my other food blogger friends from Kolkata Food Bloggers. After reaching any restaurant, my eyes always revolves around the interior of the place. This time too, I went on to check the interior of Barcelos and got pleased with their Modern wooden decor with two full-walled painting of the city of Barcelos and their social life. In one wall, they have the world map showing the countries and cities, Barcelos is opened highlighted with yellow light. And in one corner, they kept a red colored closed booth for smokers which is very similar to London Phone booths. So the ambiance and seating couches are quite comfy for a relaxed family eat-out or friends hangout and this is obviously going to be a plus-point for Barcelos.
¬†¬† Once you are seated, each table gets their four signature Peri Peri sauces(directly imported from South Africa) served at the table. Three types of Peri Peri sauces are named according to their spice level are - Mild Peri, Very Peri and Supa Peri where Supa Peri is the spiciest and a Tangy lemon sauce beside the Peri Peri sauces. At first, we four were served the four glasses of mocktails or as they call it their "Molecular drinks" - First one was "Kiwi Cooler" served in a tall glass which is basically Kiwi puree twisted with spices and sprite/soda added. The second one was "Hey Rosey" served in a short round glass made up of rose syrup mixed with cardamom and topped with rose petals and sprite/soda. And the Third one was "Tangy Mango" served also in a tall glass where tangy mango puree seasoned with spices and Sprite/soda added. As all these were molecular drinks, servers very eagerly were pouring liquid nitrogen us after serving on the table, which was giving the drinks a smokey effect. I tried the Tangy Mango one and it was a bit too tangy according to my taste but overall not so bad and quite refreshing. Other than few more mocktails, they have quite a few cocktails or drinks with alcohol too for alcohol lovers. 
¬†¬†¬† After drinks were served,¬† it was time for appetizer and the servers brought a big basket full of goodies which they call "Arabic Maze Platter" which consists of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Peri Hummus,Yogurt Dip, Tabouli, Falafel, Lavash with 3 Pitas. The platter is sufficient for 2-3 people if you are not hungry like lion. Along with it, came the non-vegetarian starter, which is by the way their one of Portuguese signature dish, Chicken Espetada, is basically flame grilled bite-sized chicken breasts, onion and bell peppers skewed on a hanging long skewers which is served on your table and you have to pull out from the skewers to serve yourself with some crispy french fries and lettuce mayonnaisee dip. It will be a crowd-pleaser that I'm sure as the whole appetizer part has surely won my heart. 

¬†¬†¬† There is also Veg Espetada available for Vegetarian crowds. Also some more Portuguese exotic dishes are shining bright with exotic names on their menu card which you have to try out on our own risk as we havn't tasted those. Just kidding...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After these yummy appetizer, they brought in some coloured burgers which I havn't seen or heard before. As a food blogger, I've heard a lot about different whole-grain burgers but never heard or seen any colored burger which has all natural color and no artificial color. A good innovation I would say in the Burger World. They also have some amazing number of wraps, Middle-eastern Pitas along with a huge variety of Burgers. The list of burgers are also not a few, some are regular burger, some are colored burgers made with whole wheat, what they call, "World's Healthiest Burger". This colored burgers already made a buzz and a must-try main coarse item in Barcelos. The fact that made these burgers healthy is that they are made with all natural colors and wholemeal flour. The Red bun is made of tomato powder, chilli powder and wholemeal flour. The black bun is made of roasted wheat, spinach extract, herbs and wholemeal flour. The white buns are made of milk powder, coconut and plain flour. The buns tasted really healthy and tasty filled with veg and chicken patties along with peri peri sauce, pickled jalapenos, onions and cucumbers etc. We 4 were served 4 of these healthy burgers and we had to take one bite from each to taste all of them. 2 of them were veg and 2 of them were non-veg. Anyway, all of the burgers were juicy and soft but each of them tasted quite similar having peri peri sauce inside them. I personally don't like much sauces and mayonnaise in my burgers, but my friends found them quite appetizing and Its highly recommended. But I must say, those black, red and white buns were melt-in-the-mouth texture.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† For the main course, we were served Grilled Trout Fish (another signature Portugese dish) with yoghurt dip and french fries. They suggested to try the fish with a mildly spiced yellow rice. The fish was fresh but found a bit under-cooked and I didn't like the preparation at all even with the rice which was also very mild to my taste. I love grilled fish but this preperation was nothing like it, I'm really sorry to say that there was nothing to taste other than their peri peri sauce. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† To rescue our taste bud, came their Peri Peri Chicken, their most signature dish, the flame grilled chicken with Peri peri sauce off coarse was just the opposite in taste. The chicken was quite juicy and moist and perfectly grilled. I drizzled their Tangy lemon sauce(served at the table) on grilled chicken and it remarkably changed the taste and I enjoyed every bite of it. Its highly recommended for the first time go-ers who love chicken. As this joint is famous for its grilled chicken, the signature dish of 1/4 chicken, 1/2 chicken, full chicken, chicken steak are a must try. These can be selected with one or two side dishes which include spicy rice, mashed potatoes, green salad etc. 
¬†¬†¬† After we were done with this, we were almost full but still waiting for the next or last coarse, dessert to come just like other International food joints. But after 20 minutes of waiting when nobody served anything else, we decided to leave the place. But I realized later that they didn't offer any dessert as they don't have much of a dessert in the menu card other than some milkshakes. Nothing to worry, Other than the dishes mentioned here, Barcelos offers a huge array of food like, a huge list of appetizer, veg and non-veg sizzlers, awesome salads, Special Kid's menu also some Afro-Portuguese fusion dishes. 

Plus Points about Barcelos:

¬†¬† 1. An awesome array of dishes
¬†¬†¬† 2. Both Vegetarian and non-vegetarians options are present
¬†¬†¬† 3. Kid's Menu available
¬†¬†¬† 4. Awesome ambiance, perfect for a relaxed family day-out/friend's hangout
¬†¬†¬† 5. Great service and quite pocket-friendly

My recommendation :
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mine one and only recommendation to Barcelos is to add some Portuguese desserts in the menu, because first of all Kolkatans are famous for their sweet tooth and second of all, as much I know Portuguese have sweet¬† tooth too and are very famous for their Egg Custard and Arroz Doce or rice pudding and for some pastry shops.

Went for dinner tonight. The decor is simple and nice. Staff are courteous. However they need to be little more professional in the service -- brought appetisers and main course almost at the same time; and then fretted that the potato wedges served as the sides to the main course would get soggy of we took too much time to finish the appetisers! However their politeness covers up a little for the sloppiness. 

What we tried --
1. Non veg assorted appetiser platter -- It has generous portions of chicken, fish and mutton. Enjoyed with the peri peri sauce and dip. 

2. Mini burgers with both mutton and chicken -- Very soft and juicy. 

3. Quarter chicken -- chose the very peri rub and the chicken was soft, juicy and flavourful. 

5.  Tiramisu -- soft, melt in the mouth and rightly flavoured. 

We carried back home --
1. Chicken trinchado with rice
2. Garlic fish with rice

We are yet to try those. But they look appetising. Also the packing is done very nicely and securely. So if you ever want to take out food from Barcelos, packaging would not create any hindrance.

After having heard a lot about this new outlet, we decided to give it a try this Sunday afternoon, and the entire experience was surreal.
Ambience was brilliant, with brilliant lighting and music. Ordered molecular drinks, tangy mango and hey rosy. My daughter's went crazy with the smoke effect emanating from the drinks.
Chicken Espetada  and chicken picante were out of the world, a taste, we had never experienced before. Kids absolutely loved the coloured mini burgers.
Overall a very unique sense of presentation, very courteous staff, great ambience and an unforgettable experience. Can't wait to get back with entire family again.

I first saw the banner at Acropolis mall nearly three months back and since then, I've been eagerly waiting for Barcelos to open. In case you are unaware, Barcelos is an international restaurant chain that has outlets in 16 countries including India. The food served is Afro-Portugese and their speciality is the flame grilled peri peri chicken. 

I was invited by Barcelos for a tasting and was really impressed by their menu. I started off with a Tangy Mango Drink  with mango puree, sprite, spices and lots of ice. This is part of the molecular beverage menu so the drink looked quite spectacular with the liquid nitrogen coming out from the glass.If you love spicy and tangy drinks, you will like this.

Next up was the Chicken Espetada, a Portuguese special and I loved this one. The menu describes it as a hanging dish skewed with chicken breast, onions and peppers and served with potato wedges. The chicken was juicy and grilled to perfection. If you want to spice it up, add any of the four variants of peri peri sauce placed on the table. 

The other two dishes I tried were the Mediterranean platter and the Grilled Trout. I loved the dips in the platter specially the Baba Ghanoush & Hummus but the pita bread was dry and thick. The Grilled Trout was by far my favorite. Basically a whole trout, deboned and grilled with sauces served with a salad. The fish was very fresh and again, grilled to perfection. For dessert, I had a rich and sinful chocolate truffle cake.

I loved the cheery ambience of the place and the servers were attentive and extremely helpful. Will surely go back to Barcelos and this time, will try their famous burgers.

As their website states : This restaurant is named (and also symbol-ed) after a quint Portuguese town; famous for an ancient legend of the Barcelos rooster. With it's exotic name and Portuguese offerings Barcelos is one of a kind in Kolkata. This newly opened restaurant has definitely sparked the interest of the food lovers all across the city. 

Located inside Acropolis Mall, beside Asia Kitchen; this place is easy to find. I went to this place with a bunch of friends. As I entered, I was warmly greeted. The place was quite humongous. and divided into distinctive sections. One section had lots of wall art with a brick pavement kind of finish. I was myself sitting below a glowing map of the world with countries having barcelos marked in red. An elaborate cocktail counter, lots of paintings, huge clocks and wall art gave the place a distinctive look. 

Service was quite excellent. The manager Vijay Kumar Yadav was attentive and helpful. Our server Ritwika were gracious, knew her basics(considering that the place has opened for just 2 weeks), and diligent. 

Now the food. Well firstly, the presentations of almost all the dishes were quite splendid. 

* Tangy Mango Drink : This was a molecular drink, so lots of smoke with liquid nitrogen. Wow presentation(had to take a video :P) ! It came in a elongated, V-shaped glass. The menu said : GARNISHED WITH MANGO SLICE ( well this wasn't there). Apart from its very flamboyant look, this drink tasted mediocre; mainly tangy and spicy. It had mango puree, sprite, lots of ice(too much).

*Berry Cucumber Drink : This was another molecular drink with DHUYAN DHUYAN, DHUYAN HI DHUYAN . This was a red colored drink and came in a golbet sort of glass. With strawberry syrup, cucumber toppings, sprite and orange juice, this drink was refreshing. But in my opinion, both the molecular drinks were a disappointment, apart from the presentation.

* Cheesecake Shake : Best drink of the evening. This came a big jar shaped glass with a chunk of cheese cake as garnish. Made of vanilla ice cream, cheesecake, peanuts, and crushed ice, this drink was a HIT. It was thick, creamy & aptly sweet. This is a must try. 

* Date with Orange : This drink had more to offer than just the pun in its name. It also came in a big jar, with dates as garnish. It was deliciously thick & creamy. The flavors of orange, vanilla ice cream, coconut and crushed ice blended well. An yummilicious drink indeed.

* 1/2 Chicken : This was primarily grilled chicken with a chef special sauce. It came with some french fries and mayonnaise. Immersed in chef special sauce the chicken looked quite enticing and tasted palatable. They also offered 4 kinds of sauces(order of their hotness) : Tangy Lemon, Mild Peri,Very Peri,Supa Peri. All the sauces tasted good, especially the Supa Peri went perfectly with the chicken. The french fries tasted good, they were crispy and the mayonnaise sauce was thick. 

*Mini Burger - 2Mutton-2Chicken with a Portion of Spicy Rice and French Fries : This platter consisted of 4 multi-colored mini burgers(2 of each flavor), rice in a small bowl & french fries. With so many color variations this burger platter looked very alluring. I had to take a billions picture to satiate the budding photographer in me. Ritwika kindly dissected the burgers for us and we immediately dug in. Well, with a heavy heart I must say that while I had great expectations, all went down the drain with the first bite. The bread itself was not soft. The chicken burger was bland and came with some grilled chicken, mayo sauce and lettuces. The mutton burgers were definitely the better ones. The mutton patty was far tastier and blended well with the red sauce inside. The spicy rice bowl had nothing spicy about it and came in a small bowl. it was mainly flavor-less yellow colored rice with some zucchini and capsicum. I didn't like its taste.

We decided to end our evening soon(meaning without dessert), since we had to leave early ! I congratulate the team on their efforts. Welcome Barcelos to the City of Joy; hope you have joyous journey here! :)

Very disappointed. The d√©cor is fantastic. And the food us just the opposite. We ordered for all the signature dishes and were sooo let down. It was like all the items were so similar. There is like nothing except the peri peri sauce which seemed so over hyped. Nandos is much much superior. Very very disappointed

Barcelos has opened up their new outlet in Acropolis Mall, Kasba . Off course a good new for us Kolkattans that after New Delhi, they‚Äôve chosen Kolkata for their 2nd outlet in India- good news. Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù

How to reach and when to reach:

Its inside the new mall-baby in town Acropolis Mall, Kasba and bang on Rajdanga Road. While going from Ruby General Hospital towards Gariahat, a 3-4 minutes drive and its on your right hand side. Get in and go up to the top floor. Its just there. Its an all-day outlet. Spic and span, nicely decorated- just the way its expected. We were invited there from KFB team. Thanks Team Barcelos.

Experience:

For mocktails, we were served a molecular drinks each and for me, probably they assumed I would love the rosy flavor, and it was Hey Rosey for me. It was basically rose syrup with cardamom and rose water. As it was a molecular mocktail, hence, some fizz was mandatory and the servers tried their best to give us the experience‚Ä¶ Doesn‚Äôt matter if I didn‚Äôt like the taste much, the presentation was fantastic.

For condiments, on table, there were 4 types of sauces. 3 types of Peri Peri (supposedly exported from south Africa)- Mild Peri, Supa Peri and Veri Peri and one Tangy Lemon Sauce.

Presumably, Barcelos had a pre-defined set menu in mind and as the menu was not presented to us beforehand, it remained a surprise element for us (at least me) throughout the meal. The starter was Chicken Espetada. In a layman‚Äôs language, it was chicken kebab hanging with green peeper and onion on two sides and great to look at. It was served with finger chips and dip as sides. It was delicious. Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù Along with it, came a one veg ‚ÄúArabic Mezze Platter‚Äù consists of Hummus, baba ganause, Peri Hummus , Yogurt Dip, Tabouli, Falafel, Lavash with 3 Pitas. Its safely enough for 3 persons to start with. The dips were interesting.

¬†
Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù Till this point of time, we were not served water. Probably we were served the mocktail, hence, we were supposed to be satiated by it. anyway, its time for the main course now. And, for the main course, we were served Grilled Trout Fish with yoghurt dip and french fries. The fish was fresh, extremely fresh and chef was eager to offer us the freshness quotient. Such that, it smelled slightly fishy (this is in true sense and I am not joking here). Next time, anybody visits this place and orders the same, please make sure, you mention this to be full-done, else the freshness-quotient is bound to hit your senses. The marination was somewhat similar to the chicken espetada, but whatever. We were served yellow rice along with it, which was basically a tasteless pilaf and can easily be avoided.¬†

The next dish was their signature item. The mini burger combo. It was 2 veg and 2 non-veg combo. Out of these 4, the burgers were the highlighted ones. I‚Äôve never had black, pink or white burgers. The tastes were remarkably different. But, the chef again was extremely consistent. Such that, the fillings for the non-veg burgers were strikingly similar. Nevertheless, the dish was really good and highly recommended.

Finally, the dish of the day arrived. 1/4th chicken (grilled) with their secret marination. It was a closely guarded secret in this joint and the chicken was seriously good- juicy and tender. But one word of caution. Remember, we are used to instruct those roadside chicken fry stalls ‚ÄúBoss, give me breast piece and not leg‚Ä¶.‚Äù, the pure reason being the portion size. Its the same story here. Order them specifically for a breast piece, because that piece is considerably larger than the leg piece. But again its your call, unlike the dry breast piece, leg piece is much much juicier. Hence, choice is yours. Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù‚Ä¶. The tumblers were over and they clearly are saving water and in turn, going the ‚Äúenvironment-friendly way‚Äù.

We were full and waiting for the dessert. But, god thought otherwise. Barcelos was taking care of our calorie counter and hence, omitted dessert for us. And we kept on waiting. After sometimes, we left and while leaving, probably the longing for desserts was evident on our faces‚Ä¶. They asked us for the same and being ‚ÄúBhadralok‚Äù, we politely denied. Well, ‚ÄúCan I have some water please ?‚Äù was still the question on our minds.

Finally, I can suggest that go there. have their burger combo- its really good and chicken espatada is also pretty decent. Definitely, worth a visit.

Last weekend tried this new restaurant opened in Acropolis. The Portuguese cuisine is quite different delicacy in Kolkata, so had to try it. The ambience is very bold and colorful. We ordered chicken drumsticks, mutton sizzler,  brownie shake and all the foods were tasty and the staffs are really really cheerful and helpful.

Expensive food!
(surprisingly expensive keeping in mind the quantity)
Sauces are nothing to boast about.

The variety of burger buns are good but the pricing seems unjustified. 

Not many options available for vegetarians.

I went to the much talked about Barcelos on its opening night and repeated my visit this weekend.. I wanted to check the consistency before I wrote a review.

First impression- the place has a casual yet contemporary look which I like. The staff were friendly and overall looked an feel was welcoming.

The menu is a refreshing change to the current offering in the city. The falafel platter was excellent. As expected the falafel was crispy outside and soft inside, the dips had an interesting twist to them and I not being a egg plant fan cleared the portion happily.
Let's admit that chicken is by far the most cooked protein in the world.. so its all about¬† the sause and boy does Barcelos have the sause..loved all the levels of sauce..It added a nice dimension to the grilled flavour of the chicken,more so the thing that I liked the most was that the sauces allowed customization as per my mood.
I even tried the rice item in the menu and unlike many places the did not serve over cooked thick grain rice. The rice was light¬†and flavourful.
The main attraction for me however was the colourful burgers..They had unique taste, I had tasted nothing like it before. It's a welcome break from the repetitive kind of burgers available these days..its a must try.

There are things beyond the food iv loved about the restaurant.. There attention to details and customer centric approach has impressed me. The London telephone booth designed smoke room is one of them. A restaurant serving drinks have often found customers craving for smoke and the only way to get it fixed in a mall is to leave the mall itself, the addition of the booth does the job.

Over all I would happily hang out with my friends and family and enjoy a non pocket pinching evening.

Newly opened and situated at the top most floor of Acropolis Mall, so its very easy to locate and when you find the place you find tons of happiness with it too.
A fantastic restaurant with an awesome environment. The serving persons are too nice.
Tired their sizzlers and the molecular drink, it was just mind blowing. Will surely visit this one again to try out their other dishes.
Price is slightly high, Quantity is enough.
Inner decoration is just WOW. Seat are comfy. Serving time is good enough. Large enough to hold a crowd. Really one of the coolest restaurants I have visited.¬†
Overall a really nice experience.

Visited this place during puja, found their food quality degrade a bit. My salmon was too salty, my friends chicken was half cooked, they took too much time to replace that dish. And in the end the frsh lime soda was worse than the street vendors selling nimbu paani. Really disappointed.
Last update about this place - never again visiting this place.

Already being a fan of portuguese cuisine since visiting 'Nandos' during my London days and then back in India at New Delhi, Barcelos added a new height to my portuguese experience. We visited on a leisurely Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was more than half empty. However it filled up gradually with curious people sneaking in and hence an advanced table reservation during weekend nights might be a good idea. The interiors were sober and classy. My daughter liked the world map they portrays on the wall. They pride themselves in the use of signature peri peri sauces (you can select from a range of 4 levels of hotness), delicious burgers and nonetheless their signature grilled chicken dishes.We had ordered the Cheesy Chicken Espetada and their signature Whole Grilled Chicken. The Chicken Espetada consisted of juicy and extremely delectable chicken pieces on a skewer with capsicum and onions.The spicy rice and fries on the side really went well with chicken. Though the quantity of sides could be a little more. Considering you are sharing the dish amongst 3 people, it was really less. Whole chicken was tenderly marinated and grilled to perfection. The use of sauce did full justice. We also ordered chocolate shake which was really good, as well. The taste of food itself deserves full marks but I would still rate it at 4 because of the slow service. We were kept waiting for our order for a good 25-30 minutes with the restaurant less than half full in the beginning. I just wondered how long it might take had it been during the busy evening with more people around. Other than that,Barcelos is a must visit for people loving portuguese food or those who dare to try out a new cuisine.

Barcelos is a fantastic hangout and food joint in my city, Kolkata. It has introduced itself few days back.. They came up with our very known Portuguese style food and those Peri Peri Sauces. We had tried Chicken Burger with Fries and Chicken Peta. Extremely good food. Ambience is really very nice. And pricing is absolutely pocket friendly. Though they don't serve alcohol, but does not bother if I get these good food :)

I was already a fan of portuguese cuisine after visiting 'Nandos' in the UK but Barcelos just took my love for portuguese a step further.I have minor complaints with their service as they invited us into the restaurant to be seated,only to tell us to get up moments later as someone else had reserved the table earlier. Inspite of such minor service flaws, Barcelos is an experience you cannot miss.
             The interiors are minimalistic and classy.They pride themselves in the use of the signature peri peri sauces (you get to choose your own level of spice with each dish),delicious burgers in attractive colored buns,and obviously their famous chicken dishes which are to die for.
     We had ordered the Chicken Espetada and Chicken Cataplana with Yogurt Dip.

The Chicken Espetada - It consisted of juicy and extremely delectable chicken pieces on a skewer with capsicum and onions.The rice and saut√®d grilled vegetables on the side really went well with chicken.

Chicken Cataplana - This dish was a sizzler consisting of grilled chicken shreds with rice and grilled vegetables. The yogurt dip and the sauces in this dish were absolutely lipsmacking.It was one of the best dishes I have tasted in a while.

I have deducted .5 here just for the slight lack in service.Other than that,Barcelos is a dream come true and a must visit for anyone who loves to experiment with their food.

So after reading rave reviews about this place, finally went to Barcelos yesterday. It's the newest addition to Acropolis Mall's food joints and also the first and only restaurant to have al fresco seating. We however chose to sit inside. There is a big map of the world with roosters marking the spots where Barcelos has spread its wings. The d√©cor is good as is the ambience. 
We ordered chicken espetada with spicy rice and wedges with dip on the side, 3 chicken mini burgers with french fries and dip on the side. The espetada is a hanging chicken skewer Portuguese dish while the three burgers are not the usual brown but red,black,white instead! But they are made with natural ingredients as informed by our waitress. The red one is made from tomato and beetroot puree,the black one from cocoa and spinach extracts while the white one is slow roasted.You can choose among tangy lemon,mild peri,veri peri and supa peri sauces from the table and also to put in your dish.Overall i loved the food and will be back soon to try out more dishes.
P.S. The plates are a little small and not too sturdy.

Food Bloggers Meet at Barcelos

It was a pleasant afternoon on Saturday when I reached Barcelos at Acropolis Mall to attend a blogger‚Äôs meet organized by the management, and that was the day we had been waiting for. Food Bloggers Meet at Barcelos (a newly opened restaurant). Me and my three food blogger buddies were united to attain that event together. The event was declared to be started from 2:00 PM onward and it continued till 4:00 PM.

What We Expected

As being professional food bloggers we used to attain countless events like that and habituated of the event procedure, the welcome gesture of the authority and all. So a warm welcome was quite expected at the beginning. Usually, such food tasting events start with a welcome drink which normally served within five to ten minutes just after the guests arrive. And then the special starter items of that restaurant are used to be served next half an hour. Then we are served with the best dishes of their menu and last but not the least the yummy desserts are dished up. We expected the same or may be better from Barcelos.

What We Got

But it‚Äôs very woeful to say that we got disappointed at the very first as the welcome procedure was too much informal. The restaurant authority was not concerned about that. However, that way the event began. It was the time for the welcome drink and again, they disappointed us by serving only three welcome drinks at 2:50 PM. As we were four people together, we demanded another drink, which was served by them after another half an hour, this gross negligence by the steward and staff in general was really embarrassing.

We had a small introductory talk with management and got informed that over 40% dishes in their menu are Veg. So I planned to give some try on their veg items. We also got informed that there will be another bloggers meet where few bloggers from Delhi are coming for reviewing Barcelos, Kolkata.

We ordered two veg burgers and two non-veg burgers accompanied by few veg and non-veg starters. While we were expecting starters on the table, they served us one veg and three non-veg burgers, which again a very gross negligence, as we had ordered two veg burgers. They skipped starters and interrupted the usual genre of presentation. Though we continued anyhow, but service was extremely slow. The replacement burger reached our table after one hour, awful. Veg burger was bit dry and missing the flavour and crunch, I didn‚Äôt like it at all.

The next item, Veg Platter, a mixed platter of different kebabs accompanied with stuffed mushrooms, potatoes, paneer and grilled vegetables; was again atrocious and was not palatable even with peri peri sauce. The Veg Espetada that followed was possibly the only food item that had some class. It was a hanging dish skewed with stuffed mushrooms, marinated paneer with onions & peppers with two regular sides. It had really interesting flavours and full credit goes to the chef for successfully playing with spices and herbs; however it was a tad too salty and bitter.

Finally at 4:10 they could not even serve the half of the items which were put for photo-shoot and tasting, we lost our patience as they were taking forever to serve and informed it to the restaurant authority. We were offended by the service and realized that we did nothing but just wasted a whole afternoon in such a poor place. We were extremely unsatisfied and decided to leave the place and did the same.

Verdict

In today's competition if anyone opt out for a business which is totally customer based then he / she should be concerned about the customer's convenience first. Especially when you are running a restaurant then it is equally important to maintain effective hospitality besides the food quality. There are so many restaurants in the market which are famous among people as they are aware of using the right Mantra which compiles both the food quality and good hospitality. We wonder that if it‚Äôs really possible for Barcelos (which is just a start up) to survive in the market in today's age of competition by being this much unprofessional.

Overall I had a very unhappy experience. Service and customer satisfaction is surely not on their priority list, which is a must for hospitality industry. This is a matter to worry about!!

Horrible experience. Never going back again. First of all they took 10 minutes to give water. We ordered for one mini burger, one one-fourth chicken and one chocolate milkshake. The burger came after 25 minutes but to our utter disappointment, the chicken didn't come even after 1 hour 30 minutes. Finally we had to call for the cheque after asking them several times for the chicken. The staff seemed confused and were not aware of the orders.

The latest addition to Acropolis Mall. Barcelos is the ultimate destination for chicken lovers and would feature very well if it starts serving Alchohol too. Portuguese food without wine or beer is kind of incomplete.

I had been to the place with my fiance and my aunt. A treat to my aunt was long overdue and I had heard quite some reviews for this place, so all in all it was the perfect plan to go there.

We were quite excited to try the place and so were everyone else which was evident by the long waiting time.

We got our table and were attended to impromptu. The staff were very friendly and really courteous . A special mention to our server for the day Akash, he was really always available for any small request and I seriously appreciate it.

Coming to the food we started off with mocktails , The Electric Blue Fizz, The Grape Fruit Punch and the evrgreen Pineaple Juice.
We were quite confused with what to order as the menu was filled with mouth watering delights and once again it was Akash to the rescue who guided us and we had the Chicken Espentada and Barcelos special half chicken. I loved the food and the variety of
Peri Peri sauces available at the table.

The chicken was a bit dry for my taste. But yes it was delicious. Service time was surprisingly fast and we had food on our tables within minutes of ordering.

Loved the decor and the ambience. The food was top grade and the mocktails were out of this world. Would have surely given a 5 if not for the long waiting. Nevertheless a good experience looking forward to more awesome visits.

P.S its a good idea to reserve your table on weekends as this place has a huge rush.

I visited this place with a friend at about 8pm on a Sunday. We had to wait for around 15 mins before we got a table. Well,that was fine for us 'cause we had heard a lot about this place and were quite excited about it. But sadly,it failed to make a good impression. We were given black-coloured plates which were full of finger prints and spots,quite prominent over the black color- after requesting to change them,twice,a lady came up to us and said that that is their cleanest best! We had already placed the order,otherwise we would have come out. Anyway,the food- Cheesy Chicken Espetada and a "Molecular Mocktail" weren't that special- they are only charging for the presentation. The ambience is also not that phenomenal- the wooden chairs are pretty uncomfortable,the table is too cluttered,the menucards are tattered...I'm sorry,but Barcelos- really dissapointed.

game for south African taste sprinkled all over Portuguese cuisine? Or maybe you adore a dash of cocoa in your burger or juicy tender grilled chicken with peri peri sauce? Well if you nod your head affirmatively or even feel your taste buds suddenly active, the obvious place to flock is barcelos in acropolis mall in kasba,Kolkata. the one of its kind with sangria bar boasting 21 flavours, you can drool from a long list of food items like world's healthiest burgers-black bun¬†containing roasted wheat, herbs or red bun with tomato powder,chili¬†flakes or even white bun containing milk¬†powder coconut and plain flour. infact barcelos marinates its chickens 24 hrs before flame grilling them, no doubt the chicken is juicy,tender,well cooked and the spices well permeated actually through every¬†layer.i tried chicken espetada,chicken peri peri and tangy mango drink,and as they¬†claim,i too agree that chicken peri peri is one their signature dishes.The four different types of peri peri sauce accentuate the already greatly cooked meal.If I talk about their shakes and juices you can gulp for instance KitKat shakes,ferraro rocher shakes(all chocolate lovers unite) or even tiramisu,roasted almond &dark chocolate or irish cream whipped with vanilla ice cream. Parched?¬†please try their molecular drinks--well going back to chemistry classes--solidified ice, liquid nitrogen and your drink--the threesome unleash the heavenly feeling of ambrosia. great staff, great food, great ambience, and well within budget--barcelos is a 'must visit' eatery either with family or friends anytime, anyday between 11am to 11pm.

Barcelos- what more can I say?
On a more serious note, the aroma of the signature Peri Peri chicken hits you even before you walk into the restaraunt. Kind of an appetite builder for sure! Cozily done up with wooden interiors and a European style theme, a well designed hang out.
The food speaks for itself. A must try- the signature chicken pieces, which can be customised with a sauce of your choice. My personal favourite would be the veri peri :) 
Also, the hanging kebab is delicious. Moist, succulent boneless chicken pieces on a skewer, with your choice of sides.
Being accompanied by vegetarians, I even had a chance to sample their dishes. Can safely say this place has a good (and delicious) variety for vegetarians as well. 
All in all, a must visit !! Cheers guys !

This restaurant has opened recently at Acropolis mall in Kasba. We dropped in here around 8 pm last Monday. The ambience was really nice. Welcoming staff, cozy big bright coloured sofas, smoking booth, spacious interiors. Everything was perfect. We were really hungry and quickly started discussing what to eat. The staff helped us with the orders. We were 7 very hungry people. Ordered a full chicken which was supposedly Barcelos speciality. We after that ordered burgers and sizzlers. The burgers came with one side or with two as ordered. They had 6-7 options for the sides. We stuck to fries and wedges and dips though. The Red meat burger, the peri peri bloody red burger, the too much red meat burger were really tasty. The full chicken- 7 huge portions of chicken cooked with an tangy peri peri flavour was just deletable. What we didn't like at all was the sizzler. It was more of a not so tasty rice and less of meat. But, the main reason which would make me think twice before going back to Barcelos ever again would be the ABSOLUTELY bad service. They have way too many confused staff. The food was served almost an hour after being ordered. And that too not together. The staff were even worse at following instructions. Not only us, the tables nearby also had the problem with the service. Next would be the desserts. Barcelos sure serves the most over priced desserts in Kolkata.
I definitely hope that they improve on their service, or sadly they won't be able to survive at Acropolis Mall with Chili's being just in the corner.

This newly opened restaurant is located in the 4th Floor of Acropolis Mall.

The hostess greeted us and ushered us in the restaurant which was pretty empty on a Saturday late afternoon. She even explained their speciality and signature dishes which is the peri peri Chicken.

The first thing which you would notice is a world map in golden lights at the far end wall opp the entrance.

The ambience and decor is quite good with street paintings and paintings hanging in the walls.

Ordered Stuffed Chicken Kebab as appetizer / starter dish, which is quite good. They basically serve Portuguese dishes in African spices. Almost all their dishes are prepared using the sauces - Mild Peri, Tangy Lemon, Supa Peri & Veri Peri with varied levels of spices.

We ordered 1/4 Chicken and Chicken Steak after taking the order their head cook came back to us saying though they have Chicken Steak available but as they dont have the best portion so requested us to go for something else, hence went for 1/2 chicken instead.

As per their description of both 1/4 Chicken and 1/2 Chicken - "Chicken marinated in our secret recipe sauce & grilled upto perfection" - Really very well cooked and made spicy with their signature sauces.
1/4 Chicken
1/2 Chicken
We ordered the above dishes with Mashed Potato - quantity of mashed potato was less in comparison to other restaurants.
Apple Juice

Really liked it. Will look forward to their Coloured (Red & Black) Burgers on my next visit.

Uniqueness is the keyword here in Barcelos. We started with an amazing refreshing Kiwi Cooler mocktail made with Kiwi puree and  spices, what a summer cooler it was. Then we had Chicken Espetada which was yumm  it was perfectly marinated and grilled with onions and peppers. The Bun of Burgers were perfectly stuffed which were in various colors ranging from red, white and black. Also try the Peri Peri Sauces they are amazing and it really enhance the taste of the food. In the end we tried the Himalayan Trout fish, the dish was highly delectable it was properly marinated and baked with peri sauce. The ambiance, service and the staffs all are very good here. I will highly recommend this place.

The location of this restaurant is perfect, with ample parking space at the mall you don't have to worry about parking your car. Just park at the basement and take the elevator directly to the 4th floor to reach with metres of the gate.Once you enter you will just simply fall in love with the ambiance, perfectly laid tables in three separate sections makes it easy for you to sit according to your group size.¬†Just order and relax with some Kiwi Coolers or Berry Rose Margarita and within minutes, you will be served fresh grilled chicken, fish and other hot favourites¬†that you can choose from the menu. Trust me you will be spoilt for choice when it comes to Barcelos.Be sure to try their signature dish Chicken Peri Peri, Hilamayal Trout, Kebabs etc. My favourite were the coloured burgers especially the black burger.¬†You can always customise the dish with different levels of spiciness which the kitchen staff will then prepare according to your choice.¬†With a great ambience and a really very courteous staff, you will surely have a wonderful time here.

The newly opened Barcelos had been on my cards ever since it opened in the Acropolis Mall at Kasba. I finally managed to visit the place and boy did I love it. The Barcelos rooster was ever so welcoming and so was the decor and the staff. The place is done up in a very chilled out manner and reminded me of a Spanish movie set. The walls had old Spanish streets painted and framed newspapers from the early 20th century.

Food and drinks:
For the drinks we were served fancy molecular drinks, smoked up with dry ice. Included in it were the Berry Rose Margarita, Tangy Mango and the Kiwi kooler. I loved the Tangy Mango. The Berry Rose Margarita was extremely well presented and garnished with rose petals and is great for someone with a sweet tooth.
Coming to the food, one of their biggest USPs is the presentation...its indeed one of the best I have ever seen. The food here is Afro - Portuguese, therefore it serves Portuguese food in African spices. Everything on the menu can be customised using four different spices, namely, Mild Peri, Peri Peri, Very Peri and Super Peri, with increasing levels of spice. The colored burgers and the Chicken kebabs were my personal favourites. The Kebabs were served as pendulums and were super interesting, so was the grilled trout.
The Peri sauces are served on the tables so one may even customize the levels of spice further.

What an experience and lunch at Barcelos!! Oh my God! Seriously that was amazing! This is yet another stupendous paradise of exquisite delicacies for the food lovers of the city of joy!  While at Barcelos I was simply awestruck at the presentation, beautiful interior decoration that brings in a piece of foreign touch, soothing ambience and a great combination of yummy dishes has added to one of my memorable days in life.
The dishes that was served were really finger licking and of zenith quality alongside being healthy too. The list of dishes were varied from soft drinks to desserts. Kiwi kooler and tangy mango both were too good. Excellent fish kebabs, chicken drumsticks, chicken espeteda as appetizers are worth a praise for their tastes. CHICKEN ESPETEDA was the speciality and really was of a superlative degree. Then in the main course the 1/2 chicken and fish sizzler added to the list. All the way, each and every taste of the delicacies were a greet to the taste buds. Not to forget the numerous dips! There were too many of them like mango chili, pesto, spinach etc and all were so unusually tasty. Nevertheless the members and staffs were very jovial with a smile on their face always. This piece of Food Paradise is really a treat to the people of Kolkata.
Good luck for all the future efforts.

BARCELOS which has recently opened in Acropolis Mall,Kasba is definitely on it's way to establish itself as the recent sensation for the food lovers. Straight away starting with the appetizers to main course till the desserts,none of them can be put to second or third. Starting off with Molecular Drinks has been included in the menu which sounds interesting in itself,under that Tangy Mango has been able to prove it's worth a bit more than Kiwi Kooler. Being a little bit more specific on the starters if one wants a dry one, Chicken Wings will be a great pick. While the other part of the folks will be genuinely satisfied with Chicken Drumsticks. On the other hand Chicken Espeteda which has already established itself as the special attraction of this newly opened Restaurant - BARCELOS. Fish Fantasy includes Fish Sizzler and Fish Kebabs both of which are equally tasty delicacies. Well the Desserts has always been a cherry on the top for all the food lovers. So in that case anything between Brownies or Tutty Fruity would be a nice pick :)
Good Luck!

Location - The restaurant is situated at the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall. 

Food- Peri Peri chicken and Chicken Espatada are one of the key dishes of this place. 

We ordered the Tangy mango and Kiwi kooler. I didn't much like the Tangy mango but the Kiwi kooler was good. 

Then we ordered the Mini 4 burgers. Never in my life I thought that burgers can be so colorful and was tasty too. Thoroughly enjoyed the color play. 

Then coming to the  Peri Peri chicken which is undoubtedly the best dish of  this outlet. The chicken was very succulent and properly grilled. And then comes the 1/2 (chicken breast marinated with their signature peri sauces). Boy it was spicy! Another dish which I loved here was the Grilled Trout fish. I'm not a big fan of fish. But trust me guys this is one of the tastiest fish dish I ever had. The whole thing was aptly grilled and the sauces made it more luscious.

Overall I really loved this place. The staff was courteous and service was remarkable. Loved the interior. Ambience was pretty good. 

Lastly if you're bored with Chinese and Indian dishes, I highly recommend this place for those people who wants to try something new. 

Note: The pictures are gonna speak for themselves.

Great interior with high quality food. ¬†Not only food but also the service was good. I was really tired of with KFC and Mc Donald's Big burgers and eagerly searching for a different flavor. I got colorful burgers and kababs with great taste and it was so special to have it with my besties. The World Map was incredible. I also like Tangy Mango and Chicken Espeteda. Even deserts're so yummy. Over all it was a great experience. I am planning for a dinner with my family. Great place for foodies. Highly recommended.

Finally!!!! I have been  waiting for barcelos to open.  I totally love peri peri and was super excited to have the fare here.  The first thing I tasted were the 4 signature sauces  which ranged from the mild lemon being the mildest to supa  peri,  which is totally  up my alley. 

We tried some molecular  beverages,  hey rosey was the most spectacular one. 

Coming to the food,  I'd suggest one goes or a very peri or a super peri, the grilled chicken is cooked to perfection and so is the trout which had been de boned.  Excellent presentation of the fish. 

The burgers are very soft with a brioche like consistency and are one of its kind.  The Mediterranean platter was stunner,  the peri hummus and the baba ghanouj was delicious.  The falafel was cooked well. 

Coming to the ambience,  very pretty,  and the staff is also very warm and courteous 

I'm really looking forward to another visit soon.

Cheers!!

'Barcelos' is a super concoction of mouth watering Portuguese flavours,healthy colourful burgers,cosy ambience n efficient service. Foodie kolkatans  would now get to taste the famous PeriPeri Chicken n Chicken Espatada with varied kinds of peri peri sauces n condiments. Do try their wide variety of mocktails till they open their cocktail counter which is coming up very soon.
All the best BARCELOS TEAMüëçüëç

With a lot of excitement decided to hit this place..The interiors looked descent specially ¬†the map on the wall probably highlighting the foreign essence ¬†and the staff was very wel¬†behaved¬†n friendly. Nice ambiance.....service is also very nice.....but the¬†food! Its it very tasty but little monotonous , flavors n variation are limited i think ....was expecting more , because its my first time with Afro-Portuguese cuisine. However We ordered cheesy chicken espanada, 1/2 chicken( chicken breast marinated in their delicious siganature peri sauce and grilled to perfection)!! The chicken espananda had a very innovative presentation, served as hanging chicken skewers with mozarella cheese, onions, bell peppers and sun-dried tomato. the grilled chicken was good. Presentation n garnishing is really awesome.Drinks with fog effect r just like ..OMG!!!it was fab.. New thought new concept in kolkata ...had really enjoyed a lot,but portion served per dish at Barcelos is less compared to its price.
¬† ¬†however..... being a foodie,must try....

Barcelos is now become one of my favourite restaurant. It has made its way to the city of joy Kolkata. Barcelos is very famous for Peri Peri Chicken. From Appetizers to Deserts all the foods is very good specially Mango Tango Drinks, Fish Kabab, Chicken Drum Sticks,  Fish Kabab, Chicken Sizzlers. Ambient is classy and yet awesome... wall murals awesome...

Outstanding is the word. Well, first of all a big Thank You to the Barcelos team for coming over to Calcutta; the city needed such diversity.¬†
Well, honestly speaking, I was kinda skeptical to begin with but the Kiwi kooler changed the mood altogether. It was a great start and pretty much the signs of things to come. The PERi PERi Black Beauty was the surprize package; I loved it. By the way, the Grilled Trout Fish tastes superb with the Mild Peri sauce; that, for me of the pick of the evening. However, one needs to make a judicious choice of the sauces to pair with the food that you order; I really liked the mild peri variant.¬†
The ambiance is amazing; some beautiful wall art and some classy wall-hanging to compliment the same. Great evening indeed; highly recommended.

A weekend indulgence, dropped into Barcelos, a while back. The fact that I am writing right after returning from the place, is testimony to its excellence. Courteous staff, quality food and chicken grilled to perfection. Their ambiance is nice and cozy. The smoking room reminds you of  London phone booth and the food reminds you of Nando's Peri Peri Chicken. We got a Cheesecake on the house! The Tiramisu was perfect and 'melt in the mouth'. I would highly recommend Barcelos to my fellow foodies!

A very good restaurant. The food is just awesome. The drinks are a bit off but still it is great. The atmosphere is clean and beautiful. The staff members are close to friends when you go in, with a lovely smile and a warm welcome. Many people won't like pure Portuguese cuisine/food. But, I would highly recomend going there if you want to try something new and exciting. I would recomend "Barclos" again and again if you want to try real Portuguese food. :-D

In starter I liked Chicken Wings, Drumstick Chicken (with youghart dip and pesto dip), ChickenEspeteda & FishKabab. It's a Win Win situation to have such a good interior with high quality food. Kabas are just awesome. You will find different combinations of colorful burgers. If you are tired of having KFC and Mc Donald's then just step in to enjoy a new world of taste. The place is a boon to the city. Highly Recommended.

Acropolis a newest mall in town wih handful of decent restaurants. In those they added a star which is none other than a international restaurant and trend setter- Barcelos.  Location is good and entrance makes it premium. Interiors r unique and fresh for Kolkata market. Mix of colors and European architect inspiration make it very lively. Music is good though. Now we come to food which is again new and fresh for Kolkata. Portuguese and Mediterranean food is simply awesome. Presentation of each dish is expctionaly well. We have tried lots of variety but each dish is good undoubtedly. And still lot more to explore in future visits. Drinks with fog effect r just like theater. It engage u for sure. We r talking about Barcelos and not bkack Burger how is that possible. Extremely great concept and taste. Just can't ask for more. Highly recommended. Must visit .

Not up to the mark. Had a fully loaded chicken burger and a chicken cheesy wrap. Too much jalapeno in the wrap. The chicken inside the burger wasn't great either. Service needs to improve big time. The sides were served after I was almost halfway through with the burger. Not sure if I'm coming back again. The peri peri sauces were authentic though.

Peri Peri-lous !!!
A T2 Page 3 report on this newly launched restaurant made me curious. So I went out on the next day of Vote Results. I would give an excellent rating for the decor and ambiance, further animated with a friendly staff who kept on suggesting their signature dishes, explaining South African and Portuguese cuisine and its Peri Peri sauces. So far so good.... But....
As far as the food is concerned, I didn't find much variation among the plates we had ordered ... Chicken Picantte (portion was less), Chicken Peri Peri Sizzler ( presentation was clumsy and cumbersome), and Chicken Trinchado with Rice.
My final impression is that the restaurant is theoretically sound, if not in its practical execution !

Barcelos left us awestruck!! Newly opened up on the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall, this chicken retreat will amaze you by its sheer variety of lip-smacking rooster delights. The restaurant is themed around medieval europe and there is a map of the world on one of the walls, beautifully lit up. The waiters are very courteous and the service is pretty efficient. We ordered cheesy chicken espanada, cheesy chicken wrap, a combo of four of their signature mini burgers and 1/2 chicken( chicken breast marinated in their delicious siganature peri sauce and grilled to perfection)!! The chicken espananda had a very innovative presentation, served as hanging chicken skewers with mozarella cheese, onions, bell peppers and sun-dried tomato. We totally loved the burger combo which came in different colours and tasted just as colourful, the different tastes blending to create an orgasm in your mouth!! The cheesy chicken wrap (chicken strips, mozarella cheese and creamy mayo in a blanket of tortille bread) as also a revelation!! Also you get to choose sides of your choice- be it potato wedges, french fries, mashed potatoes, grilled vegetables or spicy rice. The desserts were not as impressive. While the tiramisu was really tasty, the berries cheesecake was a bit coarse and the chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream was okayish!! However for the love of their marvellous chicken and the delicious food..this place has the potential to be the NEXT big hangout for all meat lovers!! Keep up the great work, guys!! Looking forward already to my next visit!

The Peri Peri sauces ( mild to sup) on each of the table and dere colored burgers really enhanced my taste buds. We ordered Very Peri Black Magic burger, ( 2 mutton+2 chicken) Mini burger, Hey Rosey, Cheesecake Milkshake. We were quiet satisfied wid food n service. However bun on the lower side tends to break as a result hands were messy...it would be great if finger bowl was made available.
Play some music that will be great for Barcelos.
Will visit again Barcelos.

Barcelos has now spread it arms and has made its way to the city of joy Kolkata. Where huge crowds welcomed this new entrant, all were thrilled to taste their very famous Peri Peri Chicken.
Thoroughly enjoyed the burgers, especially the color play. That was the sole purpose of my visit. A cosy setting with a friendly staff and good food, what more do you need from a place. Another dish which I would recommend is the Chicken Espatada. To make your meal a little more hearty do order their Wedges and Spicy Rice.

Craving for something that is rich in taste and satiates your taste buds, then this place is your pit stop.

With a lot of excitement decided to hit this place on my Hubby's birthday..
The interiors looked descent and the staff was friendly 
We ordered four different dishes namely steak,sizzler,peri peri signature dish and the Burger platter.
The steak was chewy and very hard.One could  hardly cut through it .On request the staff decided to change it and get a fresh new one which was a complete disaster.It was served burnt.One does not expect a joint at there reputation to serve a portion which is burnt.The sizzler  was below normal,veggies were dry,stale n bitter.Even homemade steaks are better to taste.
The Burger platter is the only thing which turned out to be a little good but nothing really great.
The items are overpriced and the servings are very small.
The mocktails are so average that will only make u regret ordering one.
No recommendations for this place and definitely not going to this place again which only left a bad taste in my mouth.

Although the ambiance is good..  I was very disappointed with the food.. The chicken breast piece which they served in the steak was not fresh n it was so hard that it was even difficult to cut it with a knife.. On taking up this issue they said they would replace it.. But after a few minutes they brought the same piece which now had been burnt from the underside due to Over cooking n tasted even worse..  Highly disappointed with the quality and taste of the at such prices.. Even the mocktails lacked in taste.. won't suggest this place to anyone.

So new restaurant in town. A totally unique and different menu. Very nice ambience, quite spacious and with comfortable seating.
We ordered the veg kebab platter. It was not all impressive. I would suggest to my veggie friends to give it a miss. 
We then ordered a Red Peri Peri burger and the black burger. I must say that the bread is really soft and had a very different taste. The burgers are quite good. And the sauces which accompany are quite good. I liked the potato wedges served with it. They were crispy and really nice.
My friend ordered their chicken starter which is served on a vertical skewer. According to him the taste is something unique and a chicken lover would love it.
We ordered the tiramasu. It was very basic, give it a miss.
Overall I would say their burgers are quite good. 
The service needs to be stepped up. I din like the plates they used to serve. They wobble a lot and they don't look clean.

Very disappointing... We ordered for chicken steak, burger platter, veri peri sizzler and 1/4 chicken roast. The chicken in the steak was first undercooked. On taking it up with the staff they took it away and brought it back saying it was redone. This time they burnt it!! Not even a bite could be had bcoz of the burnt smell... The sizzler was equally bad.. The veggies were almost raw. The only dish we somewhat liked was the burger platter but that too is nothing extraordinary. Even their mocktails are not worth a mention. Can't imagine a restaurant to go wrong with a drink as simple as a fresh lime soda. Not coming here anymore for sure.

I have always loved Peri Peri chicken and that too at Barcelos. We all got to know about the recent opening of Barcelos at Kolkata and were too excited for it. 

Just 6 days of  operations and such a great popularity. Already waiting has started at the outlet. As usual we ordered our Peri Peri chicken platter and the Espatada. Both were perfect and right as should be. 

I also loved their coloured burgers. The red ans the black being my favourite. The drinks menu is also quite nice with ample choice of mocktails and shakes.

Don't get too excited about the burger! Think Chicken Espetada!

So, finally it happens. The Perri Perri a.k.a the black burger has come to town. As a burger lover, I was looking forward to seeing what this beast of a burger actually tastes like. Well, 1st experience wasn't that great, the bun broke into a million pieces. The chicken was good but not great. Specially the Chicken Espetada. It is beautiful. Won't say the food is bad, but it can most certainly be way better.

Service: friendly
Environment: nice
Recommend dish: Chicken Espetada

P.s can't wait to try the milk shakes, cause they look and sound heavenly. Bubble gum shake? I mean are you kidding me?

The best Peri peri chicken in the world comes to Kolkata at last. Opened just 5 days back this outlet is already bustling with huge crowds. I have always been a fan of Peri Peri chicken and Black burger as I had tried them Delhi many a times.

I had to wait for 15 minutes just to get seated in this outlet as their was a huge rush. We ordered the usual Peri Peri chicken with supa peri sauce and our usual Coloured slider burgers. OMG the same taste and I must say it was way better. The Black burger with lamb patty is the best in the world.

The healthiest option to have in non vegetarian food. No oil and fat used only flame grilled.

They have a wide variety of mocktails as well. Keep rocking Barcelos.

Food is absolutely rubbish here. The restaurant seems to have been started by novices who haven't got their act together !

We tried the Kiwi Cooler which seemed to be a sugar syrup mixed with chat Masala. The grape fruit punch was far better though.

We tried the 1/2 Chicken by ITS, highly recommended by the staff there. It was full of salt and couldn't be eaten. We also tried the Chicken Espeteda which was tasty and soft, but again full of salt.

Overall it was quite a miserable experience for us. It will be difficult to erase this bad memory and have the courage to visit here again.

Good Luck !!

Visited the restaurant with family the day after it opened. It was the most disappointing experience ever. Having visited the same restaurant in Delhi, I had expected the service and food to be of high quality but, I was proved wrong. Both restaurants, even though they belong to the same chain, are poles apart.
1) We were served rock hard burgers
2) The bread used in the burgers was stale
3)They did not put any cheese or any other vegetables in the burger which the menu mentioned, the burger contained only the patty
4) The molecular peach iced tea did not contain the nitrogen that is supposed to be put in every molecular drink and nor did it contain the peach pieces that are supposed to be there.
5) Sides that we ordered with the burger were not served at all 
6) There were six of us and one of our burger's were served after all had completed there meal 1.5 hrs after the order had been placed.
 
In short everything went wrong and what had started off as a family dinner ended as a disaster. The food was unsatisfactory and the service was depressing, not something expected from such a famous chain. This restaurant is not ready to serve yet. They spoilt both our mood and their image.They can do much better.

Barcelos have established their outlets as the right place for quality food with no compromise in quality. Always leaves you craving another visit.

Great ambiance, great food and service. Love the  items on the Barcelos menu especially the addition of the Mini Burgers...yum the grilled options are also nice and the fact that now you can choose a filet of Trout Fish  is a wise option.¬†

Thanks you Barcelos

Amazing experience with different kinds of burgers. One of its kinds. Never had such a variety before. The Portuguese flavors are exquisite. There's so much food in the world..Being a foodie,must try..
kudos team Barcelos !!

I love burgers and was very excited about trying Barcelos, a South African eatery, which has reinvented the traditional burgers and painted our burger dreams red! (I just had to!!). Besides their signature colored burger buns, Barcelos is also famous for its flame grilled menu. Thankfully, the flame grilled menu has also given vegetarians a good enough reason to rejoice. They have a wide range of vegetarian offerings along with chicken and mutton items and some lamb and fish dishes as well. ...

Kudos Team Barcelos.!!!!

For a multi national chain, and opening just 3 days ago, they really should get some research done.
 I went with relatives who were already a regular at the Botswana joint and honestly its a disaster, even for them.q

We ordered the family platter with sides of potato wedges and dips. After a quick 10 mins, we were served.
The chicken was rock hard. They claim that their food is "always fresh and grilled", but all I found was microwaved frozen food. It had no indications of ever seen the inside of a grill.
The chicken wings were seriously hard. Let alone use steel cutlery, it was a challenge to chew!!
I think we just paid for the excellent potato wedges with the dip. That was the only item thats freshly prepared.
Ambience: 8/10
Service: 8.5/10
Food: 4/10 and guys I'm being generous.

It was a bust man.

Welcome to the world of peri peri! Being fairly new to Portuguese and middle eastern cuisine I set off for this experience to Barcelos yesterday afternoon. As you enter the first thing that strikes you is the nicely done decor. The bar area looks very inviting but we have to wait a month or two before the place gets their liquor licence I guess. Till then you can enjoy their amazing and varied mocktails .As you look right You see a London style ph booth which serves the purpose of smoking room and a really nice 3d painting on the wall at the right corner.

Sitting areas all look nice and comfy. There are brightly done sofas which adds to the decor.

Coming to food , the most important thing...I have just one word, fantastic!!! We had ordered chicken sizzlers and chicken espetada...they were nice and succulent. The unique thing is the peri peri sauces in the table. There are 4 varieties and depending on your taste buds you can go for the mild peri all the way up to supa peri!!!! Yummm! Next time I wish to try the black burger which is one of their signature dishes!!

Coming to servicing.... The waiters were courteous and hospitable. However since the restaurant has opened just two days back, they will definitely get used to serving faster and being more attentive. I feel the food should be served a tad faster.
The food is really competitively priced since I had expected a much higher bill!! This is definitely another huge plus point!
Overall the experience is wonderful and I am definitely going back again!

Quantity served is very less. We tried Chicken and fish. Fish was smelly,chicken could have been softer and juicier,overall not worth a visit

The 6 th burger came after 1hr 20mim after calling  for it many times.

All burgers  were supposed to be with  cheese and vegetables but all of them came without it

We had ordered sides which didn't  come only  .

One of the worst outlets for food that I have come across !! Expecting the same level of competency and the quality of food as they serve at Delhi I was taken aback !! The waiters are incompetent in taking orders and none of our orders came the way we wanted. We were served pathetic peach ice tea which was supposed to molecular but it wasn't for which the excuse given was Kolkata doesn't have supplies for it !! A truly spoilt birthday dinner. I would strongly recommend to wait till the waiters are trained enough !!

Ambience is very good. Lights and environment are very soothing and calm to sit and spend time with your partner or friend for a long time, what we did actually.

Now come to food. Specialty is they have four types of sauces and you need to understand those sauces very important to order your food which actually decide the taste of your food. 

We order wings with peri peri sauce,chicken wrap both are very tasty and taste is unique.
Good part is they are serving unlimited cold drinks.
We also ordered fish with chicken two main course with rice.fish was really tasty.

When we are coming out manager came to us took the feedback personally and also told us what we can order next time , I believe he understood by our face expression that we are going to visit them next time very soon.

Latest addition to the much talked about Acropolis Mall is Barcelos, started its operations on 14th May'16. Hazelnut coloured ambiance and warm light makes the interior little less sparky. Separate bar section right now only serving mocktail till bar license is in place. There is a smoking booth available for smokers, resembling the design of London's telephone booth. Barcelos is known for its sauces they use and on table one can see 4 different varieties of sauces ranging from mild to fiery hot flavour.

Ordered Chicken Steak and Cheesy Chicken Espetada. Thick breast pieces provided with steak dish was chewy, fibrous and lack marination. Main reason could be they provided chicken with its skin on. Kind of turn off for me immediately. 

Cheesy Chicken Espetada is claimed to be a Portugese dish with five chicken pieces hanging from a skewer. Taste was wonderful too. Chicken was succulent with distinct taste of their sauces and mozarella cheese. This dish is known as their "handing wonder of the world". With both the dishes french fries and potato wedges were provided as sides. Other options available as sides including spicy rice can be avoided. 

We were looking for sizzlers but informed by server its not available for the day. However after 5 mins we could witness sizzlers were served on other tables. 

Servers seems to be completely loss with zero relevant experience and their nervousness on the opening day was clearly visible on their face. For serving glass of water servers had to be chased. Long way to go for Barcelos to compete with their next door neighbout Chili's. Portion served per dish at Barcelos is pathetically less compared to its price at higher side. Price for 2 dishes were INR 1005.

I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is not bad at all. The Peri Peri grilled chicken , grilled trout , all the molecular drinks etc are excellent. The Burgers are not bad either but the service of this place is horrible. All our side orders were mixed up with other¬† dishes' sides.Some of the sides came much later. One of the burgers came 20 minutes later than the other dishes.Some of the food wasn't hot whereas some of the food had perfectly fine temperature. Also we waited more than 40 minutes for our mains which is totally not acceptable at a classy restaurant in a high end mall. Don't know what to say about my experience.Also I am not sure whether I will visit this place again .

I fail to understand why the owners would be in such a hurry to open a restaurant without providing proper training and adequate knowledge to the staff? While it's great that Kolkata is opening its doors to new ideas and concepts in F&B but really sad that in doing so a lot of important aspects are taken for granted. Something as basic as a fresh lime soda was not served as per the request. The staff had no idea what the menu entailed and thus ended up noting down wrongly. Dishes were served cold. Overall service was sluggish and inept. In a business where first impressions are everything, this place does not leave a lasting one.

As a first glance one would consider it to be another fast food joint. 

But as one get reading the menu, one begins to feel the difference. Contrary to what we know burgers here come with healthy at the same time yummy grilled filling. 

The most interesting, innovative and MUST TRY part is the RED and BLACK Burgers. Apparently, real Cocoa goes into the BLACK BURGER. For the RED one, you get real beet and tomatoes.

Pros. 
Food was very good and wholesome. Albeit a bit cold but still flavor on the chicken was brilliant 

Cons.

Unfortunatley cons are more but u have high score did to food quality and to be fair they have opened a day back only 

Service needs huge overhaul. The service was road side dhaba type to say the least.  Had to order for  water,  tissues,  fork,  spoon and literally everything. Food came first,  water second,  tissue third, and then finally fork to eat food. Wrong  order was another issue.   Advice : do try the rice dish and don't go with good service expectation in near future but for go. It'd a blast of flavors.

WHAT MATTERS IS GOOD FOOD THAT IS DEFINITELY AVAILABLE

All excited about the launch of Barcelos in town , we set off for a bloggers invite at barcelos for lunch. Barcelos in the home of Peri Peri. Peri peri belongs to the capsicum family and grows in Africa.Barcelos masters in Portuguese delicacies especially their flame grilled flavours. They bring about a concoction between African spices culminating it with Portuguese cuisine.

Location : 4th floor of the Acropolis mall.

Decor and ambience : the decor is quite impressive. We were alloted a table through which we could glimpse in the whole viee of gitanjali stadium. The walls were painted with different scenes froms old portugal, which was indeed nostalgic. The worn away brick walls just suited in the scene. The huge clock, the world map, the raised bar, the skewers, the wooden table and chairs were quite evidently giving it an old European feel. 

Staffs : The major problem that we faced was with the staffs. A drink ordered at 3.10 pm reached our tables at 4.10 pm. None of the non-vegetarian dishes were being served until and unless it was being summoned for. The staffs seemed least bothered to serve. Finally we walked out without tasting half of the set menu being tasted which was a sheer disgrace. A brand which seemed so promising was a major turn off for the staff support. 

Coming on to whatever least we could taste, was quite new, fresh and tempting. Not to forget their four different sauces- mild peri , tangy lemon, very peri peri and supa peri peri. To begin with -
Drinks:

1. Tangy mango - tangy mango puree mixed with spices and topped up with sprite. This was a real summer booster to beat the heat.
2. Kiwi kooler - kiwi puree mixed swisted with spices and sprite. This was the numero uno of the noon. This is refreshing, and the whole concept of kiwi puree was really exciting in a way. This is definitely recommended.

Kebabs:

1. Chicken wings - these are chicken wings layered with peri spices, grilled with peri sauce and served with peri mayo. This was interesting. It was soft , succulent and the chicken skin coating was a killer. If tried with very peri peri sauce ,  a definitive hit.

2. Chicken espatada - a hanging chicken skewed with chicken breast , onions, peppers. Was even interesting. This is an age old portugese cuisine. But this was served to us when it was cold. so did not really evoke the deadly burst in my taste buds.

3. Boneless thighs with onion and peppers - boneless chicken thighs skewed with onions and peppet and served with peri mayo was served to us when we were just about to leave. However it did created a great feeling.
 
Burgers:

The burgers were innovative a find. These quirky burgers initially made me curious as to how the taste would be. But it did taste great. 

1. Peri peri black magic - bun, peri mayo, pickled jalapeno, lettuce, tomato, onions and chicken fillet with very peri peri sauce was a killer. From what I felt , it was an absolute new addition to the food industry. A definitive recommendation.

2. Peri peri bloody red - bun, peri mayo, pickled cucumber, salsa, thousand islands, jalapeno, lettuce, tomato, cheese slice, pineapple, two fillet with mild peri peri leaves you with a feeling of content as well. 

3. White chicken burger - the bun sandwicging mango chilli mayo, iceburg, green pepper, orange, chilli garlic, coleslow, chicken breast was great as well. The pineapple flavour reigned the taste buds , which left me chomping it.

Although my personal favourite was the black burger.

Value for money : the prices are inflated towards the higher end. However, the burgers and chicken can be died for.

The brand looks promising although I feel there needs to be a chnge in the attitude of the staffs. Such a great place to have food should not suffer due to the hospitality being absolutely nil. 

N.B : the review is based on what I have deduced personally.

There would be many people posting pics of food items, but the simple fact is that I was so entrapped in the spell of the amazing food and ambience, that after reaching home only did I rue not clicking a photograph here. To put it simply, every year Kolkata gets a revolutionary food joint (Chili's, ring a bell?). This year it has to be Barcelos! I'm just glad that this global phenomenon launched its first Indian outlet in Kolkata.

Unique Afro Portuguese flavor blend gives Barcelos a unique taste palate to astound us. Had the fortune of visiting it on opening day, and everything went on like a clock work- the servers though new were thorough and helpful.
Before going to the food, a mention must be mentioned of the interiors which was artfully done in with a corner dedicated to the namesake Portuguese village called Barcelos. There is a nice glass front facing the stadium on the outside and looked awesome in the rains. Also there was a Red London phone booth designated as the smoking area.
Coming to the food, we were delighted with the bit of Molecular gastronomy magic in form of Molecular cooler-The Kiwi was yum and the Mango was tangy with a taste and bit like aam-panna but the texture very different.
For starters we had stuffed mushroom skewers which were mushroom with a dollop of mild peri peri sauce and hint of parmesan and basil stuffings.
The main course consisted of Chicken Espetada (skewered chicken with onion and capsicum in veri peri sauce) with a side of spicy rice (aromated like jollop rice) and grilled veggies, Cheesy chicken wrap in veri peri chicken and signature quarter chicken. The chicken pieces were as juicy as it looks and wrap was delightful was a hint of mild peri flavouring.
What made the whole experience every more delightful was the customisability with various flavouring sauces on the table itself. You could add Tangy Lemon , Mild Peri, Veri Peri and Supra Peri sauces (in increasing order of pungency) to adjust the taste to your liking.
We finish off with Tiramisu mouse cake which was a nice round up the whole meal.
There was constant feedback taken by the staff as well as the owner on food taste and flavouring as this was day one.
Well done to the team on this wonderful first day - looking forward to returning soon

There are restaurants serving food and there are places giving you an experience‚Ä¶  Barcelos is the latter of the 2‚Ä¶ one does not go there for just eating‚Ä¶ you go there for the ambiance service and then the food‚Ä¶ the vibes this place gives is so positive and relaxing that having a good time is surety of its own kind‚Ä¶ the place interiors ar so nicely done that taking a walk around is something each one does‚Ä¶ from the red telephone booth shaped smoking room to the world map locating barcelos on the globe.. it is just very stylishly done‚Ä¶ the best part is the portugese corner they have with a village painting and the legend of barcelos‚Ä¶ I made sure to sit there as it just felt right‚Ä¶

Since it was their first day of opening the owners came and chatted with us and asked us for the food and everything‚Ä¶ they are really good people and the staff there is also always polite and always have a smile on their face‚Ä¶.

Coming to the food‚Ä¶ their specialty is their Peri Peri sauces which they give you 4 choices and their chicken‚Ä¶ the sauces are spot on and the taste is divine‚Ä¶ the starters of fries and the hanging chicken and the mezze platter was something to visit this place again‚Ä¶ after a very long time have I had pita hummus baba ganoush and falafel of this taste‚Ä¶ the fries with their Mild Peri and Very Peri is a must try‚Ä¶ my friends informed me that the hanging chicken is also great‚Ä¶ next time I will try the hanging paneer and mushrooms as they looked damn tempting‚Ä¶

Coming to the main course‚Ä¶ the BURGERS!!!!! Oh my god‚Ä¶. Now THIS IS REAL BURGERS!!!! Kolkata was missing a decent place serving real burgers to the people and barcelos has answered that call‚Ä¶ we also called for the cataplana‚Ä¶ which was something new for us and the taste made it a must have every time I visit‚Ä¶

The prices I was surprised to see for this up market place was not every expensive as the black patty veg burger cost like 175 or something which is not expensive at all‚Ä¶

i normally dont publish snaps of a place and i am against it... but there are some places which are different and the view and the food must be shared.... the black bun burger i am sure is a first in Kolkata

OVER ALL‚Ä¶ this place is a must visit for any one enjoying food‚Ä¶ and I cant wait for them to get a bar license after which this place will be a mad house of entertainment‚Ä¶
