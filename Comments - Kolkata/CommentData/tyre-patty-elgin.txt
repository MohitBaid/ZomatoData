A lill dark cozy place with college goers crowd.something good about this place is the amazing music played over..went for a hookah only.. couldn't get a idea about food.priced nicely and a place of veg servings with a very compact menu.all in all this place is the den for hookah lovers and somewhat the crowd and too dim ambience didn't suit me well

Food- Okayish, taste is decent, presentation is below average.
Hookah- Okayish, Smoke is good, flavour is not at all recognizable.
Service- Pathetic, waiters are really ill mannered.
Ambience- Good
Music- Pathetic, flop hindi songs are played most of the time.
Location- near forum mall, so quite convenient.

This place is very near to Exide crossing.It is one of the best hookah parlours in Kolkata.Suprisingly serves good food too.The ambience is equally mesmerising.The service was bit on the slower side though.Overall it's worth the wait for that good hookah and food.

Visited tyre patty with a friend of mine yesterday at day-time. We ordered some dishes, which were sweet corn soup, mexican spring roll, mixed sauce pasta, french fries, schezwan noodles and a mocktail. The mexican spring roll was bang on amazing, as well as was the pasta and the noodles. Honestly the food was too good, but I and my friend had ordered a lot more than we could eat, in excitement and so we ended up wasting some food. 😐 The staff is really courteous and will love to visit the place again.

Often I visit here.. It has been reached to one of my fav list of cafés! ☺ 😋 Ambience is superb wid fantabulous music tracks always.. Full of youth crowd always as it locates near bhawanipur college !! This tym we took hookah(kachi kairi+orange flavour ), cottage fajita cheese pizza which was delicious as well as kitkat shake was yummy ! 😋 😋 Courteous & vry frndly staff but 'sometimes' service becomes bit slow.. Overall it's an amazing place to visit, worth to go there more dan once.. ☺ ☺

An average cafe with not so good coffee and decent food.

Thumbs up - awesome location, near forum mall and bhawanipur College, interiors are good with nice water pool flooring in one section cheers for the creativity. Nice food.

Thumbs down - water pools are good but at times it has gone messy with dirty flooring. Coffee was not that good. For me a great cup of coffee is must in a cafe. Prices are decent.

All in all a good experience.

The song collection was average. The jacuzzi was horrible to be honest. They probably never clean it. It had someone's handkerchief and hookah filters floating in it. The food was good though. Hookah top notch. Ambience could have been way better. And the service was late yet the waiters were courteous.

I have been there once just to try hookah which was new to me at that time. The place is perfect for hanging out with friends and to get a little bit stoned as well. Though one of their member had been very rude to one of my friend, coz he could not handle it and vomitted. They charged us extra fine. So i suggest if you want to do "Bawal", be prepared to pay some extra bucks as well. Lastly, the food was good.

Oh the most amazing mixed sauce pasta you will ever taste.
Schezwan Noodles were more than tasty though the amount of oil was a lil much.
Personally I loved the place because of its small pond where you dip your legs. They were amazing in their service.
A lil pocket friendly than other cafes.
What people love here-
Shisha, Crispy Babycorn, Momos, Coffee, Nachos, Mixed Sauce Pasta, Thin Crust Pizza.

I was bummed to see such a good place serving only veg at first. However the veg food is also pretty delicious. A huge reason to go there is the water beneath your legs while you smoke the hookah. That's really something to enjoy. Just a little short of the perfect 5 because they really need to improve the songs collection. Sometimes it's horrible. 
Let this aside, the place is worth visiting.

Tyre patty is a place closely situated to forum mall, Elgin. This place has created a buzz amongst the hookah lovers in the city. The interiors, ambience has immensely impressed the crowd. Starting with the dim lights which perfectly sets the mood and they have few jacuzzi style seating arrangements and that is absolutely like an icing upon the cake. The hookah served over here are quality controlled and are one of the best. However the food or the snacks over here are not upto the mark and are overpriced. So this place is a perfect place to go with your colleagues or your college gang :)

Ambience is cool but with time its deteriorating. No proper maintainance. There is an area where you can sit and put and leg in water n relax , which was one of the attraction towards this place but its no more the same like before . This place needs more maintainance. The food here is good. Pricing here is reasonable.

For Rs 131  it was handful , literally handful of boiled maggi.  Do not order maggi from here.

Tyre patty was one the first places in calcutta to put a small pool of water under the table where u could dip your feet and relax with friends. The ambience is decently set for the college crowd and food and shisha rightly priced to fit their pocket. I personally like the raised bed with the small tables on top rather than sitting on the tyres. Overall a decent experience.

So,this place is where I have been going since I was preparing my +2,talking about this place makes me remind of their thin crust pizzas and ofcourse not to forget their amazing hookah.
I love the water section,this is a place you can randomly go and chill with ur buds after college or a hectic day....They play good trance too that being a cherry on top.The pocket pinch with food comes around 700 bucks.
The only thing bad is it serves veg....😒😒

Well tyre patty is essentially well known for its wide range of hookahs and pretty unique ones..we went there on the christmas afternoon for a hookah..well the hookahs were priced at 451 (which with taxes come upto 572)..so pretty expensive in my opinion,specially given that though the flavours available (patty special) were unique and the hookah was good,yet we did not find it to be anything xtraordinary compared to much lower priced hookahs elsewhere..seating area is limited...but it has special areas for groups coming for a smoke..the ambience is perfect for a hookah lounge, with ample darkness and dim lights, and good quality music played at a tolerable volume..however, something can be done about the air ventilation because 80% of the cafe population were constantly coughing owing to suffocation on account of the smoke of course..service was good..food menu was as you would get in most of the cafes ..overall,worth trying if u have a good enough budget..

This place has every quintessential quality a hookah joint should have. Easy to find, not horribly expensive , and having a decent collection of different hookah flavours. 

I had ordered a Fully loaded Nachos, BBQ Shashlik, and a Pizza Primavera with Chocolate liquor shake. The Nachos were more or less average despite the generous toppings on it. The Shashlik was a winner with bell peppers and onions mixed with cheese making it amazingly smooth. The pizza was good too, though, it can surely be improved. The real winner for me, however, was the chocolate shake. Very creamy and dark. 

The ambience of this place is captivating, however, it does get a bit congested and full of smoke. The service is very good. The servers constantly kept checking up on us asking if we wanted something. This place is ideal for a laid back session of food and smoke after a long day at work.

Located opposite to the biker's cafe,the place is not that cool enough to visit.Strong smells of hookah will merely suffocate you.Inside is very much congested with worn out decors. They have an aqua region to chill also. What saved the place was its food.Totally yummy leaving us ordering for more
Absolutely not a good place for non-smokers!!

On an afternoon my friends and myself dropped into this well known cafe. Its located just opposite to biker's cafe. The interior is quite innovative and is perfect for catching up friends or chilling out for some time. There is a section where you can dip your fit in the water. We were fortunate to get a sitting in that area. However i think it lacked maintainance. Coming to the food we ordered chocolate liquor shake which really tasted awesome and a kit kat shake which was not up to the mark. We also ordered cheese fondue and it got me into a different world all together. I had cheese fondue at others cafes but so far this tasted the best. I think one should give it a try. We also ordered shisha of pan masala flavour and it was good too. The cafe is more or less resonable. Service is good too.

I along with my friend's went there in the morning near to 11:00. We order items including Mexican Rice with jacket potatoes, Fries on fire, paneer kurkure ,potato nuggets and at the end pan fried noodles.
The entire food provide was good apart from pan fried noodles as the we were given Chinese choupese and the manager of that place was argued that it was pan fried noodles.
And on top of that he was bragging about his 25 long career and also the information that he worked for Mainland China . While so he has no idea how to to talk to customers nor what is pan fired noodles.

I have been here countless times. It's just beside my college. The staff is well behaved and they tend to remember the friends that accompanied you last time. They keep changing the interiors which is really good. There is a Jacuzzi section where you can dip your feet in water and relax.The place is fully dark and you feel nice, relaxed and chilled inside. The Amritsari Kulcha is a must try.
The only disadvantage here is that this place is too costly than the others beside it.

a great place indeed... the most attractive thing is the sitting arrangements. like you can deep your feet in water while having hookah, this gives you an auspicious pleasure i can explain in words.. another type is bed kind of place where you can relax.. and rest is couch.. a bit comfortable place.... But the stuffs are cheap... when we entered 1st time and ask for the menu for hookah the stuff starts requesting to take hookah of rupees 1500 when i denied then he kept requesting until i ordered that.. this behavior i think little cheap..
and rest food quality is good but i was disappointed with the vanilla ice cream brownie sizzler..

I'd like to begin with d dishes I loved since it may help ppl choose what to order ;) so for anyone who visits tyre patty should definitely try their amritsari kulcha with Kali dal dip..it's just one of the best things they have on their menu. Next best I wud say is the lasagna nd the canneloni..since I'm not a hookah person I wud hv liked d place more of it didn't include hookah...I don't really like smoke everywhere..but given d yummy meal nd d reasonable price, I visit this place quite often nd I nvr leave disappointed..I hope they open an outlet near Beliaghata as well.

What unique about this place is that there's water filled under 4 tables, and you may get your feet inside it if you want. Really a nice place to chill with friends.

This place was actually one of the first places I had been to try hookah.  This place is huge,and by huge I mean,there are various places one can sit. There is the normal,couches and all. Then there is a place on a rise where one has to open their shoe nd sit cross legged. Then there is my favorite,where you can dip your feet in the cool water nd sit and puff on your hookah. The ambience is awesome and staff is one of the best I have seen. Food here is something everyone should actually try and I m sure they will definitely come back. This place is also good for big groups as they have a special lounge for parties and all. Hookah here is also pretty nice. Good flavors and enough smoke for hookah enthusiasts to have fun. Since it is located near forum, it isn't that difficult to locate. On a whole,I would suggest people to definitely visit this place and bring as many people as you can.

Tyre patty is a fairly old hookah parlour in Elgin road. The interiors of this place is quite quirky and fun. They have three different seating zones. One is a raised lounge area, normal stools and lastly an area where you can dip your feet in water and smoke some good hookah. This place is the most wanted area and is very difficult to get hold of. The place is mainly filled with school students and college goers.  We had orderded a chocolate fondue and  a cheese pizza. The food was quite tasty and the quantity was a lot. The interiors of this place has worn out but the food is quite tasty and is a good place for a hanging out with friends. :)

Have visited this place more than 10 times. So this review is a cumulative of all these experiences. This cafe is one of the old ones in the cafe trend kolkata has seen in recent years. The interiors are now worn out and needs renovation.

But the food is such that no one can complain of. The soup with the momo is too great. The cheese foundune is the best I have found. Mixed sause pasta is great. Nachos here is not a good option but do try wedges here.

The italin, chineese, mexican and indian sizzlers are great, abundant in quantity and taste. Tye mexican sizzler is too spicy and people with low spice taste should stay away from it. The noodles, Manchurian and chilli panner is also ok. But the wiwi bhel is a strict no there.

Coming to drinks, mojito was ok. Oreo and kit-kat shake was great. Special mention to dudh cola, its better than of the balwant dhaba and presented in a glucose pouch.

The first thing which will strike you upon entering this place is the overwhelming smell of hookah along with very loud Hindi music. The crowd hereby is mostly teenagers or college goers.The ambience is ok,not great. The interiors are a little worn out but look good nevertheless. There are sections with sofas, places where you can open your shoes,sit cross legged and enjoy puffing on your hookahs with cushions. There is another section where you can dip your bare feet in water while you sit around a table. That section is very popular as it is quite a different experience.We had ordered one plate of pasta and it tasted really good. This place is quite overpriced.

This place is conjusted and the interiors are worn out but but the food and the service cover the above flaws of this cafe.

Ambiance-This cafe is too loud and the interiors are worn out.The ambiance is not not good.

Service-The service provided by them is quite fast and responsive.The staff is also very cooperative and active.

Food-The sheesha served by them is extremely good and the food is also finger licking.We had-
1:Italian sizzler
2:paneer kurkure
3:Mexican Bullet
4:Cold coffee
5:Garlic bread

Among these "Italian sizzler" and "mexican bullet" is  a must try.

FOOD-4/5
SERVICE-4.5/5
AMBIANCE-3/5

This cafe is good for a casual visit because  it is pocket friendly and has a good food.😊

Located near forum, on the opposite end of the main road this is a pretty themed up hookah joint. This place is actually cool, only maintenance is needed, there are couches, an area which are like 'gaddas' (bed like) and then there is this area where you can soak your feet in water and chill out with hookah( although water is not that clean). 
Hookah is the best part here, it has got good options on flavors and you get chilled pipes too. Coal does not get over quick unlike other hookah places.
We took vanilla rasna flavored hookah, brownie with vanilla ice cream sizzler, four cheese pizza and tyre patty special shake! 
Brownie sizzler disappointed me, brownie did not taste like one and it was not having a good texture. Where as four cheese pizza was perfect with the thin crust and cheeseeee! The special shake was suggested by our server and he was right we loved it! It contained flavors of strawberry and nicely presented too. 
The only things that went wrong was the ac, god knows for what joy they were switching it off as it was very suffocating in there with all that smoke and hot too. 
But loved the music and hookah, my rating is only for the good ambience, hookah and the four cheese pizza!

*What : A typical,cozy,congested and smokey hukkah parlour.
*Where : Just opposite biker's cafe or Elgin rd Aqua java,beside Forum mall.
*When : A evening weekday.
* Pocket pinch : Same rate as any other hukkah parlour; but only a hukkah and 2 micktails @rs 1000, is too much I guess.

* Ambience : We went at 7.30 pm and inside of the cafe was very congested and smokey. Lot of people,loud most music, very big projector were something not I personally liked. At around 9.30 we managed to relax somehow.

* Food : Its an authentic hukkah parlour,so food quality must not be hoped very good. Snacks items were all same taste as all hukkah parlours. We took: 
                  *crispy chilli baby corn which tasted good and quantity was way better than other hukkah parlour.
                  * Thin crust pizza was also good with hookah.
                  * There lots of mocktail varieties and may they cost too much, but who cares when you are having happening friends around!

* Management : Service boys were well mannered,they came and asked if there was everything okay. We don't find this minimum attention anywhere nowadays. I liked it.

* Why recommended : If you like happening crowd and so much loud and party like music,this is your place. My eyes caught most- they are having water on the floor inside that you relax your legs playing with water and smoke hukkah. After a hectic night its good refreshment.

Its the tackiest hookah place i've ever been to! The concept of putting ur feet in that dirty water was so not tempting... And its so congested with seating so close that it totally takes from your privacy.
Hate it! Never ever visiting again.

One of the many hookah parlors in the area. This one however stands out because of its unique decor. It has been designed as a garage. It is moderately spacious. There are normal seats, couches, bed like area 😂, bean bags spread out in the place for one to chill as per their mood and choice. Food is okay but vegetarian. Quantity is fine and moderately priced. I had tried their baby corn, French fries and nachos. The hookah is decent as well and not expensive. They have this seating area where there's water below the table so you can dip your feet in the water if you wish to. Very cool. 😂 The staff were extremely hospitable and helpful. Two negative points about this place though-
1. At one point there's so much smoke in the space that it gets claustrophobic. One needs to do something about it.
2. The music is fun and peppy but mannnn so much of mediocre Punjabi songs! Playlist needs to be changed asap. 😂 
That apart one should pay a visit once. 😃

Well, okayish.
Sometimes you write a review for the sake of writing. This is one of those instances.
Nothing stands out much.
Garage appearance, loud senseless bollywood music, smoky air, and 'you-can-do-with' crowd.
Food is fine. Mocktails were better.
Had 'Litchi Lemon Daiquiri' which felt like fresh air in a dark place. 'Shark Bite' wasn't much of that impact. There was another something called 'Splash' I guess, which was mixture of any two fruity flavours. This was the best.
Followed by, 'Ricotta Permesan Quesadilla' which was way to heavy and you can't stand it for long lest it loses texture and consistency.
'Patty pops' were good. Crunchy outside, had a slimy feel inside.
Hookah is the only thing people should seek this place for. This one was satisfying.
And taxes. You'd have no idea what a little amount can sum up to. So much pepped up for a vegetarian joint that doesn't even serve alcohol!
So for a second time visit, my reaction would be meh.

Went with my friends here! Thank god that day it was not crowded. Once I went on a sunday, haha no place to stand even. Now you know how amazing the place is.
So we were 4 non hookah friends, and we decided to order ● Mangolian Rice ● Pasta ● Cheese Fondue.
Oh my, all three were high class! It was luscious, yummy, mouth watering. Even my hookah friends forgot they had to take hookah. Hehe.
Quality, quantity, presentation everything was on point.
If you are in trye patty please please . These three are highly recommended . Im attaching the photoes, just look at them. You would want to go right away.

One of the best hookah parlours I have visited so far. Located close to the brand factory, Elgin road, the best thing about this place is the ambience. With good soothing music playing in the background, a perfect place to enjoy hookah with friends. One intriguing thing, you have a zone where you sit your bare feet touches the cool water. The prices are relatively high as compared to other hookah bars. Not so satisfied with the service. They do not change the playlists even after requiesting time and again. Overall, 3.0/5.0.

A really fine spot in Elgin Road, near Forum mall. The hookah and service, both are top notch. Although I didn't have any drinks, but my friends took some and were pretty satisfied. The best thing about Tyrepatty though, is the ambience which is probably the best I have seen in any shishah bar in the city.

It's a good place to hang out, just five minutes from forum mall. The theme is that of a garage. The chairs are of Tyre's, the staff there dress as mechanics. The ambience and decor is good. The food and Sheesha is good too. The price is reasonable. They also have a section where You can dip your feet in cold water and just chill. The only con of this place is that they have slow service.

Little attention to its meals as i don't try it much but talking about the level of seesha they serve is worth sharing. 
Staffs accommodated in large numbers never let the service delay and are friendly which compels us to haunt this place often.

We had a lovely experience at this joint.

Location: 4/5
this place is on elgin road, near forum mall, right opposite to bikers cafe and aqua java. 

Ambiance: 4/5
Outside, the waiting area is made of tyres, interesting concept. Once you enter, the first thing you will smell is the intoxicating aroma of hookah. The first thing you will hear is loud popular hindi music. The first thing you will see are young college and school crowd.
One intriguing thing, there is small zone where the lower part of tables are immersed in water and when you sit your bare feet touches the cool water. Ambiance is really amazing, but the place is small.

Food & Drinks : 3.5/5
1. Fire on ice mocktail : this was a lemon n chilly flavoured mocktail. This tastes great, with fizzy n chilly flavour.
2. Crispy chilly babycorn : Totally yum and comes in good quantity.
3. Mixed veg four cheese pizza : this is a small thin crust pizza. Well there was practically no crust at all, and less veggies, but they gave healthy portions on cheese.

Hookah : 3/5
We tried a rasna combo. We found it to be rather course in flavour. 

Staff : 4/5
Well, the place has large number of staff members and they are all very attentive.

Tyre patty is pocket friendly also. good for students.. i love to visit the place several times.

It's a great place for hanging out with friends. Located just a minute walk from Forum Mall and opposite to Biker's Cafe. Great Music and Sync with the Television out there. Great Ambience. You can sit back and relax on the bed like section and have hookah or you can sit on the sofa and dip your legs in the underlying pool or you and sit on the comfy tire chairs. Boom Boom Shaker is worth having. You can call for assistance when you need it. :D

Well, Tyre Patty is an average cafe located in the Elgin Road area. It is a nice hang out place. But yes, this place has some issues. The delivery time is too long, even for a simple dish like french fries. Staffs are grumpy ole folks. Now as per the food, We loved whatever we ordered. The lemon ice tea was refreshing. French fries were hot, crispy and the dip was tangy. Perfect combo. We also had the chilli cheese toast, fine, at least better than CCD. I will recommend light snacks and drinks, main course might take too long and the taste might not be upto your expectation as what we have seen from our neighboring tables.

Located in Elgin road bang opposite Aqua Java and Biker's Cafe. This place is an amazing hangout place..You sit with your feet dipped in water with small pebbles and rocks meant to gibe you a feel of a river on a road trip along the mountains. The hookah is very smooth, amongst the best I have had in the city..The place is dark and comfortable.. Though it can get slightly crowded at times.. The only negative would be that the staff tend  to lure you into ordering irrelevant stuff..it tends to get under your nerves at times.

A friend of mine took me to this place. I'm not a hookah person. Was amazed by their crispy baby corn and their pasta, not everywhere you get to taste this type of appetizers. 
Anyhow, i feel they should have two cabins, one for the hookah and the other for the non-hookah's. 
Nice place to chill with buddies, the good things that being a hookah parlour the smoke doesn't clog in. And the best part is the sofa where you get to dip you feet in the water.

The place is very spacious and has ample sitting arrangements with different styles.
The thing that attracts is you have two sitting arrangements where u can dip Ur legs in water and have a cool experience...
The place has superrrr music collection which jus makes u groove even more..
The HOOKAH we ordered was teen paan and yes it is was the one of the best hookah I had...it lasts longer then any many I took and u can easily enjoy without changing the coal..
We ordered VIRGIN MOHITO ( yes I know I order this everywhere..it's my fav guys)
And lemonade...
Mohito was okay Bt lemonade was jus perfect refreshing and jus the way it should be...
BAKED PASTA in mixed sause is a must try...
Mangolian rice is good for those who love spicy cusines...
All in all
Food-4/5
Ambeiance-4.5/5

Have visited this place 3 times and never had a decent outing there. Despite having a very bad experience over the first time relating to slow service and cold and bland food issues, gave it a another shot on hearing it's buzz from friends but again the slow service persisted, though the food was better Shisha was not at all to my liking despite telling the maker of my preference and the third and forced visit had pretty much the same problems, the only thing I personally liked is the Ambience and their water table area.

A popular hub for youngsters ideally located opposite of biker's cafe. Tyre patty offers an enjoyable atmosphere. Decently sized place with special water seats available makes an unique place to visit with funky music playing in the background.

We tried the following items from their menu:-

1. Nachos= Masala nachos served with cheese & a special salsa over it being complemented with separate bowls of mayo & tomatoe salsa. The nachos were tasty so was it's topping. Although i felt the quantity was a bit less.

2. French fries with sweet & sour dip= A full plate of crispy french fries served with a lipsmacking mayo dip. The dip was the standout star of the palate. The quantity of the dish was very good. Must try

3. Blue lagoon= Classic blue lagoon which tasted satisfactory

4. Virgin mojito= The mint overpowered a bit in my opinion otherwise it was decent.

5. Kitkat shake

6. Oreo shake

7. Arabic mazza hookah= Refreshing & cool but avoid it since it causes a bit of difficulty to inhale afterwards.

All the above cost about 1440 in total. The prices in the menu are taxes exclusive & they also charge separate service charge. The service was good & the guys over there were prompt. Overall experience was very good & would like to visit again.

Location-Around 50m away from forum mall. A very good place to hang out with friends. Ambience is bit class. Mainly the place is divided into three sections one is sofa types where u can spread ur legs nd fell relax another is d one with light blue light nd one can dip his legs in water nd feel comfortable nd another is d normal sitting arrangements. I have went der mant a tyms. It serves one of d best foods specially the crispy chilly babycorn. Hookah is one of d best nd if someone is going for a cafe only for hookah then one should opt for Tyre patty coz it serves one of d best hookah. The waiters are very friendly. The service is quite good. The quality tym spend here overcome all d expense in it.

So me and my friends planned for a trip to a Hookah Parlour and found this affordable place. The place Is really fascinating. The ambience and the lighting just added to our mood. There were a few places where we could dip our feet in water. Overall, the place Is pocket friendly yet one of the better hookah parlours in Kolkata.

Location : Barely 50m from Forum Mall.

No. of visits : Many!

Ambience :
#The place is primarily divided into 3 sections:

1. You can dip your feet in the underlying pool sitting on the comfy sofa with a "press for assistance" button to call a staff.

2. Bed like section where you can relax yourself.

3. The normal one with sofas and tyre like chairs.

#The neon lighting add a charm to the ambience.

#Air flow is well managed so that it doesn't obstructs your smoke.

It used to have a non-smoking section section before but now it has been converted to a smoking one.

Staff : They are very courteous,helpful, well informed about the menu and helps you in making a right choice.

Food : This place serves one of the best food available in Kolkata. Period. The team of chef's are very consistent and you get the same thing each time you order.
*Malai Chai is a delight to have!
*Elaichiwali Chai is also awesome and the flavor of elaichi is very spot on,**but the cup is not fully filled and you get only 3/4th of a cup of chai because it doesn't have foam like the malai chai**. Disappointed!
Crispy Chilli Babycorn : Delicious and the quantity is also pretty good.
*Pizza : Perfectly baked with adequacy of cheese.
*Amritsari kulcha and kali daal : A cafe which serves north indian food at par with any restaurant you can think.
The kulcha is perfect and crispy and compliments so well with the dal that you will forget that you are in a cafe.
Kudos to the chef!

Hookah : There are masters of hookah sitting in this place.
The sheesha is brilliant most of the time and it is very smoky and lasts enough!
The only time i have a problem is when i order TEEN PAAN ROSE, (i dont like my sheesha to be made very strong and i like it to be made light or towards the moderate end) but even after asking them to make it light; it comes strong ( on 2-3 occasions). Please see to it.

Price : Price is towards the higher side taking the taxes into account but it doesn't pinchs your pocket because of the quality time spent.

Highly recommended!!!

It's an amazing place with pool where u can relax by dipping ur leg and feel fresh. Hookah is very good with dense smoke and the price is very reasonable. The staffs r very polite and their service is excellent. They maintain the age limit of minimum 18years old .

Really really good hookah with thick smoke, didn't even have to ask for a coal change.
Large servings of pasta.
The dip-your-feet-in-water thing. (Still wondering how hygienic it is though)
The décor.

What I disliked:
Service was late and attendants weren't responding.

This hookah bar is located on the Elgin road very close to the Forum Mall. It is a quite well known place for hookahs and the hookah here does taste and feels good. It does not choke and a single coal lasts about 40 minutes for two. The food however here does not taste good and could have been a lot better..moreover, it serves only vegetarian food which did not excite me at all. Hoever the most unique thing about the place is its ambiance in the form of a car garage and the floor of few seats being covered in water. When you sit in those seats the shoes have to be taken off and dipping your feet in the cold and clear water gives a very soothing and refreshing feel. Overall a decent place for the hookah with its unique ambiance and theme.

Loated in Elgin road right in front of aqua java Elgin, near brand factory. The place is nicely decorated and has a vibrant feel to it, instantly connects with the youth. The sheesha here is pretty awesome..doesn't choke and is smooth for a long time.
On my last visit, I was very disappointed with the food.
1. We ordered for a chilli cheese toast, the presentation of which was very nice, however the taste was just above average. Wasn't soft...rubber consistency.
2. The next item was the much talked about amritsari kulcha platter...served with pickle..curd..salad and dal makhani. The main element of the platter I.e, amritsari kulcha was not upto the mark..lacked the crispiness..lacked butter..was very dry inside...I've had much better kulchas...however the dal was a delight...perfectly simmered and perfectly balanced...so flavourful!
3. The next order was a lasagna verdure. Let me tell you , it was a disaster. One of the worst experiences as far as an Italian dish is concerned. The moment we took our first bite, my friend cursed me for ordering that. First, it did not have enough lasagna sheets, the sauce was thinner than pouring consistency, and tasted extremely sweet(I don't even prefer my deserts that sweet). I thought it was my bad day, and requested the waiter to change it and  made my preferences pretty clear to him, and again to our surprise, the replacement was the exact some, this time just with some more lasagna sheets in it. 
When we couldnt finish it, we complained again and asked for that to be packed, and the waiter said they would charge 25 rs more for packing..that too for a small aluminium foil container. 
I still like the place for its sheesha...cheese fondue and ambiance...in my previous visit I had tried their cheese fondue whic was very good. The exact right balance was struck.
The staff here is very friendly. 
For our order of a chilli cheese toast, amritsari kulcha, lasagna verdure, sheesha, coke pitcher and a virgin mojito, we paid 1600 bucks.
Overall, a recommended place for youngsters who want to chill.

This place is class apart . You will get great pizzas here and their hookahs are nice and smooth. Food quality is decent but what really gets me attracted to this place , is their trippy ambiance . when u vl submerge your feet in the cold water and see all the light effects going on , it really gets u . If their service were a little more quicker, I would have given them a 5 star rating .

Mixed sauce pasta is really good. Also the nachos and cheese fondue. Patty special sheeshas are good. Ambience and decor will strike you first. It has an says zone too.

Location:Straight Forum Mall backside (Shoppers Stop entrance) on Elgin Road. This place needs no locational guidance though.


Ambiance: SuperCool! Love the sections made. One appears like a Garage, other with a foot-pool, one for private parties and an elevated section for thorough chilling. Really good crowd and courteous Staff.


FOOD & Sheesha: Ordered Blueberry Kacchi Kairi and Rose Paan Sheesha. Blueberry Sheesha had major choking problems. The staff got it re-made 5 times to get the normal smoke and non-choke. Else had a soothing flavour. I'm really not a Sheesha person. Still ,a good experience.

Ordered The very famous Amritsari Kulcha with Daal Dip and Garlic Bread. 

Amritsari Kulcha was PERFECTO! Served with Salad, Yoghurt, Pickle and the Daal. It tasted Heavenly. Salad was fresh and everything was so perfect! 

Garlic Bread was equally tasty. Had that Lovely Garlic Flavour with loads of cheese. Served with chopped salad. Would have been better if served with some Liquid Tangy Ketchup. 

A word for management: Your washroom is intolerably Dirty! Please maintain hygiene. Late staff reaponse though they are very gentle. Else, So far so good :)

Hii... Tyre Patty was like a home to me but I never thought of writing a review. But here I am now, this place has one of the finest ambience in town.  The best thing about this place is the automobile theme. One must try pasta, baby corn, cheese fondue and nearly every mocktail.  The aqua place is also just fabulous with a new concept.. 
Thankyou

I've been going to Tyre Patty for over a year now. The food (especially cheese fondue) has always been up to the mark. The mocktails and other drinks are also nice. The staff, however, is a little under enthusiastic and make it boring. The ambience and the sheesha is just okay. All in all, a good place to sit and relax, especially if you don't want parking problems.

Pre-note to the review: Please Tyre Patty staff, turn down the volume of the songs, because I have been to so many hookah bars in the city and only some have given me a really bad headache in exchange for money, and one of those places is Tyre Patty.

Having said the above, Tyre Patty is one of those new places in the city that you just have to go because every other person is going. Bustling with tens of smoky silhouettes of people in their early to mid twenties, this place is a fun place. Starting from their quirky interior decoration to their hookahs, everything has got an Oomph-factor here. They use alcohol bottles for light bulb casings, and they have a Unisex bathroom! You don't see that everyday. 
Hookahs are reasonably priced, the food is AMAZING considering the rowdy crowd they have to cater to. The drinks are lip smacking and the momos are quite a different thing altogether. The food and drinks are really good. I would have given a 5 on 5 rating considering how good the eatables they serve are, but for the loud music. 

Would it really hurt to turn it down a couple of notches? This place makes for a really bad conversation place.

Really liked the ambience and the interior. One of the best places so far I have been to for hookah. Great place to hangout for hookah lovers.It was Tyre Patty's bday , the day we went. It was a nice experiance, they served a complimentary drink, which was really cool, the shots. They serve drinks in a pitcher, liked the idea. Their hookah was really good, better from most of the places,didnt finish off so early. We were three of us, we had a cheese fondue, which was amazing, the molten cheese in a bowl.The interior arrangement is quite attractive. One can choose to have a hookah while keeping their feet dipped in water, one can choose to sit on drums or seats made up of tyre. Its a veg place with a quite good location and during the evening its all packed up. All together a nice hangout place.

Tyre Patty
Its one of my favourite cafes in kolkata..
It is located in lee road near Forum mall opposite of Aqua java in the India Bulls buliding ..As soon as you enter the cafe you feel lyk coming in garage.
Beautifully designed this cafe is very different from the other cafes available in the city...Old tyres are being used to make the couches and the staffs are being dressed like a mechanic..Amazing concept...
I have visited the cafe many times and everytime have tried something new and i must say their food quality is amazing starting frm mocktails ,their shakes are amazing .pizza pasta garlic bread crispy chilli baby corn  all are superb we once ordered for their kulcha combo & it was one of the best thing of this  cafe you must try it..
The hookah are amazing with superb flavours they serve the last time i went their i tried their gelly hookah which was again a uniqueness of this cafe..
You must try this for sure..
Another thing which is different in their cafe-There is a section called their aqua section where you can chill with your buddies soaking your legs in the water giving urslf a feeling of a swimming pool..
Overall a very nice unique and a great place to chill out with your friends with superb collection of music great ambience nice & comfortable sitting arrangement..

We wanted to enjoy our fine Sunday afternoon with some hookah & shakes. We ordered for a 5 Paan & Kitkat Shakes.

The hookah was nothing to write home about. It was a very ordinary punch of flavours.

The shakes were watery. So I called up the waiter to check it & more importantly fix it. He came back 10 mins later with the same shake, watery & sweet. And at ₹151 per shake, we expected a lot more than that. 

For the owner/s: In this day of tough competition, my suggestion is that you guys take care of the quality of food served. I'm not recommending this place to anyone I know. Just good music & air-conditioning doesn't ensure customer satisfaction! Food for thought.

The hookah was realy good. The shaker was the thing that disappointed me. It tasted like bournvita. the lagsagne was good. it had a chese layer on top. I must say 1 thing. I asked for water from them. They said they are giving. I finished my lasagne and hookah but still didnt get the water! Didnt like their service. I xpected better than this

The aqua part here is the unique thing it has and makes it stand away from the crowd, like a boss! The hookah is the best in town! Pasta, baby corn are just fab! The people here are more than a family. Mathew Bhaiya being one of the most familiar to mu brother helps us a lot! The combos are outta the world!
In short, this is a must visit for everyone I must say!

Visited only once..
Proper ambience..
Not remcommended by me as its a Good place for hookah lovers and I am not a hookah party :P
Snacks was not so much Nice..

The second time, 7 of us visited here on the eve of Friendship Day :D
Firstly the security outside said that there is no space inside for ur to seat and we've to wait; at the moment we were about to leave, another one said that there is space and we can go and check it out !
We went inside and found that 2 groups of 6-7 each can seat there.
We were a bit uncomfortable with our seatings.
The manager gave us another place to seat in.
We didn't have a nice experience as the food here was not nice. We had to change the nachos 2 times then cancel it.. the pasta was ok.
The staff didn't seem to be co operative however the manager co operated with us !

Tyre patty as the name says... The ambience matches perfectly with the name.  Sittings are on half cut drums, giving a garage look and also the music is nice.  Any mild sheesha is good along with stuffed potatoes.  Cokes are also reasonable and also worth your money.  Staffs are cool and also have a separate place for birthday celebrations.  Overall nice experience.  Will surely check in again. :)

It has very trendy vibe to it with comfy sofas to sit, a lounge to spread yourself and sit, also a part of the place has tables underneath which you can dip your feet in water like an aquazone.. Hookah's are fairly priced at starting from 351 bucks.. The side orders are a bit overpriced that's a con except that I'd give 5/5 to this place overall. Try the 5 paan hookah if you're here.. Staff are very cordial too..
Hookah - 5/5
Food - 4/5
Ambiance - 5/5
Staff - 5/5

I visited this place twice. Both on my friend's birthday. Had a very bad experience.
They have this section where one can dip their feet in and sit. The water is extremely dirty. Only amritsari kulcha is good. The food requires a lot of improvement. The place is filled with the smell of hookah which is a turn off for non-hookah takers.
My friend had booked the small hall/room for her birthday. When we reached there, the manager apologised and told that the hall/room has been given to someone else. We were highly disappointed. We thought to ignore and enjoy. We had ordered many things-margarita pizza, amritsari kulcha, pasta, coke. Well, whatever we were ordering, they responded as it cannot be made now or will take time. We were still ok with it. Service is very very slow. They take 1 hour to bake 2 pizzas. We had ordered 3 pizzas. After getting the first pizza(after half and hour), they said that the other two will take time. After half and hour, they served another pizza and told- the other one cannot be served and asked us to order something else in place of it. If they cannot serve things on time or cannot prepare things, then why are they running a cafe.
I was very disappointed. I will never ever like to visit this place again.

The place is great for hanging out and killing some time. The food is good, in particular one should try the sizzler.Hookah is decent. The only problem is that the service sometimes lags behind especially in the case of hookah. Overall I would suggest this place to friends looking to kill time and wanting to listen to some awesome music.

Located in the posh locality of lee road tyre patty is a fun place for sure, starting from an eye catching decor the ambience is buzzing with energy. Though a little crammed food served is pretty decent. Starting from pastas to cheese fondue the menu is extensive and good to eat. The pan grilled momos are something which I found to be a little different. Their collection of music is nice but personally I prefer places where the noise level is equivalent to zero, not particularly looking for a meditation centre though. Have been here only once, being quite near to forum mall Elgin road, it's one of the new places that has opened. 
I didn't find their food amazing or anything out of this world. It's a regular place with interesting concept and decor, one should definitely try this place just for the experience. The all vegetarian cafe concept doesn't appeal to me much.

Concept is really good and so is the ambience. A perfect destination to hangout and if u are a Hookah lover then u wont be disappointed. 

I went there with high expectations but got disappointed with the following few things.

1. They don't serve liq or nonveg.
2. They don't maintain their USP bubble water therapy seats.

Water where we put our legs are not cleaned and the tiles have come out. U could find foils and plastics floating. 

Little warm clean water with salt can make this place much desired for.

Food is decent and so is the service.

Caters mostly to youths who are up for a hukkah and adda.

Been there for the first time with one of my friend. The ambiance was really good having a very young vibe. Mainly the aqua zone.
Just dip in your feet and chill out.
Perfect place for hangout with innovative ideas. 
Food they serve are good.
Pizza : It was good. Having thin crust. Small one will serve for one generally, so better go with the big.
Sizzlers : It was ok type.
Baked Pasta : It was not that good.

Located just on the opposite of Aqua Java and Bikers Cafe beside Lee Road Brand Factory, Tyre Patty provides a certain amount of quirkiness as it's name goes.

Ambiance - It has a very young vibe to it. Rickshaw hoods mounted on the wall, graffitis and especially the Aqua Zone. Mosaic-ed spaces with ankle deep cool water, just dip your feet and puff off a hookah, innovative way to chill out. But the loud music kind of kills the mood.

Food -  They have a pretty elaborate menu, Zomato, request you to upload the same please. We ordered,
1. Crunchy Pita with Hummus - Baked crunchy pita slices with a Hummus and Tahini dip. Tastes descent but seemed too dry to go with Hookah.

2. Onion Rings - Best sliders of the night perhaps. Light , beautifully fried , golden brown in color and a cool presentation makes this simple snack so good. 

3. Crispy Chilli baby corn - Classic vegan delicacy, always goes well with smokes and boozes. tried and tasted. Not in a mood for experiment? order this. u wont regret.

4. Boom Boom Shake - A tyre patty twist to choco oreo shake. Sweet, thick, delicious.

5. Shark Bite - Lime infused Kiwi drink. If tangy is your thing, go for this drink.

6. Sheesha ( Citrus Blast ) - It was supposed to be fruity, tasted like paan/ mint. Not complaining because it tasted well, but maybe they should make citrus blast a little more ..well.. citrusy..or maybe they made some error.

Service - Waiters are polite, though dint quite liked the way they tried to force us to take 2 hookahs though. Delivery time for hookahs were fast, foods took almost 20 mins during peak hours. 

Overall, a mediocre experience.

Well, to be very honest, even with a very good ambiance and an innovative concept of feet down into the water and puffing off hookah, I still felt that the place lacked something to it. The menu was extensive, but purely veg, not even a single recipe of non-veg. The hookah prices were moderate enough but the quality of the base was not that good. The staff, even though courteous, tried to impose two hookahs per table which I found is not done. There is nothing much to write about the food, because it's just average. The service is prompt, the hookah reaches the table fast enough, the food takes a little bit of time. 
 

This place will very much be a college-crowd puller, the place I found to be too much congested and shabby. All in all, a one time visit for me. 
(The menu card pictures and prices in them are updated till 26 Apr, 2015)

The place remains packed in the evening, but service is very prompt. There is a section where the tables are placed on a shallow pool and you can splash your feet against the water!

Finally last Sunday I had the right company to visit this hookah cafe. This cafe is perfectly located opposite biker's cafe.
Previously I had heard about this aqua section and we were fortunate enough to grab a seat there.But it turned out to be less amusing than I thought and the place also appeared to be little congested.
Coming to hookah we ordered a 3paan hookah and lasagna verdure which tasted great.
Service was prompt and the staff were courteous.
But overall it was a one time visit for me.

Been here many times.. Well this place is really a great hang out for friends.. Hookah is not very expensive. It costs around 263+ taxes for hookah. Food is great. Everything that I have tried out has kept me wanting more. They serve large coke in pitcher which looks attractive. If you have problem finding the place just crash in to Forum and ask someone for India Bulls. TP is located in that building ground floor.

Located Opposite Aqua Java on Elgin Road.
This place is has the advantage of its location. A mall, A college, Schools all within walking distance. So its always a housefull.
The decor and ambience is just too good. And the Aqua tables just add to the brilliance. There is another section for the peeps who aren't fond of hookah.
Food quality is quite good. Maybe not authentic. But it surely brings water in the mouth. Alfredo Pasta and Cheese Fondue are one of my favourites. 
And then their special nights like Sufi and all just add up to atmosphere.

I really don't know what is it about tyre patty that makes it so successfull. I mean, It's dark and dingy which is still ok but then it's suffocating. 
Location: A few minutes walk from forum or opposite Biker's cafe. 
Ambiance: I hate the ambiance here. This place us built up in a small area. And it is suffocating. 
 Food: Maybe the food and the hukkah here is the only saving points. We had ordered a lot of stuff from wai wai to chilly babycorn to pizza and all of it was good. So yeah, the food was good. Especially the thin crust pizza. Even the coffee here was good. The hookah was smooth and nice, according to my companion. 

Service: It was more on the negative side. The staff had a very casual and laid back attitude. 

Nope. Not again.

The attractive part is that there is a section having a small kinda pool type beneath the table where you can put your feet inside the water and enjoy the food.

We grabbed a combo of Rs.921/- only offering 2 hookahs , 1 pizza , 1 pasta & large coke !!!

Crispy Babycorn(side order) tastes awesome , teen patti & orange were our choice for hookah flavour , veg pizza & the white sauce pasta were too good ! A Lime~soda will not be bad to order ...

The service at this place is always as good as it was earlier ....

This place has good hookah,  try the Brain freezer salsa flavour and yea its pretty strong.  The so called jacuzzi or pool is a turn off with only few inches of water but you won't mind sitting there as that area is less suffocating than the rest! The decor is cool and casual, place is usually full.  Try going there after 5pm as they offer some good combo deals. 
The biggest disappoinment i had was FOOD.   I had ordered caesar salad and pasta. The pasta was not properly cooked. They gave me a few lettuce leaves with some salad dressing in the name of caesar salad,  well you wouldn't pay 150rs for those leaves only.  I asked them to add some cheese & veggie in the salad which they somehow agreed to. 
Bang in there for a good sheesha.

Went to chill out today...the menu has changed with prices as inflated as Rs.40 for a small bottle of water which actually costs Rs.10. A nachos is priced at 140 in which they served just 10 pieces of nachos. Its certainly not that great a place to keep prices so high considering the quantity of food. Certainly I did nt find it value for money..

Simply the best hookah parlour in town !!
Right from the beginning it just sets the tune right... from decor to the unique aqua seating...clearly separates it from others in competition.

The food and hookah...both are really great...specially you have to try the Sizzling Brownie with Chocolate Sauce... one heck of a dessert.
Shisha was absolutely awesome...neatly made up...dense smoke...and importantly you can sense the flavours..which are generally lacking in other places.

I would suggest this place as a great adda to hangout with frnz... coz the ambience is suprb.. it just sets the mood right and gets you grooving.
The location of this joint is easily accessible...probably the reason for a great and quality crowd.
And they didn't run out of hookah flavours even during the peak hours of Sunday...so you get to choose from all those cool shishas without having to compromise.
!! TYRE PATTY ALL THE WAY !!

A good place to hang out with friends with an interesting ambiance. The food may not win many accolades, simply because it dominates as a hookah bar. However, I did find the nachos to be good and the lasagna to be average. We decided to sit on one of those tables with a bubble-bath running below the table, which was fun and comforting. However, it might be suffocating to those who do not enjoy hookah. Overall, one of the places which is great after a long day at college, or worse, tuition classes.

Ambience - pretty niche and nice concept. Tyre seats and drum semi sofas. Also, there is a water portion of the parlour where you can rest your legs in water and smoke shisha. Also, there is a semi bed structured sitting arrangement, so you can suit your desire of sitting according to your mood. 

Food & Hookah - hookah was decent enough, say 7/10. For the food part, crispy baby corn was good, Mexican salad had no taste except for the chillies. Wai Wai bhel was good. Litchi lemon juice was a complete waste. We tasted a sip and left it untouched. Although, while leaving the manager saw the glass still filled up he asked if we didn't like it and said we could have replaced it. So that's great hospitality. 

Budget- just as priced as normal hookah parlours like aqua java and 360. All the things stated above was ordered and the bill was 1095. That's actually economical. 

Thought - will visit again for sure to try out some new fooding in the menu. 

P.S - place is packed on weekends.

If you are looking for a 'hatke' place  to chill out with pals ... you can check out Tyre Patty. Fun seating arrangements.. good hookah & ok food... & the best part .. the Aqua Zone... where you can dip your feet & chat away. Very relaxing!
I would recommend a better menu though, if possible with non-veg options for a hard core non-vegetarian like me.

Soups, pasta, noodles, chilly paneer and Mongolian rice were awesome, although I can't say the same about the pizza. Coffees, both hot and cold, was good. The staff is courteous. The location is perfect. The ambiance is excellent. The interiors are cool. Overall it was a pretty delightful experience for me. Am definitely looking forward to a second visit to this place.

So, finally after long time I have decided to review this place.. I have been to this place several times and the more I have been there the more I have loved this place.. One of the greatest hookah parlor in town so far and at the best place where one could never get lost :P.. They possess the great ambience, music, people and last but not the least "hookah" 
They are best at making hookahs.. I never got the chance to complain about any of its features since they are very cautious about the satisfaction of the customers and it's one of the most amazing thing of Tyre Patty.. Reasonable rates.. Love in and out of it..

If you want to have a smoky sheesha with delicious food and marvelling ambience then this is the place for you. I loved their cheese fondue and their special hookah. It lasted long and was very smoky. This place deserves 5 however I have deducted 0.5 for the pocket pich that it gives every time I visit the place!! Some of friends call them bhagwan of sheeshas as they consider it the best shhesha lounge of the city !!

Location: Opposite Aqua java, Elgin.

This place is located quite near to Brand Factory or a better landmark being  Aqua Java, Elgin.

The ambiance out here has a modernized touch to it with sectional divisions to the interior so as to suit your mood. Has around four different sections with different décors but, no such partitions to it, but, the walls and dimensions might render some to feel claustrophobic. This is the place which houses the much loved aqua zone where you can enjoy the cool waters at your feet while smoking your sheesha or relishing the dishes on offer.

»UPDATE: Earlier the Aqua zone could be availed at an extra cost, but, now the additional costs have been removed.

Having visited this place for a number of times, the recommendation list can be drafted which is subject to change on the basis of future visits.

Recommendations [Updated on May 13, 2015]:
- Pasta Napolitano  (Penne)
- Pasta Alfredo (Penne/Fussili)
- Mongolian (Rice/Noodles)
- Lasagna Verdure
- Croute Mashed Potato Focaccia
- Cheese Fondue
- Boom Boom Shaker (Shake)
- Aerated Drinks (Pitcher, consider when in a group)

The service here is prompt and a wonderful twist to speed up the services is the addition of assistance switches (read: call switches) at the aqua zone (only, coz' staff access is low in that section so as to provide a little privacy).
The staff is courteous and the prices here are slightly inclined towards the high.

Overall has always been a good experience.

This is the best place if you want to have hookah along with quality food.
Prices are high but it compensates for the rocking ambience and music and lights! 
Go with a gang of friends.  Huddle up in the sofas and dip your feet in the jacuzzi.  
Order some rich paan hookah along with rose water ice Base.  _/\_
Along with it have some cheese fondue.  You'll lick it clean.

Tyre Patty ..! I know I'm too late to write a review for a cafe already so renowned after more than a year it has started .. but it was my first visit and it was a decent experience.. The staff were helpful but the ambience was lil shady . The place was full of smoke and filled with thw strong smell of shisha. The food however was quite okay. Although the pizza had all the desired toppings and sauce, it tasted bland. Pasta was just normal, however the italian sizzler was good. The place can be visited for its shisha and reasonable pricing at this location. Besides a lil ventilation and better food can help this place top the chart!

Tyre patty being the first theme based Hookah Lounge is pretty much well designed & have given a good Garage type environment with beautifully done wallpapers and designs be it floor, walls or the ceiling. The staffs add to the theme by wearing Garage Uniform. I liked the Crazy Combination of seating arrangement with a portion of an Aqua Seating ( First In Kol )

Coming to Hookah it is par to the Nocturne Haze & Food is pricing is bit High but Good on Quality.

I'm very much satisfied & would Strongly Recommend it.

Tyre Patty is a fairly new kid in the block. Located bang opposite Aqua Java on Elgin Road, this is a quirky cool hangout. It has the look of a garagem, waiters dressed in orange garage clothes and seating arrangements resembling the same. If you shell out some extra bucks then you can dip your feet in water and "get high" :) on a double apple or teen paan. ONE THING I FOUND A LITTLE DISTURBING WAS THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE AROUND. I guess there are less filters in place and the place seems claustrophobic. The food is priced on the higher side but then its okay once in a while. 
I would recommend this place. All in all its quite cool.

The place is located at a prime location, having a lot of competition. Well, if you're from Calcutta you know how much the local youth love to smoke hookah. Though this place is a hookah joint, but it attracts its customers because of the nice foot-soaking tiny pool which is quite clean, and they even provide you with wipes to clean your feet when you leave. Talking about the hookah and food, its quite general as one would expect from a neighborhood hookah joint. The ambiance is quite different here and gives you the rugged feel, as the decor is made of tyres and rickshaw cover (don't worry you won't be embarrassed), infact its one of its kind.

Walked in today with gale and thunder, with high hopes :)Food was the ultimate turn down, and was very basic and lacked even the written ingredients. A query for the chef made us a recipient to very rude comments by the waiter. We decided not to pursue the matter, so managed to shovel it down with the help of oregano/tabasco etc. We lingered on for a while until we paid for the overpriced food and crappy service.
This was just a personal experience, i would really want to go back someday and let them change my opinion.
p.s. the rough interior looks cool but a bit overdone.

When they started this café there was a lot of buzz about the interesting sitting arrangement with a pool beneath the table for dipping your feet while you enjoy your food, drinks and hookah. I went to this place pretty excited about what I have heard from my friends about it. Though the overall place is decently arranged but the management is laid back, the pool is full of shit floating around which the previous customers have left over. The hookah was decent though nothing special and the food was also worth thing once only. Not much satisfied but might go again but surely not siting anywhere near the pool

Worked well with a portion of interiors but it does not give the best feel. Been to garage themed hookah bar in other city, so ambiance needs to get more feel. 
Place is too congusted being a garage.
Hookah is average. 
Did not try food at this place. Since hookah was not upto the mark. 
Food is not at all good

The recipe for a 4.5 rating. Near forum mall, so access is easy. Grab few close friends, Go to the water bed table, order humpty dumpty hooka, with fire on the ice drink and have a perfect view to heaven.

Staffs are friendly too.

Really a gr8 place to hangout wid frnds
Dey serve amazin varitied cuisines n mix ups splly italian n mexican
My favs of dis place r Cannelloni..... cheesy n yum baked n Barbeque Noodles..... Luscious n splendid
Would suggest every1 to try d place once coz den de'll find moments of goin der as Me

Anoder visit to Tyre Patty...... Anoder superb experience : 
We sat wid inside where we cud relax our legs in water frm below n enjoy gossipin n eating...... The staff is quite humble n even comic; we orderd Canelloni Florentine, Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Mojhito wid Ginger Ale and Chocolate Shake wid Brownie.

The Babycorn first served was jst amazin; proper crisp along wid d lusciousness of d sauce n perfect blend of spices.

The Chocolate shake was nt upto d mark except fr d brownie savin d drink n lil ice cream on d top

The Canelloni Florentine was d best i've ever had..... Super cheesy along wid d spinach n red sauce flavour arising n quantity served was also gud

Same fr the Mojhito wid Ginger Ale... It was insanely relaxin wid the mint aroma comin upto d mind
The staff while leavin gave us seperate cloth to wipe up our legs..... 
BRAVO BINGO!!!!

Food - 4/5

Ambience is just awesome here.
The way this resturaunt has been made by using scarp parts is just praise-worthy.
The aqua-zone is one of its kind but u have to make sure u visit in d non rush hours to enjoy ur meal at the aqua table.
food is good but little on the expensive side could be brought down by a few bucks.
hookAH is deccent could be made better.

Conveniently located near forum this place offers a nice hangout for youngsters. Initially had a separate section with fish spa which is not available now, but the aqua zone still remains wherein one can dip their feet in water.The menu is varied and interesting, food is decent and the hookah too. Nicely decorated outside, it is an adda zone for friends.

A very different look altogether. Looks like a garage and it also has a great look. It is not like a typical sheesha place. I liked the hookah and the food as well.  The momos and the noodles were really good. Among drinks virgin mojito was v good. Overall a nice place to go out to chill for a while with friends.

Tyre patty - Visit again today.
============================
Intro: Made a visit to Tyre Patty with couple of my college friends today. The ambience was calm today. The music was not too loud. The staffs were much more courteous than the last time. Took a seat. 
============================
Food:-

1) Lasagne Verdure - It costed 280 bucks. It was baked inside with cheese on top and vegetables inside and a bottom layer of baked flour. It was superb and i really liked the taste. Thumbs up for this. I expected this to be served same as kaidi kitchen. However, it was different and i really appreciate their work. 

2) Mongolian Rice - This is the third time i am probably trying this here. Well, the rice was perfectly tossed in Mongolian sauce with healthy vegetables such as broccoli placed in. Health as well as tasty. Lovely presentation with the chef cut carrot flower on top. Outstanding. 

3) Peach Rasna Hookah - Lasted for like 1 hour 20 minutes to be very precise. I am really happy that the hookah lasted very late here despite the A.c. The hookah was perfectly made as i wanted more peach and less of rasna. Good. 
============================
What i noticed new:-

1) Courteous staffs
2) They provided me with a well made feedback form this time. However, what was turnoff was that the spelling of 'efficiency' was written wrong. Such a big cafe and how can they get wrong with spellings? However, it does leave an impression. 
3) Hookah lasted long. New mud made base. 
4) As it is a Gadget freak world, they have kept plug points near every seats. I have never seen this in every cafe. They took notice of the youngsters wanting to 'charge mobiles' and hence, implement. Excellent. 
5) Wifi Facility available too. 
============================
Summary:

Food presentation 5/5 ( They deserve it) 
Food quality 5/5 
Hospitality 5/5 (No strings Attached - No tip required - they serve with a smiling face) 
Ambience 5/5 (From the above seating area, to the wall carved designs and wallpapers. Not just that, even the floor is designed amazingly. These small things does make a difference. That's why i am here pointing it out to you guys. :) ) 
Taste 5/5
Comfort 4.5/5 (Sometimes it feels suffocating and cramped up.) 
============================
Suggestions: 

1) I just have one suggestion. I am really happy and glad that the management of Tyre patty has come up with the new aqua zone. However, what i noticed is that after coming out the aqua zone, there should be somewhat like a towel or a floor mat so that people can clean off the extra water otherwise it just makes the whole place look messed up. The pool will definitely get dirt, one cannot do anything about that. But, a mat can probably do wonder. Some research and development must be done there because i really liked the concept. 
============================
Conclusion:

A place for the youngsters. Perfectly designed ambience. From the culinary to the presentation of the food - I just have one word 'Excellent'. :) Great going. :) Will surely come back for more.

A good culinary experience seen today at TYRE PATTY

Went with few of my friends to celebrate valentines day and had ordered many things. However, on this occasion I would love to state my review in happiness and disappointment mode. 

Happiness
1) the decor was outstanding. Preparing and spending so much for a day is superb. 
2) they had prepared a special valentine menu card for the lovers.
3) I luckily got to sit in the aqua zone. However it was dirty water and didn't like keeping my feet down much. Concept was too good.
4) the presentation of food: definitely a lovely idea.  A big thanks to management of tyre patty. 
5) instant fast service and courteous staffs.

Disappointments:-
1) the pesto sauce pasta tasted horrible. There was no pasta in it. The sauce was bland. Horrible. 
2) Italian smooch mock tail- waste of money. Tasted like mojito. NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.

Mongolian rice, garlic bread and hookahs were pretty awesome. :-) overall, lovely experience.


----- 29 Jan, 2014 -----

A third review on tyre patty- Not much improvements. 

I had paid a visit to tyre patty yesterday at around evening with my brother and another friend of mine to have a 'chill session' at tyre patty. However, when i was entering the tyre patty there is a valet parking system where you give your car key's and the inspector in charge would hand you over the slip. However, he did not hand me over the slip and told me to 'keep calm and carry on'. You know what i mean. 

Hence, i went inside and ordered :- 

1) Watermelon Rasna Sheesha- Which was pretty moderate. However, one can not enjoy the rings out here due to the arrangement's of swingers and A.c. 
2) Mongolian Rice- However, this time, thanks to my sharp eyes, the presentation of the rice had changed. I like the previous presentation more where the carrot was cut in a flower like way and served to you. However, the presentation had degraded to serve us fast despite we being the only customer out there. The rice tasted superb as it usually is. 
3) Virgin Mojito with Apple Juice- I really liked the mocktail. However, the quantity of the glass disappointed me. They should serve us with a bigger glass and not somewhat like a sampler. 

While, i was leaving back on my way from tyre patty, the inspector as usual, putting his hands on the head for a tip. However, i was even more clever to not pay any heed and leave. This is a very wrong practice and i am totally against it. I want the management to notice this so that they can take care of it. Very very disappointing and absolutely disgusting. 

SPECIAL REQUEST TO ZOMATO: All the menu's are not yet listed on your system. Please collect the latest one comprising of a different mocktail and a different sheesha menu. 


Summary:
Food presentation 3/5
Food quality 4/5
Hygiene 3.5/5
Hospitality 3/5 ( The staff's should be much more courteous enough to serve us.)
Pricey? Very pricey. I would recommend going in a group would be much better out here. 
I heard they have even stopped charging for the aqua zone. Please confirm with other people if same is the case and do leave me a comment if anyone know's about it. :)


----- 15 Jan, 2014 -----

Tyre patty - a well designed garage type environment crafted with beautifully done wallpapers and designs(be it on floor, walls or ceiling) where the staffs wearing orange garage uniform serves you with shisha, food and mock tails. 

The seating arrangement varies here. They have use tyres also and even chairs. It's like a crazy combination. A portion of tyre patty consists of aqua seating arrangement where they charge you bomb and is good for celebrating birthday parties or anniversaries. 

In my opinion, it is not at all a family place because it is conjusted, too lousy and even Crampy. However, for a family dine in one should visit kaidi kitchen which is also owned by the same person. 

Located opposite vanilla creperie(Old aqua java). 

It was my second visit yesterday to tyre patty. We were 3 people and had ordered:-
1) orange Rasna sheesha - I personally don't prefer too much Rasna in winters as I feel it causes trouble to my throat. So, on my instructions they made it perfectly with less of Rasna. 
2) mix sauce penne pasta- I had explained the waiter to make the dish according to our way so that I don't need to taste tomato sauce more and white sauce less. The pasta was really outstanding. It was beyond my expectations. 
3) Mexican rice- the presentation of the rice was excellent and the rice was fabulous. 
4) shark bite mock tail- did not like it at all. The mock tail needs enhancement ok large scale. 
5) water bottle

When the waiter got the food, believe me there was hardly any space to keep. For this reason, we picked our phones so that at least some space is there. The place is very Crampy and even the same music gets repeated many times. Same problem like kaidi kitchen. 

As we need to have more space, we said the staff to keep hookah without coal so that when we take after half hour flavour doesn't get burned. However he was telling us that it should be kept with coal on? I was like what? That proved to me that the staff knew nothing. 

Hospitality is fine. But ambience too Crampy. Music way too loud. 

Costly affair? A little on higher side. It costed us 1100 approx for 2. Ambience really very good. 
Valet parking facility available. 

Satisfied but still lot of scope to improve.  :) 

Food at tyre patty won't disappoint you.


----- 10 Oct, 2013 -----

Location and description:  Tyre patty located opposite vanilla creperie (old aqua java Elgin) or you can say 3 guys. I had visited kaidi kitchen today itself and wanted to visit this place too and coincidentally I got to know that it is owned by the same person through the kaidi kitchen management. After kaidi kitchen and its excellent, superb and outstanding services I was expecting a lot from the Tyre patty - Cafe redefined. There is a door guard who greets you for coming inside. However, when I visited inside it was like I have entered a market. It was so crowded so much crowded smoke on the air, music very loud and I was suddenly lost in the smoky ambiance. 

Complaints: No doubt the concept was new, different designs and excellent carvings made on the floor and on the walls and seats made of tyre but a group of 5 people were forced to sit into a crampy place which was very uncomfortable. The staffs however weren't properly trained and were roaming around tyre patty and felt like very unorganised. I had ordered brain freezer mint hookah. The sheesha was good but I COULD NOT enjoy it because of few reasons. 

They are as under:-

1) Stuffed into Crampy area.
2) A.c. Too chilling. 
3) music too loud perhaps felt like ear bursting out. (And even getting repeated)
4) Could not blow rings due to air swingers.
5) Did not understand this 500 and 1000 rupees charge to enjoy the water on legs? I perhaps would like to suggest that certain amount of cover charges should be made for the same. 
 

Charging 378 inc. taxes for a combo hookah and no proper services being provided is a very big drawback. 

Pros:-

1) location 
2) ambiance
3) hookah
4) prompt service 

Cons:-

1) no feedback facility.
2) staffs crowd the place. 
3) music too loud.
4) Crampy environment. 
5) AC swingers doesn't allow us to smoke rings. 
6) too much noisy and loud music makes it more chaotic. 

Conclusion:-

Maybe it was a bad ending for the day to me. I had heard so much about this place but was very much disappointed with the management.

Tyre patty is a really cool place to chill with friends. I like how the ambiance is set to look like a car garage and they have a good collection of music that they play to keep the mood set. I love the menu that they have: its varied and interesting. I had tried the veg onion and pepper pizza and also the pan-grilled momos with olive oil,garlic and chili flakes. Both were extremely delicious and mouth watering, especially, the momos (i will go back for it soon). Also, the virgin mojito was really refreshing and served decoratively. What i also love about the place is that, the service is really fast and hospitable. It is moderately priced and not too hard on the pocket. I would recommend one to visit :)

Tyre Patty is a fairly popular Cafe that has a nice young vibe to it. It serves Sheesha and hence is quite popular with the younger crowd. I usually rarely go to a Sheesha Cafe as I am not too into it but occasionally do visit when dragged by friends. I sit and sample the food they have their Sheesha ! Tyre Patty has  a special Aqua Zone seating space for an extra charge where you basically sit with your feet in a pool of water under your table while you have your Sheesha and food. No I did not try it but its quite the thing with some of the youngsters. 
I ordered a Virgin Mojito for myself and we ordered Tyre Patty ke Pakore , Cheese Balls, Chinese Salad and Onion Rings. The Mojito was nicely made and I enjoyed it. The food overall was a mixed bag .... I did not much care for the Pakore a little too oily but the Cheese Balls and Chinese Salad were both quite nice as were the Onion Rings. My friends ordered some kind of a Mint  flavored Sheesha that they enjoyed. Overall a good experience with a special mention for the decor.

My favourite hangout in town.. And so will be urs if u visit.. It will never be disappointing.. Have been here uncountable times.. Amazing food.. Commendable service.. Soothing ambience.. U would love this place 4 sure.. Unlike any other place the aqua , bed zone is the thing that will keep attracting you again n again.. They charged 4 aqua zone bt that has been withdrawn now which attracts me more n more.. Pocket pinch is affordable and worth it.. Must visit people !!


A new add to this place !! The menu has been revised and add on breakfast menu where sabji kachori the signature breakfast dish has been added which is excellent very light and good at taste



Crazy new dishes !! Must try 
Italian toast will drive u crazy and patty special pasta is like heaven for pasta lovers m sure the others will love it too !!

My initial opinion of the place was good. You can compare it to various cafés and lounges which serve "shisha". 

The decor of the place is nice. I liked the variety of seating styles. They have a seat where u can dip ur feet in water below and the water is pretty clean as it's running. As the name suggests most seats are made resembling tyres.

The service is better than most joints around the city. The quesadillas, maggi and pastas are very nice. A must try.

The drinks menu is not too elaborate. I've mostly had a red bull, aerated drink or fresh lime sweet. 

Their presentation of dishes are nice. I like that they serve extra forks and Tabasco, oregano and chilli flakes with dishes. Most places you have to ask for either of these.

They serve their food hot esp for a person like me - who loves the food cooked to good temperature.

Happy hours: 9pm onwards on weekdays (10 percent bill discount)

The do not serve non-veg. 

Separate sections for smoking and non-smoking are available.

Per person with hookah: 400/-
Per person without hookah: 300/-

(Approx charges).
Nice location to take your special friend.

One thing that comes to my mind when I think of Tyre Patty......and that is HORRENDOUS place in the heart of the city,,,,
We ordered hookah and few dishes at the onset,,,,,,the waiter told us to shift to the aqua zone,,,,,however not disclosing that there were cover charges,,,,,,so that was the first sham,,,,

Secondly, the water in the aqua zone is absolutely dirty....you will find food dropped in there along with hookah filters and plastic,,,,,,,,absolutely no hygiene,,,,,the water is not auto cleansed,,,,,so carries the germs and infections.....

The food is very over priced and very disappointing,,,,,,,

these ppl tried to innovate with tyres and all as the decor but all in vain..it lacks originality and does not serve quality food,,,,and neither quality hookah,,,,,

HIGHLY AVOID

Kudos to the concept.....the whole joint is made out of factory and garage rejects......They have comfortable sitting arrangements and a different aqua section where you sit with your legs soaked in water just below your table....but then they should arrange for hot water in winters which am not sure whether they do or not, Surprise surprise...water aint free in todays world my friend...For the aqautic section you shell out 1000 which is like a cover charge. Now talking about cover charge...lets go back to what this place is set up to cater...FOOD and Hookah.
  I took a childhood friend who came from mumbai as the looks of the place intrigued me...the first thing which came to my find as i entered was a fish market ...the music was in highest decible...and to converse you have to invent a decible higher than merlin's beard.....the lighting was that of 80's disco....we ordered a tyre patty special hookah which was flat ..then we ordered a cappuccino which was the best we had there....the cheese balls where tight and i dont know where the cheese was....then a patty special phuchka shot which was basically gol gappas and small shots of alchohol flavored liqurice......PATHETIC.....
 To add on to our misery the bill was a wooping 982/-
Full on misery....

One week's time n I have been to this place a couple of times.. Saturday the place was overcrowded n things went hay-way n I completely understand its difficult to manage things in that sort of a crowd.. I guess the management should do sumthing abt it.. Bt I was surprised that the same crowd was adressed quite decently on sunday taken care of almost all the probs I faced on saturday.. Ambience is wowww !! D aqua zone is super duper amazing.. D food qualit is gr8.. I ordered mongolian noodles n it was simply yummm.. Steamed momos also thumbs up.. All in all d food n ny experience in this place is amazing though there r certain service issues m sure with time it shall be taken care of....a must visit.. Wana njoii d place be there on weekdays...

Took me tym to realize hw could they think of cuming up with a place like this.... Nthin out of the world bt ya its 1st tym in kolkata that u get to see a theme lounge where they have a aqua zone, a bed seater to be cumfortble enuf, even couches with simplicity bt extra-ordinary set up... It amazes me !!!! I can't stop writing about the excellent ambience this place has... N since the management is d same kaidi kitchen team I expected a lot in quality of food and service n wowwww to my expectations stood these people... Amazing stuff.. Lot of variety in menu.. Momos , pizzas, special mention about parathas like amritsari kulcha u jus can't miss it.. Nt too gr8 drinks bt ya good enuf.. Overall fantastic, fantabulous experience it was.. Keep up the good work guys..

Went to Tyre Patty for the first time last week and it was a disappointed experience.  We waited for more then 45 mins for a hookah as the hookah man was yet reached as we went early morning but the Cafe was open.. 
Next come to the Drinks part : Order for Virgin Mojito as its my favorite and it was very very disappointed..   
Next Service part : Server had little knowledge on Menu , Many things which were Not available from the menu.
They needs to drastically improve in terms of service. After Ambiance was amazing but Food , servers play a major role in the whole Cafe experience...

I got to the place for the first time with very high expextation after hearing a lot from friends and other sources..
but all I got was disappointment..
I got there two days before around 8.30 a.m , left un attended for 25 mins and then I left..
didnt try the hookah or food so cant say a thing abt that..
please open at the time you are ready to serve...

It is supposedly a great place to hang-out,though after my first visit I failed to see why.
An inchoate mix of tracks,loud volume contributes to a chaotic ambience,and is not what is expected from a place like this.
The interiors are nicely done-they have really used up the place well,the soft lighting complements well the decor. There are certain tables which provide you the enjoyment of dipping your legs in water,which seemed quite insipid to me.
The staff is cheerful and courteous but slow.
Most of the stuff that we ordered was unavailable,it was disappointing to see a cafe unable to serve Irish coffee.The only good thing was the citrus tea-cooler.
Coming to the sheesha,almost 80% of the menu was unavailable;Humpty Dumpty,the one we ended up having was average and as Saurabh pointed out one cannot make rings because of the AC swingers.
Overall,a disheartening experience.

I visited this place after hearing a lot about it. It has created a great hype. However, it was just the hype that was Great.

The seats are very uncomfortable. The layout quite poor. The place seems quite clumsy. The Jacuzzi is just there to create that hype.

The food is the only thing that was alright. We ordered canneloni, crispy babycorn and three beverages. The two dishes tasted fine.

The hookah was not very nice. I am not a hookah regular, but I can say I have had better ones.

The biggest downside was that I had ordered a Cappuccino for myself. It arrived only at the very end and that too after having asked for it four times. I had to literally shout in order to make myself heard. The service was Very Very Poor.

The bill came to about Rs. 450/- per head. I do not understand for what. We hardly had ordered and scooping out the money felt uncomfortable. I am ok spending till the time the food is worth.

All in all, I was not too happy with the experience. There is scope for much improvement.

A good place.worth giving a visit! My frends literally forced me down to have a look at the ambience n giv this place a try..& truly speaking ...i must say that this place has got sumthng new in it..really ...somthng different then we observe in every other place..one cannot thing of sitting in a sofa made of tyres...I so loved it!i specially loved the Aqua zone of the lounge!We had a nice time clicking pictures!
A new concept all together!the food we ordered was1)Tyre patty shots-i love to eat puchka bt not on road side so loved it with 5 types of water.2)Popcorn maskawala-let me tell u it is not just a butter popcorn but it was served in a tortilla with masala popcorn wich was amazing.3)Momos- couldnt get better then dis newhr in kolkata believe me.4)Twist mexicana- i like spicy food so orderd for mexican nd it was worth ordering for it!5) Boom boom shakker-mocktail it was just like cold coffee with some brownie in it! All in all best experience after many days! Hats of to you guys! Kudos

I went to this place within a week of its opening,with the hype we calcuttans generate to any place , i thought it would be interesting to check out this place.But , I was disappointed.. 
The place is too clumsy for a hookah parlour..
After a while its difficult to sit ther.
The chai was bad .. really bad..
Garlic Bread was okay,the size could have been bigger..
Hookah was avg.they dont understand giving a bigger size coal in a small chillam dosnt help..

We left the place in 20 mins..

TYRE PATTY
A New place to hang in kolkata is open at elgin road (Opp Aqua Java), I personally was very excited to go to this place and check it out as the rumors about its new concept were flying about. I visited on 22nd, September (A Sunday) in afternoon. 
Seats were slightly cramped together also the waiters have no idea of the menu items, you have to point the items you want in the menu so they can write it down.
The sheesha was good not great.
Service was slow, Not expected as there are over ten people standing around the guests.
THE FOOD - JUST SHORT OF A DISASTER!!!!!
Ordered 4 ITEMS from the menu 'Garlic Bread ( Under The PATTY SPECIAL Category)' + 'Grilled Toast With garlic Mayo'
+ 'Oreo Crunch' & 'Virgin Mojito'.
1. Garlic Bread - CRAP, No cheese, Pieces of garlic on cold pieces of Bread is NOT GARLIC BREAD GUYS & SERIOUSLY PATTY SPECIAL IS THIS THEN PLEASE I AM SCARED OF THE NORMAL MENU!!!
2. Grilled Toast - "WONT WASTE MY WORDS" DO NOT ORDER AS I TOOK A BITE AND SENT IT AWAY.
3. Oreo Crunch - WOW, Main ingredients which you taste & See are 'Coffee' 'Coconut' 'CORN FLAKES' I mean SERIOUSLY????!!!!!
4. Virgin "A JOKE" Mojito - Note To Type Patty "Please Look Up The Recipe On Google" Will help You A Lot!!
ALL IN ALL I WASTED 1000 Bucks in 20 Mins!
Go At You Own Risk, Enjoy the "Sheesha & The UpBeat Music" But Avoid The Bites!

The place looks fabulous with the perfect ambience but the service is pathetically slow because of which I had to go away without eating anything. I had ordered a dish and was waiting for it when after 20 minutes the waiter comes and tells me that my order would take more 10 minutes. So thumbs up for the ambience and the setting overall but for service - (n)
