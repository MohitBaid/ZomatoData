One of oldest Chinese restaurant in howrah. I used to visit since 2000 when I was 8. After one and half year today I have visited for take away food. I have ordered 2 chilly chicken, one sanghai fish , two fried rice and paratha.

According to taste chilly chicken and sanghai fish was too good. Fried rice was average. Taste of chilly same as before.

I've been eating here since I was approx 10 years old and the food quality remains awesome and delicious to this very day. Whenever I return home from college the first thing I do is to call this restaurant for dinner. 

Never fails me to surprise with their Chinese delight... 

Thank You, Shyamal uncle.

I have been to this restaurant a few years ago and their food is pretty good given the price range. All I can remember is that we had ordered for Mixed Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken and Lemon Chicken. The chilli chicken was great. It was spicy as it should be. A good place for dining. 
Happy Fooding ‚ô•

Firstly of all I would like to include that they have renovated the restaurant. It is looking much better now than before and they have made the full restaurant AC so thats a plus.
Now back to FOOD. I liked it but there were issues. I had ordered Dry Chilli Chicken to start with then Majestic Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Fish.
The Dry Chilli Chicken was just amazing. I LOVED IT.
The Chilli Fish was ok ok... Not good not the worse.
But the blow was the Majestic Special Fried Rice. God!! üò∞ to be very honest I had it before but yesterday it was horrible. No seasoning, the rice was over cooked, the prawns and chicken was not well-fried and there were merely any mushrooms(i ordered because I wanted to have mushrooms, but üòû). It was shocking... I seriously wanted to ask the chef if he is allergic to salt! Bad experience... May be because of the rush of puja but we as customers deserve beter when paying Rs. 180 for one plate.

I don't know if anyone over here knows this place better than me.. I have been visiting this place since 2002. I just had today's dinner out there and it's too good. If you are in Howrah and crave for Chinese, this is where you should come. I didn't leave any items from their menu card and I recommend the Chinese items to be ordered. The decoration is calm and sober. Behaviour of the staffs are very friendly and they serve way faster than any other Chinese restaurant. I love their food and I have an emotional corner for them. Happy eating :)

A great multi-cusine restaurant, their Mixed Noodles and Shanghai chicken was awesome. The Chinese delicacies are particularly good and it's very reasonable too.

One of the oldest and finest resturant of Howrah (Ramtala), Mostly I love the Chinese cuisine of Majestic. Pocket friendly resturant. Well decorated too. But I would like to suggest them to increase their food quantity. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
