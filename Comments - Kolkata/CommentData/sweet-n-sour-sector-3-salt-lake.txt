Nice food. Very good ambiemce. Very helpful butlers made our day. Exactly opposite to the Salt lake stadium this is very cosy and comfy place to crash. Quick delivery helped out cause. I'd recommend all people to go here.

Went there on 27/09/17 for dinner with some friends.
We ordered-
Chicken clear soup, chicken tangri kebab,veg fried rice and hong kong chicken.
The soup was nice.. didn't try the kebab,but my friend said it's average. The rice and chicken item was good. The quantity was generous. Pocket pinch reasonable.

After being regular customers for several years, they screwed up on one order. When we kindly told them that there has been a mix up and it isn't exactly what we ordered, the delivery person started behaving rashly and showed very terrible Attiude. They tried their best to pin the mistake on us, but when they realised it wouldn't work he took it back and got it back after a few mins just draining the gravy out. Even then he showed an attitude as if he was donating food to me. A chaiwala in the street does better customer service than them. The prices are also outrageous. I'd really suggest you avoid this and use other options.

I sincerely wish Zomato allowed negative ratings. Was on a business trip to Kol recently, stayed in Coral Residency (an OYO hotel) and was given their menu by the hotel in order for me to avail food delivery service. Ordered Golda Chingri Malaikari and White Pulao. To my surprise when the delivery guy knocked on my door, he handed me a bill of Rs. 700+ amount. On checking the bill I found out that they included a Chicken 65 along with my order and on letting the delivery guy know that it was a mistake on their part he was adament that I pay the entire amount. After some heated arguement with the guy, he agreed to take the Chicken 65 back but insisted that I pay the VAT (for something which was not ordered or consumed by me). I finally ended up paying the VAT as I was sick of arguing with the guy. To add to my agony, the Golda Chigri was not at all edible and smelled nothing more than cow shit. I ended up eating a bit of gravy and pulao that night. Friends, if you wish to hear the rudest person on the phone taking the orders, do call the resturant and you would certainly remember what you read here. My view - BEWARE OF THIS RESTAURANT. There are millions of better options available in Salt Lake Sect. 3

This rating is only for one food, that is prawn Hakka chow. It's pretty decent at RS 220. Bengali foods, reshmi kabab, fish fry, other Chinese foods are quite bad. It was not. They had good kabab, fish fry once upon a time. I don't know what happened.

This place is definitely not a 2.5 as it shows right now. I would have given it a 4 for the taste, but with the price point, its clearly a 4.5. I ordered Dhokar Dalna, Navratan Korma and Paneer Kopta and they were all made really well. Initially I felt the sweetness in the Navratam Korma is a bit too much but eventually the taste synched in well along with the Tawa Roti. Didnt enjoy the Rotis much, but maybe thats probably because of it being delivered - still an improvement point. Food was delivered in 40 minutes on a Thursday night which was good. Their thalis are quite good too - some relatives ordered it the other day and couldn't finish. Â If you're in Salt Late, worth a try. Awesome VFM.

We visited this place for a family dinner and had ordered tandoori rotis, chicken bharta and chicken reshmi butter masala. 
The tandoori rotis could have been more soft rather than burnt. 
The chicken bharta didnt quite taste like one, it tasted more of a chicken masala. 
The chicken reshmi butter masala was good. 
An okay-ish place.

I like their chinese dishes, the Indian dishes not that much. Mainly famous for their snacks, but I would say it's better to have the noodles/fried rice and chilli chicken compared to their chinese starters. The rolls here are pretty good though, could be worthy of a try.

I would like to rate it in negative, but zomato won't allow me to do so.
I have never been there, but, i had their food on home delivery options, i had their food in a lot occasions.
Most of the time i had veg bengali dishes. On those days, i would rate them avg.
But recently I had their mutton curry twice. Yaacks!!  First time:  the mutton was very hard, the pieces where not how a mutton pieces supposed to be. They offer 4 pieces of mutton(??), but among them two of the pieces are just bones, nothing else. The gravy was blackish, the potato piece was not at all freash.. even I think the whole dish was not freash.

If the order was placed by me, it would be the last one. But as the order was placed by one of my close relative, i had to experince them another time.
Second: This time, again no actual mutton piece, or I can say you can't find the meat from that "mutton". This time the whole gravy was sour, may be they have to keep their name!!. The potato was extremely sour.. and again whatever meat you can get from mutton they were rock hard.

First time i thought that it may happen for one time, but twice?? Guys don't order your food from here, at least non veg items.

The only thing they delivered us right was peas polao. Earlier they made some good quality Shukto and Dhoka, but this time dhoka was again a disappointment.

I would tell all my known who lives in salt lake to avoid this place. It's a waste of money, and

It is a horrible restaurant..me & my family have been a regular customer of this restaurant for almost 15 years..we regularly use their home delivery & take away services..went there a few days ago for takeaway & they behaved horribly..we were asking if we could sit inside as the weather was very hot outside & also there were too many mosquitoes..but they did not even felt the need to respond..they behave as if they are giving the food for free..forget about customer friendliness or staff behaviour,they dont even treat their customers as human beings inspite of knowing us so well..so I cant even imagine how they treat those customers who are not regular..they deserve -ve rating but there is no option so I am forced to give them 1..being a regular customer this kind of behaviour was not at all expected..

One of the most horrible experience ever
We ordered food over phone...after our good food experiences.The delivery man came nd without giving us the bill orally told us the amount as 975 and we having a gud past experience with them paid the amount to him.After some time we suddenly realised that how come only three items that we ordered billed so high.Upon confirmation we realised the amount is only 575 .When we called them to say about this mistake instead of being courteous they behaved horribly and in a very disgusting manner.They run because of their customers nd now they are behaving like roadside slum guys...most awful experience ever.

I have been a lifelong eater from this restaurant since I was 8, (and now 18). So basically I have tasted the change whenever it happened. The fried rice is good,  they're famous for their Bangali Food,  but what most of the people doesn't know is that they are specialized in their own dish MURGA PULAV. If you get a chance,  do give a chance to this rice item which can be eaten solo and I'm sure you'll fall in love with the dish.

Dropped in here for lunch this afternoon. I was not in a mood to try spicy and rich dishes and it was the only decent resto in the area which served bengali cuisine.
The restaurant was empty when i entered so i was having second thoughts about visiting it but decided to dine anyway.
Ordered the chicken thali. It was really good.
The thali included cholar daal, aloo posto, aloo bhaja, chicken and chatni.
All the dishes tasted fine and fresh.
The service was average and the price was very reasonable.

We took a takeaway lunch of a veg thali and paneer kopta of Bengali items that was delivered to our home efficiently. The thali included white rice with gondhoraj lebu to flavour the yellow bhaja moong er dal, crisp aloo bhaja, labra, chhanar dalna, potoler dalna and mango chutney. The potol preparation, aloo bhaja and paneer kopta along with chhanar dalna were good. Rest of the items were average tasting. For a Bengali meal of regular items, this place can be an option but food quality or taste akin to five star Bengali restaurants should not be expected.

If you want decent Indianised chinese which doesnt burn a hole in your pocket then this is the place to go to. They deliver food within Salt Lake and also give a 15% discount for regular customers. Chicken noodles and chilli chicken are great. But don't try the fancy items, they aren't that goodÂ

For vegetarians beware as they send non-veg in the name of veg food. So if you order paneer they may send chicken which happened to me. And whether its meat of chicken or some other bird is doubtful. Quality of food is awful. They misplace order and only after tasting you know the truth.

Happens to be one of the first Chinese restaurants of Salt Lake City and obviously it feels really good to have the food from this place, after ages.
The quantity and pricing of the food at this tiny restaurant go hand in hand and the staff are very courteous too.
The egg Hakka noodles,Kung Pao Chicken,Chicken Manchurian,Mein Foo are worth a try over here.
If you are a real hungry buff,then this place will serve you right.

It is just that an old restaurant like Sweet and Sour hasn't done much in the recent years,that makes me sad.Definitely if you're running a restaurant for so long,you'll think about expanding it and making it go up the food chain.
Nevertheless the quality of food over here is really good.If you have a small gathering at your place,you can opt for their food.The interiors don't have much to speak off either. So its food and food and food here only......

Its very fresh in my mind the times I used to stay in Saltlake maybe 10 to 15 years back this was probably the first family restaurant catering food for people living around sector 3  in those lifeless days when we literally needed to hunt for food , thanks to Sweet n sour which came into rescue with its Indian and Chinese options for one and all , now coming to the prices I have to say over the years it kept a stable price and maintained quality  but of now it's emerging to be a bit expensive and the quality has also dropped over the time , as it used to be a hit in Saltlake area and this was a regular point for people like us often trying the home delivery option as well as going and packing from the counter or simply eating with the limited tables available .

Located near the IA block the restaurant looks very ordinary. The prices are very pocket friendly though the overall feel of the restaurant is not very appealing.. One waiter was managing the entire restaurant and which I find really odd.. Though my friend told me they also home deliver so based on the quality of food I fell home delivery is a much better option.. So people living near that sector can home deliver from this restaurant  to have a feel of their food.

This is a place from where my family has been availing the home delivery since eternity. Funnily enough, I've grown up having the fried rice and a side dish on every alternate event which demanded a little feast at home.

â˜… LOCATION : Although I've never entered the dine-in, this outlet is right opposite Stadium Gate #1 i.e. at a walking distance from the stadium island.

â˜… FOOD + PRICES : Sweet n Sour makes some decent fare at extremely reasonable prices. Their low prices for pretty good food has always been their plus point.
Of late, the quality has been degrading for sometime. The fried rice had become really oily and the chilly chicken pieces really hard the last time I had my meals ordered. On the other hand, the rolls available at the counter outside are delicious.

A plus point, the prices have been maintained consistently on the lower edge.

Home delivery is swift and dependable. A good joint for little family celebrations. :)

No speciality about the ambience. Food is not bad. Crispy chicken is a good choice here. Prawn in mixed fried rice smells a bit. Chicken in the chilli chicken are too hard to bite.

The Bengali food menu is really good with completely home cooked food! You won't be able to tell that it's from a restaurant! No extra spice n oil. Have tried only the veg dishes now- dhokar dalna and lau but plan to order more soon :) 
If you don't wanna cook at home this is a great alternative :)

A good place to try cheap and good quality food. I have been to the place just a couple of times but since my office used to be nearby, we ordered a lot from here.

The place is good enough for having a nice meal and since the place is air conditioned, it feels comfortable. The food is quite good for the cost they charge that's the best part about them.

This is our friendly neighbourhood takeaway. The food is pretty decent and they have a wide variety. We have mainly ordered Chinese cuisine and appetisers  like fish fingers but their bengali fare is great on a day that you might not feel like cooking at home.

I usually get food delivered from here. It usually is pretty decent. It's prosperity lies in the fact that options are pretty limited when it comes to food getting delivered in and around Salt Lake. 
This particular unfortunate evening saw me going to the restuarant for Momo and starters. 
The ambience is pretty shabby and distasteful. The waiter didn't have any uniform on. The cutlery was also unclean. However, all of that was still manageable. I ordered a plate of Momo and decided to order the rest of my meal later. 
The momo came at a reasonable time. It was hot and the soup was also good. I went through my first piece and then the second. On the third piece however I was greeted by an unfortunate cockroach. The poor thing had given up it's life in a plea to meet me. It lied trapped in chicken and onion. 
I kept money on the table and fled to mourn it's death.

This place is a saviour for me and my colleagues. The food is tasty, the portions are filling, the prices are reasonable and the delivery is prompt. The rice thalis very happily satisfies our afternoon home food cravings while the chicken pulaoÂ at the price it comes in is extremely well done. What amazes me is that theÂ biriyani comes with 2 big chicken legs, which is a first Â have seen in this city. i encourage the people around to try the place. the staff may sound a little off when you make the calls, but they mean well. They just are very busy serving customers. Give it a try :)

If hair found in the sweet and sour chicken is not enough to put you off your food, then a cockroach being found in the tadka served to the neighbouring table should be.

This place is located opposite salt lake stadium gate number 2, and is a good option for dining in with family or friends . The space inside is small , and the lighting is dim , which gives it a very cosy ambience . This place is more popular for home delivery , and the service is a saviour to a lot of residents in the area. The biryani is not great , so I'd suggest the Chinese options instead , such as fried rice and sweet n sour chicken etc. They also have a roll counter right  outside  , where you get momos and rolls on the go ! The egg chicken roll here is not bad and worth a try ! However, they have awesome bengali food here, which includes everything from fish to chhanar dalna. So if you don't feel like cooking and yet are craving for some good ol' bangali maachh bhaat , this is the place for you .

Sweet and Sour is one of the oldest restaurants in this area and has served food to almost every household in the area. I remember going to a friend's place nearby and ordering food from the restaurant. the fried rice and the chicken sweet corn soup is something i liked a lot. the consistency of the taste differs at times and there have been times we regretted our decision to order food from here. the price is a bit on the higher side for such a restaurant but then if you are running a restaurant in one of the posh localities your prices are bound to be a bit on the higher side.

It is an utter disgusting place for having something or takeaway.today we went and ordered for chicken roll and to our utter surprise they gave aroma king lemon(in bengali known as gondhoraj lebu) instead of lemon due to which the taste was awefully bad.when asked they said there was no lemon in the stock.normally good restaurants replaces your order or doesnot include in your bill but that was out of question here.we paid d bills but couldnot have a bit of it.overall pathetic experience

Sorry zomato but i was disappointed with your recommendation last night. The place might be good for take away or home delivery but it is certainly not recommended for dining in. And yes their packaging is good. The place is small but then that is not wanted so much. Starters were good. We ordered fish fry, fried chicken n tangri kabab. Satisfactory is the word to describe the experience. But the fish fry was somewhat lacking in taste. We liked the fried chicken. My friend ordered mixed fried rice and garlic chicken.the rice was good but the chicken was full of tomato sauce and chewy. We were greatly disappointed with the rumali roti which turned hard in no time. The worst part was the behaviour of the waiter. He was the lone server there and seemed to be tired. But he was more interested in making us finish our meal fast. So no points for service. Further,i found it to be overpriced. I would request zomato to kindly update the menu because otherwise foodies will be misled

very conveniently located near saltlake stadium, this restaurant is pretty old in salt lake. serves both tandoori and chinese foods. also does catering service for various occasions. we ordered tandoori chicken and chicken reshmi kabab. chicken reshmi kabab came in 6 big pieces. tasted ok. what disappointed me is the chicken tandoori. came with 4 pieces, but the pieces were small and not grilled well. the spices were not that tasty and the overall taste was a bit bland. if you want good food in that area, there are far better options around it within a radius of 1km.

Known for their home delivery repertoire, especially lunch "thaalis/meals" which are a complete feast in themselves, especially on festival days. Food is specifically in line with Bengali taste, but for a-la-carte they are ready to make an exception to suit your requirements. The number one in home-delivery in Salt Lake, specially in Sector III, this outlet is located bang opposite Bengal Tennis Association (BTA) and Salt Lake Stadium Gate Number 2. The place is also good for dine in and take-away. Quality is good and while it is oily, ingredients are not compromised in freshness. A meal for two, including non-veg (chicken/fish) and a 600ml soft-drink would come at around INR450, all inclusive. What is also exciting are their filling and sumptuous thalis/meals starting as low as â‚¹110 for veg and â‚¹150 for fish.

Bang for the buck. Worth trying on a day you feel equally disinclined to cook and go out for a meal.

This restaurant is near stadium island , Salt Lake and beside the petrol pump station. When we two entered into this  , we saw lots of Krishna picture on the wall. We want to grab our food as soon as possible as we were both very hungry. We ordered two plates of Chicken Biriyani. Amount was good and it had two chicken leg pieces , one egg piece and half potato slice. Taste was not bad , you may not get "Arsalan" quality but its decent.  We paid atlast 320 bucks with tax. This restaurant also serves wide range of dishes including Bengali foods. They also take up party orders. As a whole not a bad experience , you can try for once

There is a certain charm in sitting outside in the cold, enjoying a cup of coffee and a piping hot chicken roll. This place is great if you dont want to sit inside, rather would like to hang out with friends, sipping cups of coffee from an old-fashioned espresso machine, dusted with chocolate powder on top, and a well-made roll or a plate of chicken pakora or paneer pakora. I also don't mind their version of the chicken tandoori and reshmi kababs, which I have packed home a couple of times, and both times they were pretty well. However, not much of a fan of their Chinese segment.

Home delivery bengali food, nobody can beat S&S in Salt Lake. Excellent quality, superbly cooked to perfection. A bit overspiced and oily (not suitable for everyday dining), but, for a gala feast, they are the one. Their fish fry (Diamond fry) and, paneer pakoda are also great. They do a very nice and cute packing of your meal thali, very hygenic style, loved that.

They are the most reliable restaurant in Salt Lake for Home delivery. The main attraction is the range of combo-meals they have. The Bengali food is awesome. Chinese is very light and tastes heavenly. Another dish worth trying is their Biryani. A definite place to eat or order food from.

I have been to this place many time during my college days. At that time it used to be very cheap. But now the prices have become dearer and the quality is the same. The restaurant has raised the prices akin to any other Food Chain Joints in Kolkata. The dinning area is a bit compact than other good places and I hate this thing the most. When we are out for food, we want to relax and enjoy the food. But the place is very well lit i.e. the light is dim and doesn't put stress on your eyes. Comparing food in terms of freshness, flavour and aroma, it is just so-so. 

But when you consider any other restaurant in this locality, it is the best choice you have. 
Considering the food, ambience, service and locality I can only give a rating of 2.5.

This is one of those places I've only had deliveries ordered from. So many times have we ordered from here that I really can't give it a bad rating. :-)
The Indian cuisine is much better than the Chinese here, but we've ordered both with equal frequency. The prices are pretty reasonable, and the amounts are very filling too.

Had  a sudden visit to this place on this Sunday. It was a bit difficult to find the place. looks Nothing Special from the outside. But the Interior is certainly good although not too specious.
They have a large variety of dishes in the menu.We had chicken polao and chicken reshmi masala. Both the dishes were really mouth watering. Specially the reshmi masala was heavenly mouth melting. Just enjoyed the food. 
Service was just perfect and the staffs were well behaved and really good to customers. Last of all the pocket pinch was not high which is really a great part of any restro. It is very nice to have such a good food in a low budget. Hope to visit again.
