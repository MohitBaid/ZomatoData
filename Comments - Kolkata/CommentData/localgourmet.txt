I had a tenderloin burger at this joint. This is possibly the best burger I have ever had in Kolkata. Just the patty blew my mind away. Thanks to Chef Atreei and her uncompromising standards for meat gave my pallette a delicious wonderful surprise. I can say for sure there aren't many places in Kolkata that can guarantee such a quality of meat and especially for a small upcoming joint such as this.
As this place is currently just a cloud-only restaurant, you can only order from it online. For Salt Lake localites, this is a must-order place and I can assure you won't be disappointed.
To the restaurant team, I wish you all the luck in your future endeavors and expansions.
I will definitely recommend this and visit myself as frequently as I can. Can't wait to have more of your food.

P.S. The curly fries served with burger are also quite innovative and interesting.

A friends cloud kitchen. Got a first hand experience of the tenderloin burger. It is to die for. One of the very few places in kolkata that actually serves amazing beef. Recommended. Oh and look out for dishes with mashed potatoes, you won't regret ordering any dish just for that.

The best continental cuisine in the city. Mouthwatering barbecues and out of the box menus. The deserts too are to die for.
Had ordered for a company event and each and every dish was extremely delicious.

Great for beef burgers and pork burgers! Crispy, crunchy fries are also excellent. The BBQ Pork is also a personal favourite..

Everything on the menu is a class in itself. Never imagined getting world class gourmet food being delivered locally..

Moreover, over my last few reviews, I have maintained that packaging goes to your heart even before the food goes to your belly and they have nailed it.. right from the moment you see the packaging, you want it in the belly.. It further helps that the food is out of this world..

In a nutshell, this is the place to get some of the best burgers in the city of joy..
