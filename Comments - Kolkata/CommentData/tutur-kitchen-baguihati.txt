Located on the service road while you are approaching towards Baguihati from Kaikhali side. A very small place with just 2-3 tables, not properly maintained. We placed an order for a mixed gravy noodles and that took around 35 minutes to get served even though there was no other customer present at that time. However, the noodles was ok if not very good, cost is within reach, and they do the home delivery as well.

We live near by and frequent visitor as its price is moderate but nowadays food quality is Detroit and service is not at par. Delayed in table delivery as well as home delivery too.

We would request them to maintain the quality of food as before..when they have started the Restrorent...

When all kitchens are sleeping make sure that tutur kitchen is still awake. Foods are fresh tasty and hygienic... It's also pocket friendly... It's a road side open outlets... It's good.. Try chicken lollypops......

Please don't go by the ambience...as tutur is not a high profile restaurant, nor does it claim to be one. It's a sweet little eat out which offers you good food at a very affordable price.
