Excellent range of eggless pastries. I would highly recommend their black forest pastry, pyramid and apple dry cake. This place is truly a heaven for all those people who have a sweet tooth. So next time when you long for some yummy deserts this is the place to be.

Situated in the heart of Loudon Street right next to Wokaholic is a small cafe cum patisserie named Bake o Cake. As soon as you enter you'll be welcomed by a very clean and welcoming and mostly painted white cafe. There is a kitchen on the left and an array of delectable desserts on display at the counter. The hospitality I received at this place was extremely nice and I would like to thank Mr Rizwan for this. Now lets talk about the food. Bake o Cake specializes in French desserts as well as a vast selection of pastas(like the very elusive in Kolkata, Ravioli, which is also their bestseller), pizzas, freshly made breads, as well as both hot and cold beverages. They serve only vegetarian food and desserts, but they do use egg in certain desserts. Let me tell you about what I tasted which only consisted of desserts but I am a dessert person anyway so it was heaven for me. 1. Gluten Free Black Forest Pastry- While normally, I'd be turned away by the idea of gluten free food as that is reserved for health freaks which I am not, I did give this pastry a shot and was blown away. Completely devoid of flour(but with the use of egg in the meringue) they have whipped up quite literally magic as it was definitely one of the best pastries I have had ever. The no flour chocolate sponge and infused morello cherry were an amazing combo and I would definitely recommend this to one and all. 
2. Red Velvet Pastry- We are all used to loving this variant of pastry. What made this red velvet pastry stand out is that  it was heated before serving so the insides were soft and made it even more delicious. The Philadephia Cream Cheese frosting complemented the dish perfectly and there is nothing I can fault with this.3. Chocolate Pyramid- As an ardent lover of chocolate, it is hardly surprising that I was excited by this one. Another case in which heating the pastry prior to serving did wonders for it, the molten insides with hidden walnuts and soft sponge made for an incredible dessert. One can never get tired of this one and this will always remain a crowd pleaser.4. Blueberry Cheesecake- With a lot of sweetness on my palate, there was much need of relief. It came in the form of Blueberry Cheesecake. The blueberry compote on top of the cheesecake was bitter and perfect in calming my taste buds down. Soft and melt in the mouth, this was truly cheesecake heaven.5. Chocolate Macaron- Chewy meringue and soft chocolate ganache filling, this was delicious, though biting into the Macaron made a bit of a mess as the meringue cracked into several small pieces. 6. Chocolate dipped almonds- Need I say something about this? You all can obviously imagine how it looks and tastes. Unfortunately, this is all I could taste and my stomach could hold no more. Bake o Cake is also known for serving the original Philadephia Cheesecake which I plan to try on my next visit here. Drop in to Bake o Cake anytime to taste the above and more. I have also attached photos of various cakes they have on offer. You will be able to see the Profiteroles Pyramid, Belgian Chocolate Cake(Eggless), Chocolate Cream Anglaise  Cake, a full Red Velvet Cake, and a customized by a customer Strawberry cake. Order from Bake o Cake today. They deliver to your home and make customized cakes for particular occasions.

It is a gorgeous little cafe outside La Martiniere. The entire interior has a white elegant theme with comfortable chairs and sofas.

I first ordered the Chocolate Pyramind and it just melts when you take a bite. The Macarons were very appealing so tried one too and it was the perfect blend of sweetness of the dish abd bitter chocolate. 
Even the CTC Sandwich was very tasty and the service was fast as well.
It is a little on the expensive side for an everyday bakery but worth it.

Had an amazing time and it made my day.

Tasting Session On Inauguration Day @ Bake O Cake, Loudon Street, Kolkata ☺

Date of Inauguration: 26 Aug 2017

Situated in Loudon Street, right below Little Pleasures, occupying a rectangular area of around 600 sq. feet, Bake O Cake is a 20 seater cafe cum bakery cum confectionery, well equipped to dole out delectable desserts, fresh out of the oven breads, popular multi cuisine savouries and an assortment of both hot and cold beverages.

Wherein Bake O Cake's other two outlets are pure veg, the current one being designed on the lines of a French patisserie, uses eggs, but not meat.

Mostly hued in white, the entire interior of the eatery is designed on two parallel lines. The moment you enter, on the left you will see - the see through kitchen, followed by the food display counters, ending with an enclosed cabin. While on your right, you will see the array of seating arrangements, followed by the enclosed loo.

Seating arrangement comprises of - white hued, sturdy and comfortable sofas and chairs and white, rectangular, fibreglass tables. Ceilings and walls are also hued in white. The wall on the side of the seating arrangement is textured. A couple of beautiful small chandeliers hang from the ceiling. An LED television adorns the small wall facing the main door. Music plays in the background.

A assortment of items were presented for tasting at Bake O Cake and almost an equal number of items were gift packed for tasting at home. 

The items presented for tasting at Bake O Cake were -

- Wecome Drink -

- Blue Hawaiian (Rs. 110/-): It was a beautiful mocktail serving, wherein a gradient of blue liquid at the base, infused with a canned red cherry, gave way to bubbling transparent liquid, garnished with some greens on the surface and a lime roundel inserted at the glass rim.

Made of blue curacao, litchi syrup and soda, this mocktail looked quite beautiful and tasted nice.

- Breads & Savouries -

- Garlic Bread : Neatly placed on an asymmetrical stone tray, this snack item was constantly making rounds on all the tables. 

The breads were toasted on grill and tasted average. 

Pleaae note that, it is not a separate item on the menu, but is served as an accompaniment with few savoury main course dishes. However, the menu comprises of the food option - Cheese Garlic Bread.

- Penna Al Arabbiata (Rs. 230/-): Accompanied with a slice of Cheese Garlic Bread, a moderate mound of red sauce pasta, garnished with enough grated cheese, was served in a wide rimmed white ceramic plate.

It was well cooked and tasted good.

- Red Curry (Rs. 275/-): Two white ceramic wide rimmed dishes were served, with one carrying steamed Lemon Rice and the other carrying the popular Thai Red Curry comprising of - red curry paste, seasonal vegetables and coconut milk.

The dish tasted average.

- Pizza Focaccia (Rs. 310/-): A thick wooden dish comprising of well cut and relatively big pizza slices, decorated with some lettuce leaves on the top were in circulation on every table. 

I got my share of pizza slice as well, which comprised of caramelized onion, black olive, rosemary, bell pepper, garlic and sundried tomato.

The pizza was crisp and fresh, contained good quality crunchy veggies and tasted excellent.

- Desserts -

- Flourless Black Forest (Gluten Free) (Rs. 110/-): It was a rectangular slab of flour chocolate sponge, topped with a thin chocolate slab, pastry cream and morello sour cherry.

It tasted excellent. 

- Philadelphia Cheese Cake (Rs. 130/-): Made of Philadelphia Cheese with vanilla pod flavor, this rectangular soft dessert came topped with parallel placed droplets of cream cheese.

It was soft, dense and tasted excellent.

- Honey Almond Croissant (Rs. 110/-): A Croissant is a crescent shaped puff pastry made of layered yeast levened dough.

Herein, the Croissant was stuffed with sweet almond paste and glazed with honey. 

With a distinct taste of thick almond paste, this savoury cum dessert was quite filling and tasted good.

The items packed for tasting at home were -

- Choux Bun Pyramid (Rs. 70/-): It was designed on the lines of Religieuse, which is made of two choux pastry cases filled with crème pâtissière, covered in a ganache of the same flavor as the filling, and then joined with piped whipped cream.

But herein, joining of both choux pastry cases was done with a chocolate disc and not whipped cream.

It tasted soft, spongy and excellent.

- Assorted Macarons (Rs. 90/-): Packed in beautiful shades pink, green and white, Macarons were meringue and almond based cookies with buttercream sandwiched between two cookies.

The cookies were freshly baked and crunchy. The sandwiched cream was fresh, melt in the mouth and quite balanced and tasty in composition.

They were the best Macarons that I had tasted till date.

- Mixed Berry Tunnel (Rs. 90/-): It was a rectangular puff pastry, topped with Crème anglaise, fresh berries and other citrus fruits.

It tasted good.

- Almond Apple Tart (Rs. 110/-): It wa a pâte sablée almond tart, garnished with thin slices of a fresh apple.

It tasted moist and nice and I paired it with my flavorsome cup of Rose Oolong Tea. The match seemed made in heaven!

- Almond Biscotti (Pack of 4) (Rs. 100/-): It was a pack of 4 long and roughly semi-hemisphere shaped crunchy biscotti, infused with enough almonds and herbs.

They were quite well baked, comprised of good quality almonds and tasted good.

All in all, it was an extensive tasting session, both at the outlet and at home, wherein, clearly the heroes were the French delicacy desserts.

If Bake O Cake can maintain the same degree of freshness, quality and taste in it's desserts, within a short time, it has the potential to become one of the top five confectioneries of Kolkata!

They also serve individual items and platters for breakfast.

Timing: 7 am - 11 pm
