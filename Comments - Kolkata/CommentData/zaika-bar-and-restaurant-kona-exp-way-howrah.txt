With reasonable price this is a good place to have family dinner.. Mixed Fried Rice here is really love. Decor moderate , Parking available , service is fine , ambience is ok too.

Once upon a time zaika was the best restaurant of Howrah. I went there more than 10 times. But day by day their food quality and quantity both decreasing and prices increasing a lot!
Their biriyani is not so good as they charged ‚Çπ200 per plate.
.In recent puja times I ordered 2 plates chi fried rice, 1 chi.biriyani , 1chilli chicken ,1 gerlic chicken. The bill was around 1100! Can u belive it? Now days they charged like as Arsalan or aminia.. upon that instead of chilli chicken in percale pack, they gave gerlic chicken... And quality of fried rice is nowdays very low compare to 2-3years previous zaika..
So, my advice to new visitors plz DNT order fried rice or any of rice items here. U can order rotis.
Still Im giving them 3/5 stars just becz of I'm an old customer and still this the best restaurant on Kona exp way around santragachi- nabanna area.
550 for 2 people (approx)
I suggest" zaika restaurant" to either decrease your prices or increase your food quality.

Been open for many years but over the years service and food quality has worsened. They used to serve a nice biryani plate and a delicious special chicken masala, but now this place is worthy of rare visits only.

The food quality has worsen and hiked the price. Yesterday I had a office party so ordered veg fried rice and chilly chicken. Chicken was very hard, not tender and juicy at all. The rice of the fried rice was not cooked at all. In short, the quality has deteriorated very badly. I'll suggest not to go to this restaurant. Total wastage of money.

It is very avarage restaurant. Slightly over priced but inside atmosphere and behaviour of staff is good. It is famous one due to its position just 1 km away of vidyasagar setu near belepole.

Food is decent, infact few dishes are tasty...but prices are little high...also services and cleanliness can be improved. Overall good experience.
