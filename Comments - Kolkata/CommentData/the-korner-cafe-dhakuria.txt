Please avoid this place. We went to this place to have some snacks. They have an open kitchen. I saw two men pouring mayonnaise in the dispenser and scraping the leftover mayonnaise from their bare hand in the dispenser itself. It looked mind numbingly disgusting. When I asked him if this is  right or hygienic what they are doing, the person in charge simply siad he has washed his hands. On saying that he should use a glove, he started arguing and was very rude. We cancelled our order and left, the person in charge reacted by showing a very wrong attitude and asked the cook to cancel our order. Never going there again and definitely not recommended.

I found this cute little eatery quite by accident and it's the BEST I have come across in a long while.The interiors are clean and quite spacious and well decorated,the place will immediately give you a good vibe.And....they provide such good food at unbelievably low prices.I got to have this onion and cheese pizza at only Rs 50.And they baked it right in front of me.The quality was really really good.The burgers too are great.I dont know why this place has such low footfall.

Going to a restaurant is one of my keenest pleasures. Meeting someplace with old and new friends, ordering beverages, eating food, surrounded by strangers, I think is the core of what it means to live a civilised life.
Cum and have good food and beverage with ur frnds and family at The Korner Cafe...üòçüòò‚òï

A great restaurant is one that just makes you feel like you're not sure whether you went out or you came home and confuses you. If it can do both of those things at the same time, you're hooked.
So cum and get hooked at The Korner Cafe...üòçüòò‚òï

New Veg Caf√© near my house. Thought of trying it out someday and finally went there. It is located just at Dhakuria,panchanontola bus stand, opposite to the Panasonic showroom. The place is nice, but small. Service was good. Quantity and quality of food is great. We ordered a Veg aloo tikka burger, white sauce pasta and Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. The Brownie was excellent ‚ù§Ô∏è The prices are also reasonable &  they don't charge taxes.
