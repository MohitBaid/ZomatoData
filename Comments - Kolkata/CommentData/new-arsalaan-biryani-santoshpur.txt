ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹I'm Rating This Place New Arsalan Biryani, Santoshpur 5.0 Because I Have Visited Them Atleast More Than 10 Times In A Month. From October - November 2017. And On 20th November 2017 After Watching WWE Survivor Series Where Raw And SmackDown Go Head To Head With Each Other And At Last When The Survivor Series Was Over The Final Score Was Team Raw 4 And Team SmackDown 3. So  Raw Prove That Their Show Is The Longest Running Television Show In WWE History Within 25 Years. Since 1993 - 2018. On TEN 1 HD & TEN 1 5:30am Live From Houston, TX And Repeat 6:00pm. After My School Was Over At 3:30pm I Came To New Arsalan Biryani, Santoshpur To Have My Dinner. I Ordered 1 Alu Biryani For Rs. 55/- Which Was Less Oily And Great To Taste It And 1 Chicken Chanp For Rs. 45/- Which Was Very Oily And Tasty To Eat With Biryani Within Rs. 100/- I Was Full And Done. I Paid Rs. 500/- And The Waiter Returned Me Rs. 400/- I Enjoyed Myself A Lot. Thank you New Arsalan Biryani For Making My Day Stunning.ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

A typical tasty Dalda based biryani place in town which many junk food consumers would find it delicious but sorry to not healthy at all.Not a place recommended if you plan and then come for a visit even if you are a localite over there

Small place mainly takeaway. I love the Biriyani here. For us senior citizens the spice added in the biriyani is just enough and not rich in lard or oil and spices. You can add extra chicken, mutton, egg or potato at marginal added cost. Â Even my guests find it very very tasty. This is really great taste combined with value for money.

A roadside restaurant. Don't have sitting arrangement the offer only takeaway service.  Items list is quite short so no option to be choosy. You have to go for typical straight forward items. Compared to their price all items are quite good. Don't know why biriyanies are found to be much tastier on weekdays rather than weekends.

Its a small shop but can eat there too. If you are a briyani lover and love to eat briyani 2-3 times a week then its a perfect place for you.

If u r on budget and still want some nice and hot biryani this is the place.
Chicken biryani @70 and Mutton Biryani@90 with a very good quantity and a good taste add to the huge crowd most evenings ...
