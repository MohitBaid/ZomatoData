After trying many days finally I am able to get momo here. I heard about this place from lot of people. Chicken momo is really tasty. The outside wrapper is really very thin and stuffed with full of chicken. I didn’t get anything except chicken inside it. It is really a must visit place if you are in salt lake.

'Bapi dar stall', can be easily spotted late afternoonish, bustling with a hungry mob, shoving money, shouting out their orders. The place isn't fit for the health and hygiene conscious. It's strictly, don't ask don't know. I really like the chicken fries and chicken lollipop. The meat stays soft and juicy(no pun intended). The momos are above average quality. The fried chicken strips were the highlight for me. I could never find a menu hanging, and they serve in a very random order. So its a tedious job ordering and getting served. AND they should have more dustbins places by the stall. So overall this is a cheap alternative to kfc(I dare say) minus the ambiance and hygiene . They finish up fast so go sometime between 5-7 in the afternoon. And be ready to hustle. ;)

Bapi da: Till now I only knew the name of this shop is bapi da this person is one of those influential masters who sells very delicious kind of foods in a very very cheap price. People who haven't visited this place yet as soon as possible must do otherwise you won't get how bapi da lovers are just crazy to just have a one plate of a fry. Every time i go there i see a big crowd outside of this shop it takes me atlest 10 min to reach there to order food. I have almost eaten all of their fries. Chicken pakora chicken lollipop baby corn chicken wings and on and on... this is a very little roadside shop where bapi da serves a bunch o crunchy fires with a very affordable price.

This place was in my bucketlist for avery long time and finally i could visit this place. Though this is a street food stall but the food there is nothing like it.. we ordered a plate of chicken momos, chicken lollipop and chicken wings.. the momos were mind blowing it was my first visit i didnt expect this good momos appropriate amount of stuffing with very thin cover just perfect.. then coming to the lollipop n wings the chicken was juicy and full of flavours and the coat in too had a very distinct flavour which actully completed the dish on whole.. must visit..

This place is a legend already and needs no introduction. Have savoured on their fried stuff many a time and have been bowled over by their taste each time. Good food made fresh and served hot is what characterizes this place. Though a roadside stall, it can give stiff competition to any established bistro with its loyal customer base who keep asking for more each evening. The only thing negative about the place is that the window time of opening is less. It opens only in the evenings and if you're late you will see nothing left for you to consume.

Located opposite to the International Bus Terminus at Karunamoyee,but only between 5pm and 8.30pm or till stocks last ;)

Visited this place with my friend at 4.30pm but found no sight of the joint. On asking one of the auto drivers,they said that the shop would be set up by 5pm and it indeed happened.
After a roam about,on returning to that spot we spotted a small crowd of people gathered around a 8-man team setting up stoves,cooking vessels and service tables.

Four big cooking vessels(each for a particular cut) got filled with oil. Pre-marinated chicken pieces of all sorts-Pakoras,Lollipops,Wings,Drumsticks;were fed into these four cooking vessels categorically.

Chicken Steamed Momos were ready on spot.
Fried Momos are also available.

In a few minutes,the first batch of fried pieces of goodness were ready to be served. The items started selling like hotcakes.All sort of orders were placed,from bulk orders being taken away to orders to eat on spot.
Somehow we managed to get the food from the first batch.

 We tried the Chicken Momo(both steam and fried) and Chicken Lollipops.
The Momos were well stuffed and coating thickness was ideal.
Steamed Momo cost Rs.35(4 pieces) and Fried Momo cost Rs. 45(5 pieces).
Chicken Lollipops were succulent. 4 pieces for Rs.35/- as well.
They have a bin to dispose of the leftovers.

A few dogs get attracted to this place as well!! Even though they were non-aggressive , they'll still tail you with the hope of some treats!

The only thing I found negative about this place would be the staff. They seem uninterested and it is a challenge to get our orders through.

But overall a great experience to try out fried chicken at great prices.

I had been trying to try this since a long time and finally got a chance to try the chicken here. I must say the chicken is very juicy and tender. The chicken was perfectly cooked and melts in the mouth. The price is also very reasonable. The place is usually crowded with foodies trying the delicacies. They offer chicken lollipop, chicken wings, chicken pakoda, chicken strips, fried momos, steamed momos etc. I highly recommend this place to people who want to have fried chicken at a pocket friendly price. There is no seating area. Overall, a must visit for all the foodies.

A road side momo cum chicken fry joint near Karunamoyee bus stop ! So a very convenient location ! Now to talk of the food, the options are Chkn Steamed Momo, Chkn Fried Momo, Chkn Lollipop, Chkn Strips, Chicken Pakora nd much more ! And trust me, its a Chicken lovers' paradise ! And the best of the lot is Chicken lollipop ! Prices are very much pocket friendly ! Winter is the best time to visit this place ! Well timing says its open from 5 pm to 8.15 pm, but if u're planning to grab a bite of your favourite stuffs at this place, be there as early as possible since they sell like hot cakes and are most likely to get sold out as early as 6.30-7 !

Don't know how they can deliver such quality items in such a reasonable price. 

Boneless strips are awesome; need some improvement in Chicken Wings though.

PS - For those who are comparing this with KFC; "KFC is like iPhone and Bapi Da's counter is like an Android phone."

While this place is popular since a long and have even heard about it from many people, i decided to visit this place. I was amazed to see that its not even a proper shop rather just some stainless steel desks joined up to form a counter like display. I tried some fried momo and chicken fry n i was spellbound by the taste of it especially the momos. They were simply delicious. Recommended for people who loves to have tasty yet pocket friendly snacks.

At karunamoyee you find a few people with big cookwares and burners on the road with dogs roaming about and people crowding them.. that’s solid gulp for you. Of course there is no hygiene standards nor can you tell yourself that the food is healthy. It’s your guilty pleasure. Pure pleasure. The items you find here are .. lchicken pakora and friend momo and chicken lollipop etc , available for really cheap. You have to almost beg the server to serve you, cause there are usually 10 people surrounding him demanding the same. But finally the snacks are absolutely delicious . The momo has a proper filling of chicken. The chicken lollipops are also great

It is a small but very popular roadside joint near Karunamoyee bus stop. Been here quite a few times because it was near my college . I have tried chicken momos , chicken drumsticks, chicken fry and chicken lollipop , all of them are equally good. Pocket friendly place. It remains crowded most of the time . Few drawbacks are the limited menu and no seating arrangements.

Location 😂😂😂 step down at Karunamoyi bus stand & ask any one for BAPI Da's Store or go to the karunamoyi to kankurgachi auto stand.

They have no placard at all & on that particular day 18thOct17, they didn't arrange their plastic shed. So, on that rainy day it's so embarassing to stay & order the food.

We ordered chicken(common) #steam_momo #fried_momo #lollipop #wings_fry. It costs
35(4pc)+45(5pc)+35(4pc)+60(2pc) respectively. But but but, I asked for the chicken thigh fried. They told me it is not available for the day so I asked will it available on the very next day, they told me that is not sure at all. It's quite expected from a kiosk which has no shed no placard no menu card & where rain water is falling on the frying pan where chickens are frying on that moment.

I agree it's cheap & at that same time tasty. But they are not maintain some basic norms to run the store if you ignore that for some fried foods at cheaper price then then thumbs up.

Located in karunamoyee, it is the best fried chicken items shop. I frequently visit here. I have tried chicken pakora, chicken momos(they have streamed and fried only), chicken drumsticks, chicken thai, chicken lollipop, chicken sandwich and many more. All the items are awesome at very reasonable price. There is so much crowd near the stall that sometimes u have to wait for 30 minutes. But waiting is worthful when u have good food. Also there is no such sitting area n they don't do home delivery.

Visit the place after reading the reviews of zomato...it took some times to find the proper place because its a very very small place near karunamayee bus stop and beside khyber.....

4 people opens the stall in 5:00 pm and within a minute a huge crowd gathered there with there orders....

They arranged a good quantity of foods but that is not enough in respect of their popularity and demand....
Sone people comes with bulk quantity order like 12 plates, 15 plates etc....

It is really a big deal to have you food quickly so you have to keep some patience here....

After 30 minutes of struggle we finally finally achieve our food that is one plate of chicken momo and 2 plates of chicken lollipop...both item have 4 pieces...momo costs rs 30 nd lollipop 35 per plate...
Extremely cheap and soooo tasty....
Perfectly cooked and yaammmyyy....

A HIGHLY RECOMMEND place in kolkata but you should reach before 6 pm otherwise every good things will be finished....with

Was shocked to see the ratings of this place and had to go there and taste myself! From karunamoyee bus stop we walked straight and suddenly saw a huge crowd and as we got closer finally saw the famous "bapidar momo". We waited patiently for our turn and ordered in a bulk as we knew we wont get a second chance. We ordered "chicken fried momo" "chicken steam momo" "chicken fry" & "chicken lollipop"(here we means two of us;) Each and every item was just delicious and we were very much satisfied. Best part is definitely the price. Though I highly recommend every foodies to reach there at 4pm and if possible pack these wonders and enjoy at home!

Solid Gulp is the local fast food joint near the Salt Lake Karunamayee bus stop, known locally as 'Bapi Dar Momo'. Since 1999, this small eatery has been a favourite among street food lovers serving delicious crispy fried chicken, momos and other fried snacks. Owing to it's immense popularity, the joint has gained a huge loyal customer base which keeps growning every single day. A few of the items I managed to get my hands on at Bapi Da's:

⏹Fried Chicken Wings - The juicy crispy flavors of the chicken makes it a mouthwatering snack. It isn't oily as it looks and Bapi da guarantees the chicken is always fresh!!! 😻

⏹Steamed & Fried Chicken Momos - The fried momos are an absolute must try here. Though not perfectly shaped, the taste is bound to sweep you off your feet. Fatafati to say the least!!! 😸😻

⏹Fish pakora - The fish pakoras definitely took me by surprise as I was a bit skeptical the first time I tried them. With a crispy thin outer coat of besan, the fish (either rohu/katla) underneath was soft and fresh, made for a delightful snack!!! 😻

Their crispy baby corn fries are also nice which I sometimes resort to when they are close to running out of stock for the day.😸

Bapi Da knows how to keep it light and healthy for his customers. They always end up being sold out roughly within two hours of opening the shop. (Evening 5:30-7:30). The service is always prompt though you need to be a bit patient considering the huge crowd they pull in. The best part is prices are incredibly affordable and Bapi Da has continued to maintain the same price tags over the years. With the monsoon at its peak, fried chicken with a hot cup of tea, sounds like a divine idea? 😻

Top-class street food. Superb for occasional indulge. I have tried chicken lollipop and fish pakora. Fish pakoras have large chunks of fish!! Chicken lollipop was OK. Fried wings looked large.
Fish pakora 4 pcs Rs. 70.
Chicken lollipop 4 pcs Rs. 30
Chicken wings 4 pcs Rs. 50/60
Chicken lollipop is definitely value for money.

NB: Buying the snacks is a challenging task because of the crowd that it attracts everyday. Also a few people come with very large orders like 25 plates (i.e., 100 pieces) of chicken lollipop! But that did not deter me from buying my snacks. :)

I definitely plan to go back for more.

Solid Gulp, is actually famous as Bapi Dar Momo, one of the famous street food joint in the Salt Lake City. It is just opposite to karunamoyee bus stop and adjacent to the wall of housing estate. It's food is like hot cupcakes as the crowd started gathering before the stall is ready to serve. The demand of its snacks are so high that it always closed before its closing time. It is a non veg food joint which serves the best street non veg item I ever had in reasonable price with good quantity and quality. It severe chicken lollipop, drumsticks, chicken wings, chicken strips, fish pakora, prawn pakora, Momo, and few more Chinese food. The food is well washed and properly marinated to deep fried and serve hot. They are lipsmacking and you can never have enough. The best part is pocket friendly with hygiene. There service is also very efficient. And the teach you all about it.

Fired momo - yummy
Chicken wings - very popular
Chicken Lollipop - ok ok
Chicken Strips - aha
Chicken pakora - will love this
Fish pakora - mouth watering
Prawn pakora - wow
Crispy baby corn - very tasty
 I have taste all of the above. 
Also sometimes if u r lucky u can get chinese items like chowmein, fried rice and dry chilli chicken, you will just fall in love and will visit daily.
If u r not able to locate it, then for u it is just adjacent to the walls of Karunamoyee housing society the side where u will get auto for phoolbagan, mani square.

Just go and try. Shop opens at 5 pm and everything is finished at 7:30pm , so try to visit within this time frame.

Located near karunamoyee which is not big in size, however, the place is crowded always. There are good amount of options for the evening snacks. Ordered chicken lollipop, chicken drumstick, chicken fry and Momo's. Each and every item was amazing. The price is pocket friendly as well.

Located near Korunamoyee bus stand, this place is really a gem for the food lovers, pocket pinch is very much affordable for everyone. The lolipops, pakoras, chicken momos and crispy babycorn are mouthwatering at such a cheap price. One of the best thing is that the place is always crowded yet the Service is super fast...

Bapi Dar momo needs no introduction. Located at the heart of Karunamayee bus stop, this place indeed takes your heart away. Their momos, chicken Lollipop and chicken pakoras were me and my friends' constant companions during 4 years of college. They are simply mouthlicious and you can never have enough. Make sure you are on time though, the momos tend to get finished at the blink of an eye. The crowd here is crazy and given such consistent value for money and quality over the years the crowd would only increase here at Bapi Da's.

The food isn't out of the world kind. But if you consider the price, it's pretty amazing. We got 4 pieces of chicken wings for 30 rupees. Surprisingly, the quality wasn't sacrificed. All the chicken items will taste the same. They just have different names for different pieces/parts of chicken. Momos are also nice. Sandwiches are fine. 

If you're hungry and out of money, best place to go. However it'll always be crowded. It's useless to go after 6:30 (they start at 5) because most of the items will be over.

The Karunamayee location of Saltlake,Kolkata is famous, not only because of the administrative buildings but also for Bapi Da's food stall. The full stuffed momos, chicken lollipops will make you a regular visitor. The most amazing thing is low price. Whatever you eat, it'll never hurt your pocket.

One of the best roadside fast food corners.. truly a hidden gem, not so hidden, I guess. The crowd is constant here and all the staffs are really efficient. Now the comes the food, I have tasted few items here, all are above par according to roadside standards. Chicken steamed momo is good, though I will recommend chicken fried momo more, it was delicious.
The other items like chicken wings and chicken lollipops are just juicy and yummy as hell. The exact mouth watering taste that fast food requires to take over the world over everything, BAPI dar momo serves that. Loved it.

A roadside stall but an absolute heaven for food lovers.. Heard of this place since school days but it was just on 30th that my boyfriend took me there after he was way too impressed having good here. 
I have been here at 6pm or so... The place was too crowded provided it was a Sunday. 
We had two plates of chicken wings.. Each consisting two huge pieces.
Then we had a plate of chicken momos(5pieces) 
and two plates of chicken lollipop(10pieces).
All these costed 200bucks only. 
An absolute delight. 😍

This small road side eatery is in Karunamoyee just opposite the state transport bus stand. If you pass this place in the morning you will never get to know the magic that happens over here. This place reminds me of the short story The Martyr's Corner by RK Narayan. It is open in the evening for hardly a few hours and have a huge demand. People never stop ordering until this shop closes.

Despite being a roadside vendor Bappi Da takes a lot of pride and joy in serving everyone hygienic food at a very low cost. It has all the apparatus that a decent fast food center has like deep friers and all.

I have been to this place over a thousand times and about i was not able to try everything on the menu. There is insane amount demand for fried chicken items and momos of this place. When the place opens and staffs start heating the oil then only people flock around and extend their hands out towards the staffs to pay them in advance to receive the tempting food as soon as possible.

I was able to try the chicken lollipop, chicken wing and chicken strips. Chicken Lollipop costs 30 bucks and the chicken wings cost 40 bucks. They give 4 pieces in chicken lollipop and 2 pieces in chicken wings.

The chicken is very well washed and properly marinated. And is finally deep fried and served hot. This place is perfect if you are crazy hungry and its monthend so you are sort of broke for that reason.

I love visting this place whenever i am near Karunamoyee during the evening. I am not not able to resist bapi da's chicken lollipop. It is my personal favourite.I have heard that the momos are also good but i have never tried them. I wish bapi da opens up a few more such small eateries around the city while maintaining its quality for everyone to enjoy the delicious fried chicken.

Its heaven for momo lovers. No compromise on quality for the super cheap rates. Momos filled with tender juicy chicken garnished with lemon grass and their secret magic. Undoubtedly the best momos I have ever had in all aspects. I am not going overboard about this. Trust me. I wish the store was located nearby so I could have it every week.

A roadside small shop but that craze was unbelievable.
Me and one of friend visit there fr tired their popular momos and chicken lolipop..and guess what there was already 30+ people shouting for their food.
So we have to wait good 15-20 mins to got our food.
We ordered 1plate chicken momo, 1plate fried momo and 1plate chicken lolipip..
Everything was pretty good in terms of pricing.
And mine favorite was chicken stream momo.
For a cheap snack bite this is the best place in sector 1,2 area..

Bapi da's shop is my favourite in Saltlake, the chicken wings, chicken strip & chicken pakoda and momo are must try here. Prices absolutely reasonably and the best part is food is fresh this is a must try food joint at Karunamoyee.
Though the place opens in the evening for few hours and then they run out of stock due to the huge foot fall, unless you visit this place in the evening you wont know what Bapi da is. The crowd and the amount of people pouncing on his store for their order will make you realise his craze.

The food served here is a bit oily deep fried food, however must try!! Special recomendations for the Chicken wings and Chicken strip!!
Bapi da indeed rocks!!✌🏻✌🏻

When it is about Saltlake area, specially in Karunamoyee area, you will get thousands of quick bite option and bapi dar momo is something, that is you hardly want to miss.

Located opposite of Karunamoyee Bus stop, near to the Phoolbagan Auto stand. So not a hard thing to find it.

Forget about all Zomato rating and review, the crowd in front of the stall is enough to determine the popularity about this small food joint. The stall offers huge quick bite options like momo, various types of pakora, fried chicken etc. Think yourself lucky if get your desire item in the first chances. The shop opens around 5PM and within 6:30-7PM, everything gets empty.

We ordered Chicken momo and fish pakora. Was too much hungry to take the snap of the momos. Hahaha. :D Momos were full filled of chicken fillings but sadly they don't provide any kinda soup. Fish pakora was good in taste. Love the outer crispy touch. The fish was soft in nature, juicy and well marinated.

With two items, it cost me only Rs. 80 which is too much decent and this the main UPS for this stall. The stall is too famous that Bapi dar Momo become become a brand name to every office goers of Saltlake. Must visit destination for every Kolkatan.

This place is situated on pavement near to Karunamoyee salt lake near auto stand. I have tried their chicken lollypop, chicken pakoras, fish pakoras momo and various other fried stuffs. Trust me all of them were too good and really inexpensive. If you have Rs50 in you pockets you can easily have a treat here. But the place is extremely crowded and if you know Marshall arts or any kind of combat style you can expect the get the food quickly or else you have to wait.

When you're in Karunamayee, Salt Lake, just let your sense of smell guide you to Bapi Da's dokaan (shop).
You literally have to fight a mini battle in order to place your order.
Items in the menu sell like hot cakes!

But trust me, it's worth every penny.
It's simple yet delicious.
Portion size is appreciable.
Pocket friendly indeed.

Strongly recommend it!

Fried food never tasted so good before.
It is located opposite the International Karunamoyee Bus Stand and a 5 minutes' walk from the Karunamoyee crossing. My friend introduced me to this place and there has been no looking back ever since.
The food tastes delicious and the prices are cheap too.
I have tasted the fried momos, chicken lollipop, chicken fry, fish fry (boneless) and each one of them is flavourful, succulent, tasty and will leave you craving for me. 
My personal favourite is the chicken lollipop: chicken pieces fried to perfection with a flavourful and perfectly seasoned batter. Yum!
But getting your food here can be a dreadful job as it is always chaotic with people ordering for their food.
If you do not visit this place early (within 5-6pm) then chances are some of the items will already be sold out.
This place is frickin awesome and a must-visit place for anyone who loves fried food.

Office people cluster around the evening and you will get yourself satisfied only if you are lucky and are there in the right time.

We had chicken momos and fry and all of them were mouth melting. Hot, tasty and so this stall rightly deserves rave reviews. 

This stall has a story of a successful entrepreneurship. The stall started off with a very small investment and now it serves thousands everyday.

This place is at karunamoyee near auto stand. If you like fried chicken items like chicken pakora etc, this place is heaven for you.

I have tried almost every items over the course of numerous visits and loved all the items equally. Chicken fry is my favourie of all.
A really big fried chicken piece.

But you have to reach earlier around 5-5:45 to get this because the stock for this item gets depleted very soon.
Other items like chicken pakora, chicken lollypop, chicken drumsticks, Chicken thigh, Fish pakora
, Chicken momo are also good.

Only thing which is annoying is that sometimes you have to wait for a while but that is acceptable.

This small food joint makes some kickass fried Chicken, chicken wings and Momo. The chicken pieces were really big. The fried momo was really tasty. Wings were undoubtedly spicy and full of flavour. It deserved all the hype

A really small shack but heart of karunamoyee. The best momo in Kolkata. The best fried chicken. Although I never physically stood in the line to get the order, but I hear that people wait in the queue for several minutes to get the taste of it.

One of the best place to have momos. It is located in karunamoyee and always crowded. Service is quick despite of the crowd. If you are a chicken lover then you must visit this place to try their momo, chicken lollipop, chicken pakoda.

This place is literally a a Godsend for hungry and broke chicken lovers like me. They serve some of the best fried chicken delicacies in the city. It's very easy to locate this shop as it has the biggest crowd around Karunamoyee bus stop. I have had their chicken momo and drumsticks and they are amazing and perfect. You can have a great snack within 100rs easily. They have some vegetarian options like babycorn too. Totally love this small joint,it proves that you don't need fancy infrastructure to serve out lipsmacking good food :-)

This is one of the best place for evening snacks. Foods are yummy and very reasonable pricing. Those who knows this place don't wait for a review. The place is over crowded and you have to shout for your order... This road side counter is best for their style of chicken prep and it is desi reply to kfc...

Steamed momos are sold out by 7.00, fried momos by 7.30.
I can't think of a better compliment for the food here than the fact that everything gets sold out within 2 hours, every single day. The fried momos are heavenly. They don't serve soup, but in my opinion, soup's not needed to appreciate the taste.
Service is pretty fast. One of the two best momo joints in the city. The other being Jadavpur 8B.

This is the perfect place to have  one of the "best in taste" momos of this city.Chicken momo is mouth watering..You should try chicken wings and pakodas as well.. :)

Highly recommend for you guys... Keep snacks-ing.. ;)

This place is located exactly beside KHYBER (which u can find where the auto stands for going to beleghata bypass from karunamoyee)I said this as there is no board for this particular shop.... Though u may not require one if u come at the time when it's operative...As such is the crowd....Went to have the momo after hearing so much about it...So reached at 6:45 to this place....I could see atleast 30-40ppl surrounding this shop ...All shouting at the top of their voice "bapi Da amarta....Bapi Da eeta/oota)so you need to have patience as well as do some vocal exercises as well to be heard .....There were 5people frying things .....I heard that the momos were not available..So settled down for fish fingers and chicken pakora....Got 4 pieces of boneless chicken for just rs 40 and it was fried perfectly...The outside was crunchy and once u take a bite you can feel the juicyness as well....The best deal I ever had for a chicken pakora and also the fish strips/fingers were good....It's the best deal one can get in karunamoyee if not in entire kolkata​.... Definitely do visit this place .....I will definitely and try their momos next time

This is heaven!!!!!! Though this a street food shop, I won't think twice before calling it the best food joint of kolkata. It's very to karunamoyee bus stop but until and unless you know the location, a bit difficult to find out the place. It generally opens up at 5pm and around 7.30pm everything is over! Once you have these foods, you'll probably not like to go to KFC or McDonald's!
Now what should you have? Well you should try everything. Starting from chicken wings (pure bliss!!!) to fried Momo, or crispy baby corn or fried prawn. Fish pakoda! Oh! It's yummy! 
It is always over congested. You have to fight always to get your order. And, have it there only (otherwise it'll be soggy). 
It is very much friendly to your pocket. So no worries. Go, order, enjoy!

One of the best food stalls in saltlake area.

Ambiance: Its a rode side, small kiosk & there is no sitting arrangements. Ambiance is average.

Service: Swift.

Food: I have ordered Chicken Fried Momo & Chicken Pakora. Both the items were very much tasty, well fried with soft chicken stuffings. Both of the food items were good in quantity; quality was also good as it had not caused any health hazard.

Price: Very reasonable.

Popularly known as bapi dar momor dokan, it is probably the most sought out food outlet in sector 2 , salt lake, in fact won't be an exaggeration if i say that it is the most sought out food outlet in entire salt lake..as far as i remember, the momo culture itself was popularised in the karunamoyee area by this food junction....they serve ample quantities of their tastiest fast food dishes at a rate as reasonable as u won't find anywhere else in salt lake and consequently their popularity amongst the people, especially the students and the IT people has grown exponentially with time and continues to do so...I can't remember an hour of a day when this place has not been crowded with people...it remains either crowded or sold out...the shop does all its business in roughly 2-3 hours an evening....i have tried their chicken lollipop, chicken sandwich, chicken fried momos, fish pakoras and chicken fries...i have never tasted chicken lollipops this tasty and crunchy...consumption of a plate of fish pakora would make u feel as if u have consumed an entire piece of fish as you would during your lunch or dinner, such is the genuinity of the dish...without a second thought, you should go for this one, fight through the queue and get taste bud seducing dishes here without any damage caused to your pockets..i would specially recommend : chicken lollipop, chicken fry and fish pakoras..I have cut 0.5 coz a place which has been facing such a huge crowd day in day out, still has not come up with a solution to make the purchase smooth for their customers..its a mess out there...getting what you want from this outlet might sometimes feel like a battle won..go for it..its too good not to try...

Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

Ok so reviewing after a long break. 😄
Happy to be back ...😎

This place is situated at karunamoyi bus top,just towards the auto stand...1-2min by walk. After passing few momo,roll joints...u will find a large crowd over a stall.. That's the destination for chicken lovers. 😍
So we had chicken pakora,chicken momo,chicken sandwich,chicken wings and the chicken thai was finished, unless we would hv tried that too.. 😝😝

There wr 4 pakoras in one plate worth rupees 40. The size was decent,and perfectly cooked crispy pakora it was. 😄

The chicken momo was tasty,though there was no soup served with it..only u will get the sos. But I liked it. 😊

The sandwich was cold though,but it had lots of amount of chicken filling in it..yummy..😇

And the chicken wings were kind of the kfc fried chickens..the flavour was different obvious. One wings coated just 25...and it was crispy,juicy inside and perfectly cooked....😋

Our bill was around 200..and we were super full with chicken and chicken and chicken...😜😜
Surely visiting very soon.
I will highly recommend this place... it's super cheap, tasty and u will revisit this place once u are there fr sure..😄😄😇

Only bad thing is you have to wait long fighting and shouting at the counter asking for a delivery as there is a huge crowd to follow up. Other matter of concern is the hygiene of the place as it is in the roadside

Well I stay outside Kolkata nowadays ,and even if I am bribed with one limousine ..I would'nt rate IDLY,DOSA,MISAL PAV,VADA PAV over Kolkata Street Food ..even to be specific Bapi DA' r street food. I was a regular customer of Bapi Da, while I was at school ,but my bile duct was unable to release enough bile to digest so much of fat molecules and my love for those food hence gradually transforming my sweet lean self. Though no regrets, Yesterday I was in saltlake .. and suddenly discovered Steak Factory near Karunamoyee. So I had an option either to go there or hit Bapi Da's street food. After a 2sec dilemma , I was sure .. of my decision to go ..yes my very own BAPI DA. U know , when u miss ur city and want to eat ur heart out without even worrying about your pocket pinch.. Then BAPI DA is the place. No u can't have the poise dinner with abcd steak with abcd reduction with pinch of lemon or pinch of orange .. U just say DADA , two plate momo, 1 plate chicken lollipop.. and just pay 100 bucks and u get 10 bucks in return too.  
**Also Bapi da has started with his breakfast items ,liked baked beans scrambled eggs etc.. 
All i can say is, u will LOVE IT . (****SEEDHI BAAT NO BAKWAAS****)

The Star performer of the Karunamoyee area. Hungry? Hop into there and you will get your tummy filled within 100 rs. Sad? Again hop into there and the food will bring a broad grin to your face. Basically whatever may be the occasion, Bapi da will make you satisfied. I have tasted almost everything from there and they have never disappointed me. But my tongue goes on a roll for their Steamed Chicken Momos. The ample filling of chicken and the beautiful texture of the outer cover is enough to make you fall in love with it. It's only a stones throw from where I live and I visit it whenever I get time. Long Live Bapi Da. ;)

A small food stall that opens at 4.30 pm and closes at 7. This little shop makes the best momo and momo sauce in the entire Salt Lake. They also make several other chicken dishes, but their momos are definitely better than the rest of the dishes. And due to that, every day their stall is crowded all the time, and its very rare if you go there and order a plate of momo and get it straight away. You have to stand and wait, till all the people who came first,get their orders,and then ull get yours. And most of their staffs are also quite rude during rush hours. Even even if u scream infront of them, that you want a plate and you came early, most of the time they wont even pay attention. They r always overloaded with orders so they are busy prep-ing and dsnt have time to listen to each of the customers individually. Which i totally hate. Its good that you are serving good food at a good price, but at least treat the customers well.
Overall i would rate:
Steamed Momos- 4/5
Fried momos- 4.5/5
Momo sauce-4.5/5
Fried chicken and others etc etc- 3.5/5
Service- 2/5
Availability- 2/5 ( as they are available for such a little time and if ur a little late ur favourite dish goes 'sold out'.)

Visited Bapi da's twice. It is a food stall opposite to Karunamoyee bus stand. There is no name on display, so you basically have to figure it out by locating the huge crowd in front of it and that clearly gives an idea of how good their food is. We have tried their momos, fried chicken, chicken lollipops and fish pakora. Simply loved each and every one of them..  Prices are extremely pocket friendly.

Though we have ordered takeaway often from this place near Karunamoyee bus stand, this is the first time I am reviewing the joint. The food is always tasty and fresh, though some may find it a trifle bit spicy. The fried momos are our best bet though we love the fried chicken also. However if you want to eat here go as soon as it opens between 4pm and 5 pm as the food finishes as soon as it is made ready.

This place has literally become my favorite zone within the last few months! Till now, I had read only its review but only 2 months back, I realized, this place is damn close to my house! Just a 10 minute route from SAI Complex, Bapi Da momo is very convenient for people like us - it's delicious and pocket friendly. The fried momos, the chicken wings and crispy baby corn are the WOW factors of this food joint. If you are lucky and reach within time (i.e., 6.30 pm!) then you might be able to enjoy these delicacies!
A total paisa-vasool place! :D

The famous bapi da er chicken! This place is amazing. The chicken pakora, lollipop and the chicken wings are amazing and so pocket friendly. I love this place. Also, try to go before 7pm orelse you won't get any! It would have been great if they could arrange some tables and chairs but then that is the charm of this place.

When you think about chicken Momos 
It's Bapi da's momo 
When you think about wings 
It's Bapi da's chicken wings 
Everything is so good here,but you have to struggle to get your momos or whatever you feel like eating here. Come to Bapi da's stall 
you will get to know the demand of his food items . 
Even kankurgachi n phoolbagan autos don't get enough customer.😂
And pricing 
If you are broke come here ,it's pocket friendly .

Have been frequenting this place from class 11 as i happened to have my tutions near karunamoyee. It became quotidian for me to visit this kiosk before boarding my designated S9 bus to home.
It is a preety famous joint and is situated right on the main road near karunamoyee crossing. And it will always be crowded!
It is a take away counter and you can pack it home or stand on the road and enjoy it hot.
Momos are a must here! Soft and succulent steamed meat momos paired with their red hot sauce. Tastes really good. Earlier they used to serve 6 pcs and now they have cut down to 4 for 1 plate of momo!
The pan fried momo is another great option.
There are many other chicken and fish snacks that one can buy here: boneless chicken strips, fish fry, chicken drumsticks and others. Everything is good and fresh here. Ideal for evening snacks if youbare in an around karunamoyee. 
PS: no pic. Ll be uploading soon on my next visit

The most pocket friendly place for hunger prangs..the best guilty pleasure one can have..the deep fried chickn lollypop is by far the best which is only 30rs per plate..the  draw backsof the place is that it is extremely over crowded,everybody is screaming fr their orders..u have to deal with a dozen of stray dogs while u eat nd if u reach after 7pm ur left with no food to order..

Momo is the medicine of depression for me and when it comes to Bapi da,it used to become an emotion too.I am a regular visitor of this place,located near Karunamoyee bus stand.Have tried Chicken momo's,it was delicious and divine, excellent in taste.Chicken strips are mouthwatering and lip smacking.Drumsticks are also amazingly tasty.Fish items are highly recommended.One can also try their Crispy Chilli Babycorn. A great place for snacks lovers in pocket friendly range. Momo lovers can't give it a miss.

I went with a few friends of mine to this eatery located at Karunamoyee. When we got down of the bus, we saw a huge crowd has gathered infront of the shop. Generally you don't see that big a crowd for a roadside eatery. Yes..you heard it right; its a roadside stall. Not some restaurant or something. And yet the food is delicious. We had steamed momos, chicken lollipop and chicken drumsticks. The prices are cheap. The chicken was fresh. The taste was superb. I loved the Chicken Lollipops more than the rest. Well, it doesn't maintain too much hygiene though. People are throwing away the chicken bones on the road itself. Though there's a place to dump the plates. So yeah, forget about the hygeine if you want to gulp some good momos without pinching your pocket.

We [ me, family & friends ] have been eating here since 2006. They change their menu on regular basis besides their signature dishes- Momo and Chicken Fry. So, whenever I drop by, I always ask for what's new and so far, I have never been disappointed. Their 'Egg Mayo Green Onion' sandwich was my all time favourite; once in winter they were selling Hakka Noodles; once there was Whole Pomfret Fry- these regular changes in offered food items are something very refreshing. 

Once I had a Chicken Thigh which was deep fried and still was a bit under- despite the stall being overcrowded when I told Bapi da about it- he promptly replaced it. Bapi da's rapport is always extended to the new and regulars alike. In coolhead they manage the hungry-crowd is something that should be lauded. 

Last I checked, they might be offering breakfast from their shop, would be a great thing because places around sector II lack choices in breakfast.

Another thing: despite conducting their trade on street, Bapi da and his crew always maintain the cleanliness of their stall. I think, they are the first in the hood to install chrome fixtures.  Even when they were moved to the far side of Karunamoyee Gate, and there, the place was not great to peddle foods- they overhauled their 'new' surroundings and maintained their measures on cleanliness.

Best food joint ever! Cheap food, made out of high quality materials, and tastes like heaven. This small establishment, though calling it that is playing hard and fast with the word 'establishment', is a small setup with bamboo sticks. If you're looking for a peaceful dining experience, this place is not for you. But if you're looking for great quality chicken fast-food, you belong here. You can choose to eat fresh but you have to stand near the place and eat, or you can take it home, but that doesn't taste the same.
They cook all their food in packaged oil.  They start at 5 and by 6:30 they have nothing left to sell. The two best things are the Chicken thighs and Chicken momos. Give this place a visit, you won't regret it.

There are not enough words in any language that could laconically describe the relation of this joint with the City Of Kolkata. This place is a legend in itself and hence, surmising the unmatched experience of this place in a review is a fool's errand. 

Nonetheless, the formalities. This joint is located just near Karunamoyee Bus Stand. If by any chance you find difficulties in locating it, just try to find a place that is throbbing with people. During the rough three hours of its operation, this is arguably the most visited joint in the area. 

As far as the food is concerned, there is no need for rhetorics and unnecessary hyperbolics. Everything on the menu is amazing beyond a limit. Everything on the menu is probably the best in the town. No exceptions. 

This is a must visit joint. I'd go as far as to say that anyone who has lived in Kolkata and hasn't tried their specialities is missing something integral in his/her life. Worth a thousand visits, only of course, if you don't care about carbs and gaining weight. :-)

Never will you in your wildest dreams imagine that this hole in the wall could produce such delicious food! The proof is in the crazy number of people waiting ever so patiently in lines even if its just for one serving of their steaming hot momos. 

Recommendations:
1. Chicken steamed momo
2. Chicken wings
3. Baby corn
4. Boneless strips

However be sure to get ur food between 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. as after that there is a chance of them closing shop... yes that's how fast they run out of supplies.

Warning: this is serious comfort food, so yes it will be well coated in batter and fried in A LOT of oil. However I will not hesitate to say it is totally worth it. The momos are rumoured to have a secret ingredient! I think its lemon grass. (Oops should i have said?)

Visited this several times, never disappointed. 
A tasty food joint near korunamoyee.
Feeling hungry..? Or wanna taste some yummy fries then you must visit this place. 
The only thing is that you have to wait in long queue for your turn. But that much wait is totally worthy for this kind of food.

My personal favourite: Chicken fry, Sandwiches, Lollipop.

Fighting through the crowd we ordered almost everything in the menu! The momo was quite good along with the chicken items & the rating is quite justified! Pocket friendly menu but takeaway is the best option! Because street dogs may bother you!!!! ;)

Chicken fries r crunchy and crispy outside and soft and juicy inside, the coating is quiet thin and nice. Baby corns are also very crispy  and momo fillings are just yuum!

I was taken in by the zomato rating and wanted to try this place badly. Didn't find any partner, hence decided to go all by myself.

And here are the tips for all:

1. Please do not plan to have a particular thing in the menu while visiting, you won't get that. Be open to have whatever is available and you would not be disappointed.

2. It's not exactly located on the Korunamoyee 4 point crossing,hence don't go for searching the outlet all by yourself, ask anyone in the 4 point crossing and they will tell you the direction, advance towards the place and you will easily spot it, not by the hoarding or name but by the crowd surrounding it!

3. Do not wait for the crowd to disappear or at least reduce. Squeeze in and order from whatever is available at the moment, otherwise you will keep waiting forever.

4. If you are ordering momos, donot expect soups or sauces. They will serve food on a paper plate, if you ask for sauces, they will point you to the direction where only tomato and chilli sauces are available.

But since it is just a roadside and highly popular joint, all these cannot be really considered negatives specially when the TASTE IS AWESOME for such mere prices!!!! Great for evening snacks or take-aways, but if you are places faraway from the place, find a suitable time and visit, do not expect to get any special or priority services.

Best for the people working or living around Korunamoyee area..

If your in Karunamoyee and You are hungry and its 5 o clock run to this pocket friendly joint. Every time i visit chicken Momo and the chicken sandwich is always on the list.  I am proud that i tried everything on the menu its hot and tasty. I am quite a fan of the chicken sandwich. The only thing that can stand between you and the tasty food is "the wait for your turn". Its better to reach the place 30 min before 5.  They are always consistent and always filled with food lovers.  If your willing you try the Chicken Fry i suggest you better pack it for home its really hot.Its always Bon Appetit when Bappi Dar Momo is involved.

If you want to taste the best Street food in town, come here and check. A very small and portable typeo shop, open in the evening at around 5pm, and as soon as they open up a big crowd surround this store. From school going kids to the College guys and even people from 40-50s.
Solid Gulp is located at the corner of Korunamoye bus stand on the opposite footpath. I can claim that they serve the best momos in the town. Their momos are just wonderful. I often visit here for their momos.
Chicken Lolypop and Chicken Wings are another best selling item they have.
Many people are unaware of this place due to its location and timing. But I would urge anyone who has not visited this place to come and try their momo once. And the prices they charge is just nothing compared to the quality and quantity they serve.
Probably this is one of the best Street food corner in Kolkata. If you haven't been here your tongue has missed the best Kolkata can serve.!!

Located just opposite the Karunamoyee bus stand. 

Proudly proclaim to have tasted every single item on the menu !

Babycorn Fry: the only veg item available, very crunchy and fried to the core. Veg-ilicious!!

Chiken Sandwich: Amidst all the fried options available, this one's a healthier option, the filling is tasty.

Chicken Momo: Both the fried and the steamed ones, are, hands down, the second best after Wow Momo. The momos so soft and blend beautifully into your mouth. I could just keep gorging on them!!

Fish pakora: love, love, love the fish pakora. 4 pcs for 60 rs only. A must try for fish lovers.

Chicken Lollipop: sizes are similar to the hot wings from KFC. 

Chicken Drumstick: Chicken, deep fried in oil.

Chicken Fry: A humongous piece of cicken deep fried in oil. Personally, I'm not a huge fan.

What's great about the place is it's affordability. It's so damn cheap for the quality and quantity offered.
            
Be sure to visit the place within 4 PM-6.30 PM if you want to try out everything. Stocks finish fast.

Location: Karunamoyee more. Just ask anyone.

I feel the hype is totally justified. Their opening and closing times vary from day to day, season to season.

But expect them to run out of stock by 8:30 pm.

I have been to bapi da r stall many a times.

I absolutely love the momos : 4 pieces for ₹30. Stuffed with generous amount of chicken, good ol' steamed momo here is a winner.

Chicken wings and chicken pakoras : Both cost the same. 4 pieces for 49 bucks. These are good too. However, sometimes you might get a few undercooked pieces of chicken!

Needless to say that they were super tasty. They do not compromise with quality (cooking oil). But I am sure that few such shops are also there in town, just they don't get such hype like bapi dar momo.

On my way back home from office, I have to wait for an auto rickshaw from Karunamoyee to Kankurgachi. Everyday for last one year  I have been noticing this shop and today after a year I finally managed to visit this place. It is a street side eatery which specializes in snacks. I ordered chicken pakora to eat  at the place and brought home fish pakora, chicken fried momo and chicken spring roll. Each of them tasted good. The quantity of filling in the momo was overwhelming. The fish and chicken quality was great. And they are very quick at providing service. I am marking them 4 just on the basis of the quantity, quality and price.

If you are looking for Street food at it's best then this is the place you should be. located just opposite the International Bus Terminus at Karunamoyee , Salt Lake it can be easily identified by the number of people surrounding the joint. If you ask someone at Karunamoyee to point out the Chicken Gulp Stall he may look at you surprisingly but just say Bapidar momo and everyone will tell you where to find it. Coming to the food their main delicacy is chicken momo and it is absolutely mouthwatering. Be it steamed or fried they make best momos in Salt Lake and arguably one of the best in Kolkata. Other items like chicken fry , chicken pakora , baby corn fry , fish pakora are equally brilliant. The Chicken fry is a huge one & is better than fries available in  many big restaurants, moreover it is available at throwaway prices. Unlike many other joints where one has to find small chicken pieces in pakoras  you will get a nice piece of chicken with little coating needed for frying. This place is a heaven for those looking for afternoon snacks at unbelievable prices. If someone has not been to this place yet then he should rush to grab his plate but be careful to be here before sundown as otherwise he may have to return empty handed.

STEAMED AND FRIED CHICKEN MOMOS

I went there a few days ago only to find that their stock for the day was finished. The next time I made sure that I reached there by 5 pm. Yet, I witnessed a crowd assembling around the stall. 
We managed to get (buy) a plate of Steamed Chicken Momos which is served with a sauce and a plate of Fried Chicken Momos. 

Nothing much to review. I would say the steamed momos are different from what I have had for 30 rupees in other makeshift momo outlets.

The Chicken Pakora that is prepared here is mind-blowing. But 15 minutes is all it takes for the tray to get empty. So if u r right on time, u could probably taste one of the better Chicken Pakoras u ever had.

No doubt this place is rated so highly. This is basically a stall near the Korunamoyee crossing where you get awesome momos in the afternoon. Make sure you reach early, as the items vanish fast off the wok. Apart from the momos, the fried chicken here is excellent. Fish pakora - didn't like it much, though it was absolutely value for money. 

Must visit place if you are a street food addict.

Every year, so many hotel management students are becoming a part of the hospitality industry after successful completion of course. But so far the entrepreneurial skills are taken into consideration, the one whose name deserve to be written with a golden emblem is none other than BAPI BANERJEE, an IIHM-Coimbatore passout who raised the art of Kolkata street food to an eccentric level of excellence.

A less than one minute walk from 'Karunamoyee Housing Estate', gate number 2, will land you up to a roadside shack stall, surrounded by a big crowd of people dying to crave for its mouth watering momo and other delicious snacks, in the evening.
That's the place which is known as "Solid Gulp(Bapi dar momo)", a happening buzzword to the street food lovers, a wonderful creation by BAPI BANERJEE, spreading smiles with its signature taste of delicious delicacies.

Make sure to plan your visit as early as possible to the opening time, as procrastinating may end up all your effort in vain, only to discover that the stock is exhausted for the day. Easily you can imagine the craze now.

Though there is no trace of ambience at all and no sitting arrangements as such, you will not get the chance to regret once you take the first bite.
And you can get your food packed if you want to take it away and have on the good, instead of having it standing on the road.

A heaven for street food lovers, and highly recommended to all the foodies out there.

Bapi-da never disappoints you. When your mind craves for some great non-vegetarian snacks and you do not want a customary KFC or McDonalds, Bapi-da's shop at Karunamoyee, Saltlake is your saviour. You will get numerous versions of the fried chicken - chiken pakoda, chicken momo (b&f), chicken lollipop, chicken strips, chicken leg, chicken wings (better than many top notch places) and the chicken quarter fry. Along side this, you also get fish pakoda and pomfret fry on some days (you need to be at the peak of your luck). I will not go so much into describing how it tastes because the huge population of customers who return every other day and ensure that things sell out by 7:30PM - 8:00PM.

If you have experienced it - you will know what I am talking about. If you have not - I must say that you are missing a great experience. Three cheers to the soft spoken, ever smiling, diligent and charming guy - Bapi. Thanks to him for creating this total gem.

One of the over-hyped destinations on Zomato.
Momos' are absolute delicious. But the Chicken wings sometimes becomes very difficult to sever (not properly marinated beforehand!). plus accounting in horrible paper plates on which they are served. Come on!! one can have momo on a paper plate, not chicken wings which require battle between teeth and own hand.
Anyway the seating arrangement needs to be upgraded, if not , at least provide some extra chairs and overhead bulbs.

Keeping aside the downsides, it's a decent and delicious and sumptuous destination for a quick bite avoiding a pocket pinch. Hop in!
Recommended!

This place is heaven. If anyone asks you," why people in Kolkata are crazy about street foods", one should, without any doubt bring him/her to this place. 

Of course, the USP of this place is Bapi Da's momo. The momos are so juicy. It definitely reminds me of the mum prepares at home. And then there are those juicy lollipops, chicken fry and I bet you wouldn't be disappointed with any of their items. I tried out their sandwiches and Chowmein which were once again, superb. 

This was the place where my friend and I used to bond once my college used to get over. Located just opposite to the International Stand of Karunamoyee Bus Stand. This place is not difficult to locate at all, seeing a large swarm of people post 5. 

Good luck, if you wish to grab your food since there is always a hustle for food. And do reach before 6-6.30, if you wish to try out the momos. 

Worth visiting again and again and you wouldn't be bored. 

P.S. - This is a very late review. Last, I visited Bapi Da's place, was way back in December, 2015. Don't know why, once I opened this page, it says Temporarily Closed.

Though it's a famous street food place in salt lake, I found it pretty dull. The famous momos of this shop were just blunt in taste and the chutney was sour. The quality of chicken in chicken pokora was not good, tasted like wet flour dough. The fish pokora was below the average in taste. The only thing I liked was chicken wings.

Attitude Problem of staffs. 

Last week we placed order for 50 plates Chicken Lollipop in the morning. They assure us this will available in the evening and shop will open around 4:30pm. We reached there around 4:10pm and on that time no-one present. After half an hour they are came and prepared the outlet. As we are first customer and we placed advanced so we suppose to thought our food will deliver first. But after several arguments they provide us the food and all merged in 4plates in one packet. We requested them as this will difficult for us distribute them. So please pack single plate in single packet. Unfortunate shop owner react very rudely and this was not possible and we asked them to provide us atleast paper plates. That also they didn't provide. Also they didn't served exact volume of food. 2 plates were short :( 

Taste was good of food and quality also good. But they should consider about attitude and proper service.

Located on the road beside Karunamoyee Bus stop is a little shack famously known as Bapi Dar Momo. It certainly is the most famous joint for low priced yet good quality and tasteful food.  The Zomato reviews and words of mouth are what attracted me to it.

I landed here last Friday and was all disappointed. By the time it opened, already a crowd of customers(mostly regular ones) had gathered. Then came the moment when the staffS opened their shack and it all ran ruckus. It was all a ''survival of the fittest'' contest out there. Everyone was busy pushing others away and have their orderS heard. Even the staffs don't pay any attention to customers who are at disadvantage in terms of physical strength and concentrate more on regular ones. Hence, when it comes to service and staffs this place earns a zero from me.

The next is food. Well with much difficulty I could ''earn'' my plate of Chicken Fried Momos and was unfortunate enough to never handed over my order of Chicken Pakoras as all went to the regular customers who placed orderS for much greater quantities. The stuffs basically turned a deaf ear to my order of a single plate pakoras. There were five momos in a single plate but they tasted pretty ordinary. Ketchup is what you are served momos with. 

Bapi Da's joint was all disappointment for me and won't be visited ever again.

The best momo's I've had in Kolkata. This is a shanty stall located just opposite to Karunamoyee bus stand. They have a lot of variants available, from steam momo to fried momo to fried chicken lollipops and a few more. The place is pocket friendly and the steam momo's are amazing. However you should try to reach the place by 6pm as the food gets over pretty early. Steams momo's are available at the rate of 30 bucks for 4 pieces.

A food stall in Karunamoyee with 4.5+ rating on Zomato with almost everyone going gaga about Bapi Da’r Momo, I had to try it out. I never knew about this place till I read the reviews. Oh and what an amazing find it turned out to be. Delicious momos, probably one of the best momos in Calcutta. And don’t forget to try their chicken lollypop. They are just yummy. 

The place is so crowded, you’ll have to wait minimum 15 minutes but it is so worth the wait. And go early; otherwise you’ll not get anything. All of their items get sold out in a jiffy. For all of those who love momos or chicken pakora or chicken lollypop, this place is a must visit.

Take away or stand-n-eat either way this is one of the best place for momo and associates. Although the spot is a so called roadside, the food quality can't be undermined. One of the best momos I've had in the city, competing the likes of wow momo or denzong's. Located at the heart of karunamoyee, this place is worth a visit. Additional mentions, their chicken lollipop are equally finger-licking. A very affordable price, and a cool hangout spot.

While waiting for a friend at Salt Lake, I decided to try out bapi dar momo cus of their amazing ratings! On reaching I noticed a long que! I stood and got a plate of momo and chicken pakoda on my turn! The momos were so nice, a small shop serving such momos was hard to believe. The pakoda was decent enough too. The stuff there is cheap but good and thus the crowd. Would re-visit.

After visiting this place i must admit that all this while i was missing a gem known as Solid Gulp or famously Bapi Da'r Momo. This is a road side stall but there is no doubt that they can compete with the very best in the business. I visited them around 4:45 pm and to my surprise they were still closed but suddenly the people working for this place came with two vans and did their set up within 15 mins and suddenly the empty stall got crowded within a few seconds ( i am not at all exaggerating). At first i tried their Chicken Sandwich. A bit dry but the filling was absolute gem. Maybe they could start selling the grilled version. Second in the list was their Momo. Absolute gem. I dont recount any place other Denzong Kitchen serving such tasty momos in Kolkata. 30 bucks for 4 is absolutely pocket pinch. I decided to order their Chicken Lollypop and Chicken Fry for takeaway. The Lollypops though looked absolutely thin and anorexic but was having sufficient amount of meat when i tasted it. It was deep fried and the crispness delighted me. Again 30 bucks for 4 pieces. Unbelievable. Same goes for their Chicken Fry. A wholesome piece of Chicken Leg again deep fried and made absolutely crispy. To be honest this is the best i had from their outlet. 50 bucks for such a meaty piece again is very much pocket friendly.

This place is a must must try. I Repeat!!! A MUST MUST try. Do reach the shop before 6:30 or 7 coz there is every chance that you will come back disappointed keeping in mind the rush i saw. It was absolute madness down there. You have to see that to believe it.

One fine evening some of our office colleague planed to have momo/chicken from this here. I have heard this name before but did not get chance to try it.
We ordered fried chicken and chicken lollypop. I tasted both, and trust me both were really awesome in taste. Whatever I have heard about this place is really true.
Price is very reasonable and pocket friendly. You have to wait long everytime you place order but it worth it.
If you haven't tasted it yet go and try at lest once, I am sure you won't regret.
Definatly would try other items. :)

As such there is nothing special about this over-hyped street-food stall except the price and freshness of the food. Momo's are average and are not served with soup. At the same price you get a decent plate of momo and soup just outside the salt lake city centre.

I've tasted momos from a handful of places in the city as well as hill stations in and outside the state, but nothing like Bapi Dar momo. Crispy, hot, freshly-made, with great stuffing and fillings of solid chicken, their chicken fried momo was totally a 'solid gulp.' I literally gulped down the momos dipping them in chili sauce which made these dumplings all the more lip-smacking and deliciously flavourful. I'd heard a lot about this place from friends yet living close enough had never tried any of their items. I finally got the opportunity to try the momo, and it was incredibly good tasting. A non-hungry person's mouth would start watering from the first bite.

So this place was on my wishlist for a very long time and we made a sudden visit to this place after watching a movie at Carnival cinemas. 
Ask anyone and they would tell you where bapi da'r momos is located and even if you can't find it, you can always recognise this place from far off as it's always crowded (and by this I mean, a crazy crowd) who shout 'bapi da,amar chicken fry!' etc, right opposite to the Karunamayee bus stop. We were bamboozled at first because people were jostling to get their orders and we didn't know whom to talk to as the staff looked really engrossed to cater to the huge crowd (I wonder how they do that everyday).
But then,we got hold of four plates of chicken steamed momos and well, I think the momos were just as the rest of the food stalls serving momos. The chicken inside was cooked to perfection but the momo was shaped pretty badly and trust me when I say that I have seen roadside stalls shaping their momos SO perfectly. The momos tasted good,no doubt,but it didn't live upto it's rating of a 4.7. 

The pros maybe that the place is in a very strategic location and attracts many office goers in the area and caters to a all classes of people (which is a good thing). So people can come here,to try this place and then come back again,if you like it and don't come back,if it fails to please your taste buds. But one thing is for sure,it will definitely please your pockets. 
Bon appetit!

I am really not a street food person, but after hearing so much about Solid Gulp from a number of friends, I just had to visit this place. I am happy to note that it is really as good as it is hyped!

First of all, the ambiance gets, well, no ratings from me, because it is located on the roadside in Karunamoyee. The service is quick, as street food service usually is. Now, coming to the food, I tried the chicken lollipop and the fish pakoras and both the items were marvelous! You would be amazed at how good food here could be! I can't speak for vegetarians, but it's a must try for non-vegetarian foodies. The food here is extremely cheap and extremely tasty.

A 4.7 rated footpath food stall named "Solid Gulp Bapi Dar Momo" seems that Bapi Da got to show his wonderful cooking talent to the world via Zomato. Well the rating is more than enough to impress & attract foodies towards him. Top of that Rs. 100 for two is icing on the cake.

Location : As per Zomato's tag on Google Maps it shows Bapi Dar Momo is located just opposite to the Karunamoyee International Bus Terminal over in Saltlake. But at that location you will find a footpath food stall with no banner or nameplates at all. So Bapi Da thinks he is famous enough that he doesn't need to hook a banner on his stall, or probably Bapi Da is running out of budget. Don't forget to ask the staffs of that stall if you have any doubts after reaching there.

Decorations : Its a busy street footpath food stall with no sittings in front of it. One thing is very uncommon over here is they use industrial gas oven where others use normal once. The stall takes a big place of footpath & made of metal. The stall looks pretty clean, still because its on open street with no rooftop hygiene is questionable. Being so famous at least a name of the stall on a banner is highly expected.

Staffs & Management : There are a number of staffs compared it is a small stall. They were always busy to serve the Salt Lake office crowd. But they will listen to you & serve you well withing few minutes.

Foods : Unfortunately I reached there near to 8pm on weekdays & found that they don't have anything left except Fish Pakoras. As per the name & other reviews I hardly wanted to try their Momos & Chicken items well Bapi Da's limited food stock disappointed me for this reason.

Fish Pakoras : There was four big size fish pakoras served in a paper plate. Pakoras were unshaped, crispy fried to every corner. Fish inside felt juicy but natural. There wasn't spices inside so it tasted quite basic. Little burned old oil smell was there, that made it little bad taste. Overall the food doesn't justifies the 4.7 rating from any angle.

Prices : 4 Fish Pakoras costs us Rs. 60 that is quite common & sizes of the pakors were okey for that.

Conclusion : Seeing the crowd & Bapi Da's confident you probably have expected a ton. As Bapi Da's stall is located just beside Karunamoyee crossing & Auto stand so a lot of Salt Lake office goers uses this place daily for their quick bite at evening times before taking their daily transport. It is how they get a large crowd & became this famous. However their food is not at all so awesome for a 4.7 rating. Not recommended for those who have followed the rating & thinking about to try this for the same reason.

Excellent place for foodies. I heard about them in zomato only. Finally visited them one day on last week. That was 6:45pm only. By that time they were finished almost. I had only their leftover fish pakora and 1 plate chicken momo. The fish pakora was filled with original vetki. And that was reasonable. Taste can beat any star rated AC restaurant.

This is why we say Kolkata has the BEST street food in India!

One of the cheapest and best places to have chicken momos in Kolkata. Along with the chicken items, the fish items are also good. A special mention to Bapi Da - no matter how busy he is, he will always give special attention to his old customers!

You ever heard of happy accidents?
One of my colleagues was once admitted in a hospital for a week; and upon being released, his first instinct was to utter the words "Karunamoyee Fried Chicken khabo!!"
And that's how I first got to taste the chicken, the story that would go down in my autobiography.

For the ones who aren't familiar to the venue, this version of "KFC" happens to be the kind of place that happy accidents are made for. The man, Bapi da, happens to be a wizard of our generation. He weaves his magic in oil and chicken and fish, and traded his wand for the ladle and spatula.

You will rarely find the place, if you're looking for Solid Gulp. Utter the name of the wizard, and ask any passerby: "Bapida-r dokan konta?"

You will have a crowd of people, who would be all too familiar with the place, and always eager to point out the place.

You must try the momos, the fried chicken, and the cutlets. If you can, try out the fish too.

Just one thing: reach within 5PM to 6PM. Reach any later, and the food disappears, just like magic!!

Do you want to try one  of the best chicken fry and chicken momo?  Then your destination should be karunamoyi more,  bapi dar shop.  
Chicken momo is famous there.  The chicken items Bapi da sells there is the most economic yet hygienic and fresh and super tasty.  
They serve chicken fry,  chicken wings,  sandwiches,  chicken lollipop and many more items.  
But remember, It doesn't matter how much you love it,  if you want to try it,  you have to be in a queue from 5 pm. :P  Because the trolly full items vanishes within just 1 hour.  
It has been a craze since my college days.  Hope it will remain as it is.  :)

If you are not aware about the place, if you have not heard about its popularity, and of course if you have not tasted the momo at this place - its a curse of your life!!
Located just at the Karunamoyee crossing, Bapi da started this stall with a very very small tool on which he used to sell the momo. Long way back in my college days, I first tried his momo and after probably 10 long years, today again I visited this place. The stall has bit expanded with few additional items added to the menu like chicken drumstick, fish fry, chicken pakoda as well. Couldn't see him, but the boys working over there were very polite and well behaved. We took one full plate steamed momo (8 pc cost 40 rupees only). Again I tasted the same elegance, the same ecstasy which I had 10 years back. I bet you can't buy such soft, mouth melting, maximum chicken filled momo anywhere in kolkata - yes I am aware about Wow momo, momore and other Tibetan cuisine food joints and still making this statement. The red sauce is just superb with exact ratio of masala and mirch added to it. 
Long live Bapi da and team for your future endeavor!! You guys rock!! \m/😎😎👍👍👌👌👏👏🎓🎓👑👑

If you want to know what real Kolkata street food tastes like, come over to this place. For those, who don't know this exists, or even it exists where is this exactly located, they are missing a lot of flavors in their life. I do not exactly remember, when this came into existence but I have been seeing this sprung up into action since quite some time now. Located right opposite to the International Bus Stand at Karunamoyee, this is just 2 minutes by auto from my residence. Thus, I make full opportunity to savor the delicacies here whenever I can.

Beware though, securing your desired order isn't a child's play here. This place is always flocked with crowds catering to different age group. You may find a school going kid as well as guys mostly from Techno studying their Grads. You would also find middle aged guys in their 30's and 40's as well as senior people trying to pack some snacks on their way back home from their office. Evidently, this place sees a lot of hustle and bustle and one gotta stick to their nerves and hold on to their patience to get their order served to them.

Their main USP is their Momos. People proudly proclaim, that this store sells one of the best selling Momos. Normal looking steamed Momos served with some dipping and they taste like heaven as soon as they reach your mouth. If you not content with just Momos, gorge in their other delicacies like the fried items they are so popular off! Pakoras, Babycorn, Gigantic sized fries, Strips, Lollypop and even Sandwich; they have it all! Amongst these, the most popular I believe are their Fried Chicken, which if I remember correctly is 30 Rs. a piece and 50 Rs. for two. Don't underestimate them. The sizes they offer are really huge. Easily, double the size of the standard Fried Chicken you would get at KFC. If you prefer something more exotic, go for their Lollypop. Perfectly fried with a lovely and tasty batter, you wouldn't think much before ordering a repeat for this.

The price which they charge is literally a joke for the quality and quantity they suffer. It is cheap dirt and economical, something even a school going kid could probably afford these days out of their pocket money! This store had ventured into Noodles and Chinese delicacies a while back as well, but probably it got shut down owing to not so much response compared to what they see for their Momos and Fried items. If you haven't visited here yet, do it right tomorrow evening. Remember to come here by 4:45 PM.

Bapi Da features quite at the top of my all time favorite list for a long time now! Owing to the shifting of my university campus nearby, my visits to Bapi Da have become pretty often now. I couldn't possibly find fault in any of the items he offers, would rather express my biasness towards his steamed momo's, which are heavenly, also, the chicken wings with their crackling brown cover and succulent chicken inside! All in all, extremely cheap and worth the pushing and shouting you have to do owing to the huge no of people lined up there! :)

Ok.
This place provides appetizing snacks for students and office workers in the nearby areas.
As the name suggests,this is basically a momo shop,though it does sell other chicken pakora related items.
Reviewing 'solid gulp' based on the momo that i had this day,
1.Its way too costly.4 momo's for Rs20?And that too with some plain chilly sauce.
2.Not a typical roadside momo that you would find in and around the city of kolkata.Below standard quality.
But once again,its a one stop appetizing destination for famishing students and office goers.

Adjectives are less to describe this, the so called road side stall. The freshness and the quality both goes hand by hand here. Am sure everyone has tried the momo and the fried chicken, but dont let the Sandwich (underdog) be missed. Taste the same and i can assure that many good sandwiches would lag behind. Just lip smacking brilliant joint

This place is in a league of its own. It's probably the cheapest place for one who has relishes fried chicken and momos. The size of a piece of fried chicken that you get for the money is huge. And the taste....ahaaaa...thats the magic...you just cant stop licking your fingers even after finishing the last morsel of chicken on your plate. The place gets crowded a lot, so make sure to reach there early.

A small stall with no place to sit but food that demands to be eaten!! Therefore, you can see the crowd infront of the counter any day you visit karunamoee after 4.30pm. No KFC can beat the chicken fry they serve here! The smell of their food soothes your olfactory senses to the core , and the food wins your heart before reaching your stomach! :)
So, all you gotta do is , grab a chicken fry , a plate of momo and their pakodas and satisfy your hunger with their pocket friendly delicacies . :)
All said and done, rush rush and rush soon!!

A small stall which has turned into a sensation, this place offers Momos, Pakoras, Lollipops etc. It doesn't have any seating arrangement. And the most important thing, the place opens around 5, and by 6/6:15 they are sold out. All you will get after 6 are maybe only the leftovers. It is also very much pocket friendly. It's a must visit if you are in around the place. Do visit. Enjoy.

Yes it's a road side stall. Yes it serves the best momos in Kolkata. No arguments whatsoever over that. 
Not only that the chicken & fish pakodas, the chicken lollypop, the sandwich, everything they serve there is just too good. Hot, crispy, juicy pakodas, just too good.
The prices are so low that automatically one will start feeling good. No seating arrangements, no delivery facility, awful lot of waiting time to get your items because of insane crowd pressure but still this is the place to be if you want some of the best quality snacks and the best momos in the City of Joy.

Passing by karunamoyee area , I decided to try out in this much hyped foodstall.
I often wondered what the hype was all about. After all its just another roadside stall. But as they say, taste and tell.
I have just tried the chicken steamed momos the chicken pakoras. Literally for as cheap as 30₹ per plate(5 pieces) they provide the best momos I have ever tasted. And being a momo-lover I have tasted momos in a lot of places. And even the pakoras. Extremely tasty. Another plus point is that each and every foot item was served piping hot!

I am thoroughly impressed. And I now realize why every regular karunamoyee-travelling person is such a great fan of Bapi da's momos. I truly look forward to taste the rest of the items the shop has to provide.

A hidden jem near the Karunamoyee more... though now it's not hidden and Bapidar Momo or Solid gulp is now very famous for its delicious ,mouth Watering Momos and its other Chinese and Tibetan dishes ...
We had Steamed Momos , Chicken lollipops, chicken drumsticks, Fish fries etc...
Momo is just outstanding and very soft ... it just melts in mouth ....
Also try chicken lollipop ...
The only con is this is a stall so the sitting arrangements is not more... just a few...

Chicken Momo is one dish, that i absolutely love. When i was in bangalore, i was fortunate enough to taste one of the best momos in the numerous tibetan streets shops near koramangala. But unfortunately, Kolkata, in spite of its proximity to the north east, couldn't lure me with momos of the same taste and texture as that of momos. Then i heard of this shop called 'Bapi Dar Dokan', near karunamoyee. I must say, the chicken momo served here absolutely satiated my cravings for some good juicy 'Chicken Steam Momo', right away. The chicken clear soup in like an icing on the cake. And does it match the same taste as that of the momos i had in bangalore? Oh boy! it beats all of them by a handsome margin. Undoubtedly the best momo of not Kolkata! Long live 'Bapi Da' and his 'Momos'.

Ohh bapi da ohh bapi da !! What a wholesome experience !! I am still burping ! This is one of the baap's of the hidden gem collection !! Although this is no longer hidden ..  a lot of people are aware of this joint and trust me if you are not snacking from this eatery you are dreadfully missing something . We decided to have an evening snack from bapi da and so we brought food. One important thing to notice is that you should be there by 5 pm afternoon because within one hour they will be sold out . we bought 1. Chicken Fry 2. Chicken steamed momo . I have added an image of the fried chicken so one would have a clear idea of how big they are . And my oh my they are amazingly tasty and only for 50 rupees. I still cannot digest that fact . But its true and it really rocks. The momo were good too but the fried juicy chicken stole the show . So those who haven't still tried yet please do . you will have one hell of a time. :)

Never knew momo could taste so good and that too from a roadside stall. I've been hearing about bapi dar momo for quite some time but never had the chance to taste it. Was passing by karunamoyee and decided to try "THE MOMOS". N o my !!! Hands down the best momos I've ever had till date. 4 piece of those cute little momos filled up with gentle amounts of chicken served hot with a tangy sauce for just Rs 30. Awesome. The momo skins are very soft and just melts in your mouth letting you savour the chicken filling. To hell with hygiene when such meatballs are waiting in your plate. I'll b back here as soon as I can for devouring(with a big D) other items on the menu. 😁

Situated right next to the Karunamoyee bus stand, this is not even a roadside joint. It is a cart run by Baapi Da, a cart that is set up every day at 5 pm and a cart whose items are exhausted within 2 hours. He sells momos, pakoras, sandwiches, lollypops and fried chicken – and all the items are bloody brilliant. The cart is overflowing with customers, who even wait around from 4: 45 pm so that they can get their order quickly. The lollypops and the fried chicken bowls are emptied as soon as they come out of the wok, and trust me, you would not waste even the tiniest piece of crumb from these deep fried dollops of goodness. And yes, all the items are crazy cheap, and a 150 bucks in your pocket would mean a satisfied soul and taste buds after the experience.

Wow! Wow! Wow! This place never disappoints me. We ordered chicken momo (Rs. 30/ 4 pieces), fish pakora (Rs. 60/4 pieces), Fish fry and chicken lollypop (Rs. 30/4 pieces). All of them were piping hot and the taste was just too good. My favorite is fish pakora and fish fry. Be there a bit early around 5-5:30 pm or else all will be over.

Bapi da was famous for his delicious fried items and momo... these place is very easy to detect... near korunamoyee to baliaghat auto stand at korunamoyee everyone can see a huge mess of people surrounding a small road side kiosk and everyone asking " bapi da akta chicken lollipop dao", " bapi da akta momo dao" etc etc... today after a long time visited this place and delighted to see the same ambience here... Bapi da had added more items to his menu like fried momo, fish fry, chicken strips etc... His Chinese section get closed... whatever his momo and fried items are all hit... though I have tried all his items, today taken chicken lollipop and fish fry... lollipop was superhit but fish fry was ordinary not bapi da standards... staffs and service are awesome... no deco... pocket pinch was very very low... loved it...

This place is a legendary snack corner located at the heart of Salt Lake.Strategically it is definitely the best place because the office goers,college goers,hospital workers,taxi and bus drivers get to enjoy their evening snack from this place.Not only that, if you're arriving to this place after 7pm then you'll find that nothing is left for you.
I have been to Bapida's Momo stall several times as a college goer,but on a trip to the city this time I couldn't miss this place.
Me and a friend drove by and arrived approximately at 530pm when the serpentine queue was just beginning to take shape.Knowing very well what will happen,we ordered for 3 plates of Chicken Steamed Momo,a plate of Chicken Fried Momo and Chicken Lollipop.

In not less than 20 minutes there was a mass gathering and people started climbing on top of one another.In other words an unbelievable crowd formation took place,and someone spotting it from far away would say that a festival was going on(indeed during durga puja there is a massive crowd like this).

We got our food delivered quickly and I had parceled it.Hopping into the driver's seat we drove away.
Coming to the food....
The momos are simply delicious-the meat proportion was very good and taste wise it was superb.No momo corner in Kolkata can actually beat this place in terms of quality and price.A plate contains 4 steamed momos and comes for Rs.30 only.
The chicken lollipop was equally tasty.Less of bones and more of the chicken flesh cooked well in oil.The same came for 4 pieces a plate and also for Rs.30.
Other chicken preparations that can be tried out are the Chicken cutlet which I've heard is very good too.

But this place has a few drawbacks.One is there is no token system at all,as a result of which there is a little chaos at the counter.I feel that the food corner can be extremely well managed if a token system is started,and also unnecessary chaos can be avoided.

All in all if you're looking for some Kolkata street food at a low cost,do not forget to taste Bapida's momo.I'm sure it will leave a mark on your taste buds.....

Well I have never seen a street food outlet so crowded...went with 3 of my friends...and to my experience the place is pretty good and offering quality food at a very cheap price I must say...we ordered chicken fried momo,chicken steamed momo and chicken lollipop...
Chicken momos were very so-so according to me ....I have had better at other places...and they don't provide the customary soup with momo...was a little disappointed..
What really stood out was chicken lollipop...the chicken was well fried,tasty,cheap.
The place goes crowded as soon as it opens...so make sure you go early..all in all I must say this is a food joint offering good food at reasonable price..but again if you search you have better street food outlets than this..

Good for takeaway if you want to properly sit down and eat. I, on the other hand, cannot control my appetite once I get hold of the plate. Great place, serving cheap quality food. Visit before 7pm.

hahahah!!!! OMG !!! This is present in Zomato as well!!! The BEST I say, the Best momo in Kolkata one can find in 20 bucks. The chicken lollypop, chicken fry , sandwich, fish fry EVERYTHING is so good here!!! Yummy!!!

Guess What!!! It is not even a restaurant!!! It is a road side stall!!! Ambience, forget about the same!!! Food is all that matters!!!People compare bapi da's chicken fry with chicken from KFC(though the chicken fry is more oily here). I repeat again, Momos here are the best!!! Compare Bapi da's momo with the momos sold at Wow Momo outlets, U will get to know why its the best!!!! One has to stand in a queue to get hold of any item and all items finish by 8 pm.

Chicken Lollypop and Momos are the best here!!! Sandwich as well.

Being a loyal customer of Bapi da, I have always been offered complementary soft drinks on the eve of Bengali new year. :)

PS: This is the first place in kolkata I tasted Momo, in 2010,and this turned out to be the best one!!! The only place I miss  !!!! This place makes me miss Kolkata!!!! I bet my friends would agree with me.

Its the first time I rated a place 5 on zomato and I have good reasons for it.
I am a frequent visitor to Bapi Da's shop for the last 5-6 years and can vouch for the quality of food they serve.Do they serve anything unique?no, but they can give the top notch resturants of Kolkata a run for their money with the quality of food they offer.From the Momo's to the chicken lolypops and fries everything is tasty.Unlike most other stalls in kolkata they serve fresh fish items.If you reach the place around 8.30, there is a good chance you might not get anything.They practically have no left overs.Its a must visit for anyone who travels via Karunamoye or stays in Salt Lake.

I tried the steamed momos, they were good, and the chicken lollipops, they were also okay. I was at the shop at around 4:55 pm, so it wasn't much crowded. Though by 5:10 pm, it was so crowded that I didn't get the chance to try the other items.

Dropped by in the evening... This place is overcrowded with people screaming and wailing for food... I somehow found it unappetizing because of all the screaming...
Coming to food, I tried the chicken momos (both steamed and fried)...they were decent... Not the best though
Then had chicken pakoda, chicken wings which tasted pretty much the same... It had a sour flavour which I somehow didn't like
Then we had chicken spring rolls which was average
Overall a pocket friendly place for college goers... Not really a place for office goers

This is the most unassuming outlet, what you see is what you get. The food is fresh and in all these years I have never seen any unsold stock.

The mono can be a bit dry on some days. I couldn't care much about the sandwiches either. What truly towers over everything else is fried stuff. The chicken pakodas, fried chicken are to die for.

Makes for the perfect affordable chaakna for that booze party. On a gastronomic note, the meat stays soft and juicy. The seasoning is just right and is not at all over bearing.

What i can say that hasn't been already said, if you love your stuffs deep fried and crispy this is the place to be. Always crowded, you have to literally fight to get your order. Anyway the food is generally very good here, occasionally you'll have a hint of chlorine in your food thats probably due to the water. I personally don't like the steamed momo they taste rather ordinary, rest how ever is really good. From chicken fry to babycorn fry everything is really flavour full and once you have it, you just wanna have more. It is a must visit place.

I visited this outlet 2-3 days back. The moderate gathering of the customers in front of the outlet gave me a good hint of their popularity. And it turned out to be very much true, at least in my case.

We've had Steamed Chicken Momo, Fried Chicken Momo & Chicken Pakora. The taste of Chicken Pakora was standard whereas both of the Momo preparations were outstanding. The specially prepared sauce was simply awesome.. though the soup that normally comes with momo servings,at least in Kolkata, was missing.

The downside is that they don't have any sitting arrangement - it's a simple roadside outlet of Momo & other fried preparations of chicken & fish, with outstanding food quality..

Bapi Da Bapi Da is all I hear when it comes to Momos and Chicken Pakoras. Today I finally got the chance to indulge myself in this much-talked-about snack joint. We had ordered for Chicken Pakora and Fish Pakora, both of which were served straight out of the frying cauldron. The taste was overflowing with divinity. I have eaten in many places serving pakoras, but these belonged to a different level altogether. The fish pakora was absolutely wonderful. The fish fillets were very mellow and seemed to be melting in our mouths. The chicken pakora was no less either.

Few months ago, I had their chicken wings at a birthday party and they too were great. Looking forward to some momos in my next visit.

The most crowded roadside outlet during evening at the karunamoyee bus stop you find is Solid Gulp for sure.People stand there for food even before they start frying things.The momo is a must try for sure.Tgere is a particular lemony flavour in the momos which is very refreshing.Another hot favourite is the chicken lolipop.No excess batter to make them big,solid drumstick pieces fried to perfection.You will find people taking up 15,20 plates of this.

If you are looking for an after office relief with affordable momos and chicken fries..this is the place. Make sure to land early because this place is brimming with people and the que gets too long. Their chicken fries and momos are just inexplicably delicious. Road side stall but food quality is very high. Be here to believe!

Writing this review im already feeling hungry. This is the Best place in kolkata ( no doubt) to find momos. I bet none can get such quality momos in any place in kolkata even if agrees to spend 10times the price. 
Go for lollipop, kababs.
I have been visiting this place for last 2 years and i found tht the quality never falls, so does the customer base.

Located opposite to Karunamoyee Bus Terminal. A roadside eaterie rather. Had to wait for half an water before even approaching to the counter. So crowded it was! Nevertheless, the momos, the fish fry, the chicken lollipop they make is just superb. Needless to say, the chicken items are fresh and marvellous. Love them!

I think this is a great place to have momo's as a plate costs just 30 bucks!! There isn't much variety of food available here. I had tried chicken momo(only chicken momo available and no veg) and veg noodles. The momo's are Worth the money but the noodles is not that great. Overall a very cheap place for evening snacks!!

Like many other restaurants/joints in Kolkata this is another over-hyped place. Taking the cheap price and the hype into account I'm inclined to the rate the food at most "better than average street food". But if you take the mismanagement and chaos into account then it is a place which probably I'm not visiting again. The only take away for me from this place was the lemon grass flavored momos. Then again it is just "better than average street food", period.

I don't believe that despite my schooling from Salt Lake, I never knew about this hidden gem for foodies. Better late than never. It is an excellent and very affordable place to grab quick bites. The fried momos and the fish pakoras are just mouthwatering. I am yet to try their chicken wings which looks delicious.

Location: Beside the entrance (from where phoolbagan bound auto is available) of Karunamoyee housing estate.

It is a small street side food joint.
Pros:
Awesome momo, chicken lollypop and chicken pakora, chicken wings, (yummyyy!!!), Crispy baby corn... perhaps one of the best in town.
Prompt service.
Reasonable price.

Cons: 
Unhygienic (quite obvious as it is street side joint)
It remains closed sometimes, leaving loyal customers disappointed. :'(
You won't get anything after 7pm. :(

This is one joint i would absolutely recommend to be featured under the zomato hidden gems section.this is a real gem.they serve only 2-3 items,but whatever they serve,is top notch,that too at unbelievably low prices.

The chicken momo,4  for rs.30.solid chunky pieces they are.how they can give so much chicken in the filling instead of the usual filling of onion and etc etc is seriously surprising.

The chicken leg fry,again 4 pieces for 30 bucks.lightly coated and marinated small leg pieces,with a flavouring of pepper and 'gandhoraj lebu',heavenly.

The hygene is impeccable too.for a roadside stall,the utensils,counter every thing is squeaky clean.they use oils of a reputed brand.the sealed oil packets are opened and poured right before your eyes.

Only wish it was closer home.

Best thing that has happened to Saltlake, unbelievable taste in unbelievable price!! How could he make chicken so tasty? Since my first time I am in love with Bapi da s preparations.. Starting form chicken momo ( that gets finished quickly by around 6.30pm) to chicken wings later in the evening, chicken pakora, fish pakora, every item is a materpiece. Franchise worthy quality at street level price, it can give any big branded restaurant chicken a run for money!!!

Been a regular customer of this stall since 2002. Recently the quality has dipped a bit in my opinion (specially of the momos) ever since Bappi da distributed most of the work to his helpers. But still,considering the price and the standard of other restaurants,it certainly is an option worth trying for once for every Kolkatan.

Devotee of this place since circa 2007.. Used to go there before my after-school tuition classes..couple of years later,i  somewhat went there religiously with my college friends..and at present every now and then i visit there after my office hours.. We all have changed a lot for these couple of years but the only thing that remained consistent is the food quality and our unadulterated love for bapi-da.
Whenever you visit karunamoyee..scratch that..whenever you visit kolkata, it would be criminally offensive if you don't try this food joint,which,if i'm not mistaken, currently ranks #2 in zomato(right after a biggie called barbeque nation) .. The spectacular food quality in an unimaginably cheap price,only god and bapida knows how to manage that..
For every other person the shop might look like another foothpath-stroller food joint, but for many food junkies this place is pure heaven..a vortex of nostalgia,with lots of good memories and equally good foodgasmic pleasures 
So in short..." bapida is love..bapida is life" ;)

Bapi Da r Chicken Fry....my colleague introduced a few pieces placed in a new paper wrap (kagojer thonga)....closed my eyes with the first bite....it sounded....kruunchhhhh....yes it was crispy and Bapi Da can give Colonel Sanders, a run for money....i am not exaggerating.... 

a small street joint in kankurgachi...selling momos and deep fried chicken and fish items....extremely popular and you can understand by the likes and the number of reviews on this forum, even the best of best in the city will be happy to get this response...super moderately priced....but just like any other street joint, eat at your own risk....it may not be the most hygenic....i would have given a 5 but deducted .5 becuase they stay closed on random days without any reason....probably Bapi Da is making a lot of money but it dissapoints the fans :))) to travel all the way to see it closed....it happened with me atleast thrice....

Good Job Bapi Da and team...chaliye jao GURU....

Oh my god I have been searching bapi dar momo in zomato . Today I got it. I didn't know it is named as solid gulp in zomato. what can I say I like every dish prepared here. From momo to chicken pakora, chicken lollypop. Fish pakora everything. It is cheap and the food is so good. It always remains crowded because of its fame. Once anybody gets aquainted with this stall always craves to have food here. Since it is a small stall the food items get finished within 1.30 hrs. This is the only problem . But apart from that bapi dar momo deserves 5/5. I have recommended this place to my other friends and they also became the fan of bapidar momo and everything available here.

We were looking to have something light on the way back, and decided to have momos here, about which I have heard much. It is basically a small stall, but enormously popular with the locals. But by the time we reached, they had run out of almost everything. The only thing left was chicken pakora. After standing for like 20-25 minutes, one of my friends managed to get a plate of chicken pakora. The pakoras were good. Crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Better than the ones we get at KFC, and at a much cheaper price. The only thing that I disliked about this place was the crowd management. The guy was surely struggling to keep up with the pace, and people who ordered late got theirs before we managed to get. Other than that, a must try,

What can i say about this place!! The amount of pain you have to take to order and get hold of one plate just vanishes as soon as the epic pakoras and lollypops hit your taste buds.
All the items are amazing. Have been there numerous times. They cook live in front of you with 3 huge kadhai. Each time a different item comes up on rotation basis. Simple thumb rule to follow here is just take whatever comes out.
I will not single out any item as all are fantastic. In the end the bottomline is that this place will serve you better chickens than KFC. So just go out there and fight and earn your share. Enjoy!!

I used to love the momos and the chicken lollipop was to die for. The best part is that its pocket friendly. Sadly I don't find the food as good as it used to be.

This is one of the most celebrated roadside eateries available and rightfully so. Ideal for an inexpensive snack, this place is thronged by corporates and students alike. The momos are lip-smacking and the chicken preparations are crispy and crunchy. They can even give KFC a run for their money! The only cons are the limited menu and lack of seating facilities.

4.8 for a road side snacks corner. I was very curious about trying. On a Sunday this place was crowded like regular busy office day. We tried chiken lolypop Rs 30 for 4 pcs. It was yummy, simple chiken fry, no xtra coat to make it big. I will try all the items later. 
For now one thumb up that you might try this place.

It's 5-8 pm they say.

No more "no" to street foods.

I have heard of this place a lot. I had been asking my friend for a very long time to visit this place, however we were not able to catch up with Momo. It was this Monday, we both finally made it. Awesome!...it tastes wow...hot, tasty, good amount of staffing and not at all smelling. I avoid having street momos...but this one was fabulous. It doesn't end here, we even ordered for fish pakora. Delicacy! Hot, crunchy, fresh flesh....good one. The best part is, it is not expensive. I should say "cheap", compared to other momo outlets. One must try out this place and everyone should try this place. Heaven for momo lovers and paradise for non-momo lovers. I am looking forward to my next visit.

Solid Gulp is one of the cleanest eatery around Saltlake and most affordable food joint. The food served is awesome, heavenly chicken, fish fries and momo are served fire hot. Amidst all the heat around one will find an ever cool person, Bapi Da! Kudos to him and his team. Keep up the great job sir. See you again, soon!

Whenever i came over to karunamoyee I always wondered why the rush infront of this stall. 
On a weekend, a friend took me to this place and we literally had a plate each of everything on sale.
It has been by far the best fried chicken momos and fried fish pakoras that I have consumed till date.
Now, whenever i am hungry and i am passing by the karunamoyee bus stop i halt to have something from here (mostly the fish).

The one thing that you can't miss if you're near Karunamoyee or sector 2 is Bapi dar momo. It's a small shack that is easy to be not seen because of all the crowd. Bapi da serves a lot of other dishes alongside momos. And all of them are equally good.

Have been there several times ...... located at karunamoyee saltlake ,as a small roadside joint or maybe called as 'jhoops' as they say it :) .....
Few points on them:
It opens at around 5:05 to 5:10 pm ....and closing time varies from 6:15 to 6:45 approx till stocks last ....
A huge crowd gathers even before it opens and as it starts taking orders, it looks like the door in a metro train has opened at Dum Dum at ofc time .... u can see people struggling to wade into the crowd to place their order ....
They mainly serve chicken momo,both steamed and fried .... chicken fry .... chicken lollypop and chicken pakora .... but its not everyday that u would all these items ....
chicken momo - Rs 30 per plate (4 pieces)
chicken lollypop - Rs 30 per plate (4 pieces) ..
chicken fry - Rs 50 per piece (really large piece)

Recently they have increased the price of chicken lollypop and momo from Rs 20 to Rs 30 ,but still its damn cheap ....
Their main USP is quality food over such cheap rate ....!! Talking about momo, there is hardly a place in kolkata which serves momo like they serve it here .... here u wont find other stuffings or fillers ,but only large chicken piece inside the momo .... u would realize it in a single bite ..... my personal fav is the chicken lollypop ....
Prevously bapida was the only person who used to handle everything but that was a long time back ....now he has several other people to take care of it, still they find it challenging to cater to the demand of the huge number of customers .....

Bapi da's shop located at Karunamoyee is one of the most crowded joint you will come across in any given evening. It is basically a Thela which sells various mouth watering snacks like momos, chicken pakora, chicken wings fry, baby corn fry, fish fry, sandwiches,  etc. Nowadays they have also started serving noodles and chilly chicken. The taste and quality of the snacks have been consistent over the years and Bapi Da along with his efficient team has served us the best of food and made us crave for more. If you are working in salt lake area and pass by Karunamoyee and want to grub a quick bite then Bapi Da's shop is the appropriate destination.

A street side eatery at Karunamoyee crossing in Salt Lake, it is famous among the office-goers for an evening snack. The place is not hard to spot as it is always mobbed and crowded. It opens shop at 5pm and by 8pm it is all sold out. The chicken fry and the chicken momos are exquisite. The setback is that you have to wade into the human mob and fight & bribe your way to the counter to get a shot at ordering.

Recently met with Bapi da. Nice person..busy handling his business. Cleanliness is one key area they look into.
The Fried momo..is fully stuffed with chicken. Quite tasty with the sauce. The Chicken Pakoda was awesome...quite hot n juicy inside. The Fish Pakoda was immensely tasty. The Chicken lollipops are simple but one of the best around, quite a lot of chicken meat and the oozing juice.
No wonder this place has made such a craze in the area and around. They are different in what they do...keeping their basics clear. :)

Bapi Da'r Momo! This street stall is synonymous with paradise! It serves the most delicious Chicken Wings and Chicken Pakodas , Chicken Momos off a van. They are at cut throat rates, a plate for 50 Rs only! It is always crowded, overcrowded actually and their items just keep vanishing off the counter. They use fresh oil for frying and their food never gets stale. Accepted their food are a bit oily and greasy, but who cares with taste like that? Best ever!

I will go with 3.5 as I never had stomach upset although it's a street side joint hence guess they used decent quality oil. They are famous for their momo but I would say their fried pakoras are better than momo. Only problem all fried items uses same masala hence taste same. very crowded on weekdays hence go by 7:30 pm else will not find anything.

Cheap and yummy food is what makes food at Bapi da's food stall awesome!!!The place is open for only few hours and always over-crowded. I do not prefer roadside food but this place is hygienic. Fries are made right in front of your eyes. Thus, they are served extremely hot. I had almost burnt my fingers the first time I had fried chicken from this place.Chicken momo has good amount of chicken stuffing though I disliked the sauce. Chicken lollipops are a hit. Fried chicken is huge and not that impressive. Fish Fries are amazing. Make sure you pay a visit to this place if you are around Karunamoyee in the evening.

Bapi dar momo is great. It is owned by this awesome guy who had the guts to be free from being an corporative slave and start with this food stall at karunamoyee beside karunamoyee housing complex main gate. 
It is open for business only in the evening just for few hours and if u r late u might have to come back empty handed. As things sell here like hot cakes. 
The chicken Momo is hot fav and so is bapi dar fried chickens and chicken pakora.

Well, they say you need to go fast to have a bite there. Rightly said. Located right opposite the Karunamoyee Bus Stand, this place is not hard to find. It's just by the road. 

We reached there by 5:10 and this place was already filled with so many people. Anyway ordered two chicken momo's. Fried and Steamed and they were really really great with a touch of lemon in it. Certainly good taste. If not the best, certainly right up there. Then ordered Chicken Lollipop. This was equally crispy and served hot. Really good.
And guess what, all this at the cost of just 80. Would you believe it? No? Well, it's true. 

What's so good about this place is that it uses fresh oil and everything every time, something even reputed hotels don't, let alone roadside food joints. 

This was on my list for such a long time and finally i visited this place. Highly recommended for cheap, " SOLID " food.

It's rated ' 4.8 ' , no wonder. Right after BBQN. Deserving food wise at least. The only reason i won't give it a 4.5 is because it lacks a proper dining thing, in this hot weather eating food and hot food standing is really tiring. That's it. Otherwise, this place is a must try.

This little food joint has been on my radar ever since I started using zomato about a year ago but since it isn't directly on my way of commute, I could visit it just today. It was a friend who recently suggested visiting this place and since I was aware of the great review this place gets I decided to visit it after all. So this place is situated like almost exactly at karunamoyee bus stand/auto stand. I had already heard that post opening at 5pm, the food items don't last beyond 6.30pm at the most and accordingly I reached exactly at 5 only to find the place already crowded by people waiting to get their orders served and some of the fried items we ordered had to wait till the 2nd batch of the product was fried. Anyhow, appearance wise no one can tell how good the food is here cause it looks like any other roadside food kiosk. Me and another one of my friends had gone today and we ordered steamed chicken momos, fried chicken momos, chicken lollipop and fried chicken. Each and every item tasted just heavenly and another thing worth mentioning here is that the sauce that they provide with the food is a quality product and not the sub-standard shit they usually provide in road side fast food centres. Also, since we had reached just at the time of the opening of the shop, I noticed them pouring fresh batch of frying oil in the frying pans which further satisfied my mind of any health issues arising from eating there. All these orders and it cost us just a meagre 130 bucks which kinda makes me wonder whether even 250 bucks will be crossed if 2 people eat all of the items on their menu. Only regret that I have is that they don't have a dine-in area cause standing and eating all these sizzlingly hot food while sweating like anything in this weather is a bit of a hassle. Otherwise good food, great location, totally pocket friendly pricing...definitely would visit again and also suggest others to try this place out. :)

The momos are superb and the way people surround this stall makes one wonder whether its being distributed for free or what....the best Momos in town with an equally stupid service team who act as if they are god's chosen one ... At times its a herculean task to extract a plate of Momo from them as they are dumb for words.they even have fried snack items which are average as they are way too oily or under fried
 at times. The owner is a dimwit par excellence.
The ordering experience mars the excellent momos on offer..pls pay attention so called Bapi Da..

After hearing a lot about the place, finally got a chance to visit here. The stall is small and hard to locate, so ask the stalls near karunamoyee crossing. As the momo usually finished up early, so we have to leave early from office. We left office at 5:15pm and reached there at 5:40pm. Oh my God, what a huge queue for momo. The steamed chicken momo was great in taste. The outer skin was thin and soft, inside the chicken mix has light spicy taste and a nice smell of lemon! Awesome. Then comes the fries. Boneless fish pakora and chicken fry. One thing to mention, they cut 5 new pack of emami sunflower oil in front of all the customers and used it for deep fry. The fish was fresh, soft and tasty, batter was simple. The chicken fry was one fourth of a chicken, marinated well and fried with a little spicy batter. You just can't expect this quality of food from a roadside stall and such a low price.

Bapidar momo is a phenomenon in itself which you simply have to experience to believe.The fact that a simple road side joint is featured on zomato and rated so highly speaks volumes for this place.

Located right in Karunamoyee crossing,the popularity and demand for this place is immense.They open at around 5 in the afternoon and are generally out of stuff by 7.30.

The first time I visited the place I was amazed at how many people were actually jostling with eachother to get their hands on the momos and the fries.When I had my first bite I knew why.The quality of the stuff they offer here are excellent and the prices are unbelieveably cheap.

The chicken lollipops are my favourite.They are crisp and served dead hot.The marination is excellent.The chicken fry at around 50 bucks is simply a steal.It is good enough to give the likes of kfc a run for their money.The momos are succulent with a thinnish coating and a generous amount of stuffing inside.They also have fish pakoras nowadays which are not as good as the others but pretty decent nonetheless.

The staff are nice and friendly especially considering the huge rush.For a small road side joint they maintain decent hygiene and cleanliness.

Overall Bapidar momo is something unique and fascinating.It is one of the best places you can go to for a tasty evening snack without even worrying about the pocket pinch.

One of the finest chicken pakodas in town is here at Bapi Da's stall. No seating space, no delivery but still wins over heart simply because of mouthwatering chicken items. I've had their food more than any other place in the area. Worked for almost 7 years nearby and visited this place a million times. Their food items are always sold our way before closing time so you can imagine how good it is. Very bwrybreasonable price and I love it.

Talking about momos! Big. Filling. Delicious. Cheap. Heavenly. 
The place in itself is a small roadside stall but don't go by the appearance. The momos they serve are one of the best in town. 
Haven't tried those drumsticks and friend chicken yet. 

If momos are your true love and you are not so bothered about the ambience and all you care about is good food, then this is the right place for you.

What can one expect from a roadside food stall? Nothing much, right?
You come to this place with 0 expectations & suddenly wonder why is all the crowd waiting to eat while there are 2-3 similar stalls nearby who combined sell <1/10th of this one.
If you are a health food guy you order a plate of momo (if you only reach before 6:00 pm or it's over. If you are someone like me who loves good food then along with the momo you get inclined to try the chicken drumsticks as 90% people around you are ordering that.
You eat your stuff, go home.
Next day after office even if you do not need to go to Karunamoyee, I assure you will be tempted to go. That's the magic of good food.
Bapi Da is a magician who sells the most mouth watering finger food in the city at the most pocket friendly rates.
N BTW if you expect to spend 300 bucks as per zomato for 2 people you'll probably not be able to eat anything for dinner as well. :)

Very reasonable price, awesome quality and good quantity are the hall mark of bapi da"s foods. Ch. Wings, ch. Lollipop and ch. Momo are the master pieces of this roadside eatery. in ambience i have to give 0 out of 5 but in everything else they are the best.

Though this is just a roadside stall, the momos and chicken fries sold here are absolutely lipsmacking! The prices are cheap and the food you get is the best in town! The momos are just out of the world!

Warning: you may have to wait for half an hour or more for a plate of food! The rush is that big! And we do wait because it's worth it!

Momos r ok. Nothing worth mentioning. Too oily for my taste. Momo fillings are lesser than any good joint. On a crowded evening they can easily forget ur order so be ready to remind them a number of times.

So cheap...sooooooo good. If you want a good ambience, a warm hospitality, a quiet soothing place to eat.... Oh boy! I feel sorry for u.... THROW AWAY THOSE AROSTOCRCY. Chant the name of the lord 'bapi da'. Chicken momo: 4 pieces 20/-. Chicken lollypop : 4 pieces 30/-. Chicken wing fry: 50/-. Chow : just heavenly..40/- only. The list continues..... The best fast food store I have ever seen. Super quality. Huge quantity. If you ever go in that korunamoyee area, please don't miss bapi da... This is a request.... Long live Bapi da...

Generally, owing to my office timing, I used to reach this place not before 7.30pm. And invariably I would miss out on the much touted momos. But the piping hot wings and chicken lollipop have always been a treat along with their homemade sauce. 
Just recently I got the most coveted opportunity to be at the joint when it just opened, and although I was quite full, I went for the momo. And now I know why people are so crazy about it. First of all it costs Rs. 20. Anyone could buy it. Secondly, unlike other places, these guys actually fill the dumplings with maximum stuffing and the maida jacket is so thin, thus not diluting the actual taste of the stuffing inside. And the sauce. Oh so amazing. I felt guilty that I took more than what was needed of the sauce and had to waste it as it was spicy to be had just like that. Overall, a 5 on 5 for the momos alone considering the taste,  hygiene and most importantly the satisfaction a food joint such as this provides.

Well what can i say about this place?
This place offers the best momo and chicken lollipop considering their price tag.
Though they are a street side food stall but the quality of their food is very good and that is why they attract so many customers.
Drawbacks- They can add few more items in the menu and they could do something to improve some seating arrangements.

Just on the side-walk of karunamoye, this is a small roadside junction with some tasty food waiting to be gulped.
I have tried their momos and chicken wings, and both happen to be delicious. The price is a little high as compared to the other places in the category, however, their quality is far better than the others.
It is definitely worth a stop.

Finally visited this much famed place today. Tried the fried chicken,Momo and lollipop , well the food is very good. I found the quantity and quality both way ahead of other road side stalls ,as well as the food is value for money . You shouldn't waste hundreds of rupees at KFC before trying out the fried chicken here . 
All the dishes are well prepared and cooked in good quality oil,(I saw them cook the food in front of me ). I would highly recommend this place to everyone who wish to grab a fast bite.

if you are near karunamoyee and keen into Fast food... you can spend some time here... 
The moment chicken pakora, fish pakora, babycorn pakora is ready, it gets finished , so you can think of the taste, popularity and quality of the items.

it's just a stall on the road side,when you go for first time, you wont even recognize it - this small stall could be so famous but once you taste the momos, pakora or anything ... you will get to know why...

everything used here is super fresh whether it's chicken or Fish ( bhetki ) .
fish pakora (4 pieces) costs - Rs. 60/plate
babycorn pakora costs - Rs. 30/plate
i would say if you are not in hurry and don't ave any problem eating by standing , then you can enjoy some tasty food here....

Being from a College in Saltlake, there's no way I wouldn't know about Bapi Da's momo. I visited them at a time when Zomato wasn't there. And still they were as famous.

From steamed momos to fried, from chicken lollypops to drums of heaven, they had all sorta chatpata snacks at equally tempting prices. So many treats were given here, so many evening snack-cravings satiated. I just get nostalgic thinking of this place.

It's good to see they are making it even bigger now. Cheers Bapi da. :) 
We will always visit your place whenever we're in Kolkata!

Delighted to see the rating in Zomato!! Seriously, this tiny little food joint has created history  with its amazing and fabulous dishes not only in Salt Lake but outside the region as well! Me, residing in Ajoynagar area , quite far from Karunamoye, went to this place several times to grab a bite of Bapi da's one of a kind Fried Chicken or Momos!

All the dishes - Fried Chicken, Chicken boneless pakora, chicken momo, chicken wings , the sandwiches, everything is just stupendous! They all are mouth watering, enough in portions, matchless in value for money! Fried chicken far better than KFCs, Momos Far better than Wow Momo, sandwiches far better than any good quality cafes! That's the standard Bapi da has set!! Full of chicken, the momos tastes amazing with the unique chutney ! Sandwiches are literally stuffed with chicken and mayo!! Just Fantabulastic !! :) :)

This little shop proves that if the food you offer is one of a kind and matchless, people will come just for the love of food, over and over again even though you don't have a fancy dining area or a Hi-fi ambiance! 
Go there once and you will come back for more! That's a challenge!! 

Food: 10/5   ........:P
Ambiance:   Who cares !!
Service: 5/5 One man army, really friendly and cordial!

The shop remains atrociously crowded and all the food sells out in just 2-3hours! The prices are low beyond expectations and the food is better beyond dreams!

This is one of the best food you can get at such pocket friendly prices. The specialties will be Momo, Chicken lollipop, Chicken fry. The others are also great if you compare the price but these are exceptionally delicious. The only thing being the long queue that you need to be in in order to get your items delivered.  5.30pm -7.30 and everything will end in the blink of an eye, thats how popular and amazingly good this place is.

A must visit for anybody going near Karunamoyee in Bidhan nagar.

Food: It provide large quantities of tasty chicken fried dishes and momos at very nominal rates. Hence, it is a paradise for chicken lovers. I am tired of taking my chicken fanatic boyfriend to this place. He just never gets bored. The secret is apparently in the coating of the fries. The speciality of Bapi Da's momo's is that he doesn't adulterate the filling with unnecessary vegetables, etc. He prefers simple solid chicken. Sometimes you also get fish items and chow mein. The chow mein, be it veg or egg or chicken shows no signs of stinginess. Vegetarians can occasionally find broccoli and baby corn fries but they aren't as tasty as the chicken counterparts although the quantity is huge. I rate it 4.5/5.

Ambience: Truly doesn't matter. It's not a restaurant but just a small food shop. There is a small bench that can seat as many as only 3 people at a time. Generally, people stand and eat their food and quickly place their next order. I'm not rating this.

Service: Very efficient staff cooking and serving at the same time. Their oil is fresh, their packing is good and their behaviour is nice. They are always... mind it... always high in demand. Considering that, their speed is fairly good. I rate it 4/5.

Price: Seriously nominal. We all wonder how does the owner manage. The food is worth much more than what they charge.

For a place like this, overall, I have to give it 4.5/5.

Good place for a light snack. Be it momo or chicken pakora or drumstick. You get it all. A joint which is always crowded by people starting from the office goers to the students. Located at the heart of salt lake, karunamoyee. But you gotta be fast because food here doesn't last long due to the high sale.

More popularly known as Bapi da's mono, this small kisosk strategically located at the prime location of Karunamoyee in Salt Lake delivers the best possible momo in vicinity. N when I say best, it is coat effective at the same time. Besides, other hot and tasty delicacies like Chicken Lollipop n pakoda are served here too. One downside, you might have to beat down a deluge of hungry foodies trying to catch the attention of the service persons. But, you are sure to taste the best and most economical plate of great momos right here. So, it is definitely worth the fight and the travel, if you stay far off.

The momos are nothing extraordinary. But it sells just due to the LOCATION and the price compared to the location and the local clientele who don't have any variety nearby at such price in Salt Lake.. If the location would have been South Kolkata or some market area of Kolkata it would be just regular momo available in the city. 
The fried items are really good with such pocket friendly price.

Finally I got a chance to have their chicken momo and chicken lollypop. And, I must say the food quality and the price makes up for the long queue. Went there at 5, people have started to gather around already, ON went the cookers. What I really liked is that they were pouring oils from freshly cut packets and there were no residual oil in the kadhais. The wait for the food, amongst the crowd is a bit frustrating but the food quality makes up for it. Finally, the price that you pay makes you wonder how they manage to maintain so good quality at such a price. Hats off, Bapida, way to go!!

At first i was amazed to see the rating of this place. I was really curious to visit there. It was not at all hard to find. When we reached there, we were just spell bounded after the scene. We couldn't have imagined that a roadside shack can pull this amount of customer. I got worried about a thing that it might get a decade to get the food. Reluctantly i said to my  partner that let's go to another place. But she insisted to stay there. So i got into the fighting queue. But surprisingly i got the food very early than what i had anticipated. The service is really good. Somehow managed to collect 2 plates of momo. But believe me the momo was really worth of having. It was really very tasty. We even got another plate of momo despite the fight was going on to grab the momo. As i said the taste was worth it. But one thing was missing. And that was soup. They don't offer soup with momo. Anyways, next wanted to try some another item. So tried the chicken fry & chicken lollypop. Well without any hesitation i can say that it was also very tasty. And more over it was just cooked so the hot smoke was coming out of it. We enjoyed it with every bite. And honestly all the struggle to grab the food was really worth of everything. I must say that don't go by its look. Just go there & take a look at its customer, that will tell the rest of the story. I am counting my days to visit at there again.

Located bang on at karunamoyee near the beleghata connector auto stand,this place remains perennially crowded between 5:30-7,rather until stocks run out.

If crunchy,tasty and sinful is your thing,you need to visit Bapi da.
At the same time,be prepared to ignore the falling hygeine standards,hungry dogs waiting for you to throw them a bone and lack of seating arrangements.
However the price and taste more than makes up for it.
The chicken fried items are dirt cheap.
Momos-20/4 pc
Chicken lollipop-30/4 pc
Chicken pakora-35/5 pc boneless
Chicken wings-40/2 pc
Chicken thigh-50/1 pc
Baby corn-20 plate
Be prepared to brave the crowd and you shall have an experience which will leave you craving for more. Always.

If you are a frequent Karunamoyee-commuter, you know Bapi da'r momo'r stall, and one can easily find you there at 5 in the afternoon, queueing for that delicious paper plate full of steamed chicken momos or that mouthwatering fried chicken.... Or both.... 

One who's been there knows what it's all about... It ruins your adventurous nature, one that comes with finding new grub-joints(it seriously is that good) ... And that it seriously suits your pocket is another thing completely... I seriously doubt whether you'd get a plate of momos(4-5pieces) at 20 bucks!!!!!!!.... Or that crispy fried chicken in 50 bucks!!!!!....

Being one who's spent almost half a life in Salt Lake, Bapi Da and I have been in quite a long relationship... And quite frankly, I don't wanna break up quite as yet..

Went there a couple of week back,was excited to see a road side vendor to get such good reveiws over zomato about their food ....but I think the reveiwers missed some important part the hygeine
Though at initial stage visiting them we were happy to see good kitchen equipments with them ,thought they would be a bit profesional at the road side too ,
We ordered steamed chicken momos rs. 20 4 pcs nly,no chatni found served only with a sour chilli sauce,fillings not gud at all bone pieces came into our mouth while having them
Than chicken fry pakoro came full of oil,than came fish pakora @ rs.60 which was bit ok and at last I ordered veg fried rice @ rs. 30,so after getting it we saw the person who prepared our fried rice was cleaning the pan over the oven only by pouring a dirty water into it and stirring it with a small broom in hand ,which was kept at a sewere pipe near by,god we just threw away the rice for the dogs nearby,to all reviewers -food taste n quality are important but not at our healths stake
And dear zomato they might b pocket friendly but they are a total unhygeine so for me overall 0 out of 5 to them

Being an extreme lover of momos,my first choice for indulging truly mouth watering soft and heavenly momos always,since the day i first tried out momo at this little joint has been bapi da's momos. Though this place doesn't offer dine in facilities,still you don't mind standing between all those people grasping their orders and dogs roaming about to grab a bite of freshly cooked momo at this place. If you don't mind the ambience and concentrate solely on what your taste buds are feeling actually you won't ever be disappointed. This place offers great momo along with other varieties like fried chicken,chicken lollipop,fish pakora,chicken pakora,crispy baby corn and more. I have tried out only the chicken items on their menu and was never disappointed a bit considering the price you have to pay for such yummy mouth watering foods. I suggest our 'bapi da' to make seating arrangements for his customers so that people get attracted more to this place and people like me being their regular customers get some good place to seat and savour more of his momo.

the fried momos are one of the best I have had in the city! I was lucky to even have some fried baby corn that was absolutely delicious!! 
The only downside is their food is available between 5:30pm to 7:30pm and most of the things are not available after 7.

Let me ask you a question. How many street side food joint is listed in Zomato? I am aware of only one and that is Bapi Da r Momo. That's is enough to say the food quality or hygiene.
Main struggle is to order food through huge crowd. You need to have a loud voice to make your presence felt.
Ordered Steamed Chicken Momo, Fried Chicken Momo, Fried Chicken, Chicken Pakora and Fish Pakora.
Each and every item is meaty enough to satisfy one's craving. Loved Fish Pakora and Momo. Fish Pakora has twist of ajwain and momo though without soup was the best in town. Chicken Pakora and Fried Chicken will remind you of KFC flavour.
Entire order value was INR 180. Try to have it straight out of the pan to enjoy the actual taste and crunchiness. Taking it to home and reheat loses its spark.

Fast food centre is always an interesting joint for food lovers. This place has always been in my wish list. I was lucky to enjoy their tasty food this weekend. Chicken mono was perfect at reasonable price. I have tasted better dimsums than this only in mainland China. Chicken lollypop and chicken fry are both tasty,crunchy and juicy. One cannot skip them if they visit this place.

A little walk away from home, this place has always been on the top of my list for places to hangout for a quick evening snack.
Each and every dish they offer is mouth watering, from the heavenly momos to the juicy chicken fries and pakoras!
Try anything and u wont be disappointed! Have tried out pretty much everything they offer in the non veg section. A thumbs up for each of them.
Saw that they've recently started selling chow mein and Fried rice too!

I came to know about this tasty corner, as soon as I joined my office in sector V. Once I tasted those fried yum stuffs, I could not resist myself, walking all the way to Karunamoyee to have them again and again. Chicken lollipop is my all time favourite and the fish pakora. But remember to be on time (6-7 p.m.), else you will miss them out to other foodies.

You know you have reached bapi dar momo....when u see a huge crowd and smell chicken at the heart of karumoyee...a place for hardcore carnivores as it is....
If you are a person who is bothered about the ambience more than food this place is not what you would like.
But the most amazing thing about this place is the way it connects bengali "choper dokan" with "fried chicken" and the connection is one match made in heaven...as you indulge in the fried chicken... You know you would never be happy to waste your bucks on any other fried chicken outlet...as its worth every penny....
Chicken wings are to die for....
The best thing about the place??? You get to see the chicken being fried and shout.." amar taa age de bhaai"

It's a very small joint located right at the edge of karunamoyee bus terminal. The long queue in front of the joint makes it very easy to spot.
The CHICKEN MOMOS are very good stuffed with satisfactory amount of chicken but cold. I didn't like anything about the CHICKEN LOLLIPOP except that they were cheap. They just drop the pieces in hot oil and take it out when the colour changes.

This tiny eatery is located right opposite the main gate of karunamoyee bus stand , a few feet away from the fruit stalls near the more, and right behind the auto stand. Their fried momos are served 5 in a plate , and taste good , stuffed with chicken filling. The chicken pakoras are boneless , as are the chicken strips . The pakoras are small in size , but taste great. Do try out their chicken strips , which tastes amazing for its 50 RS for two price tag. The chicken wings here taste good too, and usually have two leg pieces of chicken in a plate. The place is always super crowded , and all their items are sold out before 7-30! Do try out the chicken items here ; if you're a fan of KFC , this is your friendly neighborhood alternative .

We took a cab ride all the way to Karunamoyee and yet managed to miss out on Bapida's momos. "Momo shesh" - those two cruel words rang in our ears and to get over our disappointment we ordered two plates of Bapida's fried chicken. 

Fried chicken is 3:00 am after a night of drinking food for me - I've never really been able to enjoy it sober - until I encountered the great BFC - juicy, crunchy, yummy coating, perfectly seasoned chicken. This man deserves to get franchised - corporate India, are you listening?

Went there yesterday and had fried chicken, and fried momos while waiting for an auto. I can actually understand all the hype about the momos here. We took fried ones, and they were brilliant: very thin coating, much crunchier than other places (crunchier than Wow Momo and Blue Poppy). The mixture had a very stable consistency. We had all four while standing on the road, without spilling a single crumb. So. 

The chicken fry, on the other hand, was just mediocre. It's too big to be a roadside snack, really. It was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, as should be. But the crust was too thin for me, and the whole thing lacked flavour. I'm not a big chicken fan anyway, so I'm probably  going to skip it next time. 

I'm going back there again today, just for the momos and I suggest, if you're in the vicinity anytime in the afternoons, you do the same!

Finally managed to come here on an evening with just the sole purpose of eating and in some ways it was an OK decision. 
Firstly this food joint is too popular and that makes you wait really long to grab your bite, but despite it's reputation there are certain things that are on the disappointing side. 

Basically you can't sit here to eat, it's mostly a take-away. The famous momo's are served just with red chilli sauce, no soup is there, that doesn't make it less popular though ;-). 

The thing on the good side is the value for money.
4 pieces of chicken momo costs Rs20 only. 
A plate of chicken lollypop costs you Rs30 and comprises of 4 pieces. 
A plate of fish pakora(4 pieces)  at Rs60, and single piece of chicken fry costs Rs50 only. 

Bapi da had been providing quality food at real reasonable prices over the years, and at times it is great to forget about the oil and health stuffs and jump into the hot fried foods. :-D

I like bapi dar momos better than those of denzong , which is one of the good momo shops in kolkata. Bapi dar momos are not as juicy as the traditional momos but they have chicken chunk with bits of spring onions .
I feel this style complements the dish at par, when compared with a nice shreded chicken stock inside the momo way..
The momo sauce lacks stage... I think Neither the customers nor the owner care about the quality of the sauce. I personally didnt like the sauce here.

This is an example of what a food business is supposed to be for the general public. The taste, quality, quantity and the price is the benchmark to follow. Not that its difficult to find its substitute in kolkata but also in other cities. All the foodstalls in the city who is unable to run their show profitably sud get some lesson from this man ( and his group). The shop is only run for few hours in the evening yet sales are something which others cant match for their whole week. Hats off to bapi da. May you open outlet in central also.

We keep going to Bapi da's stall at least thrice a month after office. The place opens at around 5pm and is always crowded. We always have 2 plates of chicken momo which costs 20/- per plate. one plate contains 4 momos only. the the momos are stuffed with chicken and are sure to stimulate ur taste buds. Sometimes we also help ourselves to chicken pakoras and chicken lollipops. The pakoras are a bit oily but delicious. A must visit for people living/working/studying in and around karunamayee salt lake

however, prices have increased over the years but not their quality.... hats off to them...kudos to the team.

Bapi dar momo Needs no introduction as the quality and the test tells the all. Located at the karunamoye. They serves the best momos in the city at this price. They also provide chicken fry (which is a leg piece ), chicken lollypop,  fish pokora, and also feied baby corn. Opens at around 5pm and all the items are finished within 2 hours. So if you want to test the momos then you need to think about the time also.

Bapi dar momo. The name is enough for people in and around Karunamoyee. Solid pieces of juicy momos.... slurrrppp... 1 plate costs Rs 20/- for 4 pcs. U can not stop urself from having the 2nd plate. 
Chicken Lollypops, Fried Chicken all are too good and hot selling in the eatery. 
Only thing that might turn u down is the extreme crowd at the counter.  U need to wait for a considerable time to get the good food. 
Hence,  highly recommended.

Bapi da's (an IIHM Coimbatore graduate) journey and motto of this small Momo & Fry stall should be documented and taught as some Case Study in Hotel management schools and B-schools I guess. Here with every bite, you will be able to smell honesty  in the dishes, the motto it seems is - Give your customers "the Best" and don't try to fool them, just be honest, they will recognize your efforts. Specially in hotel & restaurant business you should first make good & tasty food, rest every thing else is secondary. All the items at Bapi da's stall have just struck the right note. They are all super tasty and so much filled with the real substance that there is no place for thick fillings of besan or cornflower, etc in any place which is found even in big hotels. These wholesome dishes gives your soul the ultimate gastronomical bliss which is rarely found these days at right amount of money. For a plate of chicken momo, one plate of boneless chicken pakora, one fried chicken breast piece I had to pay only Rs.90/-, just unbelievable, specially when the food has only solid chicken inside it and nothing else, no gimmick nothing. Also we received the food items really fast, all three items were packed and handed over to me in 5-7 minutes. Special mention - The chicken breast fry was super tasty, also the chicken momo at Rs.5/- per piece was filled with so much minced chicken inside that you are bound to come back to this place! This is the first time I'm rating one food joint 5 out of 5 since they are delivering far above expectations, they will surely leave you dumbfounded. So, just grab a bite today!! Cheers!

This is the tastiest ever roadside shop you would find in the whole of kolkata ! It's just a small stall under the open sky with no places to sit even , but my goodness, you should see the rush all the time. You'll be in a crowd of fifty people stretching your hands to give the money and ask for the food ! But doing so is worth it cause you'll find the most delicious chicken snacks here just within minutes.

A plate full of 4 big momos with sauce will cost you only 20 bucks ! But you dont need to stop at that. Try off the chicken pakoras ! They're just yummy, juicy and delicious at such low prices ! One big piece of succulent chicken in crisp fried batter will be the chicken drumstick . And sometimes you find barbeque kebabs too !

Situated at the prime location of karunamoyee crossing , this place is always a MUST visit if you tend to change vehicles at that place. I myself walked a lot from my tuitions to just have a bite every week.
So, kudos bapi-da ! You rock ! :-)

I AM A MOMO AND FRIED CHICKEN FAN
This place has become a legend for momos and fries. Located near Slat Lake Karunamoyee this place is like a fried chicken heaven for me and my partner. We try to visit there atleast one very month. For me their chicken fries are better then KFC. Price is very cheap. almost everything on the menu is brilliant. 
Momo are full for meat, soft and well steamed who ever they do not give any soup with it. (actually you dont need soup the momos are themselves the kings)
Crispy fried baby corn are brilliant
Chickens are well fried, crispy and jiucy 
for me this place is as good as KFC (Kolkata Fried Chicken)
for me and my friend group this place is a must visit for every month.

22/8/2015 visit 
The price of Momo has gone up. It's now 30 for 4. Still worth it and a must try. The best momos in town. The fries are dearer by 5 rupees. The variety was less today. The chicken wing fry bug in size for 40/piece but 2 for 70. Chicken lollipop was too good 4 for 30. And chicken boneless fry with bread crumbs 5 for 50 and 2 for 40. 
Enjoy guys...I tried all. Except the fish. 
Tip : buy a bottle of soft drink as a side kick for the fries. Enjoy the munch.....

At first we could not find the place cause the name was  not written anywhere.But we found it by asking some locals and we could easily identify it by looking at the crowd standing infront of the place.
First we ordered steam chicken momo and it was delicious.Then we ordered chicken wings and chicken lolypop.Those were crunchy and chicken was very juicy.
We also ordered fried chichen momo and it was very tasty and crispy as well.
Overall the food experience was very good and all our foods only costed 130 bucks which is quite cheap.
I loved this place and surely comeback again.

I visit this place whenever i am nearby.Once i even walked all the way from city centre 1 to eat here.
The place is always crowded,always.The food is super fresh.The momos are stuffed with chicken and are a bargain at rs 20 a plate.
The chicken fries,lollipops,and pakoras are absolutely hot!!!The batter is crisp and spicy,and when you take a bite the taste justifies the fight u've had to have to get it.
Bapi da and his men are very hygienic,and though it looks like a roadside stall the place is spic and span.
My friends and i joke that bapi da could give kfc a run for their money,and trust me,i'm not quite off the mark when i say that.

For years I thought that the ruckus at karunamoyee was obviously because of the sector 5 rush. Little did I knew that it was just partially correct. One fine day I decided to explore the 'karunamoyee more' so decided to get off my car & what I saw I'll never forget. This one cart was surrounded by hoards of people as if it was some lottery claim session. I neared the cart and BANG, Discovered Bapi Da's Solid Gulp cart. 
Everything made sense now. 
I finally came to know that there's a cart that caters to the hungry and insanely tired people coming from sector 5. This cart gives the reason to look forward to the day, a reason to skip that boring lunch, a reason to get down at karunamoyee, a reason to fight for food & definitely a reason for that smile near karunamoyee. 
Getting momos here is a do or die limited offer because there's a catch. Momos are mortal here and yes they run out faster than you can even imagine. If you are new to this place then believe me you'll be disappointed if you are even a second late. 

Solid Gulp is a Man's fights for the ultimate food quest and a battle of 
                      MAN vs TIME.

Now coming to reality

Food
I've tried the momos and they are heavenly. The sauce is not even close to the red momo sauce yet adds flavour to the momo better than the actual momo sauce.

Ambience: it's a cart and yes no place to sit. As I've already mentioned it's a quest so you're not allowed to sit, hahaha...:-) 

Price: you are practically stealing it at  ₹ 20 for 5 heavenly pieces.

This is one of the famous food  stall around the salt Lake region. They don't have a long menu but what attracts the crowd here is their good taste, reasonably good quantity and that too at really low price. 
Unfortunately I could not try their momos as it was already over by the time we got there and so had to settle for chicken lollipop, and that wasn't a bad decision after all.
It was really a good one with good quantity and maybe I will go back again someday to try their momos. 
However a minus point five for the hygiene. I don't understand why Kolkata street joints has to be this unhygienic, it's not their case alone but for whole city, guess streets should be a little more clean.

----1st review----
This is probably one of the few times when i rate 5. heard a lot about this place, my expectation grew a lot n when i did visit i was not disapointed, some may think it may be unhygenic or the food will be oily etc etc, but this is one of the few street food centres who maintains the level of hygiene parallel to the quality of food, it stays open for nearly 2hrs a day n u have to fight your way in to get your orders, i love this place, cant wait for the next visit.. 

----2nd review----
Previously i rated this place 5,but now after 6months i reduced it to 3.5,in this 6months i did visit this place for than 15-20times and noticed something which made me reduce my rating..

The owner as the name suggests is Bapi Da and in the last few months he made some changes in staffs, the latest includes 4new faces.. Whenever the owner isnt around they will prefer to serve the customers only with bulk orders, guys ordereing 1or2 plates will have to wait for a long time only because they are busy serving packing bulk orders, so that they dont loose them.. 
Solid Gulp is a popular name and this kind of behavior of the staff should get checked....

Location: A minute's walk from Karunamoyee Crossing towards Central Park, Saltlake.

This place is more like a roadside stall, but definitely hygienic!
I say so, coz I reached this place before it opened. Opens at 5pm and starts serving customers from 5:30pm, reached at 4:50pm.
I noticed the staff was cleaning their stall with soap water, to be precise dettol+soap water. Everything was so spic n' span!
Surprised as well as Happy to find such a hygiene level to be maintained at a roadside stall.

This eatery is quite famous among office-goers as well as residents of Saltlake and the supplies get over within a few hours of it's opening.

Sorry for the Vegetarians, this is a strictly non-vegetarian eatery with just a single option of Fried American Corn as a choice for you.

Had visited along with my non-vegetarian colleagues who pulled me along for company. 
The corn was well-fried, greasy yet, decent tasting but, the non-vegetarian dishes tasted great as stated by them.

The service was pretty quick and prices were pocket friendly.

And finally did taste everything that was available in this joint. That too on a single day. Its crowded like no other place. People hurling to taste the  tastiest chicken wings. Its drop dead hot, crunchy and succulent. The oieces are quite large. the chicken lollipo is one of its kind. I simply loved gorging up on them. The momos are good. Its stuffed with chicken.but the taste has to be worked upon. I guess the momos are over hyped about. So if u wanna taste it go on by six in the evening otherwise you will be unlucky to not to have tasted great food. Pocket over-friendly and a great great taste. Am rushing back to karunamoyee for just this.

Don't judge this place by its looks, it may look like a normal road side stall but the momo and other chicken items and the crowd  may not be normal. I go here at least twice every week with friends, you need to reach here between 5-6pm to get what you want as the demand is too high. The momo are the best in whole Kolkata, the fried chicken vanishes within seconds the moment it is fried and put out. You need to be loud enough and keep on repeating what you want, but you will be happy when you get your food. If you are a vegetarian you can go here after 6 and try baby corns which are also good.

Best fast food destination in Salt Lake, Bapi Da has an array of delicacies to send your taste buds in an amazing journey. And yes, being so popular you have to actually jostle around people to get your order. But the wait is worthwhile, and you will soon find the urge to take back some home. A must visit destination for every Kolkatan.

Chicken Momo, Chicken Fries, Chicken Lollipop, Chicken Pakora, Baby Corn Fry are items worth fighting for. The best part over here  is the oil used, good sized portions, hot and fresh food and last but not least the price. I frequently come here every month and has never been disappointed a single time. I wish this doesn't remain as a one off shop and expands over time.
3 cheers to the desi chicken delicacies.

Awesome place for an afternoon snack (because u wont get any later). Whenever I go to Saltlake I always try to get around Karunamoyee around 5.30! The food is great..I love the lollipops and what they call the chicken thigh..a huge chicken treat!
The preparation is very neat and everything tastes very good. The only problem is lack of crowd management!

If you don't mind a good plate of Momos while standing on the road, you have to visit Bapi Dar Momo. It is located bang opposite the Karunamayee Bus Stand. Their Momos have become like an everyday evening snack.

The Momos are really good and soft. The chicken filling is delicious, and the covering is nice and soft which melts in your mouth. You can really taste the lemongrass in the Momos. 
Rs. 20 for 4 pieces is not bad at all. But the sauce which they give is Chili Sauce and not Momo sauce, but I don't really mind. 

I wasn't sure if I should try the fried stuff they keep. But when I did I didn't regret it. It was not bad. Although, I have to agree that it was a bit oily, but it tasted good. Nice, spicy, and crispy chicken which melts in your mouth.

But out of all the items in their menu, I discovered that they do not have all the dishes available. Also, there is no place to sit and eat. I suggest that you come in your car with a chilled bottle of coke and order your chicken and momos and enjoy them in your car.

I discovered this place way back in 2011 when it was a tiny 'Thela'. I used to take an auto after office from Karunamoyee (where it stood). I tried their steamed chicken Momo one hungry evening. Priced at Rs 20 per plate, it was surprisingly sumptuous, succulent and filling. I felt happy and went home smiling! Isn't that how good food should make you feel? No wonder it is one of the highest rated eateries in Kolkata. 
From then on, I would rush to eat here, whenever I finished early (you have to get here by 6:30 if you want them). I also tried their sandwiches, fried chicken legs and wings. I am not a big fan of fried stuff but enjoyed it quite a bit when with friends. Warning: chicken fries are loaded with mono-sodium glutamate but otherwise quite fresh. The oil is not too bad! So you can safely binge. It is swarming with people on all weekday evenings, and there's no place to sit. The best deal is to pick some coke, and get food inside the car or take it home. The pocket pinch is slight, and the taste is finger-lickin' good.

Perfect - Soft - Hot - Fresh - Great tasting momos! You'll never try from anywhere else once you've tried "Bapi Dar Momo"!  It’s just opposite to the Karunamoyee bus stand. I've been a regular customer for a couple of years now and I have to say... momos were delicious and juicy every time.  I am also fan of his Chicken fries & Chicken wings. The food was high quality and always fresh.  They were full of flavour, rightly portioned and amazingly priced. Simply put... it’s one of the best momo shops in the city.

The momos are what bapi da is known for. Chicken wings are nice with no compromise in quantity but these chicken wings and other pakoras don't parallel the level of the momos, what earns the crave are the momos and whwn u are there y not try their other items which wouldn't disappoint u.

This is a road stall few meters from karunamoyee bus stand near that beliaghata auto stand.My office in sector v is just ten minutes walk from the place.On a summer evening thought of taking a break and have some chicken pakodas and momos.On reaching the spot e what I saw was a huge crowd surrounding the stall and actually screaming and shouting for Bapi da and his boys.

"Bapi da chicken lollypo 2 plates" "Bapi da pakoda ache na sesh????"....
 I was actually panicked how would I manage to push myself in and get some food for myself.I didnt know also what they had to offer.For ten minutes I kept screaming "eita dao oita dao".What I got finally was a plate of chicken lollypop and crispy baby corn.
The lollypops were four in number  deep fried and good to taste.Crisy baby corn was just fine.Next I stood in the momo counter queue.But before i could place the order they were finished.:(

Next I took another attempt of pushing myself in that crowd and this time I got myself chicken pakoda.A plate consists 5 solid chunky pieces ,crucnhy and very tast and costs 35/-.Dirt cheap!!!!Finally the pakodas satisifed my chicken cravings.

So Its  a must visit for all sort of junkies like chicken pakoda,fried chicken,drumsticks,lollypops and ofcourse momos.Food is finger licking and dirt cheap.But yes oily.

I will be back soon for momos and some more fried chicken.

P.S:Getting the food form the maddening crowd can be difficult for some like me so better reach before 6.

Alright,i confess! Living 10 steps away from this paradise of a street food stall,its hard to stop oneself from stopping by every single day.Bapi Da's momo is one of the most crowded food stalls ive ever come across but what lies beyond all that rush is worth waiting for.
Ive tasted pretty much all he has to offer like the chicken momo,chicken lollypop,drumsticks,broccoli fry,babycorn fry,fish balls,sandwiches etc.
The momo has a thin outer layer and the garlic touch in the chicken is very good.
The lollypop,drumsticks and the pakora are all very well done.In my approx 100 tastings,ive never had undercooked or burnt chicken.
The Fish Balls are the my favorite.
The broccoli was the only thing which i didnt like at all.
The babycorn serves as a good change from all the chicken'ey' extravaganza and sandwich is okayish.

Overall its a wonderful place for an evening snack,though id appreciate if Bapi Da could handle the crowd better but kudos for our very own LOCAL KFC!

Chicken momos are yummy ! Bapi dar momo is the best ever momo in town.... You will get 4 momos @ Rs.20 and it is just opposite to the Karunamoyee bus stand. I wanted to rate it 5 on 5 but 0.5 marks less for the momo sauce. Sorry.... they serve chilly sauce instead of momo sauce. But anyways the momos are heaven! ;)

The unparalleled momos out here are steamed in a lemon-grass boiler (which adds a delectable aroma), they're huge, meaty and go really well with the sour chilli sauce they serve. If it's for momos, then it has to be Solid Gulp - undoubtedly, the best momos in town and quite possibly in the world! Other items aren't as good, though. Rates are dirt cheap.

Located just a few steps from the crowded  beliaghata auto stand, you will find another crowded place where people are  shouting  (almost fighting), gathering. The reason for shouting is Food and the content is "Bapida chicken wings hoyechhe? (Are chicken wings done)", "Ki go ekhon ki achhe (What is available now)?", Lollypop shesh bapida(lollypop finished)?" Yes, then only you will know (for the very few who don't know where's/what's Solid Gulp) you have found Solid Gulp!

This place, to me, is terrifically famous for one of the world's deadliest(read tastiest) chicken fries!  Chicken wings, chicken pakora, chicken lollypops - you found the items lying on the table and then within a blink, poof - all gone (literally)! Four big stoves, hundreds of pieces and each item just takes 10 minutes (or less) to finish. The reason is the marination and the perfectly fried chicken items.

But there are warnings. Firstly, you have reach fast, else the items you desire will be gone, especially the momos. Secondly, when crowded, you have to literally get on top of them to voice your order and make the eye contact to be sure you are being heard. And if you stay at back expecting to get the food you ordered, you will be definitely fooled, because there is a huge rush and it might (almost always) happen that bapida (though fully efficient) forgets your order and it is actually getting digested inside someone else's tummy! But this hassle and rush is worth the taste and money - which is unbelievably low.

So, better hurry before the items are gone. A perfect finger licking place at surprisingly low price. Gulp your food completely satisfied. Worth thousand visits!

Its just a road stall dishing out humongous pieces of fried chicken at super pocket friendly prices which is sure to put the kfc to shame. Be prepared to wait in long queues before getting your food. Momos are hot favourite along with other fried chicken items like pakora n lollypop. We jus cant get enough of his fried chicken..

This tiny but posh roadside stall needs no introduction. Foods served here arr fabulous both in terms of pricing and quality. Be it Chicken Momo or Chicken Pakora or sandwich or drumsticks or thighs or chicken wings, you name it, you can have it all here. The only problem is, their stock of each items runs out pretty fast on any given weekday evening, owing to their demand. The passerbies, especially office goers returning home, stops by Bapi Da's Momo Stall at Karunamoyee bus stand to fish out a dish of any number of serving amongs the jostling crowd hungry for a bite. The crowd infront of the stall is surely amazing and hence proves the popularity of it. The rush for Bapi Da's dishes is ofcourse due to the great taste and economical foods served here. It will make you keep licking your fingers until your fingers are clean!! ;) :D

I haven't tried other delicious cuisines offered by "Bapi Dar Momo". And this review is about the item which "Bapi Dar Momo" is famous for.

I have tried chicken momo twice. Considering the standard of a roadside food stall, all I can say is, this is awesome. I don't think you will find a plate of 4 delicious chicken momos anywhere else in Kolkata at 20 rupees. Though I would not compare it to the ones I have tried at other places, this one is really awesome. And yes, the charm of Karunamoyee adds to its awesomeness!

The succulent momo....delicious chicken pakoras and lolly pops....awesome chicken fry....a sandwich that will melt in your mouth.....all at very cheap and reasonable price.....and if you are thinking where to get these....just hop into bapi da's momo shop just opposite to IBT in karunamoyee... To place an order you will have to penetrate through at least three rows...yes, that how much popular he is....and inspite of such a rush, you will always be served with a smile. What's amazing is that inspite of such a huge popularity, the quality has never been compromised.

An awesome place to feel the buzz of what Street food in kolkata means. You can eat your heart out without emptying you wallet. And oh boy.... Trust me, you will want to come back for more. The best of momos and chicken wing I have ever had.

Remnants of the chilly winter still clung to the evening breeze that day and there wasn't a better way to enjoy it other than gorging on some of the best fried chicken we've ever had, all thanks to Bapi da and his ingenious creation.
We reached the Karunamoyee bus stop sharp at 6 and one look at the massive crowd gathered in front of the tiny shop and I instantly started panicking that there’ll be nothing left for us! Luckily however, we were able to get hold of each and every item on our wish list: chicken steamed momo, chicken pakora, chicken drumsticks and chicken fry.
All the fried chicken items were drop dead hot, crunchy and tasty. Biting into the thin and crispy skin to find the soft and succulent meat inside was extremely pleasurable. The momo didn't have anything special to mention about. They should also keep a bottle of tomato ketchup at hand as their sauce just wasn't that good. We hogged down on the rest then and there before packing up a few more things to take back home. The fried chicken thigh was understandably a bit soggy by the time we reached home, but was equally enjoyed after heating it up in the microwave oven.	
P.S: If you live nearby, then takeaway would be the best option. For the rest, grab a bottle of fizzy drink from a nearby shop, settle down on one of the wooden benches lying around and gobble up the whole thing within seconds!

Fight for food that's what you needed, if you haven't pre-ordered bulk amount of foods. This is a small take away joint in karunamoyee near karunamoyee-beleghata auto stand but remember you have to reach over here @5:00 pm sharp to grab your dishes as this Opens at @4:30pm - @5:00pm but food disappears within 2-3 hours :) You may have tried momos in many renowned momo hubs but if you haven't tried momos over here I must say try in your lifetime. These momos smells good smoky lime flavor, well sized, properly steamed, 4 pieces momo only @20 rupees. Hard to imagine but really its true, It's also true that once you have finished one plate, you would definitely want more. But not only momos but there are other fried dishes which you would love to grab "fried chicken", "Chicken lollypop", "fish pakora", "chicken pakora" and one of my other favorite "Chicken sandwich". If you are fry lover then go for fried foods and if you want healthy food then you can easily go for "momo" and "sandwich". The prices of these foods are very much reasonable. Once you visit to Bapida's stall...your heart will say once more :)

One word review : SUperb .. 

Momos here are one of its kind, I havent had such in the whole of Kolkata. Fries are a bit too oily, but wouldnt bother you if you are having them once in a while.

Just One question.. I see its written that Dine-In is available ! How come? *Surprised*

Man, i got this news from a friend as usual.. Taking a look at the pocket pinch, i was like WOW!! A palm sized chicken fry for just a crazy 50INR??? and i thought to check this place out with my pals.. Located at the heart of Saltlake, Karunamoyee, this pretty little stall has the capacity to win a number of hearts, not by just its price but by the quality they offer. excellent in terms of service, even amidst those dense crowd around only that shop. We reach there 15mins from time, and there was no one in the stall. we waited 15mins. but no sooner did we reach the spot again than we found ourselves amidst a moderate crowd, busy placing orders. and man, stock for the day ran out in some crazy 90mins!! shop closed, visit tomorw. Indeed, the tomorow is always TODAY!! :) go and have a shot.. :)

I will be the party pooper here. I did not know that Bapi das momos have reached this level of fan following so as to have a dedicated zomato page!!. I had been having momos from this road side stall for years. After tuitions and college and hanging out with friends, standing at karunamoyee or brought back home. This was a great place to pick up cheap value for money food for us cheapster students. 

However with time I feel the quality has gone down the drain. The last two times I had the misfortune of having momos here, one bought myself and the other a friend brought for me to my place coz said friend knew how crazy for momos I was...and guess what, both times I had food poisoning. There wasnt anything else to blame for my poor tummy rebelling but the famed momos! They are notorious for me. I have since then forbade anyone I know to bring me momos from this place, and I have been vociferously advocating that people stop eating here as well...saving a couple of pennies at the cost of health is not very fruitful or wise. I wish Bapi da remedies this soon enough ( I have personally let my views known to him, I carry his mobile no.) So people who love eating here, please continue doing so at your own peril.

An over-hyped place this has become. I would have said "AVOID", but I cant really put it down there for old times sake..So i'll say its very bad and I know its not the popular opinion atm, but its my opinion all the same.

This yummy food paradise is located just opposite to the International bus terminus at the Karunamoyee, Saltlake, Sector III. Before catching up my bus from the Karunamoyee, I keep watching that a food corner have been encircled by lots of people, from kids to office goers, are busy in gulping down their foods with a glimpse of mundane satisfaction in their face. 

One day I also tried out this place while coming back to home. I had their Chicken Momo along with Chicken Pakora. The food was truly good rather insane in my opinion. The Momo was perfect with proper stuffs filling inside. The pakora was fiery and yummy. I wish I had more and more without any stomach limitation. This place is not expensive at all. They have also made an arrangement just beside their counter. I must mention one thing that their quality of service is very efficient. You would not find a single moment when this joint is crowd free and still, they have been able to serve hot food to everyone.  And yes, do not underestimate this joint as a mere street food corner as each service boy of this joint use hand gloves and take measures to maintain hygiene properly. And yes, as far as my knowledge is concerned, they are the one of the top rated food places in Kolkata on Zomato, its quite accurate in my view.

Just one sentence :

The most awesome food at the cheapest rate only @Bapi Da's

A roadside stall one just cannot miss because of the huge crowd around it. Every evening, there is a scurry of people at Bapi da's. Momo, drumstick, lolli-pop, this place has it all. The food items get sold as soon as it is placed at the counter. Not only is the taste the best, it is pocket friendly too.

Landed up at Bapi-da's place around 6 pm and the place was PACKED. Pieces of chicken were being lifted off hot oil and they were flying off to plates and packets like hot cake. I hastily packed up two plates of momos, two pieces of fried chicken thighs, and a plate of chicken pakora, since that was on offer at that point. Generally, the availability of dishes is based on what's being fried at that point of time, and I am not too picky about what to get, so I generally get an assortment of this and that in general. 

I packed the food, since I really did not want to eat there, standing, and getting mosquito bites in the road. After half an hour, I huffed and puffed my way home, opened packages, and ate.

The momos were warm, moist, and filled with soft bits of chicken. The momo skin was not too thin or thick - just perfect. I generally don't care for their momo sauce, so picked up and doused it with a teaspoon of homemade chili paste, and it was amazing. The chicken thighs were juicy, still hot, and crisp! After nearly half an hour of being jostled inside a bag. The chicken wings were crisp, and with a lovely thin crust which is definitely  worth returning over and over again. 

Again, Bapi-da scores! 0.5 marks deducted for the sauce. Otherwise... Yay!



----- 22 Dec, 2012 -----

Full paisa wasool, and more. I have been here at least 15-20 times, and half the times if I did not time myself right the momos would be over. However, there was still the chicken, which was awesome. I have had days when the craving for their chicken pakora hit me, and I would just get there, grab two packs of it, and eat them while coming back, in the bus or car, whichever I was in. Absolutely satisfying, and fresh to the boots. I would love to sing paeans about how inexpensive this place is as well. TOTALLY Satisfying.

Bapi da'r momo is a stall near karunamoyee. Must go there between 5:30 to 6 if you want to get a selection. Just look for the most crowded stall where people are falling over themselves to handover 100 rupee notes to the shopkeeper.

Awesome momos, chicken fry, wings and pakoras. They even have 1-2 veg dishes now.

Words fail me as I sit down to write a review for this gem of a place just at the Karunamoyee crossing! I sincerely believe that Kolkata's culinary landscape is defined more by these road side stalls that cater to the masses rather than snazzy restaurants. Bapida's momo is one such roadside fast food stall. 
I had the famous chicken momo (veg is not available) and it was tasty and wholesome. Big chunky momo pieces ( 4 in a plate) served with a spicy sauce for 20 bucks is as good as it gets!
The chicken drumstick that I tried next was simply mind blowing! One big chicken leg as soft and succulent and juicy that you have ever tasted fried in crisp batter for 25 bucks!
I have never had such good food at such prices! An excellent place for a wholesome and hearty snack.
Must try!
 P.S. You might have to wait for a while because of the crowd that gathers and do be the early bird or you might not catch your chicken! ( It flies off the shelves you see).

The Karunamoyee fried Chicken!!! The outlet is unmistakable. You walk towards Central Park and the place where you see a large crowd gathered around the footpath you know you have arrived. This place is not for the Health conscious. so if you like your food with less oil and have this perpetual fear of your arteries being cholesterol choked then steer clear and let us junk food freaks move to the front!!! Cause this is Fried food heaven!!! 
Almost all the items on offer is deep fried in oil. The one thing that is not is the chicken momo and its superb!! soft juicy and generous chicken bits. The fried food ranges from baby corn to colossal chicken pieces, fish chunks and prawns included (although the prawn is occassional). The batter is amazing...light, tangy and beautifully spiced. The chicken pieces are unbelievable ranging from quarter of a chicken to juicy boneless pieces. 
The prices are rock bottom. a purchase of 100 rs is enough to feed 3 people!! 4 pieces of chicken pakora cost 30 bucks and it consists of solid chicken and very less batter. Value for money redefined!!!
The owner, Bapida, is the epitome of calm and cool. The way he handles 30-40 customers at a time with everyone firing their orders from every direction is truly admirable. The staff are really mindful about the cleanliness, all of them wearing aprons and plastic gloves. And they never miss your orders. Kudos!!!
For foodies like me this has become a land mark in Karunamoyee and anytime I visit the area I am automatically drawn to join the crowd around this little joint and give in to my Utterly Unhealthy Food Cravings.

Reading RK's review tempted me to write one for the solid gulps I have taken here. The first trip to Bapi da's practically worked out as an adventure. My friend and me had gone there after office and  were insanely hungry. Then we didn't even know Bapi da has a name to his shop and there was a fancy menu except that whatever he sells is extremely popular with the locals, super tasty and cheap. The first day at his shop, my friend and I ordered four plates of momos which we swiped in a matter of seconds, just minimal waste of time for the heat to escape with each bite. The fact that momos can taste brilliant with simple chilli sauce can only be experienced at Bapi Da's. Then we ordered for the chicken fry, which we had one each, and packed a few pieces for home too. The only days when I actually tolerate s9 is carrying a nice heavy packet of steaming hot bfc (bapi da fried chicken) back home.
Thereafter we became Bapi da fans. Shoving, pushing, getting hand on 'amar-ta' plates of momos, pakoras and fries, I have lost count of the number of times we have raided Solid Gulp. The quality, quantity, taste and the price for which it is available is amazing. Over the several raids, I have tried the chicken lollypop, wings and drumsticks. All of them taste as good as the other and simply vanishes off the shelves even before it is fried and out of the kadai!! :O Terrors of seeing that last piece of chicken you have been eyeing going to the person next to you. -_- I am making my next visit before my keyboard transforms onto a drool board. :D Bapi daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!

Solid Gulp ( Bapi Dar Momo) has been a place I have been wanting to try forever. That day finally came this saturday when I had to go meet a friend in Salt Lake so we decided to meet at Karunamoyee Crossing. I skipped lunch that day due to a hectic day at work and was super famished when I reached at 4-45 pm , about 5 people were already waiting so I went and stood and watched them do their prep. Punctually at 5 pm they started heating up four huge kadhai's (woks) and started frying the chicken and fish items. I ordered a plate of Chicken Steamed Momo's and Chicken Lollipop since the famed Chicken Pakora was not available. By the time it was being cooked about 30 people had gathered and literally were trying to climb on top of each other to get their orders. I was served after about 20 minutes wait and was shocked to find that my bill was Rs.50/= only ! Anyways I sat in my car and tucked into the momo's first ..... at Rs.20 for a plate of 4 pcs they were a super deal .... large sized and properly stuffed with chicken they were very good but for me the star of the show was the Chicken Lollipop .... crunchy and tasty from the outside and super juicy and succulent from within .... absolutely brilliant stuff and Super Value for money @ Rs.30/= per plate.The place was cleaner than many restaurant kitchens. My only complaint is that they should start a numbered token system so that everyone can be served fairly. A lot of the ladies were being pushed aside by the men though they were there before hope they change that soon. I can't wait to go back just the thought of those Lollipop's makes my mouth water :-)

This is the place that I have the fondest memories of,right through my college days to my inital working days at Kolkata.Be it a casual hangout with friends or a stomach raging with hunger after a hard day at work or to celebrate a birthday,Bapi da's momo ,as we still call it,has always been there to save the day.And today,as I came across it's name in Zomato,I can't help but feel proud.

Initially,it was just Bapi da and 2 other boys who would hand out plates after plates of delicious,hot momos and chicken lollipop to the huge crowd that would call out orders for these dishes to Bapi da,.

And still, I am surprised ,after 3 years,these guys are still going strong,serving the same quality food  but at the same price (20 rs. for a plate of 4 momos,accompanied with 2 types of sauces).They now have a variety of items such as CHICKEN BREAST,SANDWICHES and CHICKEN PAKORAS apart from the all time favourites STEAMED MOMOS,FRIED MOMOS and CHICKEN LOLLIPOP. The service too is very fast.

A must visit for every Calcuttan and to those who visit Kolkata.Try the awesome food at Bapi da's or Solid Gulp,as it is now known, and you will not regret it..Oh, and the easiest way to spot this place,in case  the heavenly smell of hot fried chicken pakoras fail to reach you: Try finding the most crowded place on the sidewalk at the Karunamoyee bus stand :)

A well-deserved 5.0 (or insane) from my side... :) :)

I have rated it INSANE because it is INSANE, literally!! Come to karunamoyee at 5:30 in the evening, there is a place where  a crowd is always waiting for Bapi da to set up shop. The service is good, you have to be patient.... as the frying takes time. But the main attraction is because of the variety, quality and the price. The MOST POPULAR draw is the chicken fry, priced at Rs 50/-, also the chicken momos and the chicken pakoras. The chicken sandwich is also very good and filling. I would suggest the chicken fry which is a breast piece or a leg piece of chicken marinated in a special masala and deep fried. The momos are melt in your mouth, and full of flavour. be sure to get there by 6 pm otherwide you are sure to leave empty handed and with a growling stomach. I luv their food and go their frequently.

The best thing to have happened to evening snacking in Salt Lake:

Small joint - so starting with my score up approach i.e. starting with an assumed rating of '1' and then scoring up for the positives.

Food - Momos are well filled and with very thin layering - delicious. chicken fry - wings, legs etc are well marinated and the coatings have a nice taste of their own - I really like to finish up the flakes of the crust that remain on the plate. The fish pakora is another favourite and Bapi has the guts and honesty to tell you that its not "bhetki" (most of the big and small places serve non-bhetki fillets and yet claim it to be Kolkata bhetki). The quantities are great and the ingredients are fresh. Since most of the time there is a waiting list, the food served is always hot off the stove. Plus 0.5 for the taste and plus 0.5 for the quality

Hygiene - unexpected levels of hygiene from a street side counter - the gleaming steel cart and utensils, the aprons worn by the boys, the clean laminated plates. I stopped visiting the Rabindra Sadan momo joints after I saw the unhygienic conditions of the kitchens - Bapi da has proved that cleanliness is an attitude and you can be clean even if you are serving from a small counter. A big plus 1

Price - again a plus 1 - the value for money is unmatched. A momo snack for Rs.20. Chicken fries in the range of Rs.30 to 50 - its a steal. Fill up yourself for less than Rs.100. 

Service - It takes some time to get your food as the queue is always long, but Bapi behaves very well with all his customers. However I would not give any score here as I believe Bapi has been in the business long enough to invest in a bigger setup and cut down on the waiting time. Another drawback is that they run out very quickly - if you plan for a snack on the way back from office, you are likely to be met with a regret even if its only 8 pm. Bapi should start selling till 9 pm at least. The queue also needs to managed - maybe a numbered token system.

The score is 4 now and a pretty fair reflection I think (a 4.25 would have been better maybe). Definitely the best street food joint in Kolkata at the moment and no wonder they have customers flocking in from distant locations.

Located at Karunamoyee, Salt lake, Bapi da starts selling his fare at five in the evening and is spotted by the frenzied activity around him. The Jumbo Fried Chicken (Rs 50) is a whole chicken that is quartered and batter fired. A thin coating of the crisp batter gives way to a moist, perfectly cooked chicken. Also worth sticking around for – the Chicken Momos (Rs 20) stuffed with meat, vegetables and finely minced onions.

Yesterday evening I got the chance for the first time to check this famous joint at Karunamoyee. And I swear, it was the best momo I have till date in Kolkata. It is even better than WOW momos in all respect- cost, taste, quality. We bought 1 plate steamed chicken momo which costs Rs 20 per plate(4  pieces) and 1 plate fried chicken legs which costs Rs 50 ( 2 pieces of solid chicken legs).

once i was passing karunamoyee on my bike and i took a cigarette break. it was evening and i noticed a gathering of at least 25-30 people in front of a stall. i was wondering if there was any brawl going on and i thought of inquiring.  
and yes i discovered this SOLID GULP - BAPI DAR MOMO. 

WHAT I SAW
a neat clean road side galvanized stall with four young men preparing the fried items and two men were busy taking orders and serving the crowd. the huge crowd were waiting for some of the items to be prepared and in the mean while they are eating bouffant steamed momos (four in number) served on paper plates with some red sauce. all the staffs were wearing the kitchen apron and wearing polythene gloves while serving. this indeed has a substantial effect on people concerned with hygiene. so i thought of giving a try, starting with momos. 

WHAT I  ATE
i saw items like chicken fry, chicken wings, chicken lolypops, chicken drum sticks etc , are yet to be fried and prepared before serving. so like others i ordered chicken wings and started with steamed momos. 
a plate of momo includes 4 gigantic sized momos and some red sauce . bite after bite made me fell in love with this bonzer exceptionally tasting momos and believe me i found chicken grates in each and every bite. my greed over powered my self control and i ordered another plate of momo. throughout my life i never really had such tasty steamed momos. these 8 pieces were so big that it  filled me upto my esophagus and i had no room left for those chicken wings. so i had to pack them to enjoy its taste at home

WHAT I FELT

the momos are definitely the best momo in town ,both in quantity and by quality. unlike most of the street joints , the chicken momos really had grated chicken, oninons and other ingredients that gave it the superb salivating taste.
the chicken wings were deep fried yet juicy and i fully enjoyed after few hours of my heavy momo meal. it was also tasty , though not an excellent one but it was quite upto the expectation after having such quality momo.
another thing i would like to add is that their momo doesnot comes with a bowl of soup ,which is according to me is a shortcoming,because spicy soups are definitely a part of a momo meal

overall i will rate them 4/5 according to the quantity and quality of the food they serve.

Located at Karunamoyee, Salt lake, Bapi da starts selling his fare at five in the evening and is spotted by the frenzied activity around him. The Jumbo Fried Chicken (Rs 50) is a whole chicken that is quartered and batter fired. A thin coating of the crisp batter gives way to a moist, perfectly cooked chicken. Also worth sticking around for – the Chicken Momos (Rs 20) stuffed with meat, vegetables and finely minced onions.

Yesterday evening I got the chance for the first time to check this famous joint at Karunamoyee. And I swear, it was the best momo I have till date in Kolkata. It is even better than WOW momos in all respect- cost, taste, quality. We bought 1 plate steamed chicken momo which costs Rs 20 per plate(4  pieces) and 1 plate fried chicken legs which costs Rs 50 ( 2 pieces of solid chicken legs).

once i was passing karunamoyee on my bike and i took a cigarette break. it was evening and i noticed a gathering of at least 25-30 people in front of a stall. i was wondering if there was any brawl going on and i thought of inquiring.  
and yes i discovered this SOLID GULP - BAPI DAR MOMO. 

WHAT I SAW
a neat clean road side galvanized stall with four young men preparing the fried items and two men were busy taking orders and serving the crowd. the huge crowd were waiting for some of the items to be prepared and in the mean while they are eating bouffant steamed momos (four in number) served on paper plates with some red sauce. all the staffs were wearing the kitchen apron and wearing polythene gloves while serving. this indeed has a substantial effect on people concerned with hygiene. so i thought of giving a try, starting with momos. 

WHAT I  ATE
i saw items like chicken fry, chicken wings, chicken lolypops, chicken drum sticks etc , are yet to be fried and prepared before serving. so like others i ordered chicken wings and started with steamed momos. 
a plate of momo includes 4 gigantic sized momos and some red sauce . bite after bite made me fell in love with this bonzer exceptionally tasting momos and believe me i found chicken grates in each and every bite. my greed over powered my self control and i ordered another plate of momo. throughout my life i never really had such tasty steamed momos. these 8 pieces were so big that it  filled me upto my esophagus and i had no room left for those chicken wings. so i had to pack them to enjoy its taste at home

I have only tried the famous Chicken momo at Bapi Da's momo, and its not just easy on your pockets, they taste amazing, the stuffing is generously filled with Chicken. Despite being a roadside Shop, it is hygienic. And God, is it popular. You'll feel it once you get there. The enormous crowd that surrounds the shop itself is an indicator. But there is also a downside to it, given the demand, the service tends to get a little sluggish sometimes and you may need to pester a bit to get served with your plate of food. But the momos are worth the wait. You must try it. Theyr'e awesome.

Value for money is what Bapi da's chicken give to all chicken lovers..A takeaway joint unmatched in its class and quality.. As far as I know Chicken Momo is a late college evening supper for many of my Jadavpur University,Department Of Civil Engineering friends..The Bapi da fever is so fired up that south kolkatans go from Jadavpur to karunamoyee just to have a bite of this deliciously cooked stuffed momo and chicken fry....If you visit KFC for their "Finger lickin good" ad you must visit this place and you yourself will know the difference...

After hearing a dozen stories about Bapi Da's fried chicken, finally paid a visit to this street side food joint, which as I came to know, is more famous for its momo. I hadn't imagined its popularity among the residents of Salt Lake.

By the time we reached Solid Gulp, their fried chicken were sold out. So we ( the 3 of us ) decided to order steamed momo, fried momo and chicken pakora. 

1. Chicken Pakora: You never expect solid pieces of chicken in your pakora, but here at solid gulp, you get them.

2. Steamed momo:  Reminded me of Fresh'n Up (Golpark), Tasted rather good. Perfect dumplings in the age of adulterated dim sums. You get 4 pieces for 20 rupees, so that's great value for money too. A must-have. You miss the soup though.

3. Fried momo: Not as good as the steamed momo. Still, tasted fine.

OVER HYPED but VALUE FOR MONEY. Hunger is the best sauce and if ur VERY HUNGRY and your pocket doesnt feel too heavy, their FRIED CHICKEN becomes a good choice. For 50 bucks, their 7 inch batter fried chicken sounds like a good option but you also need to take into consideration the money you will spend on ENO or GELUSIL, that will help your stomach beat that acidity. The momo's are good, its dough is silky and will remind you of silky pasta's of good resturaunts.
However it remains to be one of the most hygenic roadside stalls bringing to Kolkata a feel of the Bangkok streets. However service takes a bit of time since people flock to it like pigeons do to grain. Its popular alright but taste wise its average. Its popularity proves that to most people size does matter. But to me, its ok, average.

This small joint is tugged away at a corner of karunamoyee island in salt lake. I have been passing this island for past 9 years on my way to office and never had an idea that such a place had started sometime around 1999. I got to know about this place from Zomato and me and some of my friends paid a visit today evening.

We(5 of us) got out of office and reached Karunamoyee island. A quick ask around and we were able to locate the small road side shop with a big crowd hovering all around. That is when we noticed a small plate hanging on top of the shop saying Bapi da and his boys serving since 1999. While 6-7 young guys attended to the demanding crowd who just could not have enough. 

We tasted following:
1. Chicken Momo (steamed) - Rs 20 (one plate has 4 pieces)
2. Chicken fried wings - Rs 30 (one plate has 4 pieces)
3. Crispy Fried Babycorn - Rs 20 one plate 

Momo was heavenly. Fried Chicken and Fried Babycorn were too good. Excellant place and a must visit for all food lovers. It is cheap too.

Ok..heard of this place a long time back but never could visit it since I could never make out the stall. It is that non descript. Ony thing that might let you identify it is the crowd all around it. The auto stand is nearby too so you might just mixi it all up. However I could spot the stall and was a little dissappointed when they said they did not prepare any veggie dish other than baby corn fry...But I decided to take back with me some specimen of his chicken kamaals.... Now hold your breath... I reached home 15 minutes later and gave my dad the chicken fry without reheating it....My dad finished it off in quite sometime (he is a kattar non-vegeterian and loves his chicken)...The first question he asked me was "Where did you get it packed from? I have never tasted anything like this.." And the final spark of disbelief in his eyes when i told him it was for 50 INR.. He asked me thrice if I wasnt lying. The momos could beat even the dimsums served at several upscale chinese restaurants. For 20 bucks a plate you might just think several times before you order momos at chinese restaurants. I dont know what bapi da does with his chickens but hats off to him. Even my dad salutes him and thats not something he does everyday. So way to go bapi da and keep up the great work...I deduct .5 cos u dont think about vegeterians. Please do think about them too..:P 

Please do visit the stall and you are surely gonna love it and maybe get addicted to what it serves.
P.S. WARNING 1700-1900 hrs is the visiting time..Any later and you would return dissapointed. And dont fear the crowd...It disperses like the items. :)

Reminded me of my school days while writhing this! Heard of bapi da when i studied in class 10!! So one fine evening went there at around 7.30pm..DISAPPOINTMENT...because nothing was left. Again tried the next day the same thing happened. Now this time i decided to get there by 5pm....AHHH...heavenly momos filled my tastebuds and the same goes for lollypop as well.
So if you haven't still now visited bapi da, then surely you are missing something really good :P

The best best best and best place to have Momo in Salt Lake area rather in Kolkata. I know Bapi Da's place since my college days, almost been 6-7 Years. The test is awesome and mouth watering. I don't know how does they make such a great momo. Earlier, there main menu was Momo & Lollypop  and recently they have ventured into some other great dishes.  Recent favourite is Fish Fry and some time back they have started Pomfret Fry - God that was awesome.

Its just a road side shop & they really don't need any introduction -- almost everybody knows Bapi Da very well and they know that the Momos are heavenly. Service wise, Bapi Da's behavior is too good to say. He treats his customers as his close one and try to serve at his best. At the starting, I was shocked  to see the selling capacity of this shop. They used to start at 5pm and by 7:30pm, he's done with all his selling. Then i understood when I started to have it regularly. At one point, I was a regular visitor. Any day, Bapi Dar Momo is one of my favourite and one of the best Momo I had ever In my Life.

I have known bapida r momo since I was in school. I am crazy about momos and have more or less tasted them in all momo joints in Kolkata. But definitely Bapida r momo is the best. It's cheap, clean and treats your taste buds in the best possible way. Not only the momos but everything else on the menu is purely divine to the taste buds. A must for all fast food lovers..

Bapi Da, buy a food truck, your trolley is too small to serve the queue growing every day!

If the people working for KFC follow Zomato, they'd have real problem with this food trolley at Karunamoyee.. Believe me or not, but I do think KFC has lost quite a business beacuse of this man serving delectable fried chicken at throw-away prices.. Take me for example.. Before I discovered this place, I'd swear by KFC's Fried Chicken.. But now, well, you know!

The first time I visited this joint was much before it was named 'Solid Gulp' (though I still don't get why Bapi Da needed to give it a fancy name, 'Bai Dar Momo' was already as famous as it gets through word of mouth).. It was a small trolley, which let me let you how to find.. Reach Karunamoyee at 5 in the afternoon, and head towards the stall where you see the most no of people jostling! That's Solid Gulp.. Bapi Da, with his four boys, continues frying and serving Chicken at a rapid pace.. Be a couple of minutes late to reach or order, and you might have to wait for the next batch, that's how the rush is!

The food, oh, how to describe! The momos, 20 bucks a plate, is juiciest to say the least.. The chicken filling is perfectly done, the only thing you'd crave for would be a proper chilly sauce to dip it in.. The Chicken Pakoras, Lollypops, and Fried Thighs are brilliant.. Bapi Da must mix some secret ingredient in his batter or something, coz the items are unbelievably crispy! Even when you take it home, it's still crispy like hell! Amazing! And his Crispy Baby Corn, whoof! Super..

Nowadays, I don't see him making the Fish and Pomfret Fries much, but let me tell you, if you're lucky enough to find it being served, for God's sake, don't miss it!

So let me sum up, If you're a foodie, you must make it a point to visit this place.. You'd see the real deal, great food at a minimum price.. Go there, place your order, wait along with 100 people around you, salivate when you get the chicken served fiery hot.... Happy eating! :)

The very old "Bapi Dar Momo"...., I didn't know that Bapi da has kept a fancy name :) . But for me and my buddies from many years we know it as K.F.C. [Karunamoyee Fried Chicken  :) ] 

I had been a regular customer of Bapi Da from when I started my staying in Kolkata from the mid of 2007. I remember those days when almost everyday evening around 6 pm, I used to come running to Bapi da to get few plates of Momos and Chicken Drumsticks or sometimes Chicken Lollypops . [Though I was never able to find much difference between Lollypop and Drumstick over there .. :P ] The scene was very much different that time, It was even a smaller trolley, and Bapi da along with two other guys used to serve mainly Veg & Non-veg Momos and Chicken Lollypops. Sandwiches, Fish Fry, Pomfret fry were not available all time and were very limited. The prices were may be the cheapest in the City. Chicken Momo (3 pc. )  and Chicken Drumstick (4 pc) were only Rs 10 and Rs. 20 respectively. The picture of the crowd over there was also very less that time, [ Though, it was always much more than the nearby Pani puri and Bhel puri counters ] but things have changed a lot now. Many more chicken and fish items have been introduced, even I can make difference between Lollypop and drumstick now... :) . Bapi da has extended his business a bit, but the crowd level has overflown. The moment it opens there will be a circle of crowd which keeps increasing till everything gets over. Just 1-2 hours of business at the peak time and at a busy place (the karunamoyee xing )when all those people going back home from a hectic day of work. Well 'Solid Gulp's' taste is always good enough to bring smiles to those tired muscles. Bang on..!!!! Definitely its one of best street food in Kolkata, as Bapi Da has kept the quality over the years. Hats off!!!! :D

I won't talk much about the taste and value for money, as you will come to know about when you will visit and see a crowd like any superstar is giving autographs over there. Though I must say I had Pomfret fry once (luckily), and it was just fab..!!! None of the other items lag behind in the 'taste-race'.  I would recommend to have Fish Fry, Pomfret Fry, Chicken Drumstick, Chicken Thigh, Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Momos and so on.... [ Disclaimer : If you get those available. and if possible taste all, you won't be disappointed for sure] 

About service, hold on!!!! you shouldn't expect anything about any renowned street food stall in Kolkata. Rather you should expect as much delay as possible, and obviously you have to fight a lot to get the food ordered, even to get the ketchup bottle or for paying the money. Every time I wonder by putting myself in place of Bapi Da, 'how on earth he manages!!!!' :O

There is an unofficial listing system for taking order done by Bapi da ( without any pen and paper), he tags people for the rounds like some in the 1st round of cooking, some in the next round and so on....  

Lets come to the ambiance, it is all about a 50 sqft stall and another 200-300 sqft area around it. You can find few concrete benches around, Lovebirds enjoying their drumsticks a little far away from the crowd over some romantic topics, many groups here and there totally gulping while making a circle or leaning on the vehicles they came by, few individuals walking around with their plate and few Roadatian dogs roaming around in search of few left overs!!! That's the deal Dude..!!! This is what Kolkata Street food is famous about, and certainly Bapi da along with his group has provided a remarkable example of that throughout years.

If I am anywhere near karunamayee  around 4.30 or 5 in the evening I wait for bapi da to open his stall just to fulfill my momo and chicken fry hunger.   Not only me there are many more people who actually wait for bapi da to open his stall. Within few minuets you will see atleast 20 more people are  shouting  to get his/her plate of momo ,fry,lollypop pakora or something else. People ,who are in love with all these ,they hardly care whether there is a place to sit or not.

Solid Gulp, or more commonly known as "Bapi da'r momo" is not just a food stall but a unique experience in its own way. I have  been having Bapi da's momos for a very long time and have recommended it to many of my friends, as its is one of the very few places in kolkata that offers such amazing food at extremely reasonable rates.
Last week, however, when I visited the place, I had a very intersting experience. I reached Karunamoyee, where it is located, around 5pm. The staff were just setting up the place. I asked them how long I would have to wait, and they said about 10 minutes. I went for a short walk for hardly the time and to my greatest surprise by the time I had returned, they had just started frying their famous chicken lollipop/fry/fish pakora and the place was completely crowded. The large group of customers were calling out to Bapi da with their orders. Just 10 minutes had made such a huge difference in the scenario. I waited for another 10 mins to place my order and eventually receive the food.......But guess what....it was totally worth the wait!!
The chicken was juicy and the chicken fry, which they sell for Rs 50 was extremely filling!...Having such absolutely delicious food at this price is in one word "unbelivable!"....Beware KFC and Family Chicken....Solid Gulp is here!!

Went there after reading about it in the papers... Service was prompt and food was good but not the best according to me in terms of momo. But nonetheless the momo was good and tasty. The place was somewhat neat so it was overall a good experience. Will try other items on the menu on the next visit.

if i am hanging out near karunamoyee at around 5,i make sure i go back here... just for their steamed chicken momo.the best in town.4 pcs of succelent momo fully loaded with soft cubes of chicken,with no soup,but just with chilli sauce which goes perfect with it comes at just rs 20! its a delight!
i have also tried their chicken lolipop and chicken fry at 30 and 50rs per plate respectively.both are fried in the same batter.i have heard people comparing the fry with kfc and stuff,but i wont lie,kfc goes much ahead at 10 buck extra. so lolypop is a better option for me.i look forward to try their fish items soon,but the only problem is that they finish off by 6:30 pm.and one more thing,a few more benches to sit would be helpful,besides the two already present there.

Bapi da's Solid Gulp has come a long way from nameless to the hall of fame. I never realized this small eatery is listed on zomato and I missed to review it. This little stall is located just at the Karunamoyee junction towards FE island. This stall is very popular amongst all the age group especially students and home returning professionals around the area. From 5PM to 7PM this stall gets maximum attraction and the amazing delicacies of bapi da get sold out in no time.

Try the chicken momo/drumstick/pakora and other fish items. It's not possible to try all of them on a single go but do try them gradually. The steamed chicken momo is a super hit, it's so good and succulent chicken melts in your mouth. Many times I have come down from my office to this place to satisfy my momo hunger.

Every item is very pocket friendly considering the taste and quality. But fish items are bit on the higher side if compared with quantity.

Do give a try to Solid Gulp when you are at this area around 5-7PM.

I first had their Momos about a couple of years back and found them to be  excellent in terms if quality and taste. Since then one has become a fan. 

Its a small takeaway roadside cart with a single bench for some luckier ones. The ambience is rustic but clean unlike a lot of eateries like that!!

They start at about 1700 Hrs and you would be lucky to get anything post 1830. Everything there finishes off in a jiffy and not without reason!!

Their fried chicken is very appealing too in their own way!! 

Its crowded, have patience and the goods will be delivered and rather pleasantly both for your palate and your wallet!!!

Kolkata has taken a special liking to momo in the last decade. The concept of steamed momo has evolved from a Tibetan delicacy to a common street food and no one has been more instrumental about rise of the momo, than "Bappida" and his own brand of KFC, "Karunamoyee Fried Chicken",a.k.a "Solid Gulp".

At his stainless steel counter, you will find "Bappida"  and his team arrive sharp at 5pm, to start a culinary wizardry in front of frenzied chicken lovers and bunch of hungry college goers. Steamed momos, Chicken Sandwiches, Chicken Fry and "Pakoras" are his classic tricks and sometimes he also pulls out a "Topse Macher Fry" and "Crispy Sweet Corn" from his magical kitchen.
 
Eat or take away at an astonishing price of twenty per plate of four juicy and delicious momo is a deal you just can't resist. He sells his chicken fries for fifty a piece, serving at least 250gms of meat in a secret batter, with a lemony aftertaste. 

It's clean, it's cheap and "Bappida" knows how to keep his calm, even with a hundred hungry people shouting for their turn to receive Salt Lake's ambrosia, "Bappida" serves with a smile and maintains a first come first serve basis. 

Like all good things it has a flaw, which is by 6:30pm, it's time to clean up and prepare for the next day's show. The 90 minutes is precious for any foodie in Kolkata, because in terms of price to performance, "Bappida" is simply unrivaled and unmatched, unfortunately though, the vegetarians miss out on most of the magic and the late goers leave empty handed.

Now, this is a place, where you would get the best momos at the cheapest rate(Rs 20 for 4 pieces).. Its not a restaurant.. its more of a stall.. but trust me, the quality of momos being prepared, is lot better than most of the restaurants.. 
Food to look for- Momos and chicken wings
Do maintain time.. 5.30-7.. Yes, that's the time, by which you need to reach, to grab a plate of your food..

Recently visited this eatery. Located bang on Karunamoyee. Was amazed to see a huge queque in front of this eatery so decided to try it out was wanted a quick Munch. The chciken momo's were priced at Rs 20 for a plate of 4. Must say this is the most filling Momo i've ever had and is very economical. You must stand close to the person serving you the Momo to have a quick refill cause no one can do with just 1 serving.

From the restrained courtesy of Bapi 'kaku' to the proud loyalty of Bapi 'da', this place, for me, has grown from strength to strength. Back when it was an unnamed small shack - just another street food joint at some corner of the city, run by the man-in-charge (read: Bapi) and one or two men, it garnered fame from selling the most sumptous momos at the most inexpensive price. And having stood the test of time, the shack, recently (and very aptly) named Solid Gulp, consistently churns out only good food - and not just momos. 

Every evening they set up a tidy place (Yes, tidy! I had the benefit of seeing them clean the place spic and span with liquid soap) (no longer a shack) that very quickly becomes the nucleus of people from all walks of life.

Gulp on this: There are only one or two other places who can sell Steamed Chicken Momo as good as theirs but there is no competition once you look at the price (4 pieces for 20). The filling never feels inadequate and the chicken is cooked well. A plate of Chicken Pakora availed at 35 bucks (4 pieces) packs generous amounts of boneless, perfectly cooked chicken while going easy on the batter. Crispy Baby Corn is quite palatable if you're ready to compromise on the quality only a bit and consider the generous helpings at only 20 bucks a plate.

Most other items on their menu (a chicken-lover's paradise) are subject to changes but are invariably good. If eating then and there does not suffice, one can always go for take away. They even agree on bulk orders when told in advance. The tiny place is crowded right from the word 'Go!' and can surely outdo most established businesses.

Situated in the busy Karunamoyee crossing is the little stall of Bapi Da. The first time I went there, I didn't expect this place to be as hygienic as it actually is. And you can barely say anything bad about the steamed chicken momos he makes. One word - AWESOME. Equally tasty are the chicken fries. They leave you craving for more.
Next big thing - the extremely reasonable price. The momos come at just Rs 20 per plate!

Next time you plan to drop into his stall, be sure to arrive by 5pm! Bapi da opens up around then with his momos, whose huge demand makes them disappear in less than 1.5 hours.

Undoubtedly, Bapi Da owns the best roadside stall I have ever been to...looking forward to being a regular customer of his. :)

I guess I am the very first customer of Bapi Mama. Being his niece ^_^ His food has always been a delight for me... I have soo tasted everyone of his items and trust me they are all fabulous. Hungry one evening but you have a almost empty pocket , rush to his stall. Cause you will surely get a wide range of lip smacking items there. But yes first go for the awesome momo !!! You surely won't be able to stop yourself from divulging onto some more!!

When I went there for the first time , I was taken aback to see that it was just a small road side shack.... But when I tried their Chicken Steamed momos... and chicken fry... there was no looking back.... I have become a great fan of Bapida's Food... and a regular customer for that matter....The place is hygienic and their service is very prompt...just like Bapida promises with his signboard "Bapida at your Service". And the cherry on top ? The prices are really cheap... but be careful to reach bapida's place just after opening at around 5pm... otherwise you'll have to return with an empty stomach.... because the food finishes by 7pm... All in all... a place you must visit to satisfy your taste buds :)

The best street food joint I've ever been to, Bapi Da's momo is something simply irresistible. All other items besides the momos are also equally appealing. The food is well cooked, economic and very very tasty.. Hook in to this joint after 5 to enjoy lip smacking and savory food which will surely lure you to come to this place many a times.

You have got to taste the items available in this particular street joint!
He opens at around 5 pm and things get over by 6.30! I haven't ever been able to taste the momo because I could never reach on time :-(
But their other items are equally yummy. Chicken Fry, Chicken Pakoda, BabyCorn Pakodas.. everything is super-tasty! They are super-crunchy and with their cheap price, they can give certain fast food giants a run for their money!


They just need to increase their manpower, just to manage the queue!!
Otherwise, a perfect street food counter!

Having seen the tiny momo stall right from its inception, I can vouch for the amazing food available. A plate of chicken momos cost 20rs, a plate having 4 pieces. Though the prices have increased in keeping with the times, the varieties have also increased and the quality, to my delight has remained the same. My favourite pick is the chicken sandwich and the chicken momos. With newly introduced veg items, the veggies will have something to munch on as well. I do wish that Bapi da will also introduce fried momos. If the crowd is a little more manageable it can surely give the restaurants a run for their money!!

If you love to eat off the street, this is the place to be. Karunamoyee bus stand comes to life at 4.30 every afternoon just because of Bapi Da. The food, the hullabaloo over orders, the pocket-friendly cost, the ambiance- it's awesome. A plate of momo costs around Rs. 50 and you just can't miss Bapi Da's famous sandwich. Trust me when I say it outdoes every other food joint. Be it the quantity of ingredients or the taste, Bapi Da gives you a happy bite only for Rs. 35. There are Chicken drumsticks, Chicken lollipops and Pakoras. Veggies would find it a little difficult to order anything of their sort. But it's a must-visit for meat-eaters. The place is thronged by office-goers and local youths. One thing about Bapi Da that can be considered as a disadvantage is the short duration of the shop. It opens at 4.30 every afternoon except Sundays and closes right before 8.00.

Awesome. It is the word, I could start with. Having bapi da's momo, chicken lollipop, fries, pakora etc since 2006. It's still d same taste, crowded stall ... But you have to have enough time in your hand if you are planning to come this place. You would have a durga puja feel seeing the crowd. Lolzz.. but come and try it once.. Bapi da stalls beside of the salt lake-sai/phoolbagan auto stand..

All three items were fresh, hot and very very tasty and surprisingly just for Rs. 85/-. Great value for money.Will definitely visit again soon.

You have to time yourself right to get a taste of Bapida's momo. He opens the shop by 5pm and by 6.30 it's all over. Excellent entrepreneurial skill shown by hotel management graduate Bapi Banerjee. Excellent momo, chicken pakoda and chicken legs. Price is cheap. Though its a roadside shack but its hygienic. I never had any gastronomical problem after eating at this place. The students of nearby colleges, sector 5 employees and local residents really fight over food here. I think soon he would have to install queue managers. ;-) by the way this place has got a official name also "solid gulp".

Thanks to Bapida(who is much much younger than me) for his wonderful delicacies at at highly affordable cost with reasonable sense of hygiene.The rush all around the shop is enough testimony to the popularity he has earned.He is cool, calm and comes out with the most mouthwatering plates quite fast almost from nowhere 
My best wishes for this young man and his colleagues.May their efforts culminate into a big chain known all over- like KFC.

bapi da s momo s are a favourite.
but the best thing for me  is the chicken sandwich.its simply awesome.stuffed with wholesome chicken,herbs,vegetables and a fine balance of mayoneisse.its a treat for the taste buds.

recently he has introduced a whole range of items from fish pakora,topsey fry,pomfret fry,mushroom pakora,broccoli pakoras.
the chicken fried items are old favourites for many.
the only concern is the quality of oil used.

I was so damn surprised when I realised till about a month back that I hadn't heard of this place. At least in and around Salt Lake, I know of quite a few good places to eat, and somehow this skipped my attention. Finding Bapida's Chicken "Setup" can be quite a daunting task for most of us. That is because he isn't there during the day. Bapida only sells from 5 pm and wraps up by 8. Head to Karunamoyee at around 5 and the setup is kind of difficult to miss because people wait for him even before he has started cooking. Reach early if you can, if you want to have a choice of what you want. Most people just ask the Bapida to give them whatever he has left.

This was before he had actually begun serving anyone. It is perpetually crowded. Why? It is because it is cheap. And the food tastes really good. Let us take the example of the fried chicken. You have something called the Jumbo fried chicken. Which is essentially one entire chicken cut into four parts. Each part is deep fried in a pretty batter which is honestly not very heavy on the palate. And they sell for 40 rupees each. I'll take those over the fried chicken they serve at KFC which turns out to be dry half the time. This kicks ass in terms of taste. And knocks the balls out of other places in terms of the price.

The plates these pieces of chicken are on are full size dinner plates. So they are really big. And two of those pieces, weigh a bit over 500g. So we spent 100 rupees each and got ourselves a feast of sorts. You end up stuffing yourself at the end. And it is good chicken. This is how fried chicken should taste. Crispy on the outside and so damn soft and juicy on the inside. Not overcooked chicken, but perfectly tender stuff. 

You can also try the chicken momos out. 20 rupees, 4 or 5 pieces. A damn good deal! Chicken lollypops sell for about 30 for 4 pieces. Chicken pakoras sell for 25 and same for the sandwiches. And because you pay less, you don't get just batter. You get solid pieces of chicken. Succulent pieces of fat chicken. Sadly for the vegetarians, you don't have much here. I am grateful for that.

One more thing. You cant help it but admire Bapida. It is chaos there. More than 20-30 people at any given point of time around that little shop asking for food, and Bapida still has the time to always smile. He keeps track of every order and always gives you what you are supposed to get first. There are 3 others working with him. And they are extremely clean in the way they handle food. Small shop, yet brilliantly done.

The famous Bapi da r Momo is the hot spot of karunamoyee. People just pounce over Bapi da for food. Because the food is worthy of every thing that you go through to get the first bite. In short a must must visit, not once or twice but a 100 times.

One of the favourite street food hotspots in saltlake.. difficult to get such tasty and filling momoz in Kolkata, leave Salt lake. I hail from Siliguri where you get cheap and tasty momos but this place can beat some of the recipes there also! 

You gotta be lucky to get his momos after 7 pm in the evening! Rs 20 for a plate of 4! Chicken fries, pakora and thighs can beat good places like KFC coz its fresh and so well marinated.. and best of it all.. so cheap! One thing not to miss in Salt lake!

Bapi da's momo is the best in kolkata. Thanks for adding this place.From my childhood days I am huge fan of bapi dar momo. In the year 2006-2007,he used to make chowmein,pompret fry along with momos. Nowadays his chicken wings has become delicious than kfc .His chicken sandwich and chicken pakora are also in high demand.Very much pocket friendly for students overall a hygienic place.No doubt bapi da is very friendly. Dont doubt on his cooking he is a hotel management pass out student.

This place is AMAZING....And even that would be an understatement. The prices are outrageously cheap,and the food is fantastic. Bappi da practically runs out of stock within four hours of opening shop. And the best part is that Bappi da practically proves even road style stalls can be hygienic and safe. The chicken preparations are great.The taste lingers for a very long time,and the portion sizes are good as well. People go crazy over the momos as well,but I personally feel that the more expensive chicken products on offer ( like the Rs 40 per chicken thigh with leg fry ) are a runaway hit. Prices are extremely cheap,to be quiet honest. The most expensive item would be of around fifty rupees...personally,what with the fabulous crunchy and spicy taste and the pocket friendly pricing,Im sure this place can give certain fast food giants a run for their money

Its been over 3 years now that i have known this place and i am quite a regular visitor since then.
back then bapi da used to make only momo and chicken lolypop. he used to set up his shop exactly at 5.00 pm and used to pack up by 6.30 pm
momos used to be over within half an hour so i used to go and wait there from exactly 4.55 pm and used to see him set up his shop and eat the first batch of momos!
i have absolutely no words to describe his momos! they are simply awesome and i perhaps will never get bored of its taste and i can say it blindly that bapi da's momo is the best momo i have ever had.
coming to the lolypop or any other chicken fries, i used to and still wonder about the secret ingredient he puts in the batter which makes it SO crunchy!!
and taste? again the best i have ever had and no other place can ever compete with him.
now, bapi da has increased his items and put up a menu card.
they fry every thing on the spot hence the service is a bit slow compared to the number of people waiting and i sometimes even wait for 20-30 minutes (of course when i have the time) to get their fries as its completely worth of waiting!
though the stall is very small but its not hard to locate as the crowd that surrounds the stall can easily be located from a distant point and you will get to know that its bapi dar dokan
this stall has become quite famous over the years and if anyone who passes by this place often and wonders what's this fuss about then i would suggest just give a visit to this place and see it for yourself whether you can control the tempt of visiting again!

You have to try this before you can be sure about what I am saying. The chicken fry is better than KFC. If you had your fill with new curry from KFC, then you will be very disappointed once you have Bapi da's chicken fry. Spicy and crispy to the true sense. Only problem very long que and no guarantee you will get it either, stocks don't last at Bapi da's. So be early and have some time on hand other wise no chicken fry for you.

Not sure how the momo is as i have eaten only two things here.... the chicken fried... and the chicken wings... both of them are simply mind blowing.. 

this is one place that's beyond imagination ...... u come.... fight for the chicken..... and when u get lucky.... eat it..... i am not joking.... people actually fight for the chicken .... there are people shoving money into the pockets of the vendor... he starts shop at 5 pm... and people are waiting since 4.30.... and the chicken vanishes... 

i had to wait for 20 mins before i got mine... coming to the chicken.... the batter is super crunchy ... even after 10 mins in the parcel.... it was crunchy as hell.... the batter is not plain.... it has some spices mixed into it.... probably the man uses rice flour in the batter.. that makes it so crunchy.... none the less i don't wanna waste my time dissecting it.... as what bapi da gives at the prices he does is brilliant.... 

after eating here.... i dont go to KFC...

This has to be my Favorite Eatery in Kolkata for four reasons: 
1. Awesome Momos
2. Bapi Da Smiling Face
3.The Crispy batter on the Chicken 
4. Location, Location and Location 

Well first of all you need to be able to scream and shove if you want to eat here and even though it is open till 8 PM, you need to be there by 5:30 PM Max if you want to eat anything!
I have never seen this place empty, and for a good reason the food here is awesome !..Best Momos in whole of Kolkata in its price range, I am sure nobody is content with a single plate. and the Chicken!! OMG the Chicken is awesome. The Batter Bapi Da uses on the Chicken is so good and the Chicken inside is soft and juicy!!..
The Chicken Lolipop, Xhicken Drumstick, Chicken pakora, Chicken Wings and the Quarter Chicken are all good and will have you coming back for more.
This is actually the 1st Road side eatery where the staff isn't rude or loud ,  Bapi Da and his boys are always smiling and helpful..
Now you also get Chinese Dishes here and Sandwiches, but I have never tired these but I hear they are good too..

The Food here is Damn Cheap , but with my appetite, me and my friends always end up spending a lot here, so it should cost 2-3 guys 300 Bucks if u eat as we do, but for normal folks it shouldn't cost you more then 150 bucks..

Rating: 4.5/5
