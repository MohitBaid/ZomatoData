Best best best!!!!!  In terms of price, food quality, interior and hygiene it's simply amazing. Must visit place as it can give you homely nostalgia in sense of food taste. I will recommend it to all.

Must say that this place provides the best and tasty food you can have in Kolkata.. this is a genuine comment!! And the price is very nominal.. average is 300 for two people and also the ambience is perfect!! Must try place :)

Very bad service.. too much time taken to deliver the food I ordered.. when I received the noodle, it was cold and did not taste good as well...

The name is pathetic. Forget the food. I wonder why you'd choose such a name for any restaurant? Why is it that only women/wives should cook?
