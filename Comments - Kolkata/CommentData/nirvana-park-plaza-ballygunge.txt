I love their ambiance, Classy calm sophisticated. Though prices are bit high but with quality food and classy decor this place is worth a visit for sure.

Very cool ambience, specially with the Giant Buddha sitting right next to you. Its a top end bar, serving premium drinks.
The best part, being located at a corner, its mostly empty and very quiet. If peace is what u desire for your drinks then visit this place for sure.
And also, tyr out the fish items, they have a few delicious fish preparations.

Unique and calm ambience, pin drop silence, very serene place. Good for relaxing while you fulfill you hunger. Food is good but inadequate in quantity. Go for it for experience unmatched in kolkata.

This is a beautiful place inside Park Plaza in the Ballygunge Area. Being a uptown hotel in the city the place definitely matches the class and the decor is aesthetically done. We had been there with a nearbuy coupon offering 6 drinks a starter under 1000 rupees. Without the offer the prices are on the higher side. Service is nice and the staff behavior extremely courteous. The choice of music doesn't go with the decor only the place. One tip if you are looking for quantity go for the Chinese starters instead of their Indian menu. Overall a decent experience.

Niravana is on the second floor of the Park Plaza Kolkata, near Gariahat. It redefines the lounge experience as one of the best bars in that area. You can distress and unwind yourself from the clastraphaubic city life. Its sensual and unique ambiance is the highlight of this place along with a 25 ft tall Buddha Statue. A mixture of Classical and contemporary dishes is also an impaccable experience.

We went here in January because Smoke Shack, another restraunt at Park Plaza was booked for a wedding. We reached at around 5pm and the place was quite empty. From what I had seen in pictures, the place was pretty small, very limited seatings. It seemed to be an extension of k19 because we walked through that to see a little space at the end with a bar for Nirvana. The food and drinks were decent. Nothing great. With the many restraunts there in Park Plaza- Nyon Yang, K19, Smoke Shack, I would rank Nirvana the lowest.
