One of the worst that u will ever find in this part of this city! They would rob u off specially if u are ordering online and having paid the bill! They would never receive ur call if u have already made ur payment n be assured u will never receive the food!! I wonder why Zomato still has it in its list (probably cz of the money it is pouring in on zomato account) but otherwise, it is one pathetic destination to order food online as u will never receive them

I live in rajarhat and order often from this place..the food is decent and the one thing that doesn't improve is that they don't provide any soup with momo! I have complained but they just don't listen. Once i called them and told them about it so they said they will deliver and I'm still waiting :P They should really improve their services otherwise people won't order much even if the restaurant has good food.

We had tasted the chicken fried rice,  chill Chiken, noodles in multiple occasions. We must admit that the taste is too good, and price is competitive. Keep us Topiwala! We are beside you...

I actually hated the food. one should serve gravy noodle always with separate gravy and boiled noodles. they didn't do that. moreover, for the first time I ate a chicken noodle full of uncooked garlic! even the chilli babycorn was not at all crispy. 
I have only rated 3 due to their polite attitude.
hope they will take necessary steps to make their food quality better.

Very bad customer service. I waited 1hour after the ETA and order was still not there. They gave the excuse of traffic to Zomato customer service. Anyone who knows Rajarhat, must know that there is hardly any traffic here at 11in the night, that too on a Friday. Moreover when I called them, they said me that they were just outside when Zomato team cancelled my order, so they took it back. But as per my chat with Zomato, they made the refund as it was 1 hour late and the meal was on them. Pathetic behaviour by restaurant. Not ordering from here again

I will definitely give 4.0 rating for this joint. It came to my rescue when I was desperately in need of food. Ordered Crispy chicken in starter, Hunan chicken and chicken egg fried rice for the main course. The crispy chicken could have been better but the Hunan chicken and fried rice were lipsmacking. They made exactly the way I have tasted in some other Chinese restaurants. Hope they grow big. The delivery was prompt too.

The worst kind of professionalism I have ever seen with Topi Wala, sachme topi pehnata hai. Ordered food @8.49 PM over phone, @10.20 PM they still says that they are coming in 2 minutes (although that was after 3 times followup). This does not even deserve 1 star. Never recommended for odering food from here!!!!!!!!!!!!

On a shuttler's recommendation, I dropped by to this small shop to taste north east zayka- momos. To my satisfaction, it was the best as it reminded me of authentic momo chutneys n soup from Bangalore days. Ordered veg steamed n chicken steamed momos for satiating evening's hunger. The best one in kaikhali within budget.

I didnt order a lot of food from them but their momos are amazing! being from the hills, it is a dish that i always look forward to and they make pretty good ones.Â i also tried their chilli fish, taste wise it was quite good only the fish chunksÂ were too big and I didn't like the fish they used. by the end of it, we felt like we were having machher jhol.Â 
but will surely order more food from them and probably update this review. :)

UPDATE
I tried their chowmeinÂ and chilli chicken. both of which were decent.Â 
However, their mutton momos are to die for! They run out of them by 8 pm so one must order those while stocks last.

Nice joint being a hotelier, this is an ibiz at 1.30am at night - getting hot and spicy food, the behaviour of the owner is very humble, the staffs are very proactive over all worth a try if you want late night jumble.

Great experience!!! The real taste of Chinese and Tibetian food can be found here. Very few outlets in Kolkata serves such kind of Momos. The service provided by the folks there was very good. It's great to eat food when such humble guys serve you. Must check out the place for authentic Momos!!!

Delivery- Delivery was half an hour late by what was promised.

Packaging- No Tissue No spoon. Leakage in packing (see the pics)

Food- I find myself lucky that I just ordered a Shanghai Fried rice and did not wasted much money. It was just yellow colour fried rice hardly any veggies. Yet another topi baaz after midnight roast.

Zomato has no standard left they are listing any road side restaurant just to boost there comission. I had word with one of the zomato executive he said they have no idea about the quality of the food served. Now how do they solve customer problems is by arranging a call back from the restaurant. What a great initiative.

Verdict- If hygiene is not an issue to you give it a try after looking after the pics however there are far better late night delivery outlet delivering hot piping food till 4am.
