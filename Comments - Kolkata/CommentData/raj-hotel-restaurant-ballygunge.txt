So Basically 
If you are at Ballygunge and you ask me for some good food there 
I will DEFINITELY DEFINITELY SUGGEST YOU "TGE RAJ HOTEL AND RESTAURANT"
I don't know but I find a kind of attachment for this place.Be it the amiable staff or the location everything is so perfect.Located very near to the Ballygunge Station this place serves very tasty food to satiate your hunger. I love their rolls,I love their chicken,Damn it's so tasty and so pocket friendly too.They have Ac and Non Ac seating arrangement, oviously if you have hole in your pockets and want to gorge something prefer seating in the Non AC seats.They charge a bit high for AC seats and this is very obvious.Dont delay,The more you delay the more you are losing a gem ðŸ˜‰

A very old place in the region, known for its rolls more so than its dining. 
I have not dined here but can safely vouch for the service here which is quick and decent. Some of the chicken preparations are good for its price, and quantity too. 
They have a fridge, an ice cream cooler too which makes up for a complete meal in very cheap rates in the para. 
The shop could need a facelift or a new paint to further invite the low price-bracket customers.

This place is great... it's like i used to go there so often as i had my college nearby... and still i take long way to home to go there the noodles and the rolls are awesome but you shouldn't miss the crispy chicken it's so awesome... the appearance is not so convenient, but it's because of it's age ... i heard about it's existence from my father's college days ... so apart from the appearance one should try it once as it's cheap and tasty !!!

I mostly visit this place for Rolls. Located between Ballygunge Dominos and the station, just opposite of S9A bus stop. The outlook of this place may not look very pleasant but the food is good.
The restaurant comprise of two parts. One serving from outside for walk away, making mostly rolls. And the inner one with all the items as in the menu. And if you take rolls from the outer counter it costs Rs.2-5 less per roll.
I had rolls many a time and I must say they make good rolls. Paratha is good. Contains potato inside wrapped with good quality ketchup, making an excellent stuff.
I took the Chilli Chicken once which was pretty good.
Value for Money. Tasty food.

To be completely honest I never liked the outlook of this place...due to my friends recommendation I have visited this place quiet a number of times...the only thing mentionable to me is the quantity of food served which is quiet a nice amount...I have tried almost everything this place had to offer and my point is they should concentrate more on hygiene and food was so oily it made me sick for the next couple of days so I won't be recommending this place to anyone

Located very near to ballygunge station this small humble restaurant is always crowded owing to its location.not exactly a place to chill n click selfies while u enjoy the ambience(there z no ambience at all) but what z really good is its Indian spread..
My favourites being chicken tikka masala n lachcha paratha..
Its very reasonable n the service is very good.even with 150 in ur pocket u can have a hearty meal n I think that's great for any of us students!!

Have always come to this place for breakfast. You'll get a South Indian feel as soon as you step in. The sambhar is to die for. Nice buzz to the restaurant and it's usually full. The dosa is pretty nice. Specially rasa dosa. Top it off with amazing filter coffee and one would walk away very satisfied and full!

This place is situated near Ballygunge railway station. I mainly tried their egg rolls and chicken rolls for a few times while returning from college. Nothing extra ordinary about the taste of rolls. It is just like any other roll center. Never tried any other dishes. I would surely give it a try for another dishes referred in the menu.

Just Near to Ballygunge station ticket counter & end of Bijan setu. Moglai patatha, chicken roll and chilli chicken with paratha are my favorite. Bengali food in lunch is awesome like steam rice, dal, sukto, fish curries etc. Good restaurant for Chinese and authentic Bengali cuisine with Nice seating arrangement. Restaurant Name is quite justified.

Had a long afternoon(31st Oct,2015) shopping and we even missed out our lunch, so we decided to have something. 
Located a few steps away from Ballygunge station, its serves a huge crowd. This place is not unhygienic, but its up to you, how you judge it for the love of food, because I've had from more clumsy places, and never fell sick.

The Chicken rolls served in this area are too small for satisfaction so we decided to dine-in.
 
Heads:2
Orders:
3 Lachcha Paratha(Rs 12x3)
1 Chicken Bharta(Rs 95)
Total bill: Rs 161
 
Parathas(7.5/10) : It was thick and fried very well. It was rich and the outer crust was crisp which I always prefer. Absolutely value for money and is worth spending.

Chicken Bharta(5/10): The marks are just because it filled my stomach. The quantity was okay. Looked good and was served with an egg on top and bits of egg were in the bharta too as its usually found. Tasted completely BLAND. There were no taste of spices despite the fact it was rich and looked spicy and tasty from outside. The only taste I could acquire was the salt and pepper which I added. It looks like Chicken Bharta but doesn't taste like one. Neither its the pujas that there will be problems in quality. It was a waste of money.

DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS , EXPERIENCE AND TASTES AND ALSO WAYS JUDGING A RESTAURANT, SO,DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR A BETTER CONCLUSION.

Raj Hotels and restaurant is founded at nearly 1988 as Bharti Restaurant but later they renovated and change their name to Raj. This is a very popular restaurant and snacks bar situated 1 min walking distance of Ballygunge station. I tried couple of times mainly at evening for fried rice and manchurian chicken. Fried Rice quantity is enough for two people, tastes is good also you will find lots of prawn and chicken on it. Chicken manchurian tastes normal, Not extraordinary. Serving time is 12 minutes only. No VAT needed. Staffs are well behaved.

The ambience is a bit noisy as CSTC bus stand is just opposite and a lot of autos honk away. The service is very fast and the quality and quantity of the food is great. Good for a quick bite on your way.

That day we had a small picnic of sorts and from Prinsep Ghat, we took a train to Ballugunge station and were very hungry when we discovered this joint and entering it was not a mistake! The menu has a lot to offer and it is good value for money! Â I really liked the food!

I have been to this place many a times since 2012. However yesterday  I visited this place with a friend and ordered few dishes.
Crispy chinese fried chicken had a flat taste. So we ordered two more dishes chicken manchurian fried rice and chicken manchurian. Chicken manchurian fried rice was really great and it tasted yummy; however the chicken manchurian was hard and was too sweet in taste (generally manchurian is not that highly sweet). The portion of sauces in manchurian needs to decrease. Lastly the service was prompt and customer friendly  but it is really hot eating inside keeping in mind the rising mercury level of kolkata.
