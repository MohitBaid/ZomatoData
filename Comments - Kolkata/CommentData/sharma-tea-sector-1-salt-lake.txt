Nice place. It's for snacks. The kachouris were really good. I'd like to visit this place. But they don't have much place to sit. Cheap price. Do visit with your friends.

This place is a good place to kill ur early morning hunger...very easy to locate...near salt lake sector 1, swimming pool..more of a take away joint... however they have placed few tables on the footpath....I love their jalebi rabdi, if u want hot rabdi jalebi..than u need to be there by 6:30am...they make good gajar halwa...they are famous for their club kachori...overall   decent place to hangout...

Since childhood I am a big time fan of this place.. because there gigantic "bhaar e cha" never ever left my tastebuds in utter dissatisfaction. There jilipi and gajaar ka halwa is worth mentioning...and one should try these two dishes to satisfy your sweet tooth.

must visit place for tea lover, but i thinks it‚Äôs unfair to just visit there only for tea other north Indian delicacies are amazing too like¬† Kachories, Samosa , poori they are equally good. 

iusuly¬† sort of place which is driven by their product quality i don't have any expectation of service neither you get also. Which is fine 

i think this is good place to visit once.

Visited this eatery quite a few number of times. This joint is quite popular for the sweets and savouries it offers along with Tea. They also sell veg sandwich and cheese sandwich. If you arrive by your car and wish to be served inside your car then this wish will be fulfilled too. Their service is prompt. I have only one complaint... they dont maintain proper hygiene. I have found hairs and dust on their Rabri and sand in their samosas, not once but almost everytime i visited them. No doubt their snack options are delicious but finding hairs or dirt while munching isnt a pleasant experience at all. Tea and sandwiches has been my staple here as they are less likely to harm anyone cuz sandwiches come in packaging and tea is served piping hot.
If they could improve their hygiene i will try their rest of the snacks they offer.
Coming to the morning menu, club kachories looked enticing but they tasted average. Paranthas were average as well and i found they lacked in their fillings inside. Sandwiches were the lone rescuer there for me! üòÖ
If you are loitering around the place and need a cup of chai to brighten up ur time, you can rely on this place.

Sharma‚Äôs a gem of one of its kind. Their service is pretty fast & there are few tables around the place where you can sit & eat or choose to sit on you bike/car and enjoy your quick snack. 
The club kachori, tea & lassi are great. My personal favourite is their gulab jamun, huge and piping hot. As one can guess, this place is extremely light on pockets.

Located in swimming pool, nice place to have morning breakfast, evening snacks as well as dinner also. I frequently visit this place and tried club kachori, dahi bada, lassi, gulam jamun, samosa , Jalebi n some Parathas also. All are good in reasonable price. But the only thing is there is no such sitting arrangement. Either u have to stand n eat inside the shop or u can sit outside where there is no shade. If this doesn't a matter for u then go for it.

Literally a marwari paradise. Sharma tea is a part of Sharma sweets and snacks. It is a part of a chain, part of a brand, part of a reputation, and it clearly stands true to the expectations. Hot tea is made throughout the day, and served in small earthen clay glasses. They make a variety of teas, out of which the masala tea and the kesar tea are my favourites. They even serve mouth watering snacks and sweets.

You can park your car on the road and have tea & snakes sitting inside your car. The food quality is quite good. Service is quick too but usually people gather there to spent some time. It's very easy to locate, just beside Saltlake swimming pool.

The name Sharma always rings a bell when you say kachori and Lassi. Sharma Tea in Sector 1, Salt Lake is no different. Best known for their tea and kachoris, this place is awfully crowded any given time. And one can easily spot the biggest international brand of cars parked outside this joint. That's it's popularity. Every single item in this shop is expensive, but it does have quality, and of course the location demands money. The lassi and jalebi are my favourite here. They also have pulao and paneer and rajma and all sorts of stuff if you fancy a quick dinner. Overall a very cool place to hangout with friends or if you are just craving kachori/tea/lassi

You will find that most people here are wearing white clothes in the morning, this indicates they have returned from their walk either from Victoria or Central Park. Anyways, the food here is good. The specialities is the tea, lassi, Dudh Cola, Kachori Sabji, Pyaaz Kachori, Samosa.

I love their tea! It's the best you'll get in Salt lake. Plus the crispy samosas, kachoris, jalebis etc that they have on their menu are to die for. This is a place where innumerable people come to hang all through the day. They don't have an elaborate seating arrangement, just a few stools outside. Usually people sit inside their cars and get served there only. This place is what truly defines "adda" in Salt Lake area at a reasonable price and light snacks that they offer on their menu. I especially love their jalebis, gulab jamun and rabri being a sweet tooth :)

Can never understand the reason behind the hype about many things in India. Sharma Tea happens to be one such hype....It has become a place to hang out with friends and a go to place for friendly meetings in the evenings but the food quality is not upto the mark and specially when you consider their prices. The over hyped Tea was just ok and the over hyped samosas were simply not good (too oily and not great in taste). Imarti was good.¬†

May be it had good taste when it started out and now banking on the popularity and hype created.

Tea, paneer pakora, michi pakora- just awesome. Radha ballavi curry is awesome- the fried stuff is too oily. Tea is my favourite and the best in the town..

This place has the best jalebis and kachoris in all of Saltlake.
And not just one type of kachori. I can keep on praising the samosas and the gulab jamuns too..
The feel is relaxed and laidback. There is a seating area, though dont expect much. The staff are helpful and friendly.

Sharma tea is the embodiment of the age old Indian gold standard ... "Sasta, Sundar, Tikao". Well, the sundar here refers to the food, and not the setting. The setting, though not fancy, is quite comfy. It will give you the "Bangali Para" feel with good kadak chai, jalebi, chops, or some other snacks you may fancy, with your friends for company.... ¬†The lassi is quite good too.Visit the place, and you'll wanna come back.

Sharma tea is known for its tea. I ordered for a kesar tea and it went pass my expectations. The best i had for sure. The jalebi too is just incredible here. People usually chillout over here over a cup of tea sitting back in their cars. Good place for evening snacks and  indian style breakfast.

My go to place for adda and chai for about 3 years now. A great place to just chat along with delicious snacks and tea. 

I love this place and have been a regular here. Located at Salt lake Swimming pool , this place is known for the great ambience. No decor or anything , the food is served to you in your car. Great service and good food. 

Must haves are the dhokla, bread pakoda, piyaz pakoda, club kachori, tea, kesar tea, and Dudh Cola. 

Cheers !!!

This place is in one of the corners of Salt Lake. 
The parking place is enough and the tea boys are quick to attend you in your cars. 
The kachori Sabji was good and so are the other fried items. 
Mosquito is one problem if you plan to eat in the open air.

No matter how good you tea is, I am not paying 20 bucks for tea in earthen cups (bhnar ki chay), and in fact it's not even that good. You can get better tea in any roadside tea stall in Kolkata with better flavour and taste, for 4 bucks.

A very refreshing and Indian style chai (tea) and coffee will attract you to come here and also, we all know chai taste best with #samosa. Typical Indian place offering Indian snacks and very friendly people who serve food in your respective cars. So one need not necessarily step out of their comfort zone to gulp down food. However what I feel is since they have a "sharma" tag their prices are little high because usually one expect Street food to be cheap.

Sharma Tea is a very famous but small joint near swimming pool, Saltlake. Last Sunday, we all went to Sharma for Breakfast and started our new year.We ordered Club kachori and sabzi, jalebi, nimki with mich achar and kesar tea. The service is good and staff also friendly and super efficient. Tea is just mind blowing. It is the USP of Sharma. I had 2 cups of tea. The flavour was awesome and was very refreshing. The sabzi kachori was also served hot and tasty. It was great in taste.The place does not have much seating arrangement but overall a great place for hangout.They serve samsosas and snacks in the evening too.

Visited this place on the 26th of December while returning from Vedic Village. The place is easily navigable using google maps and parking here wasn't a hassle by the time we reached here. We ordered the following¬†

Kachori Sabzi - We ended up ordering 12-15 plates of these, each had 5 small kachoris, green chilies, a tamarind chutney (Sweet one) and unlimited aloo ki sabzi (YAYYYYY)
Jalebi - Ordered 12 of these as well, came a little cold but we weren't complaining as everyone was busy eating.
Lassi - Perfect lassi, served in an earthen pot, enjoyed it thoroughly :D
Dhokhla - Initially only one friend ordered this dish, but it was so soft and just melted in the mouth we ended up ordering 5 plates of these.

All in all, this breakfast left us very, very satisfied and didn't burn a hole either. It cost 1500 in total and that is very, very cheap for the amount of food we ate!
            

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name in both places)

Location: in CF block, near swimming pool, in salt lake sector 1.

Interior designing: this place is more like a roadside dhaba for people to have their adda place and spend their time here. They dont have interior seating but you can look at the foods displayed inside. You can either stand or there are some few tables outside where you can sit and have food with your friends.

Food and service: service is almost prompt and the servers do come back to ask if you're all alright. They serve various snacks, ranging from sandwich to kachories. I've been coming here quite a lot and decided to write a review right now. You can also eat in your car. The tea here tastes good and so does the food. Must eat.

Well, I do not often have chola bhatura and bread pakoda (i.e. both snacks items) for lunch, but today, the devil in myself convinced me to do so! 

The knack of experimenting new places and surfing office delivery restaurants on the Zomato app unveiled the ‚ÄúSharmas‚Äù based out of Sector 1 Saltlake to me. I went ahead without much deep thoughts and ordered the above 2 ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù for my lunch.

A 4 on 5 to the Zomato delivery guy ‚Äì nice to see them work so hard for a 100 rupee bill ‚Äì and food was delivered in an hour. A 4 on 5 to the Sharmas for packing ‚Äì too decent considering just a couple of items ordered. A 4 on 5 further ‚Äì for food taste and quantity, but a repentant 1 on 5 for food quality ‚Äì READ ON ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

The 2 bhaturas served with a decent quantum of chola were good, although, quite chewy ‚Äì which is understandable since this was an office delivery. Mind it they also serve some tempered green chilly along with their bhaturas. Coming to bread pakoda, tasty and fine aloo stuffing ‚Äì served with complimentary sweet chutney as well as green chilly chutney.

So, where did they go wrong ‚Äì QUALITY! An hour post lunch, I suffered the worst of acidity ‚Äì and thus did not even have the courage to go for dinner ‚Äì an after-effect of the down-market oils used in the preparations.

Barring this, all well all good!

Don't know how many times have I visited here. It never fails to impress always. The kachori sabzi or club kachori is the all time favorite. It's the best place to have breakfast early in the morning after having a walk around or swimming in the pool nearby. Tea is the best. If looking for something cool, then go for lassi or doodh fanta/cola. Just the best.

Whenever I walk by Sharma Tea, I see crowds of people chillaxing with their friends and/or family on the chairs in front of the place or in their cars. It almost ALWAYS has customers. And with good reason. This is probably the only place where my mother doesn't mind paying for tea made by someone else, because their tea is really decent. The khasta kachori, samosa, nimki, radha ballavi are all pretty good and very fresh.
I'm however more interested in their sweets and the gulab jamuns are my favourites. 
Perfect for chilling on those 'jobless' evenings.

They serve the club kachori in the traditional way with potato curry, chutney and chilli pickle. Absolutely delicious.
Gulab jamun is also tasty.

Sharma tea is one of the popular places for their tea specially and that is quite famous around the city. They have quite a few outlets here and there in the city.

##Location:
This outlet is located at Saltlake CF block near swimming pool area.

##Experience:

Been there numerous times and quite enjoy their snacks here. They have a sitting area outside with stools to be very specific. Snacks are amazing made fresh and served hot always. Try samosha , cutlet and the kachoris as well. Best and popular for their tea is a must try. Their big sized tea is served in a big bhad which is huge and very refreshing. Also I love lassi and the jalebis here. Dhoklas are quite tasty too.
One of the happening place for Adda and hang out.

When you are looking for the perfect morning tea to shed off that last bit of sleep away or hitting your taste buds with their first batch of comforting food, Sharma Tea serves as the best place for both. I love their hing and onion kachoris, they just go mesmerizing-ly well with the flavorful alu ki sabzi. I also make it a point to order a glass of lassi every time I visit. They have one of the best Lassis in town topped with a significant layer of Malai. The kachoris are fried to order and that makes so much difference. Its just about crispy around the edges with a soft easily tear-able center. Must Have.

This place has been our Chai Adda since 2011 when I was in Kolkata for an assignment & was staying near Baishakhi..This is very near to the famous "swimming pool area" :)

Me and my roommates were regular to this place because we never had better tea anywhere else in Salt Lake..We had tried almost every item here & trust me almost everything is just too yumm..Our favourite being Club Kachori, Radha bhalavi & Masala Chai..They serve Kachori with ¬†yummy aloo sabji,pickles etc which is just perfect combination..The sweets are also good & you can try their gulab jamun & lassi..¬†

Service is superfast & if you dont want to get down of your car they serve it in your car as well :) What else do you need in life:)

Left Kolkata in 2011 but my work gets me here after almost every 6 months..And, whenever I am here this place pulls me on its own and the best part is the taste is always the same:)

Highly recommended for breakfast or evening snacks..Just go for it without any double thought:)

Sharma Tea is a favourite for people who just want to sip chai and have long conversations. Apart from that nothing much is really outstanding. The chai is okay, the kachoris and samosas are also okay. The hot gulab jamuns and jalebis are good. They have been expanding their continously but I wish the place was bit cleaner.

A frequent visitor to this place. You wake up early morning and the best thing you can do next is have the masala chai of Shatma Tea. It opens as early as 5.30am and hence is an ideal place for breakfast after a walk and sorts. This place specialises in kachoris be it club kachori, pyaaz kachori, matar kachori or whatever. If you're in for a quick bite, this is your place.

Known for its Mind refreshing Tea,Sharma tea is a small outlet which started off selling tea but now someother snacks including lassi is already added to its menu.Had orderd gulab jamun and lassi..both tasted soo soo.Not better than anyother Confectionary .but Their tea us mindblowing.Located in the Posh Area of salt lake swimming pool this outlet is very small with less seating area but tea in clay cups will surely take away your heart‚ò∫

Had heard a lot about this place from people of salt lake. However was little disappointed with the quality that was served. Taste wise it's not bad but post intake of stuff like onion kachori/ samosa chat it doesn't give a joyful burp . Rather it gives some sort of uneasiness due to the continued use of the same oil since morning. Hope my feedback is taken in a positive manner and there is improvement in the hygiene factor. Needless to mention that the tea is wonderful.

Nice place to grab a quick bite or quench your thirst in this horrible humid summer of Calcutta.

Tea and Lassi are a must try, they are served in Kullad (Ceramic Cups). Even Samosa and Aloo Paratha are good. It's a quick bite place so do not expect Royal ambiance. But yes, you can expect a fast-track staff, spot-on service and a promising menu.

I heard Sharma tea is a great joint for evenings snaks in Salt Lake Sector 1.....I had told my hubby about this joint..... One day he had brought " Samosa & Aloo ka Paratha "...... Samosa was good becos stuffing was well cooked....Aloo ka Paratha was up to the mark, it's comes with aloo sabji & mixed pickles n mixed green salad , fresh curd......All item's are available in Reasonable Price......

Tried out this small joint, read a lot of good reviews about their club kachori. So ordered radha ballavi and Club kachori. They served it with aloo sabzi, chutney and pickled chilli. Wow I must say, pretty tasty. Club kachoris were awesome and had a nice crunch. Good value for money.

I am a frequent visitor to this place.Almost tried every dish of this place.The tea here in a chilly winter morning is pure bliss.The parathas are very nice and filling here.Among all snacks my favourite is the veg cutlet and dhokla.The mix pakora is not very appealing.The sweets like gulab jamun, jalebi every thing is perfect.Another item you should not miss is the lassi! Perfect creamy sweet goodness for summer.

Some of the best and tastiest and most fulfillingly pleasant Indian street food I've ever had. Their club kachori, khasta kachori were all very authentic and freshly made, and the beautiful chutney is perhaps one of the best chutneys I've ever tasted. I kept on dipping my finger to it just to get a taste of its sweet enticing feel. For early morning breakfasts, brunches, takeaways and of course the tea, Sharma Tea located near the Salt Lake swimming pool is a great roadside haunt for delicious mouthwatering streetfood and quick bites to pamper your tastebuds. If one hasn't tried any of their items yet, one must rush to it ASAP!!

A great place for breakfast which commences their operation right in the early hours of morning when most of us are still awake considering its not even midnight yet. Serves delicious Kachoris with yummy Sabji. And then you have their Samosas, Pakoras, Jalebis, Gulab Jamuns and their famous Chai. People come from far away just to taste their chai and the good part is that these people serve the meal right inside your car. Pocket pinch is quite low.

Well it was weird thing for me and my best buddy to go there for a cup of tea because we were out for a walk in the morning and I don't prefer eating anything then but one fine day for some work we had to visit a place nearby early in the morning and we both were hungry,and as its a much talked about when its about 'kulhar wali chai' which I like a lot as I generally don't like milk tea,so we went and had two chai(tea) and as my friend forced so we had hot served club kachoris with veggies (sabzi) which was really fresh,the taste was good,nothing extraordinary but the tea was better...but as the joint is a decent place to stand or sit and have a sip of tea,its overall good...

We went to Sharma Tea after a fun-filled Sunday at the grounds. Club Kachori was good. I'm not a fan of Lassi but I took the Lassi they make on being recommended. It is served with Malai and it was yum. Though the seats are on the sidewalk, it's a decent place to grab a quick bite at reasonable prices.

One of the best "refugee" brand in kolkata. Mostly they are famous for their special masala tea, I have seen people come by car, pay 20 rupees parking fee to have the 10 rupee masala chay. I had their club kachori, which is served with a fresh sabji with a chili achar. The taste is really awesome and of true "marwari" flavour.

Great place to have hot club kachoris at as early as 5:30 in the morning. The kachoris with a cuppa tea is the perfect combo. The other items they serve throughout the day are also pretty good, special mention for their paranthas, I love them. Sweets are decent non-Bengali sweets, love their lassi.
So all in all a decent place to have vegetarian snacks and sweets at not much cost.

If you are a morning person and you reside in saltlake, this is the first option that would come to your mind. The tea & Samosa are good to taste. However the hygiene of the food that is cooked is a big question mark, because i found lots of cockroaches near the cooking area.

Whenever you go for a take away they always forget to give one or two stuffs for which you again need to go all the way down to get it. I Strongly recommend to check your package whether it contains everything or not. Management hardly concerned about such things.

Was returning home from office with my colleagues when we spotted Sharma Tea on the way. So decided to go for some evening snacks and tea. This outlet is much better cleaned up and maintained than the other Sharma Tea outlets. They even provide plastic chairs as seating arrangements, which is good as compared to other outlets where there is none. Majority of the crowd are office goers, but people out for long drives even stop by.

We ordered Club Kachori, Samosa and Masala Tea. All of the items were great, especially the club kachori, best in town.

Overall a nice place to have breakfast or evening snacks at reasonable rates.

We generally visits by 7am every alternate weekends ! 
Club kachodi and sabji along with jalebi is the perfect combination to try out here , on top of it lassi ! Tea i prefer arun tea stall ! But rest of the things are really good ! 

Just take a morning walk and maybe drop by there

The bhajiyas (assortment of aloo, pyaz, dal) was no great shakes. This did not turn out to be a gem of a discovery :) The joint sure could try to be more hygienic.

A tad bit delayed service with very less seating arrangements, but the unique taste of club kachoris with the moderately spicy sabji, fluffy dhokla, and crispy hot jalebis totally compensate for those . A special mention must be made of the yummy lassi with a super fat layer of malai. It is surreal. Also heard from friends that the tea they serve is also decent. So... worth a visit !!

A lot of people have pointed out the location of this place as "just beside the swimming pool" . Well , here's a clarification : this place is not located just beside the swimming pool but a two minute walk away. Take the lane beside presidency girls' hostel and walk past the fenced park , and at the end of the park towards the right lies the tea shop. This place is a branch of the famous tea shop at ballygunj and is very popular among the car crowd , who stop by for a quick sip and bite. The first thing you notice is the kadai and the pakoras outside , and then you enter the air conditioned shop that has all its food items on display , making you spoilt for choice ! The basic samosa and kachori are available , along with other variants like piyaaz kachori, which comes for rs 25 and club kachori for rs 30! The piyaaz kachori is served in four slices with sabzi and sweet chutney . The hot gulab jamun here is a must try , and is hot, savoury and sweet! The amriti is crispy and fresh .  The club kachori plate, comprising 5 kachoris , is served with aloo curry and chutney , and is a must try here ! The mixed pakora plate , priced at rupees 50 , comprises pakoras made with chillies, aloo, paneer, bread , onions , capsicum,  and fried in a white batter .   The chai is flavored with elaichi and is absolutely refreshing after a good swim in the pool ! This joint made my day , and is sure to be on my hit list for several days to come!

I've been going here since childhood so thought i would better write a review. Better late than never.
       This tea shop is basically very up and about in the mornings as well as the evenings. If you are visiting in the morning, go for the Club Kachori and Jalebis which they freshly prepare; washing it down with their famous tea. In the evening the picks would be the samosa and the nimkis (both of which are accompanied by a finger-licking chutney) again along with their tea. If √Ωou are planning on taking sweets from this place - do try the mini gulab jamuns. They are totally exquisite. In summer, their lassi is not to be missed as it is one of the thickest around.
       They open very early and you can see a crowd at the place as early as 6.30am on the weekends. This place has no seating arrangements but you can easily park your car nearby and they will serve you in the car itself. A good place for the occasional breakfast and evening chat!

I am not a morning person hence I always give breakfast places a miss. But the foodie in me always wanted to try the famous Indian Breakfast places such as Sharma‚Äôs. 
A lucky morning arrived finally post an all-nighter. We were famished & the weather outside was perfect for a Sunday breakfast outing. Off we went to Sharma‚Äôs. We ordered Club Kachori, Jalebi. Cheese Sandwich & Lassi. 
It is a small shop & the seating arrangement is mostly roadside. Although the place was pretty crowded they served us pretty soon.

The kachori & sabzi was ok, the jalebi was loaded with ghee. But the best part of the meal was the Lassi. I am not a big fan of Lassi & usually never opt for it. I took a sip from my friend‚Äôs ‚ÄúBhar‚Äù & was blown over by it. I ordered one for myself immediately & finished it within seconds. 

Overall a cool place to go for some casual breakfast over chit chat if you stay near by. If you don‚Äôt stay in salt lake do drop in for that Lassi at least once!

Sharma tea is famous for its masala tea, samosa and gulab jamun. The amazing smell of masala tea and freshly fried samosas every evening is something magical.

Went there couple of times..This is a place where you can gossip with your friends for a very long time..no one would bother you..I like the outside sitting arrangements beside the shop..Shrama tea is well known for the tea and the chaats... i tried their khasta chaat which i really liked and tea as well.. prices are reasonable...there are ample sitting spaces...one can sit at the opposite park as well.

This place locted near salt lake swimming pool is always bursting with youngsters and foodies, they serve really good kachoris n chai. It has become quite famous and a great hangout place with your friends with a cup of masala tea and hog jalebis. I love their club kachoris. They serve hot n fresh food, although they have limited seating but once you taste the food you really dont mind it. One plus point is you can see your food being prepared once you order they fry the kachoris n serve you hot n fresh with a spicy succulent potato curry, if you live in saltlake a myst try place fr breakfast.

Sharma Tea: Famous for it's tea, this place is always at its verve to serve you their best. It is not a restaurant but a small shop where people park their vehicles and enjoy the servings on the road. I would recommend the bread pakoda, doodh cola & kesarya tea from this place. Do not try their Club kachodi, it's pathetic. A budget friendly place. 

*It's vegetarian*
Thank You

I absolutely love this outlet! Just situated near salt lake swimming pool I have visited this place innumerable times. 
If you are looking for authentic lassi either visit Amritsar directly or come here! Super delicious, thick and full of malai it's a paradise for people who love this particular Punjabi drink! It's super refreshing and quite filling. 
Also any Sharma outlet without a special mention about their club Kachori would be a shame, deep fried and served hot with some pickle and aloo ki sabzi, I love their meals. 
Also one shouldn't miss their jalebis, too tasty. 
Mostly crowded, the staff does falters a bit on the service front, because it's super busy and mostly their staff are running around and serving hot tea and snacks to people sitting inside their respective cars or seating outside. 
There's not much when it comes to "seating arrangements", a couple of plastic chairs thrown in, also like the most outlets they have small wall attached table for you to stand and eat, not air conditioned but this outlet has to be the cleanest one out of the lot for sure. 
It's always a delight to visit this super tasty snack corner and can't wait for my next visit! Superb!

Being a resident of the township of Salt Lake, I find this place to be a dedicated hotspot for the teenagers,senior citizens and the working professionals.
Salt Lake City may be a place dotted with many a sweet shops,famous tea junctions and fast food corners,but Sharma Tea is very special for me;and if you visit this place at least once in a week,you're sure to become an addict to their food.

Making an early opening at 0530hours it serves the best quality tea in the locality.
Both your smell buds and the taste buds will be treated to the sweet aroma of the jalebis they make.The fresh milk is always good in taste with their quality tea.

If you're a fast food regular,try out their samosas and kachoris.
One shot late and all of it is gone.So better be a little early if you have to grab the best.

The sweets served are good in taste and the ghee quality is very much up to the mark.

The only drawback of this place is it lacks a little in the variety,which I'm sure they will overcome very soon.
Otherwise be it the morning jogger or the evening jogger, you cannot complete your lap without having some dish/tea from Sharma Tea....

Salt lake is a class apart place in Kolkata so as there is difference in tea joints. Either you find tea-junctions or cafes or you find a very small place at the end of your block, which no way encourages or invites¬†any 'adda with friends'¬†like those tea stalls in other parts of Kolkata do. You won't find many places which are great for the tea-adda combination¬†in salt lake, but there is always an exception. That is "Sahrma Tea" in Sec-1. If you haven't been there, just pay a visit in the evening, the crowd and picture of adda will be enough as a trailer to justify what I have written.

Its a very small place, just like another typical sweet shop. But, they arrange stools for you outside the shop injecting some fuel to your adda. Even they will bring tea or food to your car if you can't convince yourself to come outside of your brand new car, just make some gesture to them, that's all. And hell yeah, staffs are really very friendly.

Being a regular visitor I would recommend one to try their Kachori (all the variants), Jalebi, Gulab jamun,¬†Samosa, Dhokla and whatever you may find in the menu. All the items are really good, and if you get it¬†hot then its best!! Don't forget to leave before trying their Tea or lassi (depending on your mood). The tea is great, it only brings most of the crowd I guess.
And guess what, the price is far more less than what you pay in a same kind of joint in any shopping mall! 
Overall Kudos to the team¬†'Sahrma', keep it up¬†!!! :)

One of the best tea stalls in Salt Lake vicinity, lost count how many times have visited there with my colleagues after a hard day at office.¬†
If you get a chance to witness how they prepare tea on mass scale will amaze you. A cuppa of tea is must there on that chili winter evening to warm you up while during sweltering summer that Plain or Rabri lassi to refresh you up. Depending on your mood and preference you can have any of their snacks available but my picks will be Khasta Kachori, Samosa and Mirchi Pakoda.
Price is reasonable enough not to blow away your wallet.

Location: Near Swimming Pool, CF Block.

This particular outlet of Sharma has been my usual morning haunt for tea and early breakfast as most of my friends live around this area. There isn't much of an AMBIANCE apart from the wall-side table inside the shop and stools on the pavement as seating arrangements. About the FARE, have always stuck to a usual few:

- Club Kachori [5 Pieces]
The non-greasy and fluffy kachoris are served along with aloo sabji and tempered chillies. Tastes great!

- Samosa
A flavorful filling of mashed potatoes with perfect seasoning. Tasted great.

- Nimki
Perfectly fried nimkis served along with tempered chillies.

- Tea
Aah, the aroma simply blows you away. Sip away along with the snacks, compliments well.

The SERVICE was always found to be quick and the STAFF was always friendly enough to gift you a great morning smile.

PRICES wouldn't pinch the pocket at all.

Overall has always been a great experience.

My review is solely based on only my indulgence of tea over here..since am a great fan of different types of tea and specially during winter evenings my main attraction becomes tea,my boyfriend brought me here yesterday night assuring me that i would love their tea and would surely ask for one more. He was so really right! I simply loved their tea,since am not a big fan of vegetarian food,therefore i didn't quite take a chance with rest of the veg stuff they offer. I saw a long queue of people their,most of them coming only for tea and i realised why this place is so famous for their tea. The reason why i deducted 1 is that they don't really have the space to accommodate very many people and also doesn't provide comfortable seating arrangements. Still i loved my first visit here and would surely love to visit again,next time may be for other vegetarian stuff that sharmas has to offer!

Visit this place today with my friend. They serve really an adequate nourishment. We could not resolve what to order in so many items eventually decree club kachori, rabri gulab jamun & plain lassi. The kachoris were very dainty in one word great. The rabri gulabjamun also stunning cannot find a fault in the savour. And finally the lassi makes my day it was too good. The man at the shop was very very good in behaviour and polite too. I will try their tea and some other items next time.

Earlier I had rated this place 3.5, but after a couple of visits I decided to change my review as well as the ratings.

The quality of tea as well as service has deteriorated..at times the tea tastes really nice and at times it is nothing more than boiled water..there is no consistency in the taste..same thing about the Kachori..sometimes they are well cooked and at times undercooked.

However, one thing that is consistent is the service provided by the staff..it is always terrible..unless you are a known face to the staff they will not come to take your order..even if the order is taken you will have to wait at least 30 minutes, even when there is no rush, to place any additional order..at times they may not even turn up to take your order..

Basically, there are other places nearby serving good,  tasty tea with quality service..so even if you miss out on this place, you don't get to miss much..

Sharma Tea is popular among the young people of (and outside) Salt Lake, and I usually tend to steer clear of the joint in fear of running into old acquaintances I desperately want to avoid. But if one is out on drives or jogs and doesn't have much in the pocket, Sharma Tea is a saviour. The tea itself is aromatic and refreshing and they do a decent job with the savouries. Good place for early morning or evening adda sessions.

So we tried chilli pakora..Then rabri gulab jamun...oh..it was amazingly delicious...
we ended up with their rabri lassi, its too thick,u just cant drink it, u have to eat this...

I really love Sharma tea. My family quite often visits the swimming pool in the same block so on the way form returning we always have a cup of tea and some snacks before leaving.The service in that restaurant is quite good.If you feel tired and are not in the mood to go all the way to the cash counter you can sit on the car from where the food can be ordered.Samosa and Aaloo Bonda is quite tasty.If the outlet has to improve anything it is that they must close the place for one day and clean it turning everything upside down.Very dirty inside....Rest everything is perfect.

Nice place for evening tea and snacks. One of the rare places in Kolkata where you get tea served in car... we occasionally drive to the place from office. Be ready to find a parking far away if it is prime evening. You will find the place bustling with young crowd. The tea will be served directly in the pitcher in your hand. The best enjoyment is with fried snacks like samosa with the tea. Being there always brings back memories of college...

SHarma Tea is the place where we friends usually go in the evnings if we are at Salt Lake. There is abundant space to park your car so there is no need for you to step out. The waiters come to take orders and deliver the food accordingly. They sell variety of items starting from bread pakora, club kachori and sabji, samosa, different types of veg pokara and other sweetmeats. The tea is good and is served in clay cups called 'Bhaar' in bengali which gives an earthen flavour to the tea. A nice place to chill if you are loitering in Swimming Pool area in Salt Lake.

If you are tired of boring breakfast of egges bread and butter.... You should really try sharma's Tea. Samosa, kachori, jalebi, lasssi and tea. I'm not much of a samosa kachori person.... But when you're at sharma tea... You can make an exception.. Everything they serve is amazing..! Chatpate tasty samose, jalebi is hot and crisp... And tea of course... I really like flvoured tea so I am a big fan. Recommended.

This is another food joint where i visited regularly with friends since 1st sem.... infact we have most of the dishes on the menu.. i am not a sweet buff so do not hav much idea about that but i tried the hot gulab jamun n laddoos they are just mouth watering... the lassi they serve is yummy... most of the time we get snacks delivered to our university during ocassion which consists of samosas they are even superb... the onion kachori is my favorite.. the chatney they serve is wow...i just always ask for more :p.. this place serves good food and gives a nostalgic feeling too for us as we hung out most of the times here

A landmark opp the BF ground.

Was drawn to it seeing the consistent crowd here. Had samosa - it is good but extra salty...
 
Dhokla is 30 for 2 pieces. Outrageous

Nice concept... Food served @ parking car..

Lassi, tea are good enough... Few sweets also up to the mark...

Typical flavored tea, if you don't like cardamom in your food then please pass this cuppa but if you like milk and flavors in your tea then sip on. The man supervising parking could have been less threatening though. Add ons like 'mirchi pakodi' is a good munch. Ideal for people wanting to chill in their cars while sipping tea. Our reason for going there apart for the obvious is also the choldren's park nearby where we can park our child and enjoy a sip.

Sharma's lassi has been a favourite of mine since my childhood days. So every visit to a Sharma joint is laced with a 'kesaria' nostalgia! Apart from the usually fabulous lassi and very good chai (if you occasionally favour the rich creamy taste as a welcome exception to the thorough bred aromatic liquor), I often visit this place as a breakfast joint. Their kachouris are one of my favourites with the fantastic sweet chutney and the chilli achar that accompanies them. Just heaven. I can eat plates together, and the size is just perfect - two bites with the subzi and one kachouri vanishes! Other items are pretty good too. 
Seating is on plastic tools outside, so summers can be a problem. The excellent locality and the fact that this place retains the old world charm of Kolkata's adda culture makes me go back to it, time and again..

Wanted to take hubby for  his kind of breakfast and so headed to sharmas after a morning jog.The kachoris were delicious and went beautifully with the sweet chutney.Deciding it was going to be a 'dont care about the calories'breakfast we also tried the samosas which were okay nothing extraordinary.The tea here is perfect-hot,not overly sweet with a hint of cardamom.Finished off with their delicious gajar ka halwa.Healthfood fanatics,calorie conscious and dieters enter at your own risk;)

So you are in Salt Lake, you want chatpata food and you want to have masala chai...where do you go? This is the solution, people! Especially enjoyable are the chai sessions where there are friends to accompany you while you devoure kachoris or samosas. I have always had fun at Sharmas and since it is very close to my home, I often get Kachoris and Jalebis for my hose for breakfast.  I would suggest this as one of the prime locations for a chai while returning from a brisk morning walk!

Just stay over for a cup of tea or a glass of lassi, and have fun with a bunch of friends just chatting. Whether you have a car or you have just come here after a brisk walk, this place will not disappoint. Especially the kachori, which is a thing of beauty. The taste and smell is amazing, and they serve it with a chutney which is divine. I love their hot, sweet tea, which is just heavenly now that the weather has turned cold.

Chai, samosa, chutney and mirchi! sharma tea is the place to be on a chilly winter evening when you just want to sit and chat! Try their khasta kachori...or the dhokla...their bread pakora is great too!

Though just a 15 min walk from my place, bt nevr visited it earlier...!! Visited on a sunday morning at about 9.30 am and its really difficult to park yr car with the enormous gathering infront...!! The tea s really worth writing about.. But the kachoris are not as awesome as i heard...! Have had better kachoris in many north kolkata outlets! The jalebis are quite ordinary for a 8 rs one...! Overall a pretty ordinary joint and not fit for the hype it enjoys!!

I constantly keep telling people that Salt Lake never disappoints when it comes to places with good food. Sharma's is one of the examples I'd use.
If you love food: food that tastes great and is made from the freshest of ingredients, then snacks at Sharma's is a must for you.
The place opens up as early as 5:30 am....With an array of mouthwatering Indian snacks on offer. 
I'm a huge fan of their club kachouris, and somehow I'm in love with their doodh cola too, but what I find the most appealing is their lassi. On a hot day, nothing quite beats the heat better......and all this at very convenient prices.

This little to hang out lies just across my place in Saltlake , wonder what took me long to write a review. This place serves awesome sandwiches which are always fresh.The drive in system where you get your food in the comfort of your car is really great and pulls in lots of customers. As the name suggests Shama Tea-the perfect adda is indeed the perfect adda, a great place to hang out with your friends and cousins with hot kachoris , samosas,sandwiches,dudh cola , lassi , various chats like puchka dahi chat, singhara chat etc.Mostly it draws so many people because it is cheap and one can hang out there as long as they wish.

Nowadays i find myself going here alot. Whenever i pass this small little shop,i stop by. And strangely so does half of salt lake. So what is the magnetism of this place? Good infrastructure and great decor? NO! You have to eat outside the shop mostly! But then what?
GREAT INGREDIENTS!
They turn normal kachouri's into AWESOME! The smell of desi ghee hits you first and then the crispy food overtakes your senses. And your tummy never gets upset nor do you get acidity. My personal favourite is their samosa! I can never have enough of it. And whenever you go whatever you eat, ask for their CHUTNEY and MIRCHI KA SALAAN! Its the BEST! The little Gulab jamuns are amazing too. However their jalebi's are too sweet for my liking. And every day i have their LASSI which is unadulterated and so pure. Its the blessing of summers. This place is a must for you if you haven't visited it already. You will get used to it...
Additionally you can try their flavoured Lassis and dahi phuchka and dahibada and maybe their nimkis and sandwiches... Me likes them all...

Dood Cola is what I tried here. It is quite unique i must admit.
The snacks are quite good. Since it is around swimming pool area of BF/CF its a nice place to spend an evening with your para friends

The perfect place in Saltlake for adda over a wonderful cup of ilaichi chai and samosa/khachori. This place is functional for almost 18 hours in a day, yet the service is tiptop whenever you choose to drop in.

This place is solely thriving because we Indians hav the tendency to eat the most unhealthy beakfasts. place opens as early as 5.30 am ... and serves piping hot kachoris and samosas. mostly known for its saffron tea and lassi, this place is always packed. the menu is small but the stuff here is fresh and pretty much sells like hot cakes. 

what not many ppl eat here is actually the kalakand.. and i quite like it.

fresh produce.. really pocket friendly and tasty...
