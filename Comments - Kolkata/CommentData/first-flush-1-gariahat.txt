We went to this place today afternoon. After entering, we could feel a homely ambience. Loved that. Ordered fish finger(bhetki) as starters. It took a bit long to arrive like almost half and hour. But it was worth the wait. It tasted amazing. For mains, we ordered chicken pesto pasta(kid's portion, ie,small) and chicken burger which came with French Fries. The burger had enough amount of chicken along with egg and veggies. Amazing it was. The pasta was served with two garlic breads. The pasta too tasted amazing. I gave it 4.5 becuase of the time it takes to deliver food. We had to wait for long for the pasta and burger as well. Though the waiting was worthy as every food tasted superb. The price is  slightly on the higher side but the menu is inclusive of taxes. This place surely calls for more visits.

A great breakfast and snack place. Try out their Spanish omelette and sausage and salami platters. Their fried bacon and omelettes are just spot on! Paired with their wide collection of teas - it's just a tea lover's paradise. In addition, the quintessential English tearoom ambience and a collection of books is sure to brighten up a lazy morning or spice up an evening after work.

Had rib chops and cream of chicken soup today. It was totally worth every single penny. I would go a step further to add that they are masters in perfect cooking of pork compared to all the peers.

A beautiful quaint place, tucked away in a cul-de-sac. Very easy to miss, but once you enter the place you are transported to another world. There is a lovely old world British charm to this place. Wicker furniture, white walls n decor contrast beautifully with splashes of red. 
A wide variety in d menu exists. The attendant is very polite even when we enquired about lunch menu items during breakfast. They will accommodate your vagaries and wishes where ever they can. Food quality is also good. All in all a feel good place which will leave a happy after taste in your mouth long after you leave this place

Located in a quiet alley, this is a value for money cafe. We ordered the following: 
Chicken honey mayo sandwich 
Chicken Stroganoff
Chicken cordon bleu
The sandwich wasn't great but the remaining two dishes were amazing! The fizzy iced tea also tasted good. 
Service was slow but staff was courteous. Overall an ideal place to spend time with friends for a good conversation over good food.

Located in a small lane just beside the Axis Bank at Golpark More. While going towards gariahat more taking the footpath of Anandamela, enter the first lane on the right immediately after crossing Ganguram and the shop will be on your left.

We got to know about while we were coming out of the Lake after morning workout on a chilly winter morning and someone was distributing pamphlets. We immediately decided to give a visit as the menu appeared quite attracting.

Place itself is quite spacious and big, however it was morning time and they were just opening so it was completely empty. We ordered the all meaty platter however got to know that there is no bacon and they replaced with pork sausage. The platter contains garlic bread, juice, cheese omelette with chicken, chicken sausage, pork sausage, juice, tea/coffee. Food was served hot and delicious. May be not something exceptional but yes keeping in mind the portion and the price it’s quite good.

Coming to the tea it was just wow. Freshly brewed darjeeling tea and it was having that smell and flavour of darjeeling tea. I will definitely pay a visit again during the breakfast time.

The cafe First Flush is situated in a bylane of golpark. It is actually located in the back side of Axis bank of golpark. It is near Aminia, khose khosa and Momo_I_Am.
The decor is nice and simple. I love the spaciousness. There is a bookshelf too.You can sit for hours with a book of your choice. 
Staffs are very much courteous and well mannered.

Coming to Food:
We ordered
*Fish Finger- One of the finest snack and the best dish i had in First Flush. I never had such a yummy fish finger. It truely stole my heart.

*Chicken cheese bombs- It is good in taste. If you are a cheese lover, then this one is a must try. 

*American club sandwich- One of the best sandwiches i had taste. Perfectly balanced and full of stuffings. It is little bit big with three layer. One must face problem while biting.But it is a yummy sandwich no doubt.

*chicken stroganoff- It is served with mixed veges, rice, mushroom and shreded chicken. It is too cheesy. I myself is not so fond of cheese that's y this dish is not so touchy for me. But cheese lover can try this out. Good in taste.
*Must try dishes - American club sandwich, Fish finger, chicken cheese bombs 
We missed out tea. But First flush ia a best tea cafe. 

Will try to visit again.

This place is an absolute package, complete with its wonderful decor,  the essence of a tea-soaked atmosphere complete with its nature-lorn ,picturesque interior.  

They inform you about how the prep time is long enough so that everything is freshly made.  And I think they live up to that absolutely,  the food on the plate says a lot about it.  

We were so spoilt for choice that we thought we ordered more than we can have,  that is until the food started coming in and we were left asking for more.  

We started with their Bacon Wrapped Pork sausages,  coupled with a cheese sauce that was to die for. 
Next up Was the Basil Chicken Skewers. Came with the perfect seasoning and dip.  Couldn't have asked for a better presentation.  
We ordered their speciality, Chilli Lamb,  the wonderfully flavorful and spicy,  much true to its name. 
The Spaghetti Carbonara is the best I've had in a while.  If you're a pasta person then this is all you'll need.  
The lasagna was a stunning end to our wonderful lunch,  complete with its layers and the ample butter soaked garlic bread.  Perfectly minced meat and definitely the highlight of the day.  

You'll seldom come across a place serving meals touched with as much satisfaction as this was.  If you're looking for a great time,  do drop by. They're worth the price and the wait.  
Make sure you click enough pictures to remember!

If you're a tea person, this is the place for you! 
We had an array of amazing dishes. They justify the preparation time with their sheer brilliance of presentation and taste. 

We took the Basil chicken skewers which came with this wonderful sauce. The chicken was very juicy.

Next was the bacon wrapped pork sausages wilhich came with a seasoned cheese sauce. Nothing could've better. 

The chicken baked lasagna was an absolute stunner. 

The chilli lamb,true to its name, spicy and so wonderfully juicy. 

The Spaghetti Carbonara was the winner for me. Served with two generously buttered garlic breads as sides, it had he perfect blend of spices and cheese sauce. 

The brownie was okay. Could've been served hot. 

All over, it was a wonderful afternoon. Can't wait to come back here. Do pay a visit if you're in the locality. It's absolutely worth the time and your money.

Located in a place extremely difficult to find, the place is just amazing.
First the directions. Get down at the Golpark near mouchak and take the road leading towards Aminia. Cross Aminia and ten just before you reach the Arambagh foodmart, there is a secluded lane towards your left. Go in and almost at the junction of the first left again is First Flush. It is very easy to miss, but no one would want to give it a miss.

Ever since our first visit, it has become a very favourite hangout spot for me.

Coming to the food, everything I have had till now have been amazing. Starting right from Cheese Omlette, to chicken Cheese balls, bacon cheese balls, fish finger, crispy chilli baby corn, crispy sesame chicken, nothing has been disappointing. The toasts with the omlette are the right amount of crunchy, the cheese in the balls is just right. It is very well worth it.

Coming to the highlight of the place, TEA.

The first flush and second flush teas of Makaibari, Giddapahar and Thurbo Autumn have been extremely well brewed whenever I have had them. The flavour comes out great and is neither too strong nor too light. And coming from someone who just adores tea and is from the areas of Darjeeling Tea, you can rest assured, you cannot get this quality in any other place so easily.

This is someplace I would go again and again to satiate my taste buds.

First flush is a quaint cafe located in the bylanes of Golpark. I was waiting for quite long for my friends so wanted to sit and have something to drink so went in.  The ambience was nicely decorated and feel good vibe is present. Ordered an orange mojito and chicken cheese bombs. The food took its own time to arrive. The bomb was great in taste and came in sticks. I felt the presentation could have been better as the servicing dish was white, the picture was not the best. Also a spicy dip was needed with this dish but the staff were helpful to give me some tabasco sauce. But the dish was mindblowing..loved every bit of it. The orange mojito was very refreshing and a perfect thirst quencher. Pricing is inclusive of taxes. Service is warm and friendly. Might order their tea on my next visit.

First Flush, nestled in a quiet by lane off Gol Park, is  a delightful place.  The decor is simple and tasteful. As the name suggests , it is a tea parlour,  which offers an array of exotic tea served to perfection. The ambience is so pleasant and the staff so courteous and helpful that I'm sure the first visit will steal your heart . The food is simply amazing.  They serve only continental and Chinese cuisine. We opted for  the continental fare . The Cream of Chicken Mushroom Soup was subtly flavoured , piping hot and creamy. Chicken Krickers are large slices of boneless chicken, with a crispy coating served with bbq sauce. The chicken roast was juicy and soft and was served with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. The grilled fish in lemon butter sauce served with grilled veggies , mashed potatoes and herbed rice was delightful. The fish n chips was awesome. In short , it was a lovely experience.  Give it a try!

“I wish I had your company over a cup of tea”
Believe it or not, the chances of me turning down these words is almost negligible. When it comes to Tea, no one knows it better than us Bengalis. Call it our love for adda over a cup of chai or the presence of the Queen of Hills, Darjeeling in our very state. Either ways, there is nothing that a perfect cup of tea does not set right. My love for Tea blosommed over my annual trips to Darjeeling. The hours spent in the tea boutiques taking in the aroma have always worked like magic. If there was something I missed more that the cloud laden Himalayas, were the tea boutiques.

As if as an answer to my tea-woes, my very own city has come up with something strikingly similar. First Flush, on a quaint lane in Golpark is one of it’s unique kind of Tea Boutiques. As I stepped inside, I was transported into Colonial Darjeeling. Done up with generous doses of old world charm, this place is heaven for all tea lovers. Being the tea fanatic that I am, the first thing I noticed was a jar of Giddapahar tea. The first time I had Giddapahar tea was in Darjeeling  (Giddapahar being a te garden there) and I had lost all hope of finding it in Kolkata. First Flush made my dreams come true and my winter evening was made with a perfect brew of the Second Flush Tea. I usually prefer the second flush over the first, the former being slightly stronger.

When it comes to Tea, it is essential that the brewing time is perfect apart from the temperature of the water. First Flush serves their tea with a sand timer which ensures that you enjoy a cup of perfectly brewed tea. All Bengalis would agree, “Cha” is never complete without the “Ta”. Keeping this in mind, they also serve a wide variety of food to accompany the tea. Rather, some of them would also qualify as full course meals. The signature dishes include everything from Lamb, Chicken, Fish and Pork. I tried the Neapolitan Baked Chicken Lasagne with Garlic Bread, Pork Chops with Sautéed Vegetables and Garlic bread and Grilled Chicken. The portions are extremely generous and each work as a meal on its whole. They serve a wide variety of desserts as well.

The ambience is homely with a little bookshelf. I can totally sit there for hours, curled up with a book, savouring my cup of Darjeeling tea. First Flush is indeed my little piece of Darjeeling and I am so glad it have the best of all worlds in my city.

My maiden visit at First Flush filled my heart with immense joy as this joint serves exquisite varieties of tea complemented with praiseworthy quality of sandwiches. Right from the cool ambience comparable to the tea cafes of Darjeeling , to the finishing service , everything was spick and span.

Coming to their specialty I can vouch that this tea cafe serves one of the finest varieties of tea in the town. Being an aficionado of tea I was totally bowled out by the fine tea liquor and smooth flavor of the Giddapahar First Flush. The smoked tea was also fabulous. Shifting to the food , the American Club Sandwich with lot of stuffings was yummy along with the honey Mayo sandwich. The Nutella Sandwich was average though.
With such a lucrative varieties of delicacies on offer this joint has seriously allured me to plan couple of my future appointments here! Hope to get back soon...

Thanks to a suggestion in an FB group, I got to know about this place last week n decided to pay it a visit over the weekend.

It is located within 100 meters of Golpark Mouchak (which is a popular landmark and is a busy area 24*7) yet in one of the quietest streets and is tough to find.

The moment you actually enter, you start getting the vibes of an European cafe with its wooden chairs and cosy ambience. The place is known for its variety and quality of brewed tea and continental cuisines. It does live up to the hype. The bacon wrapped cheese balls melt in your mouth in a moment of pure gastronomic delight and the succulent pork chops are by far the best I have had in Kolkata and probably India (abroad the meat quality is better so not really comparable)!

And surprisingly, all these mouth watering stuff do not pinch a big hole in your pocket.

To summarise, this may not be the place where you want to go on a romantic date or a special occasion, but this is the place where you want to go with your friends, with your family or with your partner to relax and have great conversations and moments to cherish. 

Will be back soon!

They serve the best tea and American club sandwich in town. Try their Giddapahar First Flush and Makaibari Second Flush. Even a tea sceptic like me keep going back to First Flush to take a few more sips. The chicken lollipops that you get there are soft, juicy and succulent with just the right amount of sauce and other toppings. Also try their bacon wrapped pork sausage. The combination of bacon with smoked sausages is mouthwatering. Their food presentation is also noteworthy. The staffs are very friendly and always on toes. The cafe is quite spacious and the interiors exude a warm feeling. It surely stands out amongst its conspecifics. A must visit if you haven't already. :)

Tricky to locate, this is one of the best joints in Golpark. We ordered the Fish Fry and Darjeeling tea. The Fish Fry was great and so was the dip that was severd alongside. The tea was served in a quaint little pot along with an hourglass to calculate the brew time. The place is spacious and not clumsy at all. The staff, very polite. Service is prompt.

An elegantly named Cafe and seriously a hidden gem in many respects, I have visited this place twice and loved each of my visits.
Back then, Nearbuy had open vouchers and we feasted very well here.
*Bacon Cheese Bombs* Gooey cheese? Check. Crispy Bacon? Check. Lip smacking dip? Check.
*Fish Fingers* the ultimate Calcutta snack was served in a modest manner with the not so modest mustard sauce and it stole my heart.
*American Club Sandwich* three words; Filling, juicy, palatable.
*Neapolitan Baked Lasagna* a mini Lasagna to fulfil your sinful cravings for cheese and meat, we were impressed.
*Cold Coffee* this was average.
Their main course items like Roast Chicken, Peri peri chicken, etc. are highly priced but taste average.
The decor is soothing and the place has a cultured vibe. Service is more than fine.

The decor is nice and simple. I love the spaciousness. 
Staffs are very much courteous but few small things like refilling water time to time should be improved.

Coming to food.

Cheesy soldiers: if you are a cheese lover, this is a must try!! 
American Club sandwich: one of the best sandwiches I have tasted . Perfectly balanced!
Chicken Burger: compared to other items, it was just ok. 
Spaghetti with meatballs: the sauce was perfect, but the meatballs were very much stiff, which I didn't like. 

Will surely visit again!

A little hard to find as not on the busy road but its location makes it quite segregated from the hustle. Having a silent atmosphere with a retrofitting nostalgic environment it is perfect for small groups. We had chocolate brownie and a cold coffee (some chocolate flavoured) but cannot meet the perfect expectations. Overall a nice place for hanging out or to get refreshed with your close ones 😊

This place has a very soothing ambience. The food is pretty good in taste as well as quantity. I forgot to take pictures of all the things I had 😅 
The staff were very helpful, the service was excellent. Not too expensive for students. The best part is you're allowed to sit for quite some time ifyou want to without them bugging you as soon as you finish eating. 
100% recommended :D

It was my second visit to this place, although sometime ago it was. The first time I went there, we were in a rush and so we couldn't fully appreciate the ambiance which is the primary attraction here. This place is tucked in the lanes right between the walk from Gariahat to Golpark. It's a bit tricky to find but once you do, you'll thank yourself for doing so. This place aims at presenting a canvas for quiet addas.

I, personally, don't have hot beverages outside my house, so this bit is a dear friend's judgement. According to her, the tea variants are nice enough to fuel a long session of gossip and her favorite was Makaibari variant. I had the Bacon Cheese Bombs here and yes, gooey cheese oozes out of these 'bombs'. However, being an avid fan of crisped up bacon, it did feel like the fats weren't totally done justice to. Rest assured, it didn't hinder the taste of the dish. The plate, however, did feel a bit empty! Presentation matters for such appetizers and it should have been kept in mind that while negative space(it wasn't quite negative space...it was empty space to be exact) is an artistic touch in gourmet cuisines, it doesn't bode that well for such dishes which disappear rather quickly.

The decor is soothing and the seating arrangements are varied, with sofas as well as only chairs encircling a table. The place is neat and feels welcoming. People willing to spend a bit of time with a bit of food or beverage in this vicinity must try this hidden 'well-not-gem-but-obviously-something'.

This is one of my newest discovery in Gariahat. Though located very much inside a lane. Simple yet elegant decor. I must say they have beautiful collection of photos of tribal art. I happened to attend a live performance there, which happened to be awesome. They served some nicest tea varieties. We ordered pasta and it was nice taste. Service is pretty fast. Crowd was nice and cultured. Over all loved the ambience and food.

The good things about this place are the old world charm, the calm ambience and their tea.. The food is extremely bad. May be the appetizers would have been a better choice. But the main course meal was horrible. The coating of the fish and chips were too thick and oily.. Even I think they dint use betki for the grilled fish preparation.

Visited this newly opened cafe today evening. It is within a small lane, near golpark. The decor and ambience are very nice. Quite a cosy place.
We order lemon iced tea,  gidda pahar second flush tea, fish finger and American club sandwich.
The second flush tea and the fish finger were quite good. The fish finger was infact very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. So plus points on that :)
The iced tea however was nothing great. Infact since they gave slices of lemon, with the skin intact, it turned a little bitter.
And the club sandwich lacked the "spicy" balance which was required for the sweet onion sauce that they used. It was so sweet that the bacon and chicken lost their individual tastes. So that was a little disappointing!
However, the overall experience was good!

I am a regular guest at this place, which is one of my favourite cafés in whole Kolkata. 
The tea is fantastic. I tried almost all types of tea they serve here, my favourite ines being the flame tea and the white tea. The service is excellent: the staff is always very kind and brings you the tea on a little tray, letting it steep for the right amount of time. Some types of tea are accompanied by two cookies on the house. I also tried a homemade ice tea which was very good.
The place has a relaxing and soothing atmosphere, with slow music played very softly, or no music at all. There is a nice couch and the other seats and tables are made of wood. The only thing which doesn't belong there is the TV, whose volume is always off, but which just doesn't fit the graceful atmosphere of the place. Sometimes members of the staff stand in front of the TV watching a game, which, in my opinion, is not very professional. 
Apart from this small detail, I find everything else to be perfect and I am looking forward to my next free afternoon at First Flush.

The place had been in my wish list since long and one fine evening I stepped inside. Its a lovely medium sized cafeteria with heartwarming decor and cane furniture. The staff is very friendly and always ready to help with a smile.
The menu is extremely satisfying and so is the food. I had ordered cold coffee with ice cream and chicken ham sandwich, both of them stood high well beyond my expectations. The price is also very much reasonable and wouldn't burn a hole in the pocket. Its a recommended place for all right from college students to the ripe aged people.

I visited this place after reading a lot of good reviews, only to end up a bit dissapointed. 

I had ordered the basic Second Flush tea and a cappuchino - both of which were quite good. Along with it we ordered Spanish Omlette which we found to be dissapointing. Charged at 120/- which I think is a pretty good price for an omlette, the dish lacked basic finesse. The capsicum pieces where quite big, the the tomato and corn and cheese just looked like thay had been thrown on top at the last minute before putting in a micro. 

Otherwise the place is a nice one, quaint and cosy.

Aptly captioned "love in a bylane", we had a quite a hard time to find this hidden gem, nestled in a bylane near golpark. As suggested by the person taking our order, we tried their American club sandwich. It was awesome. We also liked the concept of leaving the tea with a sand clock for brewing it when we ordered Giddapahar First Flush. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the place.

One of my earliest childhood memories is of taking a tram from Belgachia with my mother, getting down at Shyambazar, walking to Fariapukur to the famous Orphan Tea shop and standing in a queue holding her hand while she bought the household’s monthly supply of tea. This was in the 80s and Orphan Tea was considered to be one of the best shops in the city. It was stacked with chests containing various varieties of loose tea – Darjeeling, Assam. There were little steel drums on the front counter, with ‘Cha’, written in both Bengali and English. Orphan Tea lost its glory long back and with the advent of ‘cha bars’ and cafes, so have many of these standalone tea shops in the city. Now, we no longer stand in a queues to get our caffeine fix. All we have to do is walk into a cafe and order what we want. One such cafe or ‘tea boutique’ as it is called where you get a very good variety of tea is First Flush, located near Golpark.
                                          ...

After a tiring day of shopping in Gariahat, Zomato suggested this place as a nearby. The location is a bit tricky as Google Maps has no road sign for this by lane. Nevertheless, we saw some sticking bills around directing towards this cafe.

This tea boutique has a spacious indoor, whitewash walls, big windowpanes, comfortable sofas and cane furnishing. Everything reminded me the times I visited some of the tea gardens’ guest houses and bunglows in North Bengal.

It was a hot and humid day so we did not opt for the tea menu which actually looked quite fascinating. But the rest of the menu did not seem interesting enough. We ordered two coolers and one Bacon Cheese Bomb which was to die for.

Which Bengali wouldn’t like a good cup of tea? I would like to visit again just for that.

Located in a narrow alley, just beside Golpark, it happens to be the perfect place for recluses like me. First Flush, with its aesthetic decor, relaxing seating arrangement and delicious food resembles a nicely done cosy dining hall in a tourist bungalow! The ambience is so soothing with retro lights, books stocked up at the corner, rare artefacts judiciously displayed and above all a nicely done flooring. We were just bowled over with the spanish omelette, served with love and passion. The amazing grilled fish followed suit. It is perhaps the best I have had in recent times in the city of joy. You also get the best of tea range in this cozy culinary destination. So spend hours listening to goods music, flipping through your literary love and pampering 'me' time.

The location of the cafe might be difficult to find as it is in a narrow lane. The interior is beautiful and I love the combination of the red door that opens into the white walled cafe. The plus points are their ambience and staff behavior.
The food is average to me. The coffee is too light for my taste. Even though I mention it to be stronger, they fail to make it. The Fish finger is good but the Crispy chicken lollipops served with hot sauce are not something that I liked. The sauce was too tangy and I had to wipe as much as I could on the dish before taking every bite. 
It would be better to have comfortable leg space between the chairs and the table.

We had Chicken cheese bomb as starter with virgin mojito and cappucino. Being a lover of continental food we also ordered chicken stroganoff served with herbs mixed rice and roast chicken served with veggies and mashed potatoes. The dishes were good and the staffs are really courteous. Though the food is not extraordinary but an evening can be jolly well spent in this cafe.

The explorer in me was eyeing on this cafe for quite sometime and finally after a busy shopping day we landed up here . Situated between the Koshe kosha(Golpark ) and Arambagh it  has nice homely and having a kind of old world feel to it. Very simple and neat decor , with the flavour of the hills at every corner. It is advised to be there with some time in hand so that one can relax and enjoy the food and tea. Coming to the menu, having a home at the foot of the hills, the names of familiar tea gardens have an instant connection. The menu is having the right mixture of cafe type food and drinks. Tea was served with utmost care and precision , and the food was good both in presentation and in taste. Its a nice place to spend some alone time or to catch up with friends. Overall one would like to comeback to such an atmosphere again.

Another charming place where you can gossip with your buddies over a cup of first flush or second flush Darjeeling tea. Before visit here, I am not clear with Flush.I am little bit confused between first flush and second flush. They told me the difference of first and second flush. As I every time preferred strong flavor so I take Makaibari 2nd flush tea. Believe me here you can find various flavored Darjeeling tea. Next the ambience, it's interior looks like a bungalow of tea estate. Same type of sofa set and chair table arranged here. We also took fish fry and virgin mojito. Loved the place.

The first thing that caught my eyes at First Flush is their exquisitely unique decor. Coming to their dishes, each one of them were a perfect 10, both in their taste as well as presentation. However, their desserts were the ones which were the stars among all the other dishes. A blend of perfect texture and taste, they were simply mouthwatering.

Quaint place in Golpark - Gariahaat area. The bylane is too narrow to discover this place. A house ground floor converted into a restaurant. Interesting place. Seating can be made more cosy as the inner dining room looks like a banquet set up. Innumerable books make it add to the place's appeal. Waitstaff is good. Food quality, quantity and taste is also nice. A lot of tea on the menu. Music can be made more appealing and interesting. Parking could be an issue. Wifi seemed not available. Overall a nice place.

Beautifully decorated, this joint offers you some delicious dishes. 
I went their with my friend on a friday evening and to our surprise the whole place was empty. We stayed their for half an hour but still no one came. 
Anyways we ordered,
Green Apple Mojito and Green Goddess. The later was a mix of apple and mango juice and was too sweet. The mojito was very refreshing.
Basil Chicken Skewers. This dish was yuumm.
American Club Sandwich. It was also tasty.
This place is very reasonable. I would love to go back there for trying their other dishes.

 The ambience is quite soothing. The place is spacious too, which gives an added advantage for enjoying one's company with friends. 
The food is also good, the reason why this place falls into one's bucket list. The price and the quality, quantity goes hand in hand. The service is also impressing. 
The recommended dishes (as per what we ordered)
Green apple mojito (mocktails), 
Hot chocolate (not too satisfactory)
Basil chicken skewers (starter),
Peri peri chicken (a bit spicy) amongst the chef's choice dishes.

There are very few cafes in Kolkata where they give as much priority to rare varieties of tea as they give to varieties of coffee. This cafe is one of them. As my partner is a Darjeeling tea fanatic the name of this cafe drew my attention. The place is within a hidden lane of Golpark and once you are able to find it you will surely know it was worth the effort. The decoration of the room is based on the theme: tea. There are photographes, varieties of cups, teapots and many more. We ordered Jangpana tea(first flush) which was served in a teapot along with an hourglass to measure the time to brew tea perfectly. Then we ordered crispy chicken lollipop which took time but was very delicious and perfectly marinated. As per recommendation we took American club sandwich (2 pieces) and Chicken cheese bombs. American club sandwich was a 3-tier sandwich with egg poach, chicken,ham and vegetables and served with French fries. It is of huge quantity and it was a delight to our eyes as well as lip smacking tasty. Chicken cheese bombs were perfect end to this wonderful experience and it was served with cream cheese. It was a heavenly experience for a cheese lover. We had a bill of 1200 for two people. At first I thought the price of tea was exorbitant but the delight in my partner's eyes after tasting it changed my mind. :)

Really nice place. Tucked away in a lane in the Gariahat area, it's worth searching for it for ten minutes on the scooter. The interior is quite spacious, and the decoration looks really detailed. People have worked really hard to make it an attractive place. Food and service both are exceptional. If you love tea, do visit this place. It's amazing to have tea and chat for hours here. Also I think the location is actually a plus, because people who'll make the effort to find it out will value the place, than make it a crowded, loud place full of selfies and whatnot. 

Will be definitely visiting again.

Situated in a quiet bylane of golpark is this adorable cafe..
After keeping it in my bucketlist for quite some time, thought of finally visiting this cafe.

DECOR: The entrance of this cafe is beautifully adorned with lights and plants and the interior is quite good.
There is also a boutique having a beautiful collection of junk jewellery..The walls of this cafe is beautifully decorated with feather paintings and pictures of the hill slopes of darjeeling. There is also a good collection of travel books which will give u good company if u r visiting this cafe all by urself. They also sell cutleries and exotic tea varieties..

FOOD: Now coming to the main component which is the food. Honestly we had very high hopes with the food.
We ordered A CAPPUCCINO, MANGO MILK SHAKE AND A PLATE OF FISH FINGER.
The cappuccino was good, but nothing extraordinary.
Well, the mango milk shake was the real disappointment. As this is the season of mangoes and the price of the drink being on the higher side, we thought them to use fresh mangos in the drink but instead they used syrup in it.
The shake was bland, tasting mainly of milk and having a faint smell and taste of mango which was a let down.
The fish finger came with chopped salad and tartar sauce. Really loved the way they presented the dish.
The fish fingers were crunchy on the outside with soft, flaky fish inside but again the tartar sauce was not sufficient for the six pieces..
Nevertheless, it was tasty and was okay as per the price.
The service was quick and yay for free wifi!
Including VAT and SERVICE TAX, the pocket pinch for two was around 480 bucks.
Nevertheless, it was a good experience, but the beverages could have been better.
I would recommend this cafe as it is a good place to indulge in some addas and do check out their junk jewelleries.

If you want to cherish your test buds with some mouth-watering continental food, and also wants to enjoy different flavors of Tea, you should visit the first flush.  The entrance is a lovely little gate nestled with fairy lights (in the evening time). However, the inside decor is really nice, and it's spacious as well. Decoration and Ambience deserve 5/5 rating. Although I don't understand anything about the boutique, still I must say that the small boutique collection in the corner gives the interior decor an extra dimension. Seating arrangements are very comfortable. The look and feel of the place give you the perfect ambiance for a tea party!
 In addition, a small library is also there to make your waiting more enjoyable. A couple of Led Televisions are also there. 
All the signature dishes, as well as other dishes, are simply too good, and pocket-friendly, Being a foodie, I visited many continental restaurants (few big names of Calcutta are also there). However, I never come across some restaurant like the first flush that gives you the privilege of testing continental food without treating your solvency.

Planned to catch up with a close friend this weekend and decided to tick this place off the bucket list. First flush, located at Golpark behind Aminia according to map but my friend took me there via a shortcut so you better follow the map when locating this cafe since it is situated in a narrow lane, hence easy to miss it. 
Ambience deserves a 5/5. Very comfortable seating arrangement, elegant interiors with antique and vintage crockeries at display. Well air conditioned. Also, live sports screening. 
We ordered a fresh garden sandwich, a cheese corn sandwich, an espresso single shot and a cappuccino. 
The sandwiches were well made, fresh and delectable.  
However I was disappointed with the beverages. Both the espresso and cappuccino were not up to the mark. 
The staff is courteous. Service was quick. 
All in all, a nice place to catch up over a cup of coffee. Prices are not very exorbitant . Prices are not inclusive of taxes though.

The ambience is really nice and simple. The service is very prompt. The green apple mojito is nice. The ginger fizzy land is so so. The chicken cheese bombs are really good. The grilled chicken sandwich is so so.

If you love good quality Darjeeling tea, this is the place to go. Tucked away in an unassuming bylane, first flush is really a treasure. It is the quintessential cosy "ghorowa" place for a quiet adda wih good tea and tasty finger food. The decor is simple, it makes you feel at home. It is not restaurant type at all, rather like a huge and comfortable drawing room. They use little trolleys to bring you your tea, just like one would do if they were entertaining guests at home.
As for food, do try their bacon cheese bombs. Cheesy and wrapped in crispy fried bacon, accompanied with a mild dip to balance the saltiness of the bacon... It is just perfect!
In the time of new age fancy restaurants and cafes, first flush has that typical old Calcutta charm that is so rare to find these days.

This place is difficult to find, which is probably the only major snag for them. It gives you a feel of cozy ness the moment you enter and you are definite to like it. This place provided for a perfect meet-up with an old friend. We had ordered Avongrove euphoria and a speciality white tea of there's. The tea was not very appreciable. The Avongrove euphoria tasted like normal green tea and there special white tea gives a tangy taste to the mouth the moment you sip it. The food on the other hand was quite toothsome. We had ordered the Bacon Wrapped Prawn from the new arrival menu and the pork chops with sautéed veggies which is their speciality again. Both tasted decently delicious. 
So yes, I would recommend this place incase your are looking for a cozy cafe for a meet up with an old friend and you a willing to spend a decent amount.

This place is tough to find. Nestled at the end of a narrow alleyway in Golpark, we actually had to call the restaurant to locate the place. The entrance is a lovely little gate nestled with fairy lights (if you are visiting in the evening), give you no idea that the interiors are as spacious as they are. The ambience is nice and relaxed with a small boutique in a corner with a free artsy items on display. There are a couple of low armchairs and seating area as well as some regular glass tables for seating. The look and feel of the place gives you the idea that it is quite right for a tea party - something which the name aspires to drive!
They offer a number of Darjeeling teas, based on the tea garden from which they are sourced, along with food and other beverages. We ordered the Gidda Pahar First flush. One helping gives you two cups of tea which the waiter allowed us to split between two since we weren't quite sure whether we would like it or not. We also ordered a Mango smoothie and Ham & Cheese sandwiches.  The smoothie was excellent, and the sandwiches were decent. The tea was served with a sand timer, which counted the brewing time. The tea was nice and fragrant and a good choice as well. We quickly ordered a second pot.
Overall, this place is really nice for an evening out with your girl gang, your better half or your parents. It might not be the best option if you want to hang out with a noisy bunch of friends though.
I would definitely go back to try some more items from the food menu, and another pot of tea!

Located in one of the lanes of Goalpark, this tea boutique was in my wishlist from a very long time.Ambiance is good, they have ample sitting arrangements, staffs are courteous and my god!! Their food will definitely leave an impact on your tastebuds.
Comming to the food we ordered
1.Green goddess, mango milkshake and cold coffee with ice cream-Mango milkshake and cold coffee are one of its wanders, on the other hand you can avoid that green goddess.
2.Cheese corn spring rolls-I m generally not a veg lover.. But this dish has totally changed my concept. perfect crispiness of the roll and perfect blend of cheese and corn is superawesome!!

Total bill came around 652 including taxes.. So pretty ok.

A must try place 😊

Situated at golpark just beside the bylane of aminia and rallies this cafe has quite a posh ambience but at the same time a homely feel. The name indicates the first pluck leaves of the tea and that is why the place is famous for good tea also. We ordered oreo blast blue lagoon and lasagne. At first we found the price of lasagne a bit too high but when the order arrived we were thrilled to see the quantity they had given along with the beautiful decoration. The shakes were equally nice. Only one disappointment I faced that it was not tax free. Otherwise a good place to hang out

First Flush, located near the Golpark auto stand had been on my mind for quite sometime. It was its 4.3 rating on Zomato that took me there. I went for lunch with a friend and we were surprised to find ourselves to be the only ones there.The decor and ambience of the place will transport you to an old school cafe in Darjeeling. So we ordered for a "Fresh Lime Soda" and "Sparkling Cranberry with Mango Punch" (both were average).. For starters we ordered for "Bacon Cheese Bombs, served with cheese dip" (it was really good and is a treat for all cheese lovers. The combination of bacon with a burst of cheese will explode your taste buds.. but somehow i personally feel they should have served it with a different kind of dip as it was too cheesy). Then we ordered for "Basil Chicken Skewers, served with hot Marinara" (it was very different from most chicken skewers I have tasted before.. freshly grilled and served with coleslaw salad and a yummy dip).. For main course we ordered for "American Fish and Chips with beer batter", served with lemon butter sauce and French fries ( This was my personal favourite.. the fish was fresh And the coating was crunchy and  the fries were crisp.. the lemon butter sauce was to die for.. its a must have!). To sum it up, it was a good experience. Hoping to visit First Flush again and try out other dishes they have to offer!

axis bank গোলপার্কের পাশের ছোট্ট গলিটা ধরে ঢুকে পড়ুন , এবং চোখ কান বুঁজে চলতে থাকুন। বাঁদিকে ঘুরেই এট্টুখানি গিয়েই লাল রঙের দরজা , খুলে ঢুকে পড়ুন- দক্ষিণ কলকাতার একফালি দার্জিলিং এ ……

প্রথমে ঢুকেই দেখবেন একফালি বুটিক , বেশ সুন্দর আর শৌখিন সব জামাকাপড়, প্রসাধনের জিনিস। ভেতরে ঢুকে যান- বসে পড়ুন একটা চেয়ার টেনে আর ভালো করে সময় নিয়ে মেনুকার্ড তাকে দেখুন।  দার্জিলিং চায়েরই দেখবেন বহুরকম option , কারোর সাহায্য নিতে ঘাবড়াবেন না – আমি সাজেস্ট করবো হালকা গন্ধের জন্য ওনাদের first flush টা নিতে – গিদ্দাপাহাড় ফার্স্ট ফ্লাশ।  মানে আমার মতন চা-কানা হলেও মন্দ লাগবে না।  চা টা এসে গেলে সময় কাটাতে পারেন সঙ্গের বালিঘড়ি টাকে নিয়ে।  ৩ মিনিট লাগবে।  হালকা এক চুমুক দিন – মন্দ লাগবে না – এটুকু পাক্কা। 

তা এবার বঙ্গসন্তান যখন, চায়ের সঙ্গে টা না হলে ঠিক জমে না।  তা এখানে সে ব্যবস্থাও মন্দ নয়।  এখানে নতুনআমদানি হয়েছে ব্রেকফাস্ট প্লেটারের।  সোজা কথায় একগাদা মাংস (এনারা আবার সসেজ টা আনান কোনো এক বাড়ির থেকে, ফলে স্বাদে পুরো আলাদা) সঙ্গে ডিম্, টোস্ট  , ফলের রস – সোজা কথায় এক বিশাল আয়োজন।  যথারীতি টোস্ট এ ব্রাউন এবং সাদা , দুধরনেরই অপশন আছে।  লড়ে যান, মন্দ তো লাগবেই না – একজনের পক্ষে একটি শেষ করা একটু চাপের।  আলাদা করে আমার বন্ধু নিয়েছিল চীজ অমলেট (সঙ্গে টোস্ট বিনা পয়সায়) – সেটা তো কখনোই খারাপ হয় না।  ভেজ platter ও একবার নিতে দেখেছিলাম আমার এক বঁধুকে – আমার ঠিক জমেনি, তবে তার দিব্বি লেগেছিলো।  সেদিন আমি শুধু এক প্লেট পর্ক সসেজ এর ওপরেই ক্ষান্ত দিয়েছিলাম।

তা, এই বস্তূ টি এনারা সারা দিনই বানান- ফলে চাপ নেওয়ার কোনো কারণ নেই।  মন্দ লাগবে না- অন্তত আমার তো লাগে নি।  আর সঙ্গে দার্জিলিং চা (I also love their silver needle variety – its something different), খারাপ তো যেতেই পারে না। এটির সঙ্গে আবার ফিশ ফিঙ্গার টাও বেশ জমে- তবে সে আলাদা গল্প …..

First, there's an error in the Zomato listing. Seating IS available, very much so! At least now. And, for information, First Flush caters to breakfast, lunch, tea, and early-ish dinners.

First Flush is hidden in a narrow decrepit lane when you enter the lane next to Aminia's  at Golpark (i.e. the lane previous to the auto-stand road from the Mouchak end). Once you enter, two things may overwhelm you: the fantastic air-conditioning which works (sadly lacking in many other reputed joints), and the quaint Darjeeling-café-ish decor.

I was tired after my swim, and just thought to drop in at a new place for a coffee and sandwiches with my dada for a quick bite. The menu overwhelmed us, and I tried their chicken omelette with chicken sausages, bacon, and garlic bread, and my dada ordered their bacon-wrapped pork sausages (have uploaded the pics), and coffees (cappuccino and mocha).

They were wonderfully served. I simply LOVED the omelette (it was really superb!), and my dada the bacon-wrapped sausages. Both were excellent, on the eyes as well as on the tongue. The coffees could (and should) definitely be better.

But I will definitely be back for more, and would try their teas (which I prefer) and from among their eclectic menu selections. They have a lot of my favourites, slurp!

Pics (L-R):
• Chicken omelette with spicy chicken sausages, bacon, garlic bread
• Bacon-wrapped spicy pork sausages [the bacon was delicious]

[Addendum: Sometimes, on a weekend, you may catch an up-and-coming live band, a music release, or possibly an open-mic session here. So if you want to jive alone or with friends, here's the place to really be. And if you want to "really enjoy" the food (as one of the popular soft-drink ad shows!), better check before landing. Not everyone may appreciate the loudness, the crowdiness, or the consequent tardiness in service.]

[Addendum-2: Have re-visited. Still believe that they serve the BEST bacon at Kolkata, and their omelettes are just heavenly!]

[Question: If any Foodie knows of any other place in Kolkata serving better, softer, or fresher bacon rashers, please leave a comment. Thanks.]

Fabulous collection of tea from various gardens particularly the Glenburn Moonshine is worthy of praise. Recommendation of tea and food by Anirban was extremely great. Food, particularly Pasta is very well made and highly delectable. Great place for satiating hungry stomach. Thumbs up !!!

Went for a Sunday brunch ordered a Chicken Jumbo sandwich , Pork Sausage, Bacon, Ham Salami & fried egg.

What works : The quality of meat is good, the preparation and presentation is nice, though we are yet to try other items on the menu. They are trying to create a cozy ambience , or an experience of not just the cuisine but a little of music and lyrics if you will.

It works to a great extent, the house turned into a restaurant with couches and carpets lend an informal "adda" type setting, and the décor is soft and elegant with light pastels and a personal photograph collection. The service is polite and the staff seem friendly, wearing bright red T shirts, and a smile. The hygiene was good and the cutlery served was decent.

What could be better : Lets start at the approach, it is inside a gully, a very narrow one at that, not much they can do about it, perhaps introducing valet service might help, parking with a  big car will be a jam! The seating needs to be a bit more spaced out and the theme a bit more decisive. 

Give you an example : if the objective is to focus on the experience and less on the food, then the ambience has to be a bit more cushy, where people can relax, like a lazyboy kind of a feeling. If the focus is on high quality cuisine, then playing loud live music disturbs the cause, considering the space between the make shift dais and the nearest table is too less for comfort. The choice is to tone down the decibel and the choice of music. Can't have a hard rock playing while you sip an exotic tea! Its still early days for them, so I am certain they will evolve into a more decisive balance or skew as the case may be.

Overall : I liked what they are trying to do at this stage, I'd certainly go back a couple more times to try the consistency of the cuisine on offer before forming an opinion, as for the first impression, it was reasonable. Would recommend when you have time on your hand and want to enjoy the experience vis-à-vis a quick bite.

PS : You might want to rethink on the name : Rarest of the Rare ,an exotic tea on the menu,  it gives a very different picture in my mind!

This place is located near golpark aminia and arambagh. This restaurant serves one of the best cappuccinos and teas in the town. The ambience is just beautiful. Seems that the decoration is made with utmost love and care. Staffs are courteous. Chicken and mustard sandwich is my favourite here..

One thing I need to mention is that I had never tasted any more fresh, more tasty and more healthy food in this price range before. Hats off!!!

First Flush is defined as the very first plucking of a tea plant’s harvest season. With such an interesting name, this newly opened restaurant deserved a visit. Finding it without a map could be challenging, but once you reach there you will be welcomed through a bright red door into a quaintly designed boutique cum restaurant with spaced tables and various seating arrangements. It is charming and welcoming and we decided to start off with two mocktails.

Mocktails:
Blue Ocean Lagoon: It was at best okay. It was served prettily in a tall glass but this classic mocktail just didn't hit the mark.

Green Goddess: A green apple based Mojito and it was exactly how you would like your mocktail. It was pretty and tasted even better and it is surely one you should try.

Starter:
Chicken Cheese Bomb:
When you hear Chicken Cheese Bombs,you expect a juicy meat ball overflowing with cheese inside, soft and crunchy. And that's exactly what we got. Served albeit in a skewer like fashion, these were quite large chunks of juicy chicken studded with gooey cheese inside and a nice crunchy crust outside. It's served with a white dipping sauce and is decorated beautifully making every bite a pure joy.

Mains:
Rock N Prawn:
It's the classic Rock N Prawn, rather the crumb fried prawn for the seafood lover. Six pieces of tiger prawn fried in quite a light batter, leaving a bit crunchy outside and cooked perfectly preserving the softness and melt-in-the-mouth texture of a well prepared shrimp. A sincere effort to make the prawns perfect on the plate was quite evident. You have a choice of rice or pasta or spaghetti to choose as the main carb here.A real treat this one.

Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce:
What strikes you first with this dish is the big chunk of fish on your plate, that too a classic Bengal Bhetki at such a reasonable price. The fish was yet again prepared to perfection. Moist, soft and juicy...it had a nice char on the outside with a hint of smokiness yet holding on to its firm yet soft texture. It is served with sides of cheesy mashed potato, sautéed veggies and rice along with a small serving of the lemon butter sauce. This is for the typical fish lover, and even the non-fish lovers.

We were too full to have dessert.
Sadly, we didn't get to have some tea.

First flush is located in a narrow lane near golpark. The ambience and decor gives you the feeling of a friendly home with comfortable wooden chairs and also a sofa with 1940s blues music playing in the background.
Coming to the food, we ordered Cappuccino, cream of chicken soup, basil chicken skewers and bacon cheese bombs for starters. The soup was thick and creamy that was very sumptuous. The bacon was perfectly cooked and went well along with the cheese. The chicken skewers were really succulent and tasted heavenly.
Would definitely recommend to go for a visit.

Located near golpark auto stand.. the decor and ambience is quite good with live band performance. We ordered cola float(tasted good), lemon fizzy ice tea(didnt like the taste. Going by the name thought it to be fizzy or lemony but it was just plain cold tea with some ice cubes and slices of lemon thrown in. Saw many ppl ordering it though) and chicken ham sandwich(nice and fresh, served with chips and sauce).

We friends always meet once a month at a relatively new place . We wanted to explore and experience " First Flush " and landed up on a Saturday afternoon.
We were 7 of us and were seated at the right hand of the large room . The setting is quite like the Club culture of the city , with trolleys to get the orders to the tables .
Service was quite slow as it took around 30 minutes not just to get the starters , which as they say , requires time as they need to start fresh , but 30 minutes for glasses for water , 40 minutes for them to inform us that they don't have cold mineral water !!
On the plus side , the food is excellent . We ordered the Algerian fish and the Fried fish and chips . The Pork chips were good but laden with plenty of fat . The chicken roast was a perfect single piece of leg , with great  sauce . The Peri Peri chicken had a greater portion and was well cooked . In starters , the Basil Chicken skewers were tasty and well presented . The bacon  wrapped cheese balls were the best and the tastiest with melt in your mouth cheese .
The fried chicken starters were large portions and well done .
Mocktails are passable and most of the drinks are unavailable as we found out .
Great place for a leisurely meal or a cup of chai .
Would definitely visit again in their better day !

Location :  This is definitely the Achilles Heel of the place . The shortest path would be to get down at Golpark and take the " Koshe Kosha " lane  i.e The Lane next to the lane adjacent to the " Mouchak " sweet shop. Then take the first left on the lane to enter a silent by-lane and after that take another left to have the place in sight .  Ya tricky i know !!

Ambiance : Beautiful . Felt at home and yet it was just a tad more glamorous than home . Old world red comfy sofas and chairs . The perfect place for a "adda" with old friends . Scantily populated and plenty of room and the A.C in full swing .

Service : The boys are very young but polite and enthusiastic and do know most of the dishes' flavor outcome . Overall nothing to cringe about. The food is brought about within the normal waiting time in carts on wheels like those yesteryear bengali movies .

Food : Typical cafe food with a focus on Continental (European) . Everyone can read the menu so no use highlighting the already highlighted ! Our group of colleagues / friends ordered the Oreo blast , Vegetable burger with fries , Chicken wings , Virgin Mojito , Green apple mojito and some coffees in between. Over the years I've eaten Burgers at every joint possible  but I've seen a patty this thick ! It was so good and tasty with a crunchy exterior and a guey interior along with cheese  and their signature garnishing . I've never had a Veg. Burger that was this good . Accompanied by some french fries , some coleslaw and a miniscule amount of sauce .  

The oreo blast was interesting as well . A certain creaminess could be felt .Someone clearly knows how to use the mixer grinder :P ! The other drinks weren't anything special .Just the usual taste .Good enough but nothing extraordinary . The chicken wings were tangy and spicy at the same time. Ample use of Barbeque sauce could be felt . It was very tasty ." Finger licking good " stuff .

Cost for 2 : 300/- plus 

Final Conclusion : Well worth it . Couldn't click many photos because we were so drunk on our conversations . Old colleagues you know .  But take my word for it . It was a nice experience . Not heavy on the pocket as well . The " vegetable burger "gets a special mention . The location may be a bit odd but once you enter you don't have to look back .

While seraching for a place to hang out in a hot summer afternoon, we found this wonderful place. Although, it is conveniently situated at the Golpark-Gariahat area, finding the place can be a tricky affair, if you aren't a big fan of google map or not been there previously. 

We reached the cafe around 12 noon and it was absolutely empty(it should be, not everyone is as crazy as us, planning something at that hour). However, we did enjoy the fact of having the whole place to ourselves. Contrary to the entrance which is relatively small, the place is really big from inside. It gives the feeling of a dining hall of a bengali home, with bookshelfs and beautiful paintings on the wall. 

Coming to the food, price is reasonable and quantity, quality both match upto it. We order french fries, egg mayo sandwich, chocolate milkshake. Egg mayo sandwich was best of the lot, a must try. 

Staffs were courteous and friendly. Wonderful experience, overall. Will definitely visit soon...

Visited this place to hide out from the scorching heat outside and trust me its such a relief! It gives u a feel of ur own drawing room, mostly homely decor with much of whites soothing ur eyes.  Cordial staffs.
Food part -
1. Orange mojito, electric shock to gulp for...Frankly i found flavours too much over-powering the base which is soda so after some sips it did nt come out well.
2. Chicken mustard sandwich-which was good and they serve it with normal salted potato chips, 
3. Fish finger-it was the best stuff  and i thoroughly loved it. well cooked, soft, loaded with fish and very thin crust coating.
Overall experience is good !

First Flush's charm is strongly embedded in the food and the ambiance. Bengali in its essence, the restaurant/cafe is very welcoming and boasts of a varied menus and an extensive beverages menu. The tea  they serve is brilliant (you can even purchase loose tea leaf packets!). I tried the following and I'd definitely recommend each: Bacon cheese bombs, Italian fish finger and chicken lollipop. I'd definitely back and try the other items on their menu!

First Flush is almost an oddity in the middle of  Golpark. Tucked away exactly behind Axis bank (and all the craziness!), it somehow brings together three things that define Bangalis - a perfect setting for adda, incredible food and top grade Darjiling tea.The decor strongly resembles that of what you'd call an 'adda ghor'. The food however is different, more adventurous almost - something which holds true for Bengalis ONLY when it comes to food! These guys know how to brew some incredible tea. You'd know the difference when you taste the chaa here.
Definitely try the: Bacon Cheese Bombs, Basil Chicken Skewers, Peri Peri Chicken (yes, I like my chicken!)Oh and the desserts are pretty great too! (Nutella Sandwich FTW!)

First Flush is a place in the  vicinity of Gariahat more. 

When I heard the name very first time I was soo curious about the name. Later I came to know about the  meaning from the owner herself. First Flush is defined as the very first plucking of a tea plant's harvest season.

This restaurant will look very decent but well maintained from the outside .

But once you entered the place you will be stunned with the beauty of the cafe. A grand collection of teapots, photographs and books and so many thinks. It feel like you are in a colonial time house of northern  Hills of  Bengal. As I always think the ambiance and the decor of any restro or cafe is of prime importance so I gave 10 on 10 for FF in Ambi and decor category.

Now lets come to the most important one that is food category.

People can easily slipped in the place to have the finest quality of Tea directly from the best tea estates of India. Although I am not a great Tea fanatics and basically I love to have the "dudh chaa in matir bhar" in the roadside chaier dokan but the aroma brewing from the teas just make me mad.So if you are a tea specialist man please visit your pilgrimage.

We have a family get together at the   Cafe so I doesn't order not a single dish but snatched some portions from every ones order.Lets gave some taste details

1) Green Apple Mojito - As usual soothing and chill

2) Grilles Egg Sandwiches - Mouthwatering

3)Fish Finger served with tarter sauce - A close competitor to Legendary Chittoda's fish finger of Deckers Lane.

4) Some chicken I forgot the exact name with mashed potato and assorted vegetables- Delicious

5)Crispy Chicken Lollypop - A bit more spicy . It may be improved if the gravy type of sauce can be minimally utilized.

6) Nepoliten baked Lasagne served with the garlic bread - Kudos to the cook. If you forget to order the dish at FF it is heinous crime against your taste buds.

7) Grilled fish serve with mashed potato , mai mai sauce and spanish rice - According to me It is the queen of FF . The grilled fish will melt in the mouth like a butter. I will love to kiss the hand of the  man/woman who make this ultimate beauty.

So the foodies go and enjoy your lazy evening with your near and dear one to the newest rocker of the city. A place to enjoy , celebrate and cheer for the beauty of our own Beautiful Bengal....

"First flush" comes with a beautiful and appropriate tagline "love in a by lane". Situated in a quaint by-lane in the heart of Gariahat, this cafe got an ultimate classy decor. This place is quite spacious with nice and comfortable sitting arrangements. The menu, too, is nicely chosen. We ordered smoked tea and ice lemon tea. Both were perfect. Bacon cheese bomb, as starter, was stole our heart, both taste- and presentation wise.. We could not resist us from ordering the classic "brownie with ice-cream" and we loved that item, too. In one sentence, "First flush" spreads love in a by lane and beyond.

Beautifully​ set up cafe , quite cozy and gives a relaxed homely feel with white washed falls , collage picture frames shows scenes from Darjeeling and surrounding tea estates , various tea cups and cutleries stacked in showcases and a small blue coal engine of ghoom station drew our attention. The staff were courteous and instead of ordering tea from this themed tea lounge , we sat for a full course dinner.

It started with CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP , one bowl of creamy goodness served with buttered garlic bread made it a heavenly start. The starters followed , BACON CHEESE BOMBS and CHICKEN WINGS , we liked both , the former being my pick. Next , CHICKEN LASAGNA was dry and downer. The dessert was surprisingly way beyond what we expected , the BROWNIE WITH ICECREAM was one of the best brownies i had recently , and a must try .

This is my second visit to the place.  It has a nice comfortable feel. The staff are extremely polite and helpful. Now coming to the food. One should definitely try their smoked tea. It has a burnt flavour to it. I tried their pesto pasta which was well made with subtle flavours with perfect consistency. Their quantity is more than sufficient. Would definitely come over again to try their other dishes.

I really liked this boutique coffee shop and believe me, once you are in, you will really fall in love with the decor. Its so cosy and calm. Specially the decor has been done in pure English style. Coming up to the food, must say I tried their chicken cream and mushroom soup with a twist which really is comes with garlic bread and roast chicken, both were so tasty and have unique tastes. I am glad to have one coffee shop like this close to my house and will surely keep visiting.

Dessert coming complementary with a main course…..sounds like a deal? Well then First Flush is where you should be. Wholesome, delicious comfort food and some hot beverages is just what we needed to greet winters in the city and this is exactly when we got invited by First Flush, the boutique café. Tucked away in an otherwise non-descript by-lane in Golpark area, it is one of those quaint little cafes that boasts of  good food and warm hospitality, apart from a neat and tastefully done up interior!

Perfect location. Situated in the prime zone of Golpark and Gariahat, this new surprise in town is yet located away from the hustle and bustle tucked nicely in a byelane. You can only go there if you know the place. Accidental cafe hoppers are unlikely to be the guests here. Amazing variety of tea is the prime draw for me. The tea is packed in hot water and the sand clock will indicate when the same is ready for pouring. I loved it. Has its own charm having the tea brewing in front of you as you carry on with the lighter adda or more serious stuff for which you might have landed up. Even if you are not hungry, try out a plate of fish fry or fish finger. Indeed lip smacking. Surely the kolkata bhetki has been used which you can make out from the taste of it. If your adda stretches a while, they are polite enough to pour some more hot water onto the tea leaves and you get a nice cup of "second flush"

The restaurant is located close to golpark. The ambience of the restaurant is sober and subtle. The red entrance door then all the red and white color decor is soothing to the eye. 
It is mainly known for it's various flavours of handpicked darjeeling tea. 
I had the chicken lasagna with garlic bread. It tasted good but the lasagna was less cheesy. They didn't serve garlic bread,  it was plain toasted white bread. 
The algerian fish with mashed potato,  herb rice was really good.  The fish was perfectly cooked, the mashed potato was soft and creamy.  The rice was fine.  But I didn't like the red tangy sauce they served with the fish. It was too tangy and had some traces of rosemary. 
The menu on zomato is not the updated one.  That needs to be updated.

First Flush - the name is synonymous to the plucking of the very first tea leaves at the beginning of the year. The name itself tells us what the cafe specializes in - TEA!! Frankly, it would be wrong to call it just a cafe. Yes, First Flush is one of the first Tea Boutiques in South Kolkata. All the more reason for us "South kolkata'r lok" to rejoice.

First Flush is located very close to Golpark in a small alley. The door is very brightly coloured and is bound to attract some attention from passerbys. The place is extremely spacious and comfy and exudes a homely vibe which endeared it to me, the moment I stepped in.

Since Tea is the of the utmost importance in this café, the place exudes a vibe which is very similar to the restaurants in Darjeeling. They've tried to portray the feels of Darjeeling by doing up the walls with a myriad of pictures from Darjeeling. The décor is very minimalistic and has a soothing effect on your soul.

We were invited for a food tasting event at First Flush and I was more than excited to visit it. Since I'm a lover of tea, the fact that it endorses itself as a tea boutique aroused my interest quite a bit. We received a very warm welcome from our hostess who was extremely friendly and organized our event in a flawless manner.

A note for people who don't love tea - Don't judge a book by it's cover. This is a gem of a place that has more to offer than just tea. Read on to find more.

Let us begin with the menu of the evening :

• Arya Ruby Tea - This was Black Tea from the Arya Estate in Darjeeling. The tea was light flavoured and tasted brilliant. The manner in which it was served was also interesting. The kettle was covered and a sandtimer had been placed beside it. This indicated the time when we should pour our tea for the best flavour and aroma. Honestly, I've never had tea that had been so intricately thought out.

• Chicken Lollipops - Now everybody knows about chicken lollipops, but don't for once make the mistake of thinking that this is your regular lollipop. These lollipops are humongous and mammoth sized. Plus they tasted brilliant. They were soft and juicy. Yummm. Recommended!

• Basil Chicken Skewers - 6 skewers of chicken served with mayo. Tasted really good. It was slightly dry but the taste was great. Would serve as the perfect snack with a cup of steaming hot tea!

• Fish Fingers - 6 pieces of fish fingers were served with tartar sauce. Yet again the size of the pieces were commendable. The stuffing was perfectly made making this one of the best tasting dishes of the evening. Perfect snack material, too!

• Bacon Cheese Bombs - THIS WAS THE BOMB OF THE EVENING!!!! Seriously, I've never tasted something so soooooo brilliant. If you visit First Flush and don't order this particular item, I think you're losing out on life. Cheese wrapped with bacon served with ketchup...Perfect foodgasm. Recommended to infinity!

• Chicken Sliders - This was basically Chicken Burger served with fries! The patty was thick and extremely delicious. The burger was really huge, so much so that you can't put it in your mouth all at once. Heavenly stuff! Recommended yet again.

• Egg and Mayo Sandwich - This was the last item of the day and it pleased me to the core. Grilled sandwiches stuffed with generous portions of egg and mayo. The stuffing was so much that it was oozing out with every bite, on the plate, on my t-shirt! There was egg and mayo everywhere and I was loving it!! Strongly recommended!

This was the food scene at First Flush and I thoroughly enjoyed the event! The hosts were more than friendly and warm and we had a great time. The biggest surprise that awaited us at the end of the event was a beautiful chocolate cake with vanilla frosting which we cut along with the hosts. We had an amazing time and I'm definitely coming back again!
A perfect café with a perfect ambience! All my love to Team First Flush!

Talk about Kolkata, and one of the characteristics of the city to be listed out will be the indispensable “Adda”. The true vibe of the city is present in the adda of the Bengali folks, as they gather and discuss everything from Donald Trump to Donald Duck. And, in all these high-spirited discussions and exchange of thoughts and ideas, the one thing that can be considered integral is tea! The youth still hosts its addas in Coffee House and Jadavpur University compound. But, those who want it less noisy, and more chic hog cafés. It’s no surprise when a new tea joint or café comes up in the city. And, the newest in the block is First Flush Kolkata. As an addabaaj Bangali tea-lover, I have fallen head over heels in love with this Darjeeling themed tea boutique!

It's a quiet café tucked away in a Golpark lane!!! Its perfect for those long meet addas as both the food and d ambiance is mesmerizing!
Ambience-as quite jazz music plays in d background you get to sit on comfortable wooden chairs and enjoy perfectly made darjeeling tea. It definitely recreated the solitude and bliss of a mountain valley, with the walls of the café adorned by pics from Darjeeling.
Service-the service is really nyc, with the waiters extremely helpful giving us ready details about each dish and preparation.
Food-we ordered oreo blast, chicken and mustard sandwich, chicken omelette and chicken alakeiv. The oreo blast was awesome, the chicken omelette was huge served with bread slices, the chicken alakeiv took longer than expected to prepare, but definitely it was worth the wait.
An overall good experience!

First Flush Boutique Cafe located at 21/2 , Gariahat Road, Gariahat, Kolkata is the kind of place you would want to visit for a cup of specially first plucked unfiltered and purist form of tea leaves from the gardens of Darjeeling. Not only that as apart from its identity of a Tea boutique, it also has a great menu lined up for snacking as well as for a complete belly satisfaction indeed . As its a new form of a cafe in the city it has its own charm in the category of places to visit for folks of all ages .The most interesting thing of this place is surely the calm and homely feel you get inside this cafe as according to the owners and management it does not focus much of a business clustered sitting arrangement but more of a relaxed and home style affair with sofas ,wooden chairs and glass tables comfortably surrounding spaciously with sitting for roughly 25 people at least .

These days every bit of our urban life is result oriented. We can not think of a task we will undertake that won’t yield positive results. Even people snacking over a sandwich and coffee in a café tend to discuss topics that will be beneficial to them. The charm of old world ‘adda’ has almost vanished from the life of Bengalis today. And seriously cafes today who mostly operate in chains, won’t let you choose their café as your adda spot during the evening rush hours, since they will bring the bill to your table and will keep asking you if you need anything else. But there are detoxification agents present around you whom you need to know before it’s too late. And one such agent or rather place hidden in the bylanes of Golpark is called ‘First Flush’. This is one Tea boutique and coffee shop where you can sit in a spacious homely atmosphere for hours over snacks and cups of aromatic tea and get nostalgic with your old friends or loved ones. It also has an unique gift and accessories kiosk near the entrance. This place somewhat washes down all the impurities in your body and mind in a shot. Here you can discover the unique taste of first and second flush tea, which are handpicked from Darjeeling. Along with these splendid cups of tea you get soul pleasing continental food options to choose from. And I must say, I was mighty pleased with the food at this place. They serve top quality no-nonsense food which is damn flavorful and drives you and your taste buds crazy!

​First Flush is a unique tea boutique located in the bylanes near Golpark. Well, tea boutiques aren’t quite popular in Calcutta. The essence and flavour of the teas of the different tea estates of Darjeeling are distinctly different and, we Bongs, are really fond of them. Thus, First Flush has come up with this unique concept where the taste of the ‘queen of the hills’ is retained and you’d find all the unique varieties of Darjeeling Teas on their regular menu. But that’s not all about this place. First Flush welcomes you with an amazing menu which can be definitely enjoyed over a cup of amazing tea ! I was invited to First Flush for a bloggers meet. Now what does First Flush mean? Most of you reading this aren’t aware of the meaning of this term. First Flush is defined as the very first plucking of a tea plant’s harvest season. The new grown leaves plucked during First Flush are the youngest and most tender part of the tea plant and are said to yield the purest and freshest cup of tea that the plant is capable of producing. The restaurant, as evident, is completely centred around tea and tea lovers. But wait? You don’t love tea? Never mind, there are still various reasons why you must visit this place. Let’s get into details.

I visited First Flush Cafe as a part of CFC (Calcutta Foodies Club) meet and was invited here by Indrajit Da, who is also a food blogger and food enthusiast. I was quite excited for the CFC meet up this time as i had visited the last one quite sometime ago which was held in association with Zomato @ Saptapadi Restaurant. It is a cafe concept which even has a small section for selling garments and junk jewellery and is famous for it’s tea (Coming again for tea). There was a pre-set menu for all of us which was beautifully curated by the CFC Team keeping in mind the cost as well as the offerings. We were around 10-15 people ready to hunt down the food due to our food cravings. The place is chic, modern and is a concoction of white-red. It has been kept simple yet elegant to look at. The seating’s are comfortable as well and can easily accommodate groups as well. There were wall paintings, few show pieces and just one or two tree plants. I really liked the entrance of it. It’s quite welcoming.

Intricate Tea Tasting & Other Munchings @ First Flush, Kolkata ☺

'First Flush' is defined as the very first plucking of a tea plant's harvest season. They are considered more expensive due to their bright liquor and a lively character.

First Flush, the relatively new tea bar cum eatery boasts of an unusual variety of first flush tea leaves picked from the very best of Darjeeling tea estates during the March-June Period. Hence, the name.

First Flush is jointly opened by two tea enthusiasts and great fans of the hilly terrains of Darjeeling. Their love for the aforesaid hill station is apparent from a nice and big collection of Darjeeling based photographs that adorn the walls of this outlet!

The outlet is situated in a quaint by lane, at the back side of Axis Bank, the one situated at the Golpark Crossing. Relevant sign boards are placed around, to provide ease of access to the prospective diners.

The entrance leads to a small room that serves as the reception cum waiting area. This room also showcases a limited selection of handmade jewellery, block-printed scarves, sarees etc., that are arranged on the shelves for sale. All items are ethnic and artistic.

The small room leads to the actual 25 seater dining area, done in red and white, with enough space between two seating arrangements and oodles of old world charm. Also present alongside is a book shelf filled with books on - cooking, brewing, painting and literature. The books are only for in-house reading.

The menu card cover is done in red silk. At the first glance, it appears like a wedding card! The menu comprises of - first flush and other teas, coffees, mocktails, milkshakes, starters, soups, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, thin crust pizzas, signature dishes and desserts. Both veg and non veg options are available.

Once the tasting session started, a tea set was brought in a trolley and I felt like a 'gora sahib' of old world Bengal! Once the tea set was arranged on the table, I noticed that it comprised of - a brewing tea pot well covered with a tea cosy (cover), an hour glass to administer the brewing duration, a metallic sieve with it's tea pot shaped metallic place holder, sachets of assorted sugar, a small mixing spoon and a set of transparent glass cup and saucer to facilitate viewing of the beautiful golden color of the final tea.

Once the entire sand in the hour glass slipped down, I was told that the brewing part was over. Some tea was sieved into my cup. Also, I mixed some sugar to it. As I took my first sip of the prepared tea, how longingly I felt the need of sitting beside a window with a wide plantation view and whiff of clean fresh air! But alas! it was simply not possible. So, I simply shut down my eyes for few seconds and enjoyed a writer's paradise in my vision!

The tasting session was done in pre designed pairs of food i.e. a set of a beverage and a dish were presented together for tasting.

Food Pair 1:

- Silver Needle Tea (Rs. 160/- per cup): It was a premium quality tea with an altogether different shape of dried tea leaves. They were thin, a couple of inches long, and they kind of looked like dried 'sangri' (a Rajasthan based vegetable).

The final liquor looked pale golden in color and had a nice floral flavor. I had it with some sugar. It tasted quite refreshing. A plate of complimentary thin biscuits was also served. The biscuits also tasted nice.

- Cheese Corn Croquette (Rs. 160/-): 4 deep fried, bulbous and tikiya shaped croquettes were served along with some ketchup. With their crusty exterior and mozzarella cheese rich interior, they tasted quite nice in the winter chill.

Food Pair 2:

- Veg Minestrone Soup - Served With Garlic Bread (Rs. 130/-): Thick and kind of little sweet soup, garnished with some cream and a sprig of green was served along with slices of triangular garlic breads.

The soup was hot, fresh, rich in aromatic spices and tasted very nice. Garlic breads were prepared out of the usual sandwich bread and were scantily topped with some herbs. They tasted nice.

- Veg Club Sandwich - Served With French Fries (Rs. 120/- for half plate and Rs. 220/- for full plate): A half plate portion equaling to 2 toasted double decker club sandwiches was served along with abundant fries and ketchup. In each sandwich, the bottom filling comprised of lettuce leaves and a thick crumbly spread of fresh garden salad. The top filling comprised of lettuce leaves, thin tomato and onion roundels, char grilled yellow bell peppers, topped with a thin sheet of cheese. To hold together the entire sandwich, a toothpick was inserted in the middle of it. A green olive was inserted at the top of the toothpick.

The sandwich tasted excellent and quite filling. The char grilled bell pepper added a nice smoky flavor. The garden salad was quite balanced in composition. The french fries taste average.

Unless you are 3-4 in number, refrain from ordering a full plate, as the portions are quite large.

Food Pair 3:

- Okayti First Flush Tea (Rs. 130/- per cup): This tea had a relatively darker and richer shade. I tried it without sugar and found the taste better. It's after taste strongly reminded me of a perfume called 'Tea Rose'.

- Veg Lasagne - Served With Garlic Bread - With Soya Keema and Paneer Stuffing (Rs. 250): In this very different take on veg lasagne, instead of vegetables, the lasagne sheets were alternated with crumbled cottage cheese and finely minced soya! The look and chewy texture of soya granules, made them appear like something non veg, but they were not! The top of the lasagne was coated with enough butter and well grilled.

It was a different and tasty main course dish.

Food Pair 4:

- Ginger Fizz (Rs. 100/-): It was a lemonade infused with finely minced ginger in enough quantity. It was served in a long glass with a slice of lime inserted at the rim. It tasted nice but minute ginger pieces that came with each sip were little disturbing. It would be nice, if most of them are substituted with freshly extracted ginger juice.

- Homemade Ravioli With Spinach (Rs. 290): One big piece of ravioli stuffed with a spinach concoction arrived in an oval white dish, as opposed to many smaller chunks or pieces if ravioli.The whole dish was generously topped with herb infused thick white sauce. Some melted butter and a sprig of green was placed at the top centre.

This main course dish was excellent in taste.

Desserts:

- Brownie with Vanilla Ice-cream (Rs. 110/-): A rectangular slab if brownie was topped with a round scoop of vanilla ice cream and enough chocolate sauce was poured over them.

This comfort dessert tasted expectantly nice.

- Tutti Frutti (Rs. 100/-): It was a long glass of vanilla ice cream, infused and topped with apple, pineapple and papaya chunks, and further topped with a red cherry.

It tasted average.

It needs mentioning that once your tea pot is empty, upon askance it will be filled with an extra hot cup of water. Of course, this hot water will not be charged and you can go through the whole process of brewing, sieving, sugar mixing, and get yourself a complimentary cup of tea!

To sum it up, it was an old world style and relaxed tasting session enjoyed with courteous and dignified owners and their PR company personnel. The waiters were friendly as well.

Note: It was a complimentary meal presented for tasting & review.

Had been eyeing this joint quite for sometime. Was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful decoration and sufficient seating arrangement. As I made myself comfortable, a rolly polly staff came forward and handed me the beautifully decorated menucard. In fact, I at first took it to be a wedding reception card.
It was evident from the name itself that it is essentially a tea boutique. Alas, I don't drink tea. I nevertheless tried jasmine tea here, and really enjoyed. The aroma of jasmine soothes your senses.Here they provide first flush tea of various variety. Since I don't drink tea, I had to remain contented by drinking jasmine tea, as suggested by the staff. It's an out of the world experience. The tea was served in a trolley with a timer and lovely tea set. It was like going back to the British era.

In food, with the help of Debraj,the staff herein, I chose chicken mustard sandwich. It came grilled accompanied by potato fingers. It tasted good, I could feel the tingle of mustard in my tongue. I then chose fizzy drink lemon ice tea. It tasted nice too. 

Coming out, I found a sale of garments and junk jewellery. I bought a pendant from there, which inspite of being overpriced was too cute to leave alone.

There was a bookshelf from where I chose a book on tea cyclopaedia, and truly it was an eye opener. The proprietor walked to and from one table to another, making friends.
 
It's being situated in the by lane makes it difficult to park car. The price is a bit on the steeper side.

Overall a superb experience.

This place is tucked in a by-lane in Gariahat. But it is not difficult to find. Yesterday a group of friend got together at this place for dinner. This is a small eatery. Ambience is very nice. Gives you a feeling of Darjeeling. 
The food was fresh and tasty. We ordered a number of dishes. The mocktales Ginger frizzy or Green apple Mohito were refreshing. For starters we had Fish finger, Cheese corn fritters and Chicken skewers. They used Bhetki for the fingers. The Cheese corn fritters were excellent. However the Chicken skewers were a bit dry and under seasoned.
For mains we had Pork chops and Algerian fish. Both served with vegetables and mashed potatoes. The Pork chops were excellent. Fresh and succulent. Again Bhetki was used for the Algerian fish. Both the dishes were very tasty.
The deserts were wonderful specially the Tulli Frutti. Brownie with hot chocolate was also very nice.
The over all experience was excellent. We had a very nice time.
This is actually a tea place with a large no. of types of tea on offer. They also serve breakfast dishes. We will have to come back again to try these.

This place is situated in the bylanes near axis bank golpark branch. As now theyve put directions its easy to find this place. As you enter this place all u'll find is warmth nd friendlyness. The idea of opening a cafe nd finger food joint which has a nice decor cosy sofas and above all the photographs is amazing!! Oh yes nd i loved their cuckoo watch too. Well abt their food and beverages we took Gidda pahar first flush nd avongrove tea chessy soldiers chicken wings nd american club sandwich with french fries. Food are of good portions. American Club Sandwich was perfect nd fries along with it were crisp chicken wings are of good size nd they r succulent Chessy Soldiers were just fantastic. Now the beverages my friend asked for a strong tea so theyve suggested avongrove which was good nd for me Gidda Pahar first flush was good too. But all i want to say since uve named this place First Flush u should incorporate more variety of tea for tea lovers and If possible do keep white tea also. Nd overall good evening spent but would like to have more variety of tea at ure outlet.

This cafe  is located in the by lanes of golpark, initially it was a bit tough to locate but now they have put direction boards.
This cafe is spacious with nice decor of white and red and i love the cuckoo watch. I absolutely love the ambience, the staffs are very helpful and polite. And even the owners are extremely sweet and they surely know how to take care of their guest. I have already visited this cafe a dozen times. So i surely recommend this place. 

Now lets focus on the food, this place takes tea very seriously, but i have never ordered tea, so really cant comment on that part..more of a coffee person. 
I have had their
Chicken wings: liked it, not the best in town but worth a try.
Chicken lollipop: similar to their chicken wings, i like this.
Cheese soldiers: cheese sticks fried to perfection. This is gooey cheese oozing out with every bite. No nonsense. Comes with a tastier dip. 

Roasted chicken: i dint like this much, but my friend liked it. Comes with grilled veggies and mashed potato, ask for a mayo dip and u mix with the mashed potato as needed. You can thank me later. ;)

Cappuccino: i like their coffee. Though i find their latte and cappuccino similar.

Latte: nice

Cold coffee: Okayish

Chicken kickers: The barbeque sauce is love. This is basically chicken fillets fried to perfection. :D i always ask for plain mayo dip with this. :)
Chicken ala Kiev: melted butter oozing out of the perfectly fried chicken breasts and flooding the plate is a treat to watch. A bit salty for my taste. I think they should reduce the size of the chicken and serve two. 

One thing i so want them to start is some eggless cake. Or mayb some momos.
Lasagna and sandwiches are on my wish list already, mayb next weekend. :)

This cafe is located at one of the by-lanes of gariahat. If you are walking from gariahat more then take a left from the auto stand and then take right, walk few steps then again take right. Don't get confused with the direction mentioned as they have already put up direction boards at each point to get there. Ambiance is very cosy and the mixture of red and white colors give a very vibrant look to it's decor. Staffs were really helpful and courteous. When we went there, not a single table was vacant thus we were told to wait there for few minutes. After 2 mins they called us and took us to the table. After settling comfortably we looked around and saw lovely photographs being hung upon the wall. Tea is their speciality but yesterday we didn't opt for tea. Nevertheless, there's always a second chance to everything. On my next visit I will definitely try their tea. Coming to food we had ordered egg mayo sandwich and veg pesto pasta. Loved the food. Quality and quantity is value for money. The manager herself was there and she was dealing with her customers with utmost care.

This newly opened Tea-Room, tucked in a lane near Golpark More, is a breath of fresh air among the mushrooming cafes around. The spacious area has been done up beautifully in white, with touches of red. And the best thing is that, the tables aren’t crammed inside, rather are arranged at a good distance from one another.

Tea is taken seriously here, and the pots nestled in tea-cosies, come with pretty little sand clocks to make sure the warm water is infused with the lovely tea leaves for the perfect amount of time, before being poured out.

The day I had gone to this place, on an invitation by SocialBong, I was pleasantly surprised to see a short yet immensely enjoyable show of stand-up comedy in full swing, inside the place.

They also serve wholesome food, and I tried quite a few of them. I particularly liked the Roast Chicken and the Pork Chops. These main courses come with sides of mashed potatoes and sautéed veggies, thereby making it a full meal in itself. The Lasagna here too, is worthy of mention. Also, you get the Dessert of the day for free with every order of a main course. Now, that’s a great deal, I felt.

I was so very pleased with the quaint little place and it's conscious aesthetics but all gets ruined when your service is so horrid. The food is good but my waiter was ignorant and ill mannerd. Took my order and served only one of the dishes and when enquiried as to how long the other order would take he said that he had only asked if it was there in the menu. Though he wrote it down write in front of me. When an otherwise gets completely ruined by the lack and incompetence of service it is really really sad. Good luck. Revamp your staff if possible.

The place is a bit difficult to find. Its on the ground floor of a house in the lanes around Gol Park. However, once you step inside, you will get surprised by the nice & tasteful design. The name itself suggests the place to be oriented on Tea. Yes, that's right & along with that you get good continental food. I chose a normal Chicken & Mustard Sandwich and Giddapahar First Flush tea. Liked both of it. Will visit again for trying out other dishes.

This is a tiny little tea cafe in a lane of Golpark. The decor is refreshing and they have a pregty long menu . I went here with my sister because we were too hungry and this was the first place our hungry eyes could spot .

We went here for evening snacks . We ordered a spaghetti with meat balls . Served with 6 six meat balls and in a tangy tomato based sauce. I liked it to a certain extent , I'm a spaghetti monster . The sauce was a little bit too tangy, I think they put too much ketchup in it otherwise pretty good .


Happy eating!

Love in a bylane- definately it is. First Flush definately captured my heart not only with their food but also with their behaviour and ambience. The place is beautifully decorated. In a rainy day this place can be a perfect place to gulp on something. Be it with friends,family or just alone this place will give you a nice experience. 

Location- take the lane which is beside axis bank(golpark branch). Walk 2-3mins you will find First Flush.

Yesterday went there to have a sandwich and brownie. Well i wasnt disappointed at all. Had a chicken ham sandwich and a hot chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream.

Chicken ham sandwich - this sandwich was a grilled one. Liked the taste of it. It was very good. 

Brownie with vanilla ice cream- it was heaven. It was warm and soft. The brownie was perfect. I loved it. It captured my heart. #recommended

I loved this place and i will definately give this place a visit with my friends and try their other items.

A new addition to the Golpark and gariahat region for all the food lovers around Kolkata. Located at the Golpark Crossing bylane of the Axis bank to its right. Its a small but very well made cafe for all the hangout freaks. The place has enough space to accommodate atleast 50 people at once. The decor and interior have been kept simple. The attactive point comes when you see the painting, photo frames, books and show pieces which are displayed all over the place for sale. While eating if you like one you can buy it then and there.
Had an opportunity to join here with some of my friends and some well known people. The pleasant evening started with a fizzy drink in form of a mocktail. That was refreshing and a good thirst buster.
Followed by a hot coffee with sugar to be added as per your choice.
In the food section the choices were very common and kept simple as the french fries arrived at the table to accompany the coffee with a dip.
We had the bacon cheese  bombs as well which were presented really well in the long sticks.
Non veg club sandwiches were  the pick of the dishes for the evening for me. Triangle shaped sandwiches with veggies, cheese, chicken as well as bacon to make the things really good. Tasted very good.
Then came the beer battered fish accompanied with chips which was okayish at the end.
Finishing of with the brownie with hot chocolate sauce and ice cream. Soft and hot. Going well with the ice cream. 
It was a pretty decent experience here. I am happy to see that new opening like these are maintaining the quality of dishes and keeping the taste intact without much experiments. I wish Team First Flush all the best. Cheers!

What makes this quaint little cafe so special is the uncluttered decor and peace. It lives up to its name - first flush - first of its kind cha bar with eclectic choice of the Indian national drink fresh from the best tea gardens of Darjeeling . We found this place by luck and it was a very pleasant surprise. Specially recommend arya ruby tea and the brilliant steamed chicken momo - served with lot of warmth and dash of smile by the ever helpful staff. The owners make it a point to mingle with the guests looking after each of them and make the experience of a cup of tea to be more delightful than any cafe I visited in recent times. Since its tucked away in a bylane next to axis bank , golpark , the place is almost a tea-spa to rejuvenate the senses. Hope to see this place grow and may the aroma of Darjeeling tea reach many corners of the country ! Revisit is mandatory .

Tucked away in the small bylane next to the Golpark Axis Bank is this beautifully decorated quaint cafe. The decor will surely remind you of the Elite North Kolkata houses. Unlike the cramped up cafes that have mushroomed in various parts of Kolkata this is spacious and an ideal place to sit and talk with friends over a piping hot  cup of coffee.
The coffee was served piping hot. 
The fries with salsa dip was the perfect condiment to the hot beverage. 
The bacon wrapped cheese bomb was beautifully prepared and was tempting.
The cheese bacon egg sandwich was the highlight if the evening .
The brownie with ice-cream was the perfect dessert,that was beautifully presented.
All in all it was a satisfying experience and hope the place with grow with time .

M 10 days late to express my words about this amazing place. For many to know this is cute and cozy cafe on your right while your walking towards Golpark from Gariahat, it's inside the lane beside the Axis Bank ATM. A bright red door cordially opens to welcome u and the entrance is decorated with beautiful boutique products and amazing paintings for you to buy are spread all across the cafe. The interiors are a fusion of new and old. The cane furnitures were super cool. Coming to the food it was great. We ordered for a Green Apple Mojito and it was  refreshing in every sip with thin slices of green apple dipped in the drink. The beverage was partnered with Chicken Sandwich and delicious fish fingers. The simple and query menu has attracted me alot. Planning my next visit soon as the food needs to be explored more. Service was really appreciated but only the timing if managed is going to make things perfect. Cheers !!

For a boutique cafe, the concept being new in the city, this quaint tea shop (if I may call it that) sufficiently raises the ante by several notches. We started off with a preliminary order of Cream of Chicken soup & Club Sandwitch with all the trimmings of ham & cheese and a Pasta Carbonara AND Chicken Lollipop. The quantities were generous to an incredible degree and you should be hungry enough if you are ordering a dish only for yourself! Delectable is the word that springs to the mind where yumminess is concerned. We were brazen enough (there were four of us) to also order a Pork Chop which was really heavenly! Another point to be made here is about the freshness of the items served which was simply faultless. We were forced to pack substantial quantities for home as it was simply impossible to stuff ourselves any more. But even in our bloated condition we were adventurous enough to order the brownies with hot chocolate sauce. Incredible silky smooth taste! The prices were extremely friendly and till now is tax free; so enjoy it while it lasts folks!

After this "stuffing" it was impossible to drink even a cuppa of their Darjeeling tea or browse through the books or (my wife) skimming through ethnic boutique jewellery & kurtis & dresses, all of which are available in house. Reserving that for my next venture.

I generally do not like writing negative things about people and places, but my order was nothing like what I expected.  The Nutella sandwich wasn't made with Nutella; Nutella is a hazelnut chocolate spread - this one had no hazelnut.  The quesadilla was made with Indian paratha, with thin slices of cheese layered with a barbecue paneer concoction that tasted nearly as bad as it looked.  Also, there was no sour cream.  I'll finish with an analogy to help understand.  It was like I ordered Aloo paratha and got an Aloo and two parathas that were actually Kachoris...

Visited First Flush twice in this week,  first with my family & then with my friends. It's a cozy place tucked in a quite lane off Gariahat Road, in Golpark area. More specifically,  the lane opp. Geeta Bithika near Aminia,Golpark.
Food ordered. Fish fry. 5/5. Made with bhetki.
Chicken wings. 3.5/5.Use of  Barbeque sauce makes it sweet.
Pork ham sandwich 2.5/5. Soggy & too salty.
Tea ( second flush)  4/5  proportion of tea leaves should be less as if steeping time is adhered to by the timer given.
Good value for money. No added taxes.
 Spacious sitting arrangement. Courteous & eager to please staff. Friendly & attentive owners with a very honest down to earth approach.
The best thing about this place is that it does not have the pretentious  cultural atmosphere that most cafes nowadays try to implement which is irritating in its artificiality. The tasteful decor with cane furniture, simple  lamps hanging from a high ceiling, the predominant use of white colour gives a spacious  clutter free ambience which is very pleasing. It is possible to book your table in advance if you are a large group.  Will definitely visit again.

I had dropped by for a quick meeting and tried the first flush tea. Tried the Gopaldhara first flush. The green leaves were soaked in water and a timer was given on the table for the soaking time. I found it really unique.
The taste was amazing. Never had tried such exquisite tea so my first time went really well.
Will drop by to try the other food items as well soon.
All the best to the management.

Located in the lane beside Aminia(Golpark), you can also get here quicker if you take the one right by Rajneeta. If you think First Flush ( judging by the name) only caters to the tea epicures, you would be wrong. From serving some Fine quality first flush tea, it also has a comprehensive & compact Continental cuisine(mostly) which has been constructed with great care & thought. So along with the usual junkies like fish fry, chicken wings & burgers there are also the pork chops, Chicken A la keiv, chicken cordon bleu & quesadillas. The quality is fresh and at the same time lip-smacking! The gastronomes will be absolutely delighted by this place. It's definitely worth more visits!!

The ambience is very nice.we ordered for fish finger,cappuccino n castleton 2nd flush tea.the fish finger was not very good,a bit undercooked I think.cappuccino was fine.i absolutely loved the way they served me the tea.And the aroma of that tea was splendid.I will suggest to order for castleton 2nd flush if you are visiting this place.and I would like to request the management to maintain the quality of tea intact in the long run.

This place is just amazing. The quality as well as the quantity is totally worth the money. 
Had the pork chops with sauteed vegetables, homemade chicken ravioli and fish finger. Each of these dishes was just brilliant. Highly recommended for everyone. :)

Tucked in a corner in the alley opposite to Garib nawaz meat shop in Golpark, First Flush is a cafe that must be visited by pasta lovers. Also, their fish and chips is lip-smacking. I'm no connoisseur of tea, but the second flush teas are strong and can fix a headache or two.

Edit: they have started an amazing breakfast platter. The quality of meat in the platter is absolutely sublime. For people in the locality, this is surely a boon.

Well honestly I have a mixed experience at First Flush. But I would definitely go back. I ordered a bacon cheese bomb and chicken quesadilla. However after 15 minutes of ordering when I asked how long it would take I was told the bacon cheese bombs aren't available. I waited for the quesadillas and it wasn't like what we generally expect.  In the normal Mexican version we generally have bell peppers and a lot of cheese, however their version is more like polynesian with soya honey sauce. The bread isn't exactly tortilla. But it tasted nice. It was a huge portion which isn't apt for a starter, more of a main course. I would definitely go back and try more dishes.
