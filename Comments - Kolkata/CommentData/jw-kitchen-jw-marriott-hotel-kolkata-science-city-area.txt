If you are looking for a fine buffet dining experience this is a must try places. The food spread is wide with cuisine option ranging from Mughlai, Awadhi, Chinese, Italian and Indian. Live kitchen facility is present where you can order as per your requirement. Post main course one can choose from wide spread pastries, cookies and sweets. The quality of food served is top notch and every cuisine is lipsmacking.

A very good ambience...bright and sunny( i went for lunch). We went for the buffet option. For the menu we had a lot for the mains as any other widespread buffet arrangement but the starters seemed to be a bit too scarce but what won my heart are the desserts that looked so cute and attractive and a lot more variety than i expected...not to forget their complimentary mango mocktail which tasted amazing....

We went to JW Marriott for lunch last week and were really amazed to see the huge spread just at 1250, which is a steal deal. They have multi cuisine for lunch buffet starting from Chinese, Italian, Indian and also Indian street food counters for starters. Dessert section was huge which almost have around 10-12types. Coming to the staffs I found it disappointing and not upto the mark as per 5star standards. I ordered aglio olio pasta at the live counter with the veggies of my choice, however I got unsalted pasta on my table without any veggies. My husband ordered prawn noodles, even he got chicken noodles instead of prawns. So in that case I found the staffs weren't too attentive. The food service for lunch buffet stops at 3pm almost at every restaurants, but I haven't seen staffs to clear the counters in front of guests right at 3pm. They surely stops refilling foods but clearing counters is very unlikely. Rest overall apart from the staffs I liked the food and spread was brilliant at this price. Worth a visit.

Food: North Indian, European, Mediterranean, Thai . etc .¬†
There were so many varieties its impossible not to get lost . I personally liked the North Indian part. But I tasted others too. Foods are too good and lots of varieties are available. Awesome place for lunch. Stuffs are also very helpful.
Ambiance: Excellent. Absolutely mesmerizing. 
Service : Self service for food and if you want some special cooking they will send it to your table (Its part of the Buffet ) .¬†
Excellent for Family .¬†
Cost : Reasonable and competitive . We payed around Rs 1200 per person.

Another ‚úîin my bucketlist ! Jw marriot.. in one word.. AMAZING ! undoubtedly the grand hotel in Kolkata!
The interior is superb ! The kitchen set up is huge ! The seating provision is large ! The view from inside is awesome!
It's located near ITC sonar bangla..easy to locate. You will get an warm welcome at the entrance firstly ! The staffs are friendly and well mannered!
We went there for a buffet lunch. Their buffet covers almost 100 items .. Their a la cart is a bit expensive (being a 7 star hotel). If you order anything beyond buffet menu then you have to pay 18% gst extra. We ordered virgin mojito extra for our lunch !
Food quality was good and quantity was sufficient! But the dessert section has disappointed me a little.. except 3-4 items, the remaining were not up to the mark in taste. But the buffet menu almost covers everything..starting from papri chat, sandwich, burger ..to from pork, ice cream, pasta! Everything one can eat is available in the buffet menu !
It is an amazing experience to check into Jw Marriott kolkata!
And special thanx to vishal (staff) for the smooth service and your friendly and polite behaviour is appreciableüôÇ

I went there with my family for my parents anniversary with a lot of expectations. But to our surprise we had one of the worst dining experiences ever. The first batch of prawn and fish satays were apparently stale and foul smelling. The next batch was served raw. Moreover customers don't expect houseflies in a luxury hotel chain line JW Marriott. The desert section was vast. But the thing was that despite the number of items on it was large, most of them tasted the same. The waffle bar was something which I really loved. Honestly  I would not recommend people to visit JW Marriott Kitchen

It was my first visit to a five star hotel. And Probably this why I am giving this 5 star rating as well, because it was worth it. 
I went with my family, I was excited a lot. I was literally on cloud 9!
The hotel is barely a year old. The hotel premises are brand new and kept super clean by the hotel housekeeping staff. Kitchen staff seemed a bit overwhelmed, the food was great. There was so much to taste, so to much try, It took us literally two damn hours to try and taste everything. There was - Chinese, continental, salad, Japanese, North Indian, Italian and many more countless cuisines. And the best part of this luxury buffet was those "CUTE LITTLE CUPCAKES". I am immensely in love with their presentations. You are free to choose your meal from a variety of dishes. There is no restrictions. Also, we ordered separately mocktail and rum, (which was not included in their buffet menu).

I am totally satisfied with this place. If the level of service is maintained, it‚Äôs a great hotel to visit at. If one likes buffets while dining out this is one place that is definitely worth trying out at least once. ^_^

THANK YOU FOR THE BEST, LUNCH Of LIFE.üíóüíó

Had an amazing dining experience, thanks to the lavish buffet spread. Being a member of Marriott has it's own perks. The best part of the buffet is the delectable desserts. From Indian sweets to Danish pastries, pineapple tart, lemon cheese cake to hazelnut mousse, strawberry and pista fudge, apple tart, cr√®me brulee, chocolate passion, fruit chiffon, shortcrust pastry, walnut brownie, mudpie and 10 other variants of whose names I've literally forgotten because I was so busy ogling the sinful gooey stuff and moreso hogging like a malnourished person. I've always maintained sanctity while taking food in the plate but I've got to admit, I really lost my grace the way I was dolopping one after another dessert. It's really a task to tick off every item from the buffet because you gotta pick from beetroot with basil salad- zuchinni and carrot salad with babycorns, feta cheese and fruit salad with pita bread and it's 10 dips of which some of them you"ll be having for the first time, like the 'baby mayo' and the different vinegars. The condiments are wow. You have the chaat counter, soup with amazing breads and oh-so cheesy cheese and dips. Well if you're already full, bad luck because there's starters- cheddar cheese balls, paneer tikka, baby corns. In the main course you have a mix of Italian, Chinese, Mongolian, Rajasthani and North Indian. There's a bite for every ratatouille lover, baked potatoes with cheese and also for a Dal Batti Churma lover. You have the yellow dal tadka as well as Dal Makhni, bhindi do pyaza, palak Alu, shahi paneer with choice of your Indian bread- garlic naan, roti and Masala kulcha and rice. Well, in the live counter you"ll find Thai as well as Mongolian noodles and pasta. My suggestion is to take at least 3 hours with you and enjoy the buffet spread but am sure you don't want to miss out on the desserts. So my suggestion is to not to miss any of the 20 variants of desserts and from the other courses, choose wisely and enjoy the meal! Go slow on eating to relish every bite. If you want, you can take breaks in between to roam around the lounge area to the swimming pool area.

The ambience of the JW Kitchen is awesome. I went for lunch. Ample of food, eat whatever you want, like. More than 100 items. More than 20 kinda of dessert. The full menu is buffet but you have to serve yourself. Taste of each and every food is not that good if you go look wise. But the indian starters, main dish, dessert are awesome taste. And you have to smell and take small portion first, then have big portion - a small portion. Also, it was my birthday so from their end they gifted me a cake. Overall experience was good and will visit again during dinner with

But rest was very avarage.dessert was huge in number though there were 4/5 mousse preparation instead of real bakes.pecan pie was good. I expected gammon ham there but was told pork is not served! I was really disappointed with the calamari fries which had live counter .they were super small in size and taste was below average. The Buffett was with drinks and I think there should be and option without alcohol so that non drinkers don't have to pay the extra üí∞

This kind of service is not expected from a hotel like J W Marriott.Would have to think twice before visiting the place again and would advice others the same.

Paresh and Rahul were absolutely great in terms of customer service. Just one drawback that i didn't expect from such a big and famous hotel. It spoiled my mood and i hope the authorities must take proper care of their washrooms and also maintain them. Would like to visit again. Had an amazing time.

This is a late review of my visit to this place.

I went for the dinner and I¬†booked the table for the 7 pm slot.I don't have much to say about the ambience which is awesome. The staffs were courteous but my love for food made me drag towards the starter counter without paying much attention to other things. I was the first I guess for the 7 pm slot. The starters looked great but some of them were a bit saltier.¬†

Then I moved to try the Indian snacks and went for the main courses which were delicious but as I was told by my brother that the dessert of JW Kitchen is awesome I had to keep some place for it in my stomach.
The dessert was really amazing.¬†

Unfortunately, there were too many items I missed. At the end, one of the staff came and asked for the feedback and thanked for the visit. Overall it¬†was a great experience. Food, decoration, service everything was great.

It has everything from everyone, be it salads cold cuts Indian Continental and many more!! The standout section is the dessert section with cakes tarts panna cottas and of course our typical Bengali sandesh!! Do give this one a try!!

A budget buffet in the upper section. Food tastes good. But the buffet is so distributed that you need to roam as if u r roaming in the market place. But I would suggest Marriott to look more intensely about clean plates. The plates are old and faded. You can have a nice date here. They have a nice collection of wines. Desserts are awesome as compared to starters and main course. Go.... Enjoy your food...

It was a Chandon Brut eve to kick in Christmas and JW Marriott Kolkata played their part superbly to be a graceful host. We were a group of 15 and had booked our tables a week ago. JW Managers Mr. Apurv played a super role in giving us the best tables and arranging A Cake followed by a surprise bouquet to the magnificent food spread it was an evening to cherish. Would like to thank Mr. Suvankar as well for taking care of the F&B at our tables. Impromptu Christmas Carols sung by a group were a welcome kick to imbibe the atmosphere around. Lovely eve spent. Would definitely visit again.

Went out with my office team for a lunch. At the reception they booked us with a complimentary drink offer; but later they started challenging us about it. The manager who handled this was extremely impolite. Not expected from JW. The food spread at that money is nothing great. No lamb, pork, duck .. the mains are very elementary. The only attraction over here are the deserts. I am embarassed to be a platinum member of JW worldwide after this experience.

A very lavish dining. Some of my absolute favourites were the starters and the desserts. The main course and Italian dishes were quite filling. There were again a variety of Indian cuisines including Biriyani, mutton curry and some variations of Chinese cuisines as well. Coming to price, it‚Äôs a little pricy when it comes of a budget but definitely worth a try. The ambiance is surely beautiful. I still remember drooling over the pictures taken there. üòçüíñ

Some people really worth thanking are Sunipa, Sandeep and Chef Vivek. They were so courteously serving us through our breakfast and dinner, even getting dishes specially made from out of the buffet menu. For the first time found a place worth competing my favorite hotel Leela Kempinski. Keep up this standard of service up always! Coming back soon again ‚ù§Ô∏è

Went for a staycay for two days with my family. Last year we got an exceptional service, so decided to go back again this year. Was greeted by the super-friendly staff as always. Some people really worth thanking are Sunipa, Sandeep and Chef Vivek. They were so courteously serving us through our breakfast and dinner, even getting dishes specially made from out of the buffet menu. For the first time found a place worth competing my favorite hotel Leela Kempinski. Keep up this standard of service up always! Coming back soon again ‚ù§Ô∏è

I was here the last time with my family and I must make a mention that from the time we made the entry to the service,it was all so superb.The service staffs to the Chef who attended to us was courteous and very helpful in explaining to us few of the dishes.The City of Joy needed this kind of service which was in most other place lacking.Where the service and food was concerned it was delicious and worth all the good remarks. Now I'm back in the city and I'm looking forward to giving it a visit once again and this time for breakfast.Hats off to team Marriott for their splendid service.

I went with my family for a lunch buffet out here and the first point I would say is that the ambience is awesome. 
There are lots of food to choose from. Starting from breakfast dishes to dessert items, everything on the menu is damn tasty.
The breakfast region contained cornflakes, almonds, sandwiches and other exquisite munchies.
The main course contained lots of dishes, starting with Dum Biriyani, Kosha Mangsho (chicken), Gosht( Mutton), Malabari Fish, Kofta, Dal Makhni, Aloo Matar and other different preparation of fish and chicken.
Other than this, there was a preparation on Tofu along with steamed rice. 

But one dish that deserves special mention is Chicken in Oyster sauce. This is damn awesome and a must try out here.

This was followed by the live counters for Pasta and Noodles (both separate). Pasta was available in both Penne or Alfredo sauce. And for noodles, chicken, fish and prawns were available as an add on.

Let's come to the dessert section. There were so many dessert items that I lost count! All were special dishes crafted by the chef. Also tasted the Gur Rasgolla and the Rasmalai. And there were marshmallows too.

Overall, the dining experience is quite good and I would like to visit here again.

Yes, the best buffet I ever had in Kolkata.
The ambience was fabulous, the courteous staff had smiles, the royalty of the place served more to the place.
Coming to the food, we literally didn‚Äôt know from where to start, it was huge , I started with A mixture of Indian, continental and oriental starters , every starter were amazing. Going to the main course, the Murg Hyderabadi Biriyani was the best I ever had, even better than most of the Hyderabadi speciality restaurants, the rice was so soft and it tasted just perfect, no less , no more ! Other menus were mouth watering too.
Mock tails were refreshing,
Coming to desserts !!! dammm, I didn‚Äôt know which one to taste first , had like 20+ types of cakes , 5-6 types of moose, yogurt, and what not. They even had different types of Indian sweets , my appetite was full.

Brunch was good with lot of variety especially the dessert section was worth a try. But what was disappointing is we went there for a special occasion, celebration of 5th  yr anniversary, pre booked the table and was also informed that we would like a cake, they return a call back and asked the name to be written on the cake. The sad part is no one bothered to ask us about it, staffs were not able to handle too many crowd i guess, because it looked so as it was a weekend. Really a disappointment for us. People don't fall for there false phone call for a cake as they give false hope. Really really disappointed and would never recommended this place for special days. Marriott is far better option with courteous staffs,  given a choice between JW kitchen and Marriott' restaurant. Feeling disappointment along with

My visit to this place didn't start on good note.
I went there with my wife on 7/12 at 9pm and they informed me that I was booked on 7pm slot and not 9pm. I informed them that I did book for 9pm and there is a mistake on your part. They made me wait for 20 mins before providing me with a table. 

The Interiors and ambience of this place are quite pleasing. Coming to food there should be more variety. Not a single chicken kebab item in dinner is certainly disappointing. There is no clarity which are the things included in buffet. You can see people making sandwich and burger like other live counters only to realise later that its not part of buffet. You order in live counter and then it gets delivered to you in half an hour that too when there is no rush.
The only things which we like apart from desserts are
Gosht biryani, butter naan, barbeque chicken and 1 gosht item which I don't remember the name. Instead of having a chat counter if you put more varieties then it would be better. These days there are many places where they serve more varieties with less price than JW. Just the name is not enough there should be value for money as well.

The only saving grace for you guys are the desserts.

P.S : please book your customers timing properly so that you don't waste their time which in result spoil their mood.

I guess this place attracts crowd and got it's reputation merely by the name 'J W Marriott'. The buffet served here is extremely ordinary and the price is too much hyped. Staff courtesy and excellent interior decorations might lift your mood primaries but the food served on your plate is surely not up to the mark.

Couldn't communicate with my partner and was highly disturbed by the guests sitting next to us. My table was continuously and mistakenly hit/bump by passer by's. Not a right place for date :) but do come with frenz n family for amazing food and service.

The waiters and staff and very curtious and friendly. Hope to visit again shortly.... :)

My 100th review had to be special so I chose Marriott. The most special and spectacular place I have been this year 'twice' and both the times the experience was heavenly.
JW Marriott is more than a delight for all dessert fanatics. They have fewer Indian sweets and more of Western desserts. They look so appealing and pretty that you can't resist to try all of them. It does not end here, they have seperate waffle and icecream counter and one can order any waffle of their choice.
Coming to the buffet, they have a variety of starters but the main course has very less veg option. They should bring variety in Veg course also there should be a complimentary mocktail or soft drinks.
Coming to the ambience the place features a blend of modern yet warm aesthetics with white sophisticated wall, silver bells and blue sofa catching most of your attention.
The buffet price is high but if compared to the variety of food they offer.. It's worth it :)

Been there for two times.one is for celebrating our anniversary and another is for celebrating the jw marriott kolkata's first anniversary.first time the experience was great and next time it has become greater.

Now coming to their food,they offered wide spread of indian as well as continental dishes.their kebabs,fries and various noodles,burgers and many more were awesome to test.street food counter,pasta counter,noodles counter,salads,waffle counter was awesome.

And here comes the best part,their Dessert.it was like more than heaven.more than 30types of indian and continental desserts are there including pie,sweets,cakes,kheer,ice cream,baked tart and many more.

In our second visit,there were unlimited mocktails and beers also.these was only for their anniversary celebration otherwisr they do not serve any complimentary drink.you have to pay for it.that day they had lamb beef and many other dishes and many flavours of sangria in their special menu.

Now coming to the hospitality,they have very nice staffs as well as chefs.staffs' behaviour was also quite good.ambience was pretty.over all it was 5/5 from me.thumbs upüëç

Worst food! I didn‚Äôt expect this kind of food from a 5 star rated hotel restaurant.
First of all the menu as shown here is not fully served in the buffet.
Items like chicken(murgir jhol), butter nun, noodles are worst of worst. Further the desserts are not at all good. If I compare it with barbeque nation, barbeque is way ahead in all ways. So why should one shell so much of money? Another part is that service is really poor. They have calculated and limited guests for a session, then why can‚Äôt they tackle the guest‚Äôs order? They somehow seem not at all interested to serve you, it is shown from their faces. I asked for fresh lime soda which they served without declaring it will be charged extra, trust me I have never had such a crap fresh lime in my life ( that too at a price of 250 bucks).
And yes, worth to mention, they serve only one item of kebab.
The most annoying part is after an hour they start asking you to leave saying they are closing!
I would not at all recommend this to anyone. If you want to have good food, go somewhere else.

In main course, excessive rose water has been used in gosht biriyani and in the mutton gravy mutton was hard. Deserts were ok.

'JW Marriott' - I guess the name is enough to set your expectations to the zenith and I am no exception. Went there for my birthday lunch where I was ushered with a complimentary birthday cake and warm wishes. Big thumbs up to their customer service. The stunning decor and the pleasant ambience promises a fine dining experience. Now, coming to the food, the buffet spread is eclectic. Worth every single penny you spend. Such variety presented with absolute finesse while the taste is heart melting. I'm not much of dessert person, however, the dessert segment stole my heart. I think, they should just quicken the service of the live counters and they'll ace it. Cheers! üòä

But the best part was the Desserts ,they were simply superb ,likes of Besan ka laddu, chocolate muse ,cheese carrot cake, baked yoghart etc . Overall experience is good ,i would like visit there again, and will be hoping to get some very good food there ,

First of all, I have been pretty lazy in writing this review. I had been to JWM for a buffet lunch with 14 colleagues. Probably there wasn't too many positive things to write about...
There is a live counter where you can order food but delivery can happen when you are having your dessert! So that reminds me of the good things... And that undoubtedly is the dessert! There is indeed quite a bit of options available. Don't try the cheap ice-cream..there are better options under pastry, sweets, etc.
There are a few starters but not much you may like. Same goes for the main course. There is no complimentary mocktail or cold drinks. Overall not a good place for lunch. In fact there are much better options available at a cheaper price in other restaurants.

Yesterday midnight went to JW Marriott for coffee and this is probably one of the worst service I have faced in a five star category. When I asked for cookies along with the coffee which they normally serve , the staff stated that the cookies were finished and he was trying to arrange them in some time. Needless to say the cookies never came to our table. They did not even have the basic courtesy to make any information regarding this. This hasn't been the first time we experienced such an uncourteous service from the staff, the last time we went for dinner,we faced the same kind of service. After ordering the food, when we enquired about it being too late, the staff was clueless. This unethical service and unprofessional behaviour cannot be excused. The JW management surely needs to take this matter into consideration.

As we all know the Marriott offers an immense spread of delicacies from a variety of cuisines in its lunch buffet. It's almost impossible to try and taste all there is to offer. The quality of food is good even though the taste might not be lip smacking. Specially the non veg North Indian section seemed a bit bland for my taste. There are pasta and noodles counter where they make your choice of noodles or pasta infront of you on request. The noodles which I ordered was really tasty and full of egg and chicken chunks. The main focus obviously is the dessert section and it does leave a dessert lover like me drooling for more. They had Bengali desserts as well like payesh, Sandesh, patisapta, kalakand, jalebi, malpoa, roshogolla. They sandesh, kalakand and payesh were really tasty. Patisapta wrapping was a bit chewy and didn't taste like patisapta. I won't be able to name all that was there but the dessert section was obviously much better. Hope they make their starters and main course equally good considering the pocket pinch of this buffet.

An iconic hotel on the EM Bypass, sharing its presence with other hospitality landmarks like ITC Sonar and upcoming ITC Royal Bengal. Kolkata always had its share of uber luxury hotels from the British era Like The Grand and The Park. But this new age spurt of hotels probably signal the reemergence of this city as an economic powerhouse, and the need to cater to a fast moving clientele of Business travellers who demands the highest level of service.
The lunch spread was magnificient and had a wide array of cusine from the traditional Mughal dishes, the Bengali favourites like shorshe macher jhol to the continental dishes. The desert selection is especially praiseworthy and sure to increase an inch or so on your waist region.
The architecture is fantastic and stands out on its own.
As one expects from an establishment of this calibre, the staff were extremely warm and courteous.
Definitely will visit again in future.

Certainly the most disappointing experience one could get from the Marriott group. The team in Kolkata needs to work from scratch on hospitality and personalized service. Honestly, I don't have a single compliment to offer to the team here.

I went for the lunch buffet at the JW Kitchen. As per my experience, restaurants usually have one attendant for every 4-5 tables depending on the rush and level of patronage. Here there were none.¬†

On being seated, only 2 questions were asked: "Water - regular or mineral?" and "Buffet or A la Carte?" That's all. Usually when selecting a buffet, the attendant introduces you to the buffet and gives a heads-up on what's included and not. Here, forget an introduction, we were not even asked to make ourselves comfortable.

So as per service: 0 on 10

Food: Ugh... An entire counter on chaats for lunch. Perfect.¬†
Only 1 choice on soups, dessets with no egg-less cakes and practically all 2-3 vegetables with cauliflower. Honestly, a Sher-e-Punjab has better food.

Overall, apart from the comfortable seats nothing was pleasant about this place.

Certainly never visiting this place again.

Yes it is a five star and the ambience is awesome bt the food is not up to the mark. The kebabs in the buffet was very dry and tasted burnt. The biryani's mutton was also not well cooked. Only the desert section was good.1.5 i have rated for its decoration and the desserts. You can find more better place than it.

Went there with a friend on a Friday. They offer an amazing spread at just 1250 per person which is reasonable considering the quality and variety of food offered. The starters and main course sections are good but the best is the dessert section. We loved the mud pudding and the chocolate praline. They have live pasta and noodles counter too. The ambience is perfect for dining with your loved ones. Overall a great experience. The only thing is they don't offer any complementary drink in the lunch buffet, other than that it's probably one of the best buffets in town :)

Visited JW Kitchen a few days back for their dinner buffet. The food was just amazing without doubt. Outstanding spread of desserts. Ambiance was very soothing. Their service was excellent. Special thanks to Krishanu Bhattacharyya and Subhadeep Malakar for their superb service. They were always there for everything we needed.
Overall, it was an excellent experience.

Nice spread of desserts.Few more dishes should be added like prawns and fishes.Gosht dishes needs more care.Expected more variety in Indian starters.There should be some welcome drink.Food should be warm as I tasted food that were not warm.

JW kitchen was a much awaited place in my bucket list...visited for a birthday treat..JW kitchen is simply  a foodies paradise...not only it is a delight for the palate but also a treat for the eyes....they have wide varieties of Indian and English starters....they have a live Chinese and Indian counters... They have a huge collections of frozen items...the cheese table will surely catch one's eye...now coming to the desert section it's just a Disneyland for any desert lovers...they serves both indian and English deserts...coming to the interior decor ,what to comment when it is JW Marriott!!!!!!.

As the name suggests, Marriott was supposed to exceed all the expectations but unfortunately it didn't. Priced at a rate of 1259 approximately with taxes made us overwhelmed thinking that it's quite reasonable for a 5 star hotel.. However, it wasn't that exciting!
We went for a team lunch and we got our reservation done a week before and it was booked at 1.30 slot. We reached at 1.30 sharp and received a warm welcome. But what happened next made us quite upset. We asked the receptionist for our table and to our surprise we received a table that was totally receiving the scorching sunrays. It was excessively hot and was too uncomfortable. We asked for a change but they were not able to do so. However we adjusted ourselves there although all of us were excessively uncomfortable. Since we pre-booked it a week ago, this kinda behavior was quite unexpected. 

Coming to the food, mostly it was filled with salads and breads with very less option for chicken. Personally most of us from the group were strictly anti-pork and anti-beef family and it was really tough for us to adjust. The dishes were mostly bland and tasteless. Most of the chicken preparation was tasteless. Biriyani was good from the main course. Mutton curry was absolutely nonsense and all the pieces had bones and were very hard. There was no option for prawns and no complimentary drinks which was another disaster. Desserts there were loads of options but hardly few of them could reach our expectations. 

Another horrible experience was the waiters kept looking us to finish our lunch by 3 as the time is getting over. My question here lies, since we got the table after 1.30 how could you even ask for finishing off the lunch by 3?

Management is excessively poor and needs improvement. It wasn't a good idea to have team lunch there and won't be revisiting the place again!

I love the brand JW Mariott, and I had to try out their food. So, I made sure to head out for lunch with my folks. Pleasantly surprising was, it was the 1st anniversary of JW Mariott in Kolkata. Along with the brand, we celebrated its 1st anniversary with food and cocktails at JW Kitchen.
Though I am a food goblet, yet it is practically impossible to try out everything in a single lunch. My favourite was the cheese section, where they have an international selection of cheese. The prawn cocktails and the salads are really great and you should not miss it. I literally had 3 plates of different selection of breads and salads. I think I would go back one day only for the desserts, which had the low sugar carrot cakes, apple pie and a wide array of selection. I ended my trip with an espresso with the hazelnut cake.
The hospitality was touching. The chef, the manager and other employees made sure to visit the tables personally and find out if the guests were comfortable with everything.

For the price, it‚Äôs more than worth it, I recommend you must visit JW Kitchen once, for that fine-dining experience. You go to a place, not just for the food, but for the experience and I could see that sense of relaxation in my parent‚Äôs smile. The brand stays loyal to its name and principles in every sense.

The kitchen serves  lavishing sumptuous food in the buffet menu .  I did love the continental part of the food.  The starter's were tasty but wasn't appropriately warm enough to taste tastier. The desert table was well decorated with fine looking deserts ,  i just felt that a few of them were too sweet to be eaten.  The ambience was impeccable with a warm welcome from their end but the table service could have been better as i had to order and recall the steward for  the same drink thrice for a repeat.

Best buffet in town.You won't be able to try everything because the spread is endless.The highlights for me were the prosciutto wrapped cucumbers, the numerous flavoured sangrias and the dessert bar.By the time I reached desserts I was so full I couldn't try even half the stuff,but whatever I tried was absolutely top notch.They make a mean biryani too and their excellent service deserves special mention!

Tried their breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet. One of the best buffets in town at the moment. That explains why they have a minimum of one week waiting period. The breakfast has a lot of healthy juice options starting from carrot juice, beetroot, lemon. There‚Äôs the usual English breakfast options like eggs, bacon, toast, hash brown potatoes, beans. The Indian options include dosa, Bengali breakfast items. Parathas. Nothing is complete without a sweet note so they serve cold coffee, pancakes and waffles amongst other sweeter options. Lunch included a variety of starter options like kebabs, soup, Italian options like garlic bread, variety of chaats, sandwiches, salads and cheeses. Their main course included biriyani, noodles, Chinese preparation of chicken fish, along with pasta, Indian curries. However, the star of the show always happens to be the dessert section. They have over 30 odd desserts to offer and they keep bringing in new things once a lot is over. They have a combination of both Indian and western desserts that‚Äôll leave you speechless and spellbound. It‚Äôs like Disneyland for dessert lovers. Every meal ends on a feel good note and we come out all smiles.

So, as I'm giving a 3.0 rating, the bar can't proceed the warm yellow hue signalling that maybe all wasn't well at such a classy place. Well, it's true.

The Marriott name is a reputed one and so I was wondering that they would indeed carry a lot of weight on their shoulders to live up to the name. It couldn't be so.

I visited this place for lunch buffet (sans liquor) with my friend yesterday, (10th Nov. 2017) on the occasion of my birthday, and we both agreed that it was hardly worth the price we paid ( ‚Çπ2500/- for 2, inclusive of tax).

What we didn't eat: noodles, pasta, pita bread+hummus, sandwich, North Indian veg. dishes., chaat. We ate every other thing in minimal amounts (including all the desserts). 

Before listing what we disliked, I'd like to tell the pros:

1. People mostly go for the brand value, I did too. The decor was up to the mark. Shiny floors, sparkling glasses, clean cutlery. The basics are where they would score full marks. 

2. Humble staff.

3. Murgh Biriyani, Mutton Kosha. I can't describe how exquisite the taste was.

4. Mushroom Stroganoff. Brilliant, in one word.

5. Mud Cake.

Now the cons (from where should I start!!!):

1. I had called for table reservation at 2pm the day before we were supposed to go. It went fine. On the day I visited, there was no table to offer. 

2. They lie about table reservations and this is one of the biggest cons.

3. The food isn't extraordinary. Don't fall for that trap, the food is kinda okay. The mixed herbs chicken was BAD. It was chewy and a tad little undercooked. The beef salad- the meat wasn't tender. Salads were soggy, unfortunately. 

4. Waiters (even though quite humble) didn't exactly offer to fill up the glasses when we were finished drinking. I wonder why! Also, I wonder if you would like it if waiters stand exactly beside you as you eat because I didn't. (Maybe, it's just me(?)!)

5. Desserts- too many in number, but some of them tasted kinda the same. There's nothing innovative in having 5 kinds of chocolate cakes, 2 kinds of chocolate mousse, 2 kinds of chocolate chip tarts, etc. Also: NO CHEESECAKE (this was a major disappointment)

I expected something of 5-star value but this was an ordinary experience. Disappointed.

JW Kitchen-a foodie's paradise. A one of a kind experience. Not only it is a delight for the palate but also a treat for eyes.
Describing the Interior could be difficult. Please see the pictures and one should experience it.
This place serves north Indian starters and buffet; chinese and continental are available at live counters and also at buffet. The north Indian stuff is very good and then goes the live counters. The kebabs are succulent and full of flavours. In main course mutton curry and biryani are worth mentioning. Pasta and Indian chaat at live counters are also very good. Now  coming to desserts, they offer a large variety of pastries, brownies, custards and ice creams and many more. Taste wise, 90% of the desserts were very good.
Service is to look for. They provide you with five star service and hospitality. 
The cons are that they serve no prawn in starter or main course and no welcome drink. It is not expected from a place charging 1250 per head. Nevertheless, it is worth to visit the place for great ambience, good food and hospitality and wonderful opportunity to click picturesüòâ

Located in EM Bypass, this notable building cannot go unnoticed. Firstly I would like to point out that it's great initiative by JW Management to have this buffet at such an affordable price. This helps many to fulfill their dream of dining in a 5 Star Hotel.
The place has a very positive vibe about it & the staff is very good & helpful.
So what I had there
#Starters
*Cajun Spiced Chicken
*Honey Chilli Chicken (Strongly Recommended)
*Kasundi Mahi Tikka
*Cheese Ball
#Main Course
*Gosht Biriyani (Mutton)
*Lal Mass (Mutton)
*Butter Naan
*Chicken Chettinad
*Subz Biriyani
*Palak Paneer
*Steamed Rice
*Dal Makhani
*Yellow Dal
*Mix. Veg.
Apart from all this there were different types of Soups, Salads, Breads,Cheese & Pickle on offer.
#Desserts
So this place serves one of the best desserts in town
Pro tip:Eat the main course less & concentrate more on the desserts. From Red Velvet cake to Indian Desserts to Ice-Cream they serve it all.

Dining at a 5 star almost makes you feel like a royal and JW Kitchen is no exception. The experience starts from the entry gate itself when the entire staff treats you like a celebrity. By the time you survive the larger than life decor, exteriors and interiors, you are guided to your table in the restaurant. A buffet that extends from north pole to south pole leaves you confused as in where to start from, but we must mention, what an extended menu! The menu has an array of cuisines like Appetizers and Salads, Soups, Rice and breads, Pastas and Risotto, Sandwiches, Burgers and Wraps, Local Speciality, Asian mains, Indian Mains, Western mains and Desserts. You can get the complete menu from Zomato, but the complete menu mentioned there might not be available, a dish or two here and there. The good part is they experiment and make slight changes in the menu everyday. They have around 30 items for desserts, and we bet you cannot try all of them in one day. The twists and turns they give to Indian mithai is commendable. A must mention is the courteous staff, they just make you meal extra special with the service.Do reserve a table well in advance or you might not get a table.

I am falling short of words to describe my experience at this place. Be it about the spread of food or the ambience or the taste and texture of the foods i got to experience there, is absolutely outstanding. My last few outings to any 5 star hotel (they were mainly in different cities other than Kolkata) where i had attended lunch buffet, fell a bit short of what i was expecting in their food. JW Kitchen fulfilled that craving. I would be back soon!!
Coming to the staffs, they are very warm and courteous, ambience is a bit squeaky as people flock to this grand place and keeps it abuzz. Seating arrangement in the lounge is very spacious, furnitures are simple yet appealing. Now coming to the food, where should I start describing it ..... this place has got everything. North Indian, Bengali, Mughlai, Continentals, Orientals, Middle east.... you name it!
Their buffet spread is huge!! Live counters are a treat to watch. Dessert section did amaze me as well with its spread. Chicken Biryani and the various salads in the continental section made me the most happy at that time!! I was like a kid in a candy land! :P
Being a foodie by habit i had to taste each and everything (except the roasted beef). Finishing the whole affair off with a jar (yes... i would call it a jar!! :D) of freshly squeezed (orange+pineapple+ginger), left me satiated
But I really wish they had more options in their starters. Crispy potato, dahi kurkure and crispy veggies were a name a few and among the non veg starters there were just Drums of heaven.
Nonetheless....Cant wait to visit this place again!!! See you soon JW Kitchen!! :)

A great place with some variety of great food.. JW Kitchen will offer you much more than other star hotels in the city at a really affordable price.. You will get a chance to taste variety of salads , starters , main course and ofcourse... some of the best mouth watering desserts. The price includes unlimited drinks too. Make sure to taste the red wine drink ( forgot the actual name , sorry for that ) along with the dessert. The ambience was superb.. all the waiters / waitress were really helpful.. they even helped me out regarding tasting the perfect combinations of food. Its really difficult to taste all those mouth watering dishes in just 1 visit.. so looking forward for my next visit in next month.. A suggestion to all.. make a reservation before coming.. I was lucky enough to get a table booked in 1 day advance...

Though there are huge variety of food specially desert ,I find the taste of the food very ordinary.... There was no tinge of being a 5star food over there....and the variety of food items in the starters and main course were not that huge,though I really liked the pasta.....as I went for a weekday buffet it cost me 1250rs including taxes but if you want to order any drink you will be charged extra...

Well let's start with the quintessential service thats the demarcation of a starred hotel ..... not up to Marriot standards.... lost waiters ... flabbergasted chefs ... as if someone had stolen their wallets ... though not rude ...but with customers wandering.. rarely did i see complete service .. like they'd ask you what u want but wudnt bring it to ur table..... courteous if and when they attend to you.

Food.... ample choices ... from across the globe ... so no worries there ... live kitchens need to be manned better. It's not the trade mark mughlai ... but their Rogan Josh beats any restaurant in kolkata boasting of authencity on the same.

Saw an amazing array of cheese and pasta salads ... made my day.....

Awesome biryani .... very high standard of mutton ( something that's fast fading everywhere) hatsoff for keeping 3 main course mutton dishes in Indian.

Desserts .... well that's always top in these 5 star do's
In love with the Apple and blueberry tart. The blueberry crumble and the dark chocolate tart ( it was proper bitter dark chocolate with a layer of mousse and awesome glossy ganache on top)

Overall am tempted to give 4 stars but would refrain only to request better staff and courtesy management. Other than that the food for the price offered is nothing short of exemplary.. good service and better choices made available to guests would easily add many more stars.

Have just been here recently and I'm mighty impressed by the ambience, being a star hotel which is not very surprising. The restaurant is on the ground floor and very spacious and open. Went there for dinner but by the looks of it, it gets flooded by daylight. The staff were helpful, courteous and friendly. The food was good. As it was a buffet, options were varied but with limited choice in starters. The live counters were fast and the chefs there customised the dishes to your taste. But the best was saved for the last as the dessert spread was very impressive and varied. You'll be spoilt for choices.

Despite being from the same city, we checked into¬† JW Marriott, Kolkata for couple of days in July 2017 for a mini vacation. That's when we were introduced to their amazing in house¬† restaurant JW kitchen. It is quite a common sight to capture celebrities there. During our stay, we were lucky enough to meet the handsome and talented designer Mr. Manish Malhotra.

Ambience - One gets easily mesmerized by the ambience. The interior is done royally and tastefully. The height of the roof gives a feeling of enormity and copious amount of space. View from the glass panes on the sides take one's¬† breath away. Tables are well spread out. The live counters are forever buzzing¬† with activities. The crowd mix is quite interesting here.¬†

Food- we tried out the buffet meals during lunch and breakfast. The spread is elaborate for both ,specially the desserts. Breakfast had a range of options. From the south Indian dosas to the continental bread - bacon - cheese to the bengali luchi aloo, it was all there. For lunch, the live counters whipped up pasta, pizza, chowmein and many more dishes . The spread had kabab¬† and fried starters,biriyani, mutton and fish gravy among other items. But what stood out during both the meal times was the forever crowded dessert counter. It had close to twenty options and each one outdid the other. Be it the hallway or the mousse or Sandesh, one was tempted to taste every single offering. During¬† weekends, the counter which is located very near to the entrance area gets so crowded that it starts resembling a mini market. Since we were staying in the hotel, we also had to get food for our then - 18 month old toddler customized. Chef was extremely accommodating and co-operative. For dinner, we tried fish and chips through room service and it was awesome. Food was tasty, healthy and covered a lavish spectrum of options. Quality and hygiene, as expected, was well maintained.

Service - Right from the entrance to the front desk to the restaurant, JW Marriott maintains very high standard of service in every department. Restaurant staffs are extremely warm, helpful and courteous. We had a baby chair arranged for every meal that we visited without even having to ask for it.. Between my husband and I, one of us had to stay near the baby most of the times. One of the lady staffs attended to us throughout the duration to ensure that we don't have to get up much for food. She took my instructions and got the item sent to our table. They are really raising the bars of hospitality here.

Pricing - Considering that it is a five star property, the restaurant having a wide range of offerings, quality being of the highest measure, I would say that the pricing is one of their USPs. The lavish¬† buffet option is highly affordable. Ala Carta options are slightly on the expensive side but having eaten at a chain of high profile restaurants I feel it's still not extravagant.

Overall, this is a fantastic place for lunch or dinner with family and friends. Couples get to have a quiet corner as well. One gets to experience a beautiful ambience, picturesque views, yummylicious food and all this at a very affordable price range. It is recommended to reserve beforehand since they run packed houses even on weekdays.

In a nutshell, my rating for the restaurant will be as follows -


Food 4.5
Ambience - 4.5
Service - 5
Pricing - 4.5

Overall - 4.6

We dined for dinner on Diwali night. We ordered Mutton Rogan Josh , Chicken Breast, Dal and Soup. The food was pathetic. Every dish was made just for the heck of it. On top of it the service was way below standards. We had to wait for even a glass of water , which was being served by waiters by hand without tray. Icing on the cake was the reluctant and ignorant attitude of the Floor Manager Mr. Prasoon.
I hope Marriott does take serious review of the Kitchen and Service Staff at Marriott, Kolkata.

From starters to buffet dey have awesme range of variety. They also have three live counters, noodles counter and spaghetti counter was awesome. But i personally think starters range could hv been bettr. All the foods were taste delicious. They have widest spread of dessert one can ever imagine. Desserts look so fancy and unique. But they don't taste as fancy as they look like. But I am totally satisfied after visiting this restaurant.

One of the best buffets in Kolkata. Live noodle, spaghetti/pasta counter, and desserts are worth special mention. Out of the world "Potol Posto". Proficient and cordial staff, perfect ambiance for a five-star dining facility.  I liked the taste of almost every item except the main course fish. It was a mustard item that felt like Pangas instead of Bhetki (or even Basa). There could be better variety in starters but I guess the live counter items and other special offerings in the cheese and dessert section balanced it out. Apart from the buffet we also ordered for Mojito and I must say it was one of the best-blended cocktails I have ever had in Kolkata. All in all a great experience at a superb price point.

Ambience: 5/5. Awesome. 
Comfort : 3/5. For chairs which are tough with 1baby and 1 kid with. 
Hospitality :4/5 . Good enough. No complaints. 
Now the food. Kind of Dissatisfied . No mutton/ no mutton biriyani. Only mutton keema was there which was not so good. So many chicken items. But my father dsnt like chiken. So he was dissatisfied. 
Other food items are more or less good enough. Desserts were very good but i cant comment much coz i couldn't taste /eat as we had to leave fast. Yes. I  regreting now. 

Price: high. Its worth it if more mutton and other north Indian items r put.

The buffet is indeed awesome. The live Noodle counter,live spaghetti counter and risotto counter was awesome indeed. The starter range could have been a bit better but they made up in the sumptuous desert section which was amazing. This is surely the widest spread of deserts you can ever imagine. The staff were welcoming. Loved the experience to the core.

Went for the saturday night buffet and must say the spread is moderate but the dishes are really high on flavor and theres a bit and more for every pallette. I loved their counters especially the pasta and noodle ones and last but not the least the byte sized eclairs were really the worthy taste i rested my meal with. Beautiful meal all in all!!

JW Kitchen by JW Marriott Kolkata is the best place to have a buffet in Kolkata. We went to celebrate our 5th Anniversary there and it was a grand affair.

The ambience of JW Marriott is beyond comparison . The buffet spread was huge and we started at 12.30 pm.

The starters were delicious and the cuisines included Continental and Indian. The salads were delicious.The pork sliders were mesmerizing. The cheese especially Brie was out of the world.

The main courses included Indian, Continental and Chinese items. The live counter for the Chinese and the continental section were dishing out delicious¬† food items like Spaghetti, Squid with vegetables etc..
Special mention has to be made for the laal mansh or mutton curry. I have never tasted mutton curry this good in a restaurant.

The famed dessert section of JW kitchen left us spellbound. Every item were delectable. I was surprised by the carrot cake's decadent flavor. I forgot to have the ice-cream though.

Special mention has to be made to the impeccable service of JW Kitchen. Plates were cleaned at regular intervals and they served us with a smile. When they came know about our anniversary,they made a cake for us. We were touched by this gesture. 

All in all, a great experience and I will visit again.

It was a fairly good experience for me. I went there with my colleagues. Excellent decor and ambience. Cordial staff. Service was bang on.
Now lets come to the most important subject: FOOD

We went there for a buffet lunch and this place by far provides the best buffet in the city. They give you a wide range of choices across different cuisines.

For starters they had 2 veg dishes, but being strict environmentalists, we went for the non veg starters which had a juicy chicken tikka and chilly fish.
Next came the biriyani. The biryani here is very different from any other biryani brand in kolkata. It is very light and you can have a lot of that and it gives you a hit with subtle flavours popping in your mouth. The mutton curry (lal maas) was succulent and tender. We also tried some pork salami. I would say it was decent enough. They also provide live counters for chinese and continental dishes. They will customize the type of noodle or macaroni as per your wish and deliver it to your table. They also have a live counter for the Indian Chaat and one can make a quick stop over at this counter if one needs to freshen up their taste buds. Apart from these there were also counters that had dry fruits and different types of cheese.

Now we come to the section which was my highlight for the day. DESSERTS. One table had the traditional bengali sweets. Rosogolla, sandesh, etc. and even mud pie. The other one had cakes and pastries. I would recommend people to save atleast half of their appetite for desserts because once you start, you would just not stop. Its loaded with chocolate, be it the mousse, the truffles, even the cup cakes. They just explode in your mouth and the rest of the chocolate just melts. Felt awesome, diabetics beware. You would also find some raspberry, pineapple and mango flavoured items and about 6 varieties of ice cream.
They quality of food is flawless.
Needless to say that we had a great time.

Happened to visit this place on my son's birthday. Getting reservation was a big deal so booked in advance. The look and the feel is identical to the other star hotels. The buffet lunch is very elaborate. ..I don't remember all the items neither do I care for stuff I don't want to eat. So in a jist we were shown a comfortable seating by an extremely courteous hostess (the usual star hotel customer service ) ...the decor is matching the coffee shop genre the only interesting part was the glass architecture for the roof which makes it look very bright lots of light...now regarding food I need to sing ' where do I begin '...ok plentiful of starters fish fingers chicken kebabs babycorn mushroom some more veg stuff..a salad counter a sandwich counter some excellent veg and non veg salads... two varieties of cold cut chicken and pork..lots of international cheese. .gruyere ,feta , rye , cheddar. ..a counter for veg tid bits khakhra fafra dhokla some more served with different chutneys. ..live counter for pastas veg and non veg , oriental noodles veg n non veg , chhole tikki papdi chaat live counter. Now it's a bit tiring but if u like to dig into everything at one go this is the place. Maincourse chicken fish mutton didn't see seafood. I could smell biryani somewhere but was lazy to walk the aisles to find the stuff. ..veg also there was a plethora of paneer pulao dal makhni whatnot. ...finally dessert....that's like never-ending a big sized table full of cupcakes, pastries, meringues, pies , souffles, gulab jamun , sandesh , some kheer. ..it doesn't end here if u still have more energy left in you there's an icecream parlour a part of the dessert menu wherein they make sundaes fudges with innumerable toppings and flavours of icecream. I took the pain of jotting this today as its my 70th review and I wanted a big one so this is the Magnum one. Damage was 1200 a head that point in time I've never visited after that occasion in March. I'm not an extensive menu person but if ur then this is the place. .the price justifies the enormous buffet. Oh they sang Happy Birthday for my son also gave a complimentary chocolate sponge cake at the table and gave assorted chocolates packed in a gift box.Here comes the customer delight part ...of course a standard of excellence for a five star restaurant. Really appreciate their effort. So foodies go ahead and enjoy some quality time in a nice environment with good food and client service.With

On the more expensive side of restaurants, but the attentiveness and the food certainly makes up for it.The combination of food, environment and staff make the guests comfortable and respected.Hat tip to Subhadeep  for living it up for us..This restaurant is a national treasure let alone a local eatery.

Disgusting food quality. The pasta sauces were not good. Comparing other Marriotts across the country and abroad it was not up to the mark.The menu is very ordinary not worth the money. The salad counter had all the dressings but no one to suggest how to make a good one. When asked about beef and lamb.. said we did a market study and people don't want to touch any food associated with beef. My question is which market did you target? You can't say this in a place like kolkata where irrespective of any religion people do eat beef pork. It's just continental.

A visit to JW Kitchen was long due.Today I finally got a chance to visit JW Marriott for a weekday lunch.We were welcomed with namaste.Even the glass walls and high ceilings and elegant sofa make it one of the best looking hotels I have visited.Though the ambience is really pretty and decor is grand,the main point i.e.the food wasn't anything extraordinary or remarkable. Surprisingly even the service was not upto the mark.I would prefer Barbeque nation over JW Kitchen anyday considering the quality of food served.I agree the spread was too huge for me to even name all the dishes but apart from the dessert section,I didn't find anything else appetising enough.Firstly I expect more than two non veg starter and atleast one prawn dish for a buffet spread of 1250rs.There are basically 4live counters of pasta,noodles,chats and waffles.But the person serving us didn't even care to explain about that.Moreover we had to repeatedly tell them to clear up the table and the used plate which is not expected from a place like JW Marriott.
Coming to the main course,the biriyani and the chicken curry dish neither did it look good nor was it anything close to delicious.Only the malai fish tikka and chicken in chili beans in the entire spread tasted good.You can try out different varieties of cheese and make ur own salad which I found really interesting.Finally when all disappointed I reached the dessert section I was awed.It was a spread of almost 25 types of desserts starting from cupcakes to mousse to bengali sweets to tart.Every bit of it was enjoyed by us.If there any reason why I would recommend anyone to visit this place would be its ambience,decor and wonderful dessert collection which I don't think anyone can overlook.
The total bill came upto 3750rs for 3ppl including GST.
P.S.-Since it was my sister's birthday they had arranged for a complimentary cake which was really a sweet gesture.
Overall it was a good experience but nothing mind blowing.

The ambience was amazing.. We went for a dinner buffet and it was really enough for us. I hardly tasted any Indian dish. I was mostly plated towards Asian and continental Cusine. The turkey along with cheese was awesome and the prawns with me you was phenomenal. And yes just don't miss the cookies and desert.

We were much excited to try out this place (been talk of the town for sometime). We dropped by on saptami and decided to have our dinner right away. Slightly disappointed to see their non veg section not having chicken and the entire experience could have been a little better if few more veg sides was accompanied by breads. (Had a vegan with us) Overall, good ambiance and fantastic staff :) Hope our next visit is much better! 
*Loved their paneer and kosha manghsho*

Hi Mariott ! Thanks for the wonderful feeling and satiated tummy!
And the pocket friendly buffet pricing with the luxury appeal!

This is a rather late review had been there on my birthday in July,17. The seat was given as per my request along the glass wall but since it was evening had not much to see. Now the seats or the two seaters are really small for people having dinner. it would work well if you are having a small meal.

The person who assisted us for the day was very warm and helpful sorry for forgetting his name.
Now coming to food:
Starer : 4 types including chicken wings,paneer kebab,chicken kebab,and fish .(if i am not wrong)
Salads : huge selection with hummus, mayos,dips,viniger dipped veggies ,cocktail prawns ,lamb,chicken ,pita breads as well totally impressive !
Chaat counter : i love chats but when you have so much to try I never wanted the chats but the array was good!
Pasta &¬† noodles live counter : my husband tried the noodles and i went for pasta in white sauce with my choice of toppings with garlic bread...... now i can come back for the pasta again and again and again.........it was creamy cheesy and all that you can think of for a great pasta.
Main course: mutton biriyani,dal makhni,steamed rice,roti to order,cajun spice potato dal bati churma,mutton rara,paneer kadhai, veg biriyani,i dont remember if there was any fish or prawn items in the main course and not aware of all the veg items.
mutton biriyani,rara ghost,dal makhani, and paneer was perfect even the dal bati churma was great and made in pure ghee! though not a huge array like some other buffet places yet the long spread before the main course satiates you.
Special mention to soup of the day and jasmine rice made to perfection.

Now the huge Dessert Spread!!!
I am partial to desserts and this was another reason which drew me to Marriott but I was thoroughly disappointed. we went on the lets say second shift of dinner at 8:30 and so by the time we reached buffet counter it was savagely ransacked and scattered.I mean how can you hurt your deserts !!!
Not much was left and even what was left looked awful post the savage attack. I loved the mud pie, took chocolate spread with it (chocolate sauce could be more chocolaty) added nuts and choco chips and was happy. tried few bits and pieces of the left over pastries they were good but not great to that extent but must say the spread¬† is too good.
One suggestion for Marriott please keep some guys near the dessert section so that they save the counter from such attacks and much of the pastry would be left in better condition to appease the late comers like me.¬†
Finally pardon me for not posting pics i am a bit shy when it comes to clicking pics as they never turn out well!

Thanks again Marriott we would definitely keep coming back and next would like to attend your sunday brunch!

Dining here, has been on my Bookmark since this heavenly place got inaugurated. The decor was undoubtedly so beautiful that it made me gasp when i stepped into the illuminated hallway with gigantic blue armchair against grey carpets.

We had visited JW Marriott kitchen on Nabami which is a grand day for Bengali's to feast on 'mangsho'. Therefore going for a Buffet menu was our obvious choice. After waiting for 1 hr 20 minutes, we were taken to our table.

The food however wasn't as great as the decor. For starters they didn't really have a long and exhaustive menu as other Buffet restaurants have to offer. The chaat section was impressive since i had never expected Papri Chat or Aloo Chat to be served in a 7 star restaurant.

The main course however was banal. The Biriyani was a huge disappointment. They were no other dish splendid enough to worth mentioning. The shrimp and prawn noodles were good though, since they had garnished it well with veggies.

BUT BUT BUT
The desert was top notch. It was simply finger licking good. It was so delicious that i couldn't help myself to crave for more and ended up consuming 3 whole plates.

The moment one enters this hotel, it is inevitable to get dazzled by the grandeur of the interior. The dinner buffet of the restaurant reflects that same splendour and exceptional quality of the hotel. We not only got a widespread range of cuisines, both Indian and International, but also a number of the dishes surprised us with their deliciousness. The pasta, the jasmine rice, thai soup and chicken gravy and the Lebanese portions hugely impressed the foodie in me. However, the best part of the buffet comes at last, that is the dessert. The options are many as the wonderful pastries, pies and indian sweets are enough to fill the appetite as well as the heart. For me this dinner was sumptuous and memorable.

Well, it was a much awaited place in my bucket list and I was totally satisfied after visiting this restaurant! Starting from the ambience till the main course, everything was fantastic, especially the starters, be it the Mexican, Chinese, salads, chaat, each and every dish was delicious and filling. The main course had mutton biriyani and it was good, nothing extra ordinary though. Coming to the dessert, it looked all fancy, but tasted just fine. Not as fancy as they looked. The cheese cake and tart were not that great . The dessert menu can be improved, rest, their buffet spread is actually amazing and commendable! Also, a big thank you for the complementary birthday cake!!

These People know their job so well.üôÇ
My maiden visit to JW kitchen was delicious!
Opted for the weekday lunch buffet.
The ambience is an example of modern architecture pouring with posh and elegance!
The staff were super courteous,attentive and well versed in their job.Our plates were changed very swiftly and glasses filled timely.
From the moment we entered if felt like we were transferred to a different world....with the huge storm with rain going on outside that could be seen through the glass walls and the never ending spread in front of us...life couldn't get betterüòã
Coming to the food their were several sections consisting of salads,cheese,dips,breads,north Indian dishes,Bengali dishes,continental section,Chinese live counter, sea food live counter,live pasta counter,chat counter,fruits section,papad section,the desert section had two parts the Bengali sweets and fancy ones like moraines,cupcakes, pastries,rice treats,puddings,custards and many more.
The Lal Maas was too soft and delicious accompanied perfectly with the murgh biriyani.
We ordered spaghetti in white sauce accompanied with squid tossed with veggies from the live counters.Both were perfectly done!The roast chicken had such an earthy flavour wish I was not full,would have gone for a second helping.The ajwaini paneer Tikka was the dish I took three helpings of!It was superb!And the desert?It alone consisted of around thirty different deserts!All of them were too yum!!!!
The sweetest thing they did was arranging for a cake for us which was such a sweet gesture!We didn't even tell them before that we were celebrating our anniversary today , they came to know while talking with us and arranged it.Super sweet thing!Big thumbs up to the management.Full marks for their hospitality.
Would love to visit again.Keep up the good work people.

The JW kitchen hosts quite a good menu on it's Sunday brunch buffet.
 The live kitchen counters are swift and efficient and live up to the standards one would expect from them. The entrees served and the main course table d'hote menu is quite delectable. The desserts were quite good and the tarts and the macaroons deserve a special mention. 
 Alcohol served was complimentary. I had red wine sangria which was okayish. 
The service is applause worthy. The ambiance is plausible. 
Overall, a singular lunch or dinner would be a happy memory.

The restaurant is brilliantly illuminated even on an overcast day like today as it is located alongside the curtain wall side of the hotel,which was great to see as we loved the ambience and chose JW Marriot instead of ITC Sonar. 

Coming to the restaurant, the buffet spread was quite large and ranged from Indian and continental cuisine. The starters were quite good with the cauliflower, paneer tikka and chicken being their star dish.
I would definitely recommend their pasta from the live counter, it was phenomenal. The mains included chicken biriyani, Mutton rogan Josh and prawn curry were decent.
However, the lunch turned into a great one once we switched to the dessert section. There was a superb spread of some of the most delicious desserts I had tasted in the recent past. We were seated at table 9 and our server, was courteous and very hospitable.

One surprising thing that my family and I felt was that while clearing the plates,they just took it away without enquiring whether we wanted the plate to be taken or not. I feel at a restaurant like Jw Marriot such courteous gestures are expected.

Finally, the lady at the front counter who was showing us to our table was not helpful at all when I asked if any special arrangements could be made as I had brought my parents for lunch on the occasion of their 30th marriage anniversary. I understand that the restaurant might have been busy but blandly saying 'no' is not what I was expecting. So this was kind of a big let down. (so for me that's a sure shot - 1/5)

However, the restaurant is definitely worth visiting because the ambience is quite good and the dessert section is top-notch.

This place needs no introduction i think.This place is gala & extravagant.we went there for lunch buffet.The buffet menu is never ending with more than 100 dishes.You can't even taste one spoon full of each dishes.
Service-staffs are generous & well behaved & always ready to help you.
Food-As I said they had a never ending menu including cuisine from different countries.
North indian Starter menu is decent .They have their live counters you can have your pastas & noodles customized from there.
 A huge variety of salads.
The main course is little bit of let down.
But the dessert section suffice for all
The desserts are simply eye candy.
Value for money-As a 5 star restaurant this is place very much economical compared to other places in the town.
 I recommend this place to everyone for atleast the 5 star experience & for their desserts.

My 1st experience at a 5 star dine out clearly didnot disappoint. The decor is elegant yet modern. The lighting of the entire floor makes it a favourite particularly among the 'selfie lovers'.
Coming to the dine-in experience, the staff are extremely cordial and are top notch with their service. 
The starters included cauliflower, aubegine, tandoori aloo among the vegetarian options where as there were a couple of varieties of chicken and fish to please the non-veg palate. 
Chicken tikka was a standout for its succulent chicken pieces perfectly charred on the outside and juicy on the inside.

Salads and cheese options are also present for people who do want to try them. Live grill included both veg and non veg options .

 After which, we proceed to the mains where awaited the grilled chicken with potatos, and sausage with all its glory. Probably my standout dish of the evening, this had to be the one of the best grilled chicken I have ever had particularly because of the fall apart pieces of meat.
Other options included  tomato stuffed with ricotta, aloo masaledar, matar gobi and paneer dopiyazato name a few. Further down the main course alley, gosht biryani, mutton Rogan Josh, chicken kasha, hariyali fish, dal makhani waited with patience for savouring.

Not mentioning about the deserts would be a sin in itself. Multiple options of cake,  pastries, sweets, Icecream was a treat to a couple of senses. As pleasing to the eye as were they to the sweet buds.

Overall, it was a more than satisfactory first time experience at this major establishment.

Ambiance is classy and of course it will be. The food quality is excellent. The taste too. The variety you get is also amazing. A lot to extract from a single meal, so choose wisely and have a good time.

Finally JW Marriott Hotel in Kolkata and I couldnt stop myself from visiting this place..¬† I have been here on a weekday for dinner..¬†
Beautiful ambience. it's an abode of great food especially for desserts.
People with sweet tooth would love this place.¬†
Choosing from huge variety in the food menu, there was fabulous choices for the desserts.¬†
Being a vegetarian, we tasted almost every bit from the menu starting from chaats to live Italian counters to live chinese noodles, North Indian and salads.

Fully satisfied.

Luxurious is what you feel, the moment you step into this property. 
Look and feel- This hotel has a luscious Interior decor.  This place has glazed with fancy modern art.  The lobby area is bedecked and lit up in an attractive way.  
Restaurant service- extremely kind and hospitable people who are always around to help you in every possible way.  I would like to mention Paras, sachin,  and krishanu who aced at their jobs in fulfilling all my demands. 
>>Food- there was a huge spread for the dinner buffet
Drinks (non-alcoholic )- Mango basil and The Rose. 
**The Rose** is a must try guys. Its ambrosial in every way.  Totally out of the world. 
>>Starters - Chicken tikkas,  Paneer tikas,  Mushooms,  Russian salad,  Bean salad.  The Chicken was extremely tender and juicy, cooked till perfection. Bound to tantalize your taste buds. 
>> maincourse- grilled Chicken tossed with cherry tomatoes, onion and other veggies,  Mutton roghan josh,  Mutton dum biriyani,  Panner butter masala,  Creamy mushroom and enticing mustard fish.  The meat was extremely succulent.  The roghan josh was simply magnetic.  The food was completely Divine and saporous.  
>> desserts - the was again a wide spread options there in the table to fill the plate.  The presentation of the desserts were really eye catching and satisfying. When it comes to the taste i simply blissful.Chocolate draped comforting confectionary which was devilishly good. The fresh creamy frosting and the little garnishes layered with spongy fresh baked cakes was sensational. 
Rating it - 
Decor - 4. 5
Service - 4
Food - 4. 5 
Overall its a great experience all together.  Its a must visit and its highly recommended.

Dining here has always been the ultimate goal.. so finally we got the chance to visit here on the day of asthami when the place was very crowded, there was too much of chaos going on, with the waiters too busy to serve.. their buffet section was divided into three sections, indian, continental, indian desert, n cakes n all too.. they offers such wide variety of dishes, that u actually get confused,which one to choose n which to skip, but not all of them tastes excellent! Ambience is excellent, food is 4 out of 5. They had the live counter for chowmein pasta..mocktails and drinks. The service received wasnt that expected from this huge name, but we can understand since it was on a busy day, we il try to visit it again on normal days :)

Went for the midnight buffet during the pujas. The spread started with chicken biriyani and muton kosha. Well that was the only non veg in the menu. No starters, no non veg options. Only veg options were available like dal makhani, yellow dal, subz biriyani, steamed rice, shahi paneer. The veg menu also ends. Few papad types and few desserts. The desserts and main course items were changing every 30 mins. The chicken biriyani soon made way for  mutton(half cooked) in subz biriyani. 

The price was kept at a nominal of 999/ inclusive of all taxes. However, at this price point it really feels disappointing with such limited options. You should have added 200-500 rupees extra and given the normal spread. This was very disappointing when one had to ask for water thrice to get the glass refilled once. Will try for regular buffet at normal timings but will never recommend the midnight buffet to anyone.

The booking process is very painful. The customer executives behave like this is the only restaurant in the city and they are always sold out. When actually visited there, 60% tables were vacant. The initial experience is so bad that when you actually arrive there you tend to be occupied with the thought that how painful was actually the booking process which is unrealistic. The food was good not as good as expected. Very limited options in starter and soups. Only 2 variety of breads were available. Overall okay not so good not so bad. Desert is good.

We came here for the midnight buffet and were very very disappointed. I have been to JW Kitchen earlier for the regular buffet and i loved their spread. However, i regret coming for this midnight buffet. They had only tomato basil soup, with no choice of non-vegetarian. There were no starters whatsoever. There was a long queue for the biryani. The staffs and the manager were least bothered and unapologetic when we complained about the unavailability of the staples. The spread was very very limited. Just to mention, there wasnt even icecream for deserts.
We are definitely not coming back ever for the midnight buffet. JW kitchen definitely did justice to the phrase that quantity and quality don't go together.

Maybe the largest buffet spread I have ever witneseed till date!We went for the Saturday Brunch.The interiors at first deserve special mention,which is quite expected from a 5 star hotel as Marriot.Now coming to the food,they have a drinks counter with 5 varieties of sangria,mango and peach favoured ice tea and unlimited beer!Then there is a salad counter featuring chicken and pork salami and a variety of other salads.The live pasta and chowmein counter is at your service anytime.Then there is the Indian starter counter with chicken and fish kebabs.The herb fried chicken with bread deserves special mention.This is not the end...you will also get a full variety of indian main course with biriyani,dhaniya chicken,dal makhani and a hell lot of others.Last but not the least is the dessert counter ofcourse with a plethora of desserts to satisfy your sweet tooth!I cannot even name majority of them!Overall the service is great with courteous staffs who are at your service anytime.And also don't forget to click lots and lots of photos before leaving this place!Looking forward to come back soon!

So finally it was a star experience.. let's start up with the ambience.. i must say wow.. will give u luxurious feel.. well right from entry staff are courteous enough ... It was a Saturday night so it was full and had to wait for an hour for our turn.. this wait for food was no vain..  the person who attended was a bit late.. we started with our buffet.. it had a range of food menu.. and lots of starter both in veg and non veg... A vegetarian will have a lots of option here...  The buffet out here has a variety... You won't end up trying their each buffet menu ... For sure you will be skipping one or two of them... A nice experience but i must say food quality could be improved and service needs to be improved a bit... Good place to have a buffet with a range of variety that's what i would say for jw kitchen

Well i think this is the most popular place to have Buffet now.. so crowded..reservation needs to be done way prior.. i made it 10days before. Ambience and service is top notch. Buffet pricing is reasonable considering its a 5 star. Coming to the food, the starters were quite good.. the main course was strictly average. My top picks would be the live counters and desserts. Also they should keep prawn in buffet..mostly its chicken, fish and mutton. Also i liked the fact that they have kept few bengali dishes. But my suggestion would be to keep something what we say" elahi" bengali dish rather than simple alu posto and maachher jhol. Its a regular fare in any Bengali household. Nonetheless, it was a nice lunch with friends

A wonderfully positive place, a foodie's heaven. Obviously no amount of appreciation is enough for the ambience and the staff. Marriot is the place for you if your palates know what food actually is. Their salads, their noodles, even their biriyani taste nothing short of heavenly. And desserts!! Merlin's beard, what a fabulous 'collection'!! From cheese cake to gulab jamun, do binge on all the delicacies!

So, visited this place with my sister. Talking about the ambience and services, they are really good. The staffs are very friendly and helpful in nature.
Next coming to the food, the spread is good and the food was average except the mughlai biriyani which was pretty good and the best part was the desert.
We opted for the lunch buffet and its 2500 for two including all the taxes. I loved the German shepherd at the gate who check the cars. <3 AND yes booking is must.

I think the entry to JW Marriott just stole my heart away , where a duty dog is there to welcome you. üòÉ  Coming next to the international ambience , simple yet classy, the delicious food and the huge spread of desserts , chicken , pasta, noodles will just melt your heart. Worth a visit. ‚ù§

I was there with a good group for breakfast & we all had a very nice time here.
There was a wide variety of options in buffet & it was priced averagely & not something very expensive.

Probably one of the hottest buffets in town right now, the spread of the JW Kitchen is bound to astonish you. From an elaborate salad section, chaats, gujarati khandvis and dhoklas, to your more traditional kababs and stir-fries, to an elaborate section to mains ranging from Indian to Chinese to continental, a cheese course and a stunning dessert spread, this place will leave you spoiled for choice.¬†
Coming to the quality of the food, it is pretty decent, but most of them are not mind-blowing. The Indian section in particular was great though. The cheese course was a ¬†novelty for me and I loved te elaborateness of it all. Most of the desserts were pretty good.
Is it good? Of course, yes. You won't find such variety at such a price point in many other places in the city. Was it mind-blowing? Probably not.

It was my first trip to JW Kitchen. We went there for lunch buffet that costs around 1250/- including taxes.
I tried various dishes especially all the chicken preparations.
Those were awesome. However there is not much variety for vegetarians.
Some of the bakery items  like veg and Tuna sandwiches were good too.
Main course option was modest with Chicken Biryani and mutton and chicken dishes.

There are various live counters.
Noodles: Various options available to choose from. You can select the vegetable options, non veg toppings to the type of sauce etc. I ordered chilli garlic egg noodles. It tasted Awesome. 5/5

Pasta : i didn't like this very much.  Average 2.5/5

Chaat : Many options from Raj kachori to papri chat and dahi vara and aloo tiki chaat. Taste was good but the service was pathetic. Too slow. We ordered 4 or 5 dishes there and it arrived after 45 minutes , highly unprofessional. Also soe items were not even brought to us till end! Sigri Global Grill has better service and taste . 1/5

Desert: Excellent. Many options  Can't describe. Aplle turt and Cake of the day were heavenly. Also many types of muffins etc. Gulab jamun Ice cream, waffle etc. : 4/5.


Overall
Food variety : 4.5/5
Taste : 4/5
Service : 2/5 ( especially due to that chaat counter service)
Also i would like to add that during the last 30 mins when we all went to take main course our table was cleaned as if we left and napkins and everything were removed and even when we came back those weren't put again. Felt really bad.

I would still prefer barbeque Nation over JW kitchen . They have excellent service.

After the wait of almost a month, we got a reservation here. But let me tell you, the wait is absolutely worth it. The range and variety of food served here is amazing, a commendable one infact. Be it the North Indian section, the live counter that serves noodles/pasta according to your taste buds, the salad section, the lobster section, the drinks section or the desert section. Everything is just bang on here. The price is a bit on the higher scale, but I guess it's worth paying as it's a five starter hotel.
P.S. I would suggest to go for dinner here, as you can absolutely relish their ambiance and have a gala time!

I visited this with my family on 12.9.17 for dinner. Being a weekday we didn't bother to reserve a seat. It seems you better should,prior to your visit. Once inside,since we didn't have a table reservation, we were made to wait for 20mins. Using the time for clicking pics is a good idea coz the Decor is awesome. I also had the opportunity to know how JW gets its high reviews(the waiters butter a non suspecting customer in giving up their phones for a while,install a Zomato app and boom a 5star rating but for me that was cheap for me). 
Now a good buffet comes with a "price". We coughed up 5k for 3persons. Anyways it was my birthday so it didn't matter!!

We had dinner buffet as suggested by reviews. 

Ambience Good(minus points coz when it rained people were scattered as water was seeping in through a ceiling).

Staff good but could have been better. We were not given any options of regular water so we bought mineral water worth ‚Çπ 300(the mrp on the bottle showed 40‚Çπ).

Food plethora of options but not all are delectable. 
Starters like Mexican chicken and ginger fish is a must have although I was let down by cold prawns and ham(ice tea must be warmer). I was amazed by the spread of salads and dry fruits.
Main course gost biryani ,murg lababdar, amritsari chicken are delicious. Pasta is tasty.  Skip the rest. 
Dessert was a letdown. While I enjoyed the likes of cupcakes , rosogulla and sandesh others like lemon cake, tart cake etc were bitter!!

I like the buffet here. Been here for family & office lunches. Thrice till date. Only thing is I feel you should offer at least 1 complimentary drink. The people are helpful, so no complaints on the service bit. Sweets section is what I'd like to talk about a bit. I'm a total dessert lover. A lot of people are very pleased with the sweets section - even a couple of my friends! I however feel that there are way too many options but I personally have very less choices to pick from. The best part about this section is the diversity - I mean u have a variety of desserts ranging from Indian to Western. But I'd love it if you had a bit more options in the western kind of desserts - for example macaroons. Otherwise, I'm anyway visiting soon ;)

No doubt JW Marriott is offering their lavish buffet spread at a very reasonable price, i appreciate but the taste did not meet my expectation. Visited this place last month on the occasion of one of our corporate meet on a Fri to experience the Dinner spread. I would recommend if you have a palette for western food, please knock their salad bar. An array of lavish variety of salad combo that you can try with the best quality of cheese and olives.

The Sunday Brunch is JUST insaaaannnneeeee! 
I mean everyone ought to visit this place just for the brunch. First things first, if you are wondering about the pocket pinch? Don't. Yes, true it's a tad bit expensive. But it's a special day, your probably spend the same amount. The reason why spending this money is a smart move is the huge spread they offer for lunch. I promise you it's too much food for one visit. There is no way on earth you get to taste everything the spread has to offer. If you can? well, it's worth every single penny you've spent. As for me, I need to go back a second time to try out the rest of the food.
In short there was - Indian, Asian, Italian, Breakfast (Live Counters which will make you anything you want, almost), Salads, Cheese Counter, Sauces & Herbs and Dessert. Oh also, there was this special cute little counter/spread for kids below 10 years.

Loved the service & hospitality. Definitely going back there the second time üòá

There was a lot of hue and cry about Marriott's opening and being a breakfast lover, I too tried out their breakfast spread. For a non-vegetarian, it's a total waste as they don't provide even the basic variety but if you are a vegetarian...it's a total paisa wasool...it has a wide range of breakfast spread but to cater to a vegetarian's needs.

So finally ticked this one from my bucket list. What else you can expect from this place... Incredible decor, elegant ambiance and a good food. This sumptuous buffet is going to fill your stomach as well mind. We have tried almost every dish present over there. Infact I dint even know the name of some. The desert section is must visit. Main course can be skipped but not biriyani and mutton kosha. One quick review:- 
Food:- 3.5/5
Ambience:- 5(+1 from my heart)/5
decor:- 10/5.. 
Hospitality:- 5/5

I would must spend a line or two for describing the hospitality and the behaviour of the staffs. They are pretty much well behaved, soft spoken and co operative. A big thank you from my end. 

If you are really willing to feel this ambience please drop by here once. You gonna have a pleasant stay during that period.

Classy decor, cordial staffs, prompt service with smiling faces n the buffet platter is worth for money.

This place have been the talk to the town of late, so decided to pay a visit. Its really an affordable place which ends the exclusivity of 5-star to only a niche. Ambience and courteous behavior are notable factor but its manifested for being a luxury collection of hotel. I was elated by elaborate spread of buffet, which has Indian, Chinese and Continental. The biggest grumble I had is with the fish in mustard curry (which was really dry and smelly) and the mutton curry.

Overall its a good dining experience.

Already tried their lunch and dinner buffet so decided to opt the breakfast buffet this time. The spread  won't disappoint you for sure and they had a lot of varieties as usual. The freshly made pancakes with maple syrup and waffles with icecream was too good. Liked other baked items too. Will definitely come back.

@JW Marriott Kolkata Team - I would like you to include baked beans and greek yoghurt (plain, blueberry, strawberry flavors) in your breakfast buffet.

Yesterday me and my partner went for lunch in JW Kitchen. As we entered there,our car was taken over and parked. We were greeted with a warm welcome. The lady in JW Kitchen checked for the reservation and let us in.
We sat in a table for two but since my bag was too heavy I wanted a place to keep it in. We were given a table for four and I was overwhelmed.

Then came the main purpose for going there. There were a huge variety of food and I was literally confused from where to start. I started with the salads and sandwiches. There was a huge variety of food. Being an obsessed foodie I took almost all the things- lamb salad, chicken salad, ham and chicken sandwich and mayonnaise. The taste and texture was good but the lamb salad disappointed me. Then I went out for soup and noodles with squid, prawn, chicken, eggs and sauteed veggies. It was the best. The pasta in white sauce was tasty,but was a little less boiled. The variety of cheese and crackers and nuts were impressive enough. While my partner was keen with the Indian dishes, I was up for tasting all. The rice was too dull to the taste buds but the spinach with corn and the Indian dishes were fab. It was about to be 3pm so the staff told was to take the dessert. That was the best part. The cupcakes, muffins, tarts, pie, rasgulla were amazing. But the drawback was that there was little food item as compared to the number of people present. I couldn't get the chocolate mousse, since I'm a chocolate lover I was disappointed as I was informed there isn't anymore.
The overall experience was good and we were assisted by Subhodeep. He is a really good person and was always present nearby to help. He is genuinely dedicated towards his works.

If you get excited just by the merry thought of food then doooo‚ù§let it be on the top of your list! 

The decor, ambience is worth everything ‚ù§

The area in which it is located that is Science City area ¬†is one of the places in Kolkata to visit. 

They have literally varieties of starters including Chaat Counter, Salad including simple n compound, varieties of ¬†breads.cold cuts diff. of dressings,pickles etc....etc.

Surprisingly last night The welcome drinks are missing specially on star category of this hotel. 

The main course is not much happening except Roast chicken/Baked Potato/kasundi Bhindi...! Malabar Fish curry think little bit high coconut flavor to kill other spices flavor which one add on this dish, Mainly Indian section not attractive,lots of scope are there!!! Another important part is pl.some body should there to explain the dishes for the night spread.But the desserts section surely increasing the electrolysis of your body‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§They have continental as well as Indian desserts( specially Malpua- Rabri Missing!!) and trust me they are mouth lickingüòò

The price is little bit higher end but you get a good quality and quantity as well

So yes a biggggg thumbs up for this place of happiness JW Marriott-JW KITCHEN ‚ù§‚ù§

Had the ala carte Lunch, buffet breakfast n the salad n desert buffet for dinner.

First things first. This place is simply outstanding in every aspect...service..taste and choice

Had a late lunch about 1545. Ordered  butter chicken(the menu name is something else) n garlic naan. We also ordered the chilli chicken which came with complementary fried rice. The portions were ample and taste...finger licking.

The buffet breakfast was a dream with almost anything you could imagine being there for you to pick. The choise of fresh fruit juices and the Indian selection particularly standing out. 

The salad a desert buffet for dinner is a perfect choise if you don't want to over eat but still don't want to miss out on the goodies.

Overall an outstanding experience..

You can have a leisurely dinner there over hours. Also you can spend time by observing the food ingredients and live cooking. Regarding food, you are practically spoilt with choice.

JW Kitchen is a pride of Kolkata.  The taste it brings in, the rich variety it offers in is just something which separate JW from the others. The ambience is very sophisticated with world class decors and highly professional staffs. They has so much to offer you in when it comes to food. Its a multi cuisine buffet. You get Thai, Continental, Italian, Indian, Punjabi, Chinese and a lott more. They have plenty of live counters like chowmein, pasta, chats, english etc. Plenty of dips and sauces, fresh fruits, cheese and breads. The desert section is unending. They have almost all the varieties possible with live ice cream counter as well. 

How much you try you won't be able to finish everything in one shot. And the price is also very reasonable. Total value for money and prior booking is recommended.

Visited JW Kitchen to have a taste of the sumptuous Sunday Brunch.The spread was no doubt exotic,cutting across all continental boundaries.But I'm not here to repeat what has already been mentioned, which spoke of the neverending spread, the authentic Asian delicacies along with the yummilicious mouth melting desserts.

But I'm here to pen down a few disappointments
Firstly,everyone isnt well acquainted with the art of making salads with the perfect hint of dressing & hence there must be someone to assist the visitors while they make the salad of their choice.

Secondly,the bartender didn't have the knowledge,that white wine was available/ included in the brunch & we were offered red wine sangria instead.But a little later we came to know that white wine was pretty much available and such cases of sheer miscommunication isnt what is we expected.

Lastly, a beer like tuborg isnt the one that should be served to the guests of the Marriott Kitchen. If not Miller atleast a Budweiser beer is expected from the bars of JW kitchen

But keeping these disappointments aside,overall it was a foodilicious afternoon with the JW Kitchen.

The options are numerous. But incase you wanna have mineral water or any other beverage, beware to pay 10 times more..The only justified reason you get is that this is a luxury brand where the MRP of the product is sold at 10 times the price...Seriously next time do get a decent answer!!!

Went for lunch buffet on rakhi. Was a bit late to arrive so had to hurry. The spread seemed very scattered. There wasn't any defined order of the spread and much problematic for the uninitiated. I have been to other marriot kitchens like pune, mumbai and havent seen this. The spread was average and tasted average as well. Dint have time for live-counter. The starters nd the main course was at most average. The veg starters tasted better than the non-veg ones even for a strict non-vegetarien like me. The main course had kosha mangso(mutton) which was pretty good. The salad bar was rich and worth it. It was a bit dissappointing. The desert section was the face-saver sort of. Everything tasted awesome from malpoa to the choco mouse. Charged as guilty,i've a sweet tooth and i tasted the entire desert section. Could go back only for the deserts!!

I went there on my birthday with a lot of expectation. But I was disappointed. Desserts were very tasty. But taste of main course and starters was very poor. Ambience was very good. Needs to be improved.

Comfortable sitting arrangements.. Everything is perfectly maintained.. From the entrance to washroom even. Staffs were courteous nd professional.
There was a live countr for noodles and pasta. U can select chicken, prwan, or any kinda sea food as per ur choice nd thy will make dat for u within very few minutes.. My sis ordrd white sauce pasta.. Was delicious
Also thy have a counter for papri chat, dahi bada nd dis type of snacks. I tk a plate of papri chat. It was awesome ..
For main course thy have plenty of options.. Biriyani, mutton kasha, two type of chicken dish, fish curry, nd there menu card holds a variety for vegetarians also. Lots of cheese, dry fruits, salad option was there.. All of d food was tasty nd quality
Now coming to d most wanted nd delicious part of dis place.. Dessert counterüòç
I gt confused to select d best one. Hot waffle served with chocolate sauce was suprb.. This was huge. I guess thy have almost 20 item in der dessert corner..
Finally ice cream. U have to choose which one u want to take nd thy will decorate dat nicely.. All was mouthwatering ..

First of all no doubt the ambience of such a place won't be great. It is such a beautiful luxurious place to go with friends and family occasionally. The starters like chicken kebab, dry chilli fish were great. They had roasted chicken which was of great delight. Next we headed for pasta and noodles. And I must say the quality, taste and texture of the pasta as well as the noodles were excellent. They served the custom made noodles where we have selected the ingredients to be added. There was a variety of salads and pickles.  The murgh biriyani, subz biriyani, mutton kosa, achaari fish were great. There was also options for dal, steamed rice, peas pulao, sabzi. Then we tasted the pork salami and and similar prawns(sorry i didn't notice the names). But it was great. And last but not the least we headed for the desserts. There was just so many mouth watering varieties. The choco brownie was delicious. Rest of the desserts were awesome, I think tried everything from different pies and cakes to mousse and gulabjamuns. We also ordered an oreo shake, which was perhaps the worth of its price. Please visit this place and have a great day indeed.

Tried both their breakfast as well as dinner, and I must say the spread is actually awesome. Owning to the price we pay, this is indeed a great place to go in case you are looking for great buffets.
What I personally loved about them are the amazing dessert spread. For that, maybe I can just keep coming back

And even after asking many a times they were not providing water and ice to us.... except this everything was great.. will visit againüòä

Yesterday visited on a special ocassion in sunday brunch. I must say...wow..for the ambience.5/5 for the ambience only. Coming to the food.. taste wise its just a good...some of them..was below average level.bt i dont feel any mouthwatering menu...so much variations in the menu.bt the starter sections should have more variety.we didnt find any delicious prawn or seafood in the starter or in the main course also.the service was also not upto the mark.they took order in the live counter bt couldnt deliver in the table in tym.we knocked them 2times for that.and also they should also provide spoons along with dishes.aftr finishing main course we have to wait for the spoons to start desert.no doubt...the desert counter was super duper.i just loved it.

I came here with my girlfriend to enjoy their Sunday brunch. And guess what, it was worth it. The hall is huge, and so despite the fact that it was hosting 100 people at any point of time, we had our own privacy. Service was top notch.

Coming to food, they had a big spread of everything. Cold cuts were mouth watering, and the cheese were fantastic. There were 2 live counters to serve noodles and so of asian style, and pasta and so in italian style. There were 3to 4 kinds of Sangrias that were on offer, and all were of unique taste and flavour. Their dessert section was a beauty to the eye. 

Bottomline- it is a must go place.

The environment was very pleasant. There were a lot of varieties on food which included continental,Indian,Italian etc. It had live kitchen which was serving Italian , Chinese, different kind of chats . All the staffs were very helpful specially Amit who was taking care of our table. Overall it was worth paying 1250 rupees inclusive tax. 
The only thing that I felt should be changed was free wifi service which was only for an hour.

Had a lovely buffet lunch on the occasion of our anniversary. Overall it was a nice experience. We reserved a seat in advance so din't face any hassle in getting a place. They were really nice and kind enough to allot us a seat just beside the huge glass away from all the commotion where we could easily talk and spend some good quality time. From manager to stewards everyone will greet you with a smile which actually lifts up your spirit. So kudos to their hospitality.
Ambience is top notch. Beautiful interiors. But the food was average. (Thats why 4.5) Mutton could've been a bit more soft. Starters were good but a very less number of choices.there was a huge spread of cold cuts though i din't like them much except the fish but yes dessert section was treat to our tongues and made our day. Since we already knew about this from the reviews so we saved a big chunk of our tummies for the desserts and enjoyed them at the fullest. ;)

Pocket pinch- 1250 for each +if you want to order drinks then wine starts at around 650ish and aerated beverages 250ish.

Looking forward to visit again soon. Keep it up guys. Thumbs up to the entire team of JW MARRIOTT

We went there for their lunch buffet.
One of the most talked about places in Kolkata, and they deserve all the talking.

They have a variety of main courses and desserts.
Starter is limited in numbers but it does taste great.

Their collection of cheese is amazing as well.

The much talked about place at this moment. Visited for dinner around 9.30ish. The entire JW Kitchen was buzzing with diners. We opted for buffet of course. Option was very limited and mostly Indian menu. But no complaints with taste and quality. Each and every item was good. I loved that Veg Biryani , Fish in musterd sauce ,also there were 2 items from starter which were absolutely delicious. And what to say about their desserts. You will be spoilt for choices. Make sure you keep enough room in your stomach to enjoy those sinful delights , unfortunately I was almost full so couldn't enjoy rather couldn't taste all. But one thing which I didn't expect from a place like JW Marriott : the table ( table for 2 beside glass wall) we were provided was shaky , on informing the same they fixed it up but still I felt something was wrong with it. Hope they will look after this issue. Overall I enjoyed my dinner at Marriott.

One of the cheapest when it comes to 5 star buffet. Dessert range is huge and delicious. Starters and main course are also good but as usual it's more of a show than good food. Of course you can visit it once but other than the desserts, there's no incentive to go there again.

A much awaited visit finally materialised yesterday in the form of my birthday dinner at JW Marriott... I did harbour high expectations from this place but truth be told I almost feel like I have squandered away 5000 bucks for sumthing that's not worthy of the expenditure. But first things first, I do have to commend the larger than life ambience which lifted my spirits the moment I entered the place... It is hands down, the most beautiful restaurant I have ever been to... The buffet spread is arranged beautifully and when I entered the eating arena, everything looked delectable and I was taken aback by the wide plethora of options. The starters were overall, good in taste which made us crave for more... The chicken wings especially were cooked to perfection... The babycorn could have been a bit crispier but other than that all the starters deserve acclamation.
We were really intrigued to have a go at the live counter food and so we ordered non vegetarian noodles and pasta in red sauce. That was I believe the start of the downhill trend in the food journey at Marriot. I can't remember the last time I had such weirdly tasting noodles in my life. The noodles reeked of soya sauce and lacked a generous amount of veggies in it. Their idea of non vegetarian, I believe, only consists of prawns because i hardly tasted any other non veg tidbits in my noodle plate. The pasta was close to a disaster. The red sauce lacked balance and the chicken in the pasta was undercooked.
We hoped better reception at the mains and overall i would say, we were not disappointed though they really need to put in more options for the mains particularly. The kosha mangsho was probably the best mutton i have tasted in a long time.
The real downer of the day were the desserts. The place offers close to 20 different kinds of desserts but sadly stating, none of the desserts swept me away. The chocolate mud cake and raspberry delice were the only good things available. The rest of the items though looked delectable, tasted weird, especially the mango coconut cake which I believe is a combination that just doesn't work out. I am a veritable sweet tooth and a crazy hunter of good desserts, so u can imagine that this spoiled the whole dinner for me.
As for the staff, they were nothing extraordinary as u wud expect frm a 5 star restaurant. They hardly paid attention to our problems. When i complained about the noodles, one of them told me it was not his department and walked away... The pocket pinch is heartrending. All those reading my review, I wud say it is more thunder and less rain at the JW kitchen... Nothing extraordinary to look forward to.

Well Jw Marriott has always been in my wish list.And so finally visited yesterday with lot of high hopes and expectations.Let me start with the food section and then I will talk about the decor.We opted for lunch buffet and it was my boyfriend's birthday.So they gave us a complimentary cake and I loved their gesture.Just that they should have been bit more hospitable coz after they gave us the cake we had to wait for our knives to come and none was there at the time when my boyfriend was cutting the cake but I saw some of the hotel staffs around the foreigners when they were cutting the cake.I can't get it on what basis they differentiated us from them.
Then talking about buffet menu with lot of variations,
 Starters-Its OK but nothing that special
Main course-some of the dish did not attract me at all and others are OK.They have live counters where they will make pastas and noodles in front of you after you choose your ingredients of pasta and noodles.
Desserts-Lot of variations.Tastes nice
Only the desserts seem very appealing.
Now talking about the decor its lovely and truly gives you the feeling of lavishness.However if I am spending my bucks on lunch buffet then why not getting to taste something worth remembering.I do agree that a waiter briefed us about the live counter but a restro is not managed by a single staff.And staffs please stop differentiating and be more courteous coz this is a 5-star hotel and every single person coming here deserves best behavior.

There is no denying that the look and feel of this restaurant is absolutely great. High ceilings, glass decor, lots of open space etc. make the eating experience a whole lot enjoyable. But you would normally expect it would be such since it is counted as one of the finest.

We went for the buffet that comprises of salad bar, bread and cheese section, Indian chaat section, Italian live section, Chinese live section, Indian main course section and desserts.

It was impossible to go through everything so I would base the review on the ones that I experienced.

Salad Bar - lot of choices with usual veggies, olives, ham, pepperoni, chicken, jumbo prawns etc. Several salad dressings were there too. I loved the salad bar. It is impossible to get such fresh salad even in lot of upscale restaurants.

Bread and cheese - Tried a slice of whole wheat, cheese spread and a slice of edam. All were good.

Indian chaat section - Have not personally tried it. But some of my colleagues said that the mini raj kachoris were good.

Chinese live section - I wanted to taste a small bowl of noodles with chicken and prawn. The overall taste was good but the chicken cubes had an earthy smell which I did not like.

Indian main course - The chicken starter was bland. In fact, we found that most of the Indian preparations to be a bit bland. in the taste. May be this was done to keep it simple for the guests from other countries. Out of everything I had, the boneless mustard fish will top all.

Also had few bites of Schezwan Fish and Murg Malai Kabab. It was simply ok and I had better versions elsewhere.

Desserts - There were lots of choices to get you the needed sugar rush. But I settled with Raspberry Delice (simply superb), Baked Yogurt and Berry Mousse which are okayish.

Overall, its a nice total experience with not so top class buffet food except the salad and desserts sections.

On Saturday, we went for their buffet lunch. But it was a huge mistake on our part that we didn't make a prior reservation. Since it was saturday it was jam packed. But we didn't wanted to go anywhere else because we have been planning this for a while now. We got a table at around 2:40pm and luckily for us they extended their lunch till 3:30pm.
Coming to the property... Marriott is an experience as a whole, beautifully decorated, amazing ambience, great design. Guests are greeted courteously with a smile, great reception.
They have a huge buffet of veg, non veg, indian, chinese, continental dishes. Live sections are there too. Buffet is something I always opt for because I get to taste their different dishes but here the spread was huge and I need another visitüòã
I am not a big sweet person but they probably had the best dessert section with misti, pies, cakes, pastry, ice cream.
A great experience all in all.
Cost for two of us around 3k ( we took a non alcoholic drink outside the buffet)

We had been planning to visit J. W. Marriott for long. Finally decided to go there on the occasion of my birthday. Since we opted for Saturday lunch, we booked it in advance.

The ambience is awesome and that of any five star hotel. Their spacious, clean, and soberly decorated buffet area will surely impress you the very moment you enter it. The staffs are courteous and cooperative. They will help and attend you throughout your meal.

The birthday cake was just yummy. The food items too were extremely delicious. The starters just set your mood to jump into the food items of various other sections. The mixed veg, paneer, fish, and chicken starters were all equally sumptuous. The main course items including paneer makhani, veg biryani, chicken kosha, rice, mutton, fish etc. were too good. We simply loved the mutton item as the pieces of mutton just melted in the mouth.

There were lots of options in salads, bread, dry fruits, sauces, cheese, etc. Different types of noodles, spaghetti, pastas, etc. were also there. You can ask their chefs in the live food counters to make your choice of dish with your preffered ingredients.

The best part was the dessert section. You just can't have enough of it. You see so many options and keep on drooling over them. But till the time you reach this section, you're already almost full. Such huge spread of cupcakes, pastries, sweets, ice-creams, mousse, etc. will simply give you a hard time to select what to have!

In brief, the place is worth visiting and spending such a hefty amount for a buffet meal.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 2500 for two

JW Marriott is an experience. It's expensive obviously but for the quality food, ambience, extremely cooperative staffs and the like you get the amount they charge is worth giving. Deserts are my forever favorite so didn't miss the chance to grab all of them. This is the only buffet in town which provides this much varity of food items- staring from Indian, Bengali, gujhrati, Continental etc.

Its really wonderful gesture I got as soon as my car enter, steward open the door of the car felt like Royal and guided me to the main gate. Again another person guide me to Vintage. As I enter the ambiance was wonderful Sudip guide me and gave a corner seat. For refreshes they gave us jasmine tea. Then we order a bottle of wine along with starters. Trust me lovely delicious starters and then we order main course and last we order deserts as I heard a lot about so order a mango with caramel its really tasty n mouth watering. we enjoyed the evening and my birthday at your place. and last Sudip nice person .

Was Planning to visit Marriot since a very long time, so finally visited Jw Kitchen today for my bday lunch.
The infrastructure is splendid. Sophisticated, posh, very airy, spacious and luxurious.
The staffs are very nice. Helpful and cheerful.
Coming to the most important element, that is the food.
Starters were good, specially the chicken item. Absolutely melt in the mouth and yummy. The crispy veg and the fish item was average.
The main course had biryani, goan mutton curry, macher curry, kosha murgi, steamed rice. Biryani was yummy. I liked it a lot, My dad liked the goan mutton very much. There were veg items too, but I didnt try it.
There was a huge spread of salads, jumbo prawns, different sauces , bread, cheese and even Gujrati counter.
The live counter had sea food noodles, veg noodles, white sauce , red sauce pasta, papdi chats. The noodles was really yummy. The papdi chat too was good.
The desserts....a lot of options.
Different cakes, mousse, fresh fruits, cupcakes, bengali sweets like malpua, rossogolla etc.
We also ordered A Tequila shot and a whiskey from the Ala carta menu.
Things I didnt like :
1. The starters were cold
2. Food tasted very average, except a few
3. No complimentary drink included in the buffet

Things I liked :
1. Ambiance, atmosphere and infrastructure
2. Staffs are very good
3. Complimentary cake for my birthday
4. A large no. Of options available
Overall a worthy experience.

This place leaves you spoilt for choice. So many cuisines and options to choose from... You get lost in the food. For buffet service pre booking is absolutely necessary. Pasta, noodles, salads, indian, momos etc,. name it they have it. You cannot really try everything. 
However my favourite has to be desserts. What a selection! You do not wish to leave even one of it. 
Been there twice already and will definitely re-visit.

the ambience was just mind blowing..... the food was awesome...... i liked the dessert options the most.... planning to visit again... the faculty was very friendly....thank u for such a great experience... 0.5 point is missing just for not having a complementary drink.... which is a great combination with every buffet course.... otherwise.... #7_star #worthit

Went for dinner buffet on Sunday few days back after reading the good reviews on Zomato and J.W. Marriot name. Had to book a table a week in advance. Went there with a lot of expectations.

The ambience /decor was excellent, hospitality/service was good ....but food was a huge let down.

Apparently it looks like a huge buffet spread, but actually in my opinion there arn't many items as per a 5 star establishment standard buffet, which you can really savour for dinner. Very few items in the name of starter with very very average taste...a big let down at the very beginning. In the name of continental there is the live pasta counter which has only pasta in white /red sauce, tried the pasta in white sauce...was simply horrible...couldn't eat after having one spoon. Also there are  cold cuts, different types of loafs/breads, cheese.....which belongs more to a breakfast spread. There were a million and one items on the salad counter.......nothing i could appreciate taste wise. The was an Asian live counter....got some noodles made from there........one of the worst noodles I had tasted in a long time.....even my daughter couldn't eat it. Went for the Indian spread.......mutton was very very greasy and spicy, chicken also same, didn't have the courage to try biryani any more,  just had dal and tandoori roti.

There were a lot of items in the dessert section....tasted a few....very very average taste.

To sum up there was not a single item with a "Wow Factor" in it which me and my family could appreciate. Not expected from a 5 star establishment like J.W Marriot. I travel a  lot around the globe and have stayed in many 5 star hotels....but this is no where close to 5 star quality food.....even an average restaurant serves tastier food.

I don't know if I landed there on a day when nothing tasted good.....or this is how it is every day.

Or maybe they have kept the buffet price competitive and serving such pathetic food.....and diminishing their standards on the way.

Ambience /Decor: 5 / 5

Hospitality / Service: 3.5 / 5

Food: 0 / 5 ( very very poor)

The above rating of 1.5 is only for ambience and nicely done interiors. Going there was just a waste of time, effort and lastly money. I hope A La Carte in J.W Marriot is not equally bad!!!

This JW Marriott leaves a lot to be desired on customer service. It needs a lot of work to match the services of the other JW Marriotts of the world. There was no assigned waiter to help in the services, to guide on the buffet . There is a lot of people to serve on the floor, but you need to always call somebody for help. Also, there were charges on the final receipt that were surprises. I have also one pending issue in how they charged my credit card which I hope will get resolved.

Food wise it is ok, but nothing spectacular.

Ambience is a top notch as a 5 star restaurant. It's a huge dining space with comfortable seating arrangements.
For couples they have separate space beside the glass which is quite cosy.

Restaurant has wide variety of foods in their buffet which are tasty üòã. Lastly their desserts are delicious. From tarts to cake to ice cream, lots of options. Yummy üòãü§§

Service is always good as expected from such a great place. Courteous and good.  Price is also good which I feel is value for money considering 'J W Marriott hotel'üòä

I went for the dinner on friday! Booked table on advance via Zomato. Please make reservation atleast 2-3 days if you are visiting on weekends. 

Ambience: Ambience is top notch as you would expect from a 5 star restaurant. They have a huge dining hall with comfortable seating arrangements. All the tables have artificial candle light theme which makes the place romantic. For couples opt the places beside the glass where the lights are dim and makes the place cosy. They have well spread section of different cuisine, salads, desert etc.

Food: They provide multi cuisine on the buffet. The salad section is huge! All the different kind of salads you can get, probably they kept in mind of international guests who arrives. Starters they have two fish, one chicken and one veg items. It was good but nothing spectacular. I liked the ain course section better than starters which is rare. Main course dishes were yummy and all the dishes were perfectly made. They also have live continental section where they can prepare dish infront of you as you wish. The desert section was huges. I was confused which one to skip as all the items looked spectacular. Muffins, tart, cake, sandesh,etc all looked stunning and tasted too nice. But I assume taste wise I could have ben little better. Ice cream also 4 normal varieties were there which I dint expect.

Service- Service was the best! Staffs are well trained as you expect from 5 star. The staffs are courteous and quick to respond. I took cake along with me on birthday occasion and they them self got it presented without even have to ask for. The way they asked us to celebrate with champagne felt good.

Pocket pinch- 2560 including all taxes for 2 persons which I feel is value for money, considering the place where you are dining.

Went there on a weekday for their buffet. In one word-Disappointing. Heard much about it. Didn't deliver on all fronts.
The ambience is excellent. You would expect nothing less from a five star hotel and they do manage to satisfy with their sophistication. Decor is top notch as is the quality of cutlery. However the spread despite being large wasn't the best. The biriyani and the lamb was actually excellent! The desserts were gorgeous to look at, though some where lacking in the taste department. However the starters were a major let down. Except for a chicken kebab, the starters simply let us down. I am the sort of person who gorges mainly on starters whenever the opportunity to go to a buffet arises. However their starter spread simply forced us to move on to the main course. The waiters were of course as proficient as expected.
All said, wouldn't necessarily return unless there is a good reason to.

We went there today (Friday ) afternoon. 
The food was okay. They don't accept hdfc prepaid food card, which is very strange ! When I asked why they could not give a reason, so make sure you have a backup when you go there. 
The dessert spread was sumptuous. All in all it was okay. I felt is over hyped. Might not go there again as better options are available in the city for similar price range!

I visited this wonderful place yesterday with my wife for dinner and boy, was I amazed at the magnificent fare at display !

First I was confused as to what to go for which is when the young Manager, Aporve,  a very warm and friendly guy, approached us. Thanks to him, we got the one of the best seats towards the glass, overlooking the foyer. He explained to me very precisely what was where since I had admitted to him that I didn't know where to start. 

We were being attended to by 2 young stewards , Gaurav and Samjana. I went for the salad spread first. To say that it was elaborate would be an understatement. With the number of DIY ingredients on display,which might as well go up to 100 if you counted, there was Seafood Salad, Chicken Salad, salamis of 2 types, bacon wrapped in pineapple, etc. I was floored by this and took careful helpings of each so as to experience the entirety of it. Good stuff. Also upon request, Gaurav got me smoked salmon that wasn't on the spread. Went perfectly with the seafood salad I was having.

From salads I moved on to the Italian Live Kitchen where I customised a spaghetti Alfredo with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, olives, chicken and broccoli. The wonderful chef who was there  (I've forgotten the name) did the perfect job of it. Another very helpful steward called Duss  ( Again, I might have misspelled this) insisted that I relax at the table while the chef prepares it. He was good with the ingredient suggestions and the dish that reached my table was easily one of the best pastas I have had till date - this is coming from a man whose favourite pasta sauce is marinara. The extra parmesan on top was part of the magic that had been cooked up. I LOVED IT.

Adjacent to the above stood the Oriental Asian Live Kitchen with its full fare of raw ingredients on display, looking like it's Thai counterparts of Bangkok streets. The chef here behind the counter seemed a little confused (but he was good at his art which i later understood). But then a young chef called Abhishek who seemed to be in charge came to the rescue and helped me order a steaming bowl of rice noodles tossed with chilli garlic sauce with a pinch of oyster sauce and a lot of assorted seafood. I must mention how tender the squids were,which is something most places get wrong. This dish was very refreshing,made exactly like I wanted it. Nothing went wrong here. 

I was enjoying this dish when Chef Abhishek came up and insisted that he make a small steak for me,just for me to taste. Inspite of asking him to not take the extra trouble,he really went out of his way to get me 2 small medium rare pieces of steak. I didn't expect medium rare to actually be medium rare. At places I eat,it hardly ever is. It is either too raw with blood flowing (read flowing-not oozing) out. Wonderfully enough, this one was the perfect medium rare. Accompanied by grilled baby carrots and Asparagus shoots, the presentation of this steak was so rustic, so stimulating yet it came with a finesse not seen before by me. A regular Bengali like me mostly haunts Park Street for steaks but this was way way better. 

My wife who is much less adventurous than me when it comes to eating out had gone for some chicken tikka salad and chicken ham. By the time I was done making fun of her for piling up biriyanis and dum cooked mutton and various other regular stuff off the menu (yes they had this as well - a wide array of the Indian's comfort food like naans, daals, sabzis etc), the manager Aporve approached our table with 2 glasses full of what i later came to know was a virgin Watermelon Mojito which was probably the most innovative and refreshing virgin Mojito I have ever had. I told him there that this was the best. I was so excited and i guess he didn't believe me when I said it but again,for the record,it was the best non-alcoholic mojito I have ever had in 28 years of my life.

By the time this ended, we were stuffed full till our necks so bad that I was probably breathing out food when came the final surprise of the evening, a dessert that was vanilla ice cream perched on a chocolate cake with a molten chocolate core reached our table. It turns out that we were so busy having a time of our lives that the dessert buffet had closed. Upon asking Gaurav about the desserts, the manager overheard us and got us  this.  This was so good that I probably had to stuff it down my ears but nonetheless we finished it. Fun Fact : The green bowl these desserts came in had a brown bottom and I mistook that for chocolate and I tried to scrape it off. 

All in all, a wonderful place to dine in. The buffet fare is HUMONGOUS. The staff are excellent. Special mention to Aporve, Gaurav, Samjana, Duss and Chef Abhishek to aid us in having an awesome evening. Shall be dropping down soon since the pocket pinch is only about Rs. 1200 for a person... this deal's a steal !

Visited the restaurant two days back and was quite disappointed to spot a huge spider right beside where we were dining. The restaurant has failed to live up to its status of a five star. Hygiene is an essential element when dining at any place be it at home, a cafe or a five star restaurant. I would not recommend dining at the JW Kitchen till they work on the quality of their service and hygiene.

One cannot miss out this place if you like to have buffets.
This is a rising star wen it comes to buffet spreads in town. Offering a 48course buffet at just 950 (on weekdays) and 1300 (on sundays) exclusive of tax.
We went there on a rainy sunday afternoon for lunch and oh boy!! We were really spoilt for choices the spread is so so huge u cannot taste all the sections in  one visit. With an array of live counter ranging from noodles and pasta to desserts. The dessrt spread is equally vast with one table filled woh indian sweets and another dedicated to western confections. Salads spread is diverse. Actually to say the truth u cannot describe the spread briefly. The ambience is very good. The waiters are very well behaved. Though it was a full house on sunday but the service was quiet fast. Definitely coming down once more to complete what was left untasted!!

Ambience was similar to a 5 star. But food needs lots of improvements based on my buffet experience.
1. They need to work on the starters. Very few items with boring tastes. Lot's of buffet places will beat them any day in starters.
2. Main course was good. But pasta and noodles counter was very slow..they took 30 mins for each. And very few choices. Only veg options for pasta.
3. Salads and cheese sections are innovative and one of the high points of the buffet
4. Desert was good, but indian deserts need to be better than small sweetshops found anywwhere in thr city

Went there a couple of days ago with a group of 5 friends (including me) on a dinner buffet. Now, JW Marriott has been the new buzzword amongst friends in Kolkata, and being there is 'cool' in itself among the youth fraternity. With all the raving reviews I had read and heard from a lot of acquaintances about the food, I was quite excited to experience the place myself. Needless to say, I had really high expectations. Spoiler alert: I was disappointed.
The hotel is located just adjacent to ITC Sonar Bangla, near Science City, one of the most recognizable landmarks of the City of Joy. The entry into the JW premises was smooth, with the security on its toes taking just a couple of minutes to check our car. Entering the hotel took another couple of minutes with the regular security checkings of us and our bags. So, in all it took us around 5 minutes from the main gate of JW Marriott to finally step foot into JW Kitchen, which is no big deal in my opinion.
Coming to the infrastructure, I fell in love with the exterior glass facade as soon as I saw it. It's one of the differentiating factors of the hotel, and looks really beautiful. The interior decor, complete with the ravishing chandeliers, beautiful flooring, use of glass everywhere screamed CLASS and 5 STAR all the way. Coming to the dinner, we ordered a dinner buffet. Being a vegetarian, i found the choices in terms of food quite limiting. There was nothing extraordinary, with just regular food items on the menu. For starters, chilly baby corn, and paneer tikka sizzled our stomachs hut failed to impress in terms of taste, setting the tone for whole dinner that was awaiting us that night. Street food like chat and raj kachori followed the starters and filled the buffer time we had as we moved to the main course. For main course we were mostly limited to fill our stomachs with North Indian delicacies like Cheese and garlic Naan, Dal makhni, malai kofta, dum aloo. Other than these, there were foreign regulars such as Pastas and Chowmein which were made on demand as per the customer's choices. Again, nothing special in terms of taste here. Feeling quite disappointed we moved on to fill the last of our hearts with desserts hoping to find some magic here. We came across some fruits before desserts and gave them a try. Again, the selection of fruits was very limited. They included dragon fruit, guavas, pineapple, cherries. Desserts didn't completely disappoint us. Some were good, some were just okay. In particular, my favourites such as mudcake, chocolate tart, cupcakes, waffles, blueberry cheesecake helped me leave a decent aftertaste of the restaurant. Talking of the service, i have mixed feelings about it. While the cleaning process was quite prompt, the staff picked up used plates from our tables very often and without us asking for it, we had a hard time ordering sides like water, and onions or extra Chowmein. Really, we had to call for the staff for like 5 times to get one glass of water. For a new 5 star hotel in a city its unacceptable. Overall, I have mixed feelings about JW in Kolkata. While the ambiance and desserts were amazing, food and service was average at best. I'd like to give one more chance to JW to see whether it was just a bad day at the hotel, or is it really limited to this much, because i had set high expectations before coming. Well, I guess it is true what they say, "Expectations hurt."

The 4 rating is just for the ambience. We had opted for the buffet. The buffet has a huge spread, starting from starters, cold cuts, cheese,fruits, biriyani desserts and what not. Food is nothing great over here tastewise except for few dishes. What I liked the most among so many dishes were the fish starter, chicken biryani which was awesome, the lamb curry, mud cake and baked rosogolla. The main course were better in taste compared to desserts and starters. We also had the white sauce pasta and chat from the live counter, the pasta was very tasty. There were waffles but the ice cream was missing. Overall definitely the ambience was superb after all it is JW üòé but the quality of the food isn't great.

What I personally feel is.. a bit of variety in starters is required. Had the grilled chicken for the first time, it was so juicy and well cooked with almost no spices and still tastes so much delicious. Best buffet obviously. A thumbs up. Will be visiting soon.

Everything present from bhelpuri to papri chat to kababs.. Biriyani.. Dal bati churma.. Rosemary chicken.. Cajun spiced potato.... Live counters serving pastas.. Noodles with ingredients of your choice.. A customer is spoilt for choice. But what i felt was that the food could have been tastier.. It was nothing extraordinary.. There was also a fresh fruit counter.. Dry fruits were also on display. All of a very good quality. The cheeses were wonderful.. The last but my most fav section was the dessert section.. Hot waffle served with cold ice cream was my favourite... Then the mud pie..i dont know how many i can mention separately. All mouthwatering.

People got really confused to choose from them. Veg and non veg both item are good. North indian dis, Italian, thai, Continental everything were good. There was also a live cooking corner for noodles and pasta. And lastly dessert are toooooo good. Lots of options.u can't cover full dessert in one meal. At last it was a nice experience.

Went for Sunday Brunch on 16th July 2017. Cost per person (including GST): Rs. 1500/- (approx)

Food: 4/5. Variety is immense and everything generally tasted very good. Definitely worth it given the competitive price. The chowmein (live counter) was particularly underwhelming. Alcohol was unlimited. Enough options for all kinds of eaters. Recommended: Mutton seekh kebab, chilli chicken tangdi, all the breakfast items, chaat counter, macaroons.

Service: 4.5/5. Excellent and prompt service. No complaints as such except that they failed to note that it was an anniversary occasion (eventhough I had mentioned that explicitly during the table booking).

Ambiance: 3/5. Seating for 4 is right in the middle. There is generally a decent amount of commotion due to this being a buffet. Expected a bit better ambiance but understandable given that it's a buffet. The general lobby area is at par with any 5-star hotel.

Overall: 4/5. Overall experience was great. Would definitely recommend it to others but I personally feel like this is a "once a year visit" type place.

May be the ambience and the decoration are highly appreciated, but foods quality are so poor that we couldn't even finished our whole dishes...
Staffs are good, but idk how they have given us those poor quality of dishes....
Fried rice was so disgusted in taste that we would forget the real delicious taste of any kinda rice, trust me we never had so bad chilli chicken in our life...
Soup, that was totally awful, smelled like rotten eggs and tasted like a mixture of water and huge amount of salt...
The only thing was good was Cold drinks,
We took 4 7UP and 3 Pepsi, It was cost around 2000 +GST..
I had never been experienced with such foods...
I m done with #JWMarriott, this was the last time I had been there with my family.
One more thing, when they came to know about the foods quality, they were begging us to take some deserts for free... Coz they knew those dishes were totally uneatable ...
Thank you #JWMarriott #JWKitchen for this amazing experience...

They have a huge range and variety of food in starters and main course.. around 47 in approx.. and there were about 25 different kinds of desserts...dessert counter was heaven for any sweet tooth people. i love their mutton dish too.. and live counter was treat for your stomach... Food quality is fabulous..

They have a huge range and variety of food in starters and main course.. around 47 in approx.. and there were about 25 different kinds of desserts... It's a treat for your stomach... Food quality is fabulous.. the place usually stays crowded but if you book a table or you get a place ...you will forget the rest and concentrate on the food... They also have live pasta and noodles counter which is amazing... Overall must visit guys....

We went there to celebrate our parents marriage anniversary. The staffs were very courteous.
They gave a complemantary anniversary chocolate cake which was delicious.
This place offers you some tasty starters and desserts. If you are a dessert person, you are definately gonna fall in love with this place.
There is live counter which serves noodles and pasta.
I loved the dessert counter.

Excellent ambience, lots & lots of options of food of every type one can think of. And every item had the right taste. Obviously we tried the Sunday lunch buffet. And it was a get together of college friends & turned out to be just great! Do book a table in advance, for inspite of the high charge, its always full well in advance. Whatever your taste bud asks for, just go for it!

Buffet, buffet, buffet! Yes, please don't miss it. You get all, I repeat, all sorts of food at just the right price. Starting from starters to the main course and the desserts, it's impossible for you to leave anything. One big yes if you're a foodie, it's a mountain of food.

Visited there on a weekend. First of all booking on weekends are must or else there is no guarantee that you will find any table. Right from the moment you enter the gate you will fall in love with the ambience. I honestly didn't find the staff behaviour very warm and friendly. They were behaving almost like robots as if they were programmed to say "namaste" on entry. Maybe my expectation was too high. There is a huge spread of buffet where you will find starters, indian dishes, live counters for chowmein and pasta, desserts. Foods were fresh and tasty. Desserts were mindblowing. If you are a dessert person you will fall in love with this place.

Food was not at all well prepared especially as it is a star category hotel. Mocktails seemed to be a homemade preparation with some ice water and sugar thrown into any glassware available. Kebabs were a struggle to cut and chew and same dissapointment proceeded with items catering with fishes. In short the management should seriously give a thought about the taste buds of customers if they need to persist for long in kolkata.

This was my second visit here . My first visit was for the lunch buffet with my friends. This time we cousins opted for the Dinner Buffet. Though I was pretty much familiar to the dishes, live counters and tables ; there were many new additions this time which surprised as well as delighted the foodie in me. There were endless starters, salads, continental, Asian, Indian dishes and desserts as well , but those which are really remarkable are-
1) The welcome drink, which was a Mint Mango Slush. Refreshing, fruity and delicious , it was a true surprise for us
2) The Salad table with unending options of veg, non veg, dips, sauces, mayos and what not.... This time they had heaped up pieces of roasted chicken, poached fish , boiled shrimps and boiled eggs... Not to forget their yummy Hummus and Lamb Salad
3) The starter section this time was separate and had many options in chicken, fish, paneer but what I loved most is Crumbed Zucchini, stuffed with cottage cheese with a perfect crispy coating.
4) The Whole Roasted Chicken with baby potatoes, carrots and onions was a clear winner. The chicken was charred outside, soft and succulent inside with a rich, buttery flavour.
5) Asian Flat noodles (Pad Thai style, tangy in taste with squid, tofu, chicken, shrimps and egg) and Chicken Risotto (creamy, cheesy, Herby and flavourful) are a must-have from the live counters.
6) Lastly for the desserts, It is undoubtedly the dessert lovers' paradise. I lost count of the items but I tasted each dessert and loved them. However, the most delicious among them were Cashew Fudge, Crem√© Brulee, Red Velvet Cake and Fruit Sable. No words can describe the taste of them.
The awesome dinnner came for a whopping Rs. 1300 AI per head, not at all bad for a luxury dining experience and when choices are so many to opt from. Overall a hugely satisfying experience. Looking forward to come soon again.

Cosy ambience. They spoil you for choices. Starters like the main course is part of self service. For serious foodies, there's veg biryani, paneer koftas, mutton saalan and chicken barbecues. For Chinese food, there's noodles.... You tell the chef what to add and mention your table number. It's usually served on time at the table.
Don't waste time on salads counter, nothing interesting... Unless you are watching weight... In that case, you should not be there in the first place. 

The Pasta counter offers preparations with the combination you select yourself. That there's pork may gall some foodies.

Go easy on the desserts. Though I know most foodies will try everything. Go ahead it's your money. Tea and coffee is not part of buffet. At Rs 1121, it's on the expensive side. But hey trying it out once is OK

Sunday dinner...A royal dinner I would say. Starter and deserts are just excellent. Crispy chilli chicken I preferred. There are some love counters of pasta chowmien where you can choose toppings and ingredients according to your wish. Palak potato and dal bari churma, and chicken tikka kebab in the main course were superb. In deserts Choco Waffle with choco sauce and toppings you can select. Deserts options are uncountable

We decided to visit ¬†J.W Mariott for a special occasion: ¬†to celebrate the new job of a close friend. And the great experience we had there totally justified the decision!

Firstly, the seating area is great, situated inside the giant glass dome like structure that's probably the first thing you notice as you approach the hotel. Interior decor is simple & elegant, & the tables are arranged so that even when the restaurant gets packed( & you can rest assured that it will be packed in some time), you don't have to shout to make each other hear above the background noise!

Coming to the food- the spread was huge, & it was a normal weekday lunch too, no special occasion. I have been to New Years special Brunches at prestigious hotels that had smaller spreads than this! Traditional Indian starters & mains, extensive salad bar, cold cuts, cheeseboard, large breadbasket, farm fresh fruits, live cooking stations- there was something for everyone , And that's without mentioning the heavenly dessert selection!

I loved most of the Indian starters. Roast chicken was good too, The pasta & seafood noodles that we ordered from the live stations were perfect- cooked just the way we had ordered them. There were bite sized Burgers & sandwiches which we tasted in between heavier dishes-which were great. Only the ham sandwich was slightly dry. Some of the cheese flavors that were display, I tasted for the first time here. ¬†As for the desserts, they were divine. Berry Glace, the miniature cupcakes, the made to order waffles, everything was perfect. The only dessert that I did not like was a middle eastern dish: called Omali as far as I can recall.

As I was walking out: my only regret was that there were still several items that I had not managed to taste. But even then, we were so full that we had to sit in the lobby for several minutes before we could walk properly!

And all this for a fairly reasonable price tag. Totally VFM.

Visited the place yesterday for lunch buffet. Ambience and decoration were awesome but the taste of food was unexpectedly poor. Schezwan chicken in starter was totally tasteless. In starter, only paneer tikka was good. Main courses were average. Dessert was better than main and starter. The brownie was very good in taste.

Eating good food is my favourite thing in the whole world.'Mission To Marriott' is a long awaited plan which finally happened.J W Kitchen is right now Kolkata's one of the most diverse buffet restaurant.They used to serve classy and variety of food items.

Ambience: Situated in the ground floor of the J W Marriott Hotel, Kolkata. There is an eye glittering arcade where you can relax or wait and take selfies. The corridor is scintillating. The restaurant area is also huge, we got the table near the glass wall and it was raining outside which gives us goosebumps, heavenly feeling.

Foods: A large variety of food you will get their from Aloo Tikki to Papads,from Burgers to Pastas,from Biriyanis to Noodles, from vegetable salads to fruits and they maintain a heterogeneity in it. There is everything for every other person. The items me and my friends have tried are like,in starter Kalonji Mahi Tikka, toothsome, fish with nigella seeds and cooked in Clay oven. Schezwan peeper chicken was delicious and excellent in taste, must try. Butter tossed exotic vegetable was quite good as well as spiced potatoes. Only the pure in heart can make a good soup, soups are enjoyable. Pan Seaked Fish with Caper Butter sauce was not so tasty and didn't like the smell also. One should try Roast Chicken with Mushroom Jus, it's amazing. In main course Dum Murgh Biriyani was awesome and mouthwatering,rice are properly cooked and chicken too, but the aloo(potato) dissapointed us. Chicken Chaanp is not delicious at all. There are varieties of pastas, you will have to tell your choice of sauce and vegetables in the pasta counter and they will serve it after cooking in your table,same process is also applicable for noodles. Our white sauce pasta was lipsmacking and divine. Salads are average. Don‚Äôt miss the Burgers.

Dessert is my comfort. If you are a dessert lover ,J W Kitchen is your ideal place, plenty of desserts are there and every dessert was mind blowing,nothing to complain in this portion, just brilliant. Cupcakes were beautiful and yummy. One should try their Banana Cremauxe, Summerberry, Kye Lime Tart, Chocolate Cherry Pie, Apple Tart Normande, you should not miss their Baked Yogurts, Raspberry Eclair is wonderful, highly recommended. Different types of sweets were there as well as ice creams.You can try their Gulab jamoons, they were soft and tantalizing.

Management: The management is well behaved, gentle, friendly in nature, they will treat you like their home guests. Services are fast, will instantly collect your plates once you finished.

As we visited on the very first day of the introduction of GST,so we were not sure about the taxes which we have to pay.They only charged 18%(cgst 9% and sgst 9%)on the total bill. It's fair enough. 

Foods quality can be better in the starters and main course,I hope they will work on it. Overall experience to dine first time in a five star restaurant is just over the top. Afterall One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well. Thank You J W Kitchen-J W Marriott Kolkata.

In a short cut way just Fabulous! Just amazing! Everyone should try this buffet once! Delicious foods in buffet, 3live counters for noodle, pastas and chats and unlimited delicious items in desert! In one word SUPERB! 
Just one thing they wouldn't serve that is complimentary drinks, so that i took virgin mojito 2glasses  along with buffet and it's cost was like 2900 (a.i) for two! 
That's it! Thank you!

the worst 5 star hotel i have ever been in Kolkata. The first time I went there with my bike, they told me I am not allowed to go to the basement for parking as girls are not allowed to go to the basement parking implicating that their hotel parking is not secured for girls. but then we were hungry and the guy Krishanu served us well that I couldn't complain.then for the 2nd time we went there today to have breakfast and as soon as we entered into the hotel they said we are not allowed to have breakfast as the whole restaurant is booked for some group whereas the whole restaurant was empty and no one was there. I understand that some group has booked the whole place and outside guests are not allowed but how can you say NO to your guests being a 5 star international hotel. They should have arranged something somewhere else for outsiders,but they can never say NO to their guests being a 5star. I have been to every other 5 star hotel and never faced such kind of inappropriate welcome. I will never go there 3rd time and will not recommend it to anyone at least not in Kolkata.

Had been on my bucket list for quite some time, so finally pestered my father to take us there to celebrate their anniversary (date of visit: 21.06.2017).
Knowing the occasion, they offered to give us a (complimentary, I guess?) chocolate cake. But since mother vehemently dislikes chocolates, we declined it (though love the gesture!)
We were seated, and a person came forward to give us a little heads up about what was on offer as we had opted for the buffet option, with a pro tip: don't stuff too much because you'd not want to miss the desserts. And thank God we took his suggestion!
Not even going to attempt naming all the dishes because there were SO MANY, but I loved the live noodle counter, cheese section, chilli mushroom and baby corn (though I don't opt for vegetarian dishes ever!), the mutton side dish (I don't remember the name), the chicken in red wine jus, and of course, the desserts!
The only mistake we made was to arrive well into the lunch hour (nearly 2pm), so by the time we finished the main course, only 2 mins were left to wrap up. So letting aside any trace of shame the glutton in me had, I filled up my plate with all the desserts I could stuff on it, but MISSED THE MUD CAKE because they refilled it only at the last minute and I couldn't reach it in time (damn). üòî
Will definitely go back because that Mud Cake beckons me and it is any foodie's paradise!
And quoting my father: "they made the poor man's dream of dining in a 5 star hotel come true". So thank you for a memorable visit. üíù

I finally ended up visiting the much talked about buffet of the town and rightly so.. They do stand up to  all the expectations and they went a step ahead .. Ambience, decor, and feel needs no mention as it is extremely serene and beautiful.. the spread laid out is insane.. you need to have 3 visits to be able to atleast taste everything on the menu.. do save room for deserts as they are the showstopper.. you wouldn't want to regret it later.. it's like crazy endless spread of ooi gooi goodness happening on the desert section.. However vegetarians you might not like the starters as it's very basic and you definitely would have had better in various places but trust me the desert will make up for everything..

A very overrated place. it's only good for a photo shoot. The ceaser salad was tasteless because they used very little ingredients for dish.. you can hardly find any mayonnaise..But the chicken pieces with it was good though. Fish and chips - the fish was STALE.. quite unexpected from a place like this.. Rose wine was good. Deserts were not that good either.

Pros- Great ambiance.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Great buffet
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Wide range of dessert
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Cold starters are fabulous

Cons- You have to pay in advance for table booking, seriously!!??!!... Its unprofessional.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Main courses (Buffet) are not that interesting.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† You can easily spot difference of quality of taste between buffet and √† la carte foods.
                    

Overall its costly compared to the food's quality...

Visited this restaurant for a sunday brunch with some friends and boy was it a feast suited for a king!

We were seated and first asked for our preference of beer or sangrias and were delighted to hear that the alcohol would be free flowing. We had our drinks and started working across the buffett. This is how that went down:

Salad bar - I started from the salad bar which had a lot of fresh options, pitted olives, variety of dressings (common and uncommon ones), cold cuts of meats, marinated fruits and vegetables (I absolutely loved these, they were too good!) and other diced up vegetables mixed with assortment of things including cheese. The cheese bar was well equipped and the chef nearby was kind enough to help me pick out the best pairings for the different cheeses I tried, the mozarella and ricotta were really fresh and I finally got to try blue cheese and have come to the conclusion that it is not the cheese for me!

Live counters - There were a variety of live counters including a noodle counter, shawarma counter, pizza counter and even a waffle counter. Sampled the shawarma counter and the pizza counter and came back delighted by the offerings.

Main course - The main course offering was mainly Indian but I was in no mood to try all of it, so instead, I just ate the mutton biryani which was HEAVENLY. Absolutely brilliant and a must have if you do visit.

Desserts - As we all know, this is the most important part of any buffett and JW Kitchen NAILED it. They did a spectacular job with the desserts and I hope that the pastry chef hears about this!

All in all, it was a great experience, the service was impeccable and our server didn't give us even a tiny scope of complain. That's what great service is about! It worked out very cheap for us compared to the offering, definitely visiting again.

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram or Facebook. (Same name in both places)

Leaving aside the luxury the hotel exhibits, the restaurant was very basic. Not that the food wasn't good or the service wasn't prompt but it was very usual. Not something you should expect out of a 5 star brand name. The buffet had a variety of options though. But the food wasn't outstanding.

Visited JW Kitchen on the 22nd of June for my mum dad's anniversary....we went for buffet dinner.
It was a wide spread of delicacies which included delicious curries..aromatic biryanis...lots of green leafy salads ....live counters.... mouthwatering n tempting desserts...n lots more!
We being strictly vegetarian njoyed the veg spreads! 
We were at table no.27 n was taken gud care by a courteous staff naming Amit! Who helped us n provided us with watever we wanted!
Nothing to say about the ambience as all knows it is superb n impeccable!
Jus had one thing in mind...dat was ..the buffet was spread in such a manner dat the veg n the non veg items were placed quite closely because of which the aroma of non veg items were lil got mingled with the veg items...because of which my mum being a strict vegan didn't njoy the food much rather didn't had dinner properly! So my humble request is if u can try to change the placement of the dishes according to veg n non veg sections! I guess it's gonna help lots of ppl who r strictly vegan!

This beautiful place will take your breath away! We went for the dinner Buffet at 7 on a Saturday. JW Marriott itself is so utterly breathtaking and we spent some time marvelling at the luxe interiors. The management guides you to your table inside this massive Kitchen and there's way too many dishes to choose from. It's actually a struggle deciding which ones to pick because you can't have it all which is a shame. Amazing variety in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, there's something for everyone. And when you finally sit down to eat, the taste is impeccable! A special shout-out to the dessert section which is a haven for foodies with a sweet-tooth. Oh I'm never forgetting that lime tart and that creme brulee! There were so many dishes we never got to taste because we were already so full. The service is excellent, the gorgeous ambiance is to die for. Wow...what an amazing unforgettable experience! I cannot wait to come back here again!

New in town, this was my first at this place. 
They have an expansive menu on the buffet. There were live counters for pasta and noodles. They
had a live chaat counter too :) 

An entire table spread just for salads. Mix it up yourself or they have some already tossed and kept. 
Starters had two chicken preps., one of lamb, one of potato and another of vegetables. 
Main course had around 12-15 options. The ones I had were Butter chicken (creamy and perfect), Yoghurt fish (good enough), Lamb rohan gosht (not done well). there were decent no. of veg options. There was biriyani which was surprisingly good and the aloo roasted to perfection. 
The best for the last. Mariott kitchen is famous for its desserts. And God were they heavenly. Pies, tarts, pastries, creme brule, waffles, muffins and not to forget traditional bengali sandesh. We didn't try Ice cream. 
We had taken mocktails (which they said were their speciality). 
Thumbs up for having Khakra and chutneys :3

This is my second visit to the newest hotel in kolkata.
This time me and my brothers decided to drop in at the jw kitchen for the huge lavish buffet spread.
     The spread is so huge that i cannot individually review everything but i can tell you what i liked the most. 
Fish kebab - this is the best thing in the starter option... Tender fish marinated in mustard.
Bun with butter - the bun was very soft and fresh and was amazing. 
Pasta in white sauce - this was awesome, i asked the chef to add extra mushrooms and cheese and man it was damn tasty. 
Pan fried noodles - this was also very good. Specifically because of the live pan fry, hot and smoky.
Chicken butter masala - this was also amazing. Tender chicken in thick chicken gravy made to perfection.
 Desserts - apple pie ... Cakes .... Waffles .... Mud pie .... Tarts ..... Muffins .... everything on the dessert spread‚Äã tastes like heaven i couldn't taste all but I'll be back to taste more. 
   Rest all the items were average ..... I think the nihari ghost and the biryani could have been way way better.

This was my first visit to the JW Marriott Calcutta and to be honest I did have a few expectations ! Was giving my parents a treat , so arrived for the lunch buffet around 1.30 pm ! We were pleasantly greeted at the entrance and escorted to our table ! The ambience, decoration, attitude of staff is indeed commendable !
Speaking about the food , the starters were very good, each of them , but the variety was missing !
The main course was fine ; I say fine cause the lamb and chicken were brilliant , but the fish was not up to the mark!
Well, now desserts! Nothing much to say here, except the fact that probably this was the best dessert spread I ever found in Calcutta! I honestly have never came across such variety and each and every dish in the dessert was exquisite !
If not for anything else , give the JW Marriott a try for the service, ambience and the dessert !

Thank you JW Marriott, Calcutta, it was a pleasure to have lunch at your place !

I am pretty regular at the JW Marriott Juhu so was pretty convinced and aware of their services which are top notch to say the least, so while my visit to kolkata I thought of giving the kolkata Marriott a try. As we all know Marriott buffets and their deserts are too die for, kolkata was equally enthralling an experience as Bombay has always been to me!Awesome food absolutely 5star service. Our chef Mainak deserves a special mention because though we didn't have sea food in the menu at the lunch buffet and over the phone somebody misinformed me that they do, especially for us he got a spicy prawn dish made which was sumptuous ! Krishanu a thorough convivial gentleman who was serving us deserves a mention as much! He was polite, responsive and extremely congenial and super cooperative ! He further deserves an additional mention because he made us special coffees too which were brilliant, Marriot is a must visit if your are in kolkata! I will rate them 4.5 so that they don't get complacent! Otherwise they deserve a 10 on 5!

This review was due for long, as I was a bit skeptical whether I should write about this place or not. The things is I am sure I will be a bit biased with my review about this place, but lest aside all those and let's try to tabulate my experience here.

How to be here : If you are on the em bypass you can see this place standing tall within 700-800m after you cross the Chingrighta crossing. Travel to this place is very easy, board any public transport going towards Garia via. EM bypass and they can drop you at this place or can take a 20-25min Uber/Ola ride to reach this place from Ultadanga. For those who have private transportation at their disposal may put the destination on the Google map and wallah, you are there in no time, provided how hungry you are for your meal. :D 

Ambiance : The place into terms of ambiance is soothing. Probably if you have a pre booked table for you, you might not have to wait for long and cannot straight away move into the dining area and start gorging on the savorous food. In case you don't have a pre-reseved table, you might have to wait for a while and can enjoy the serene indoors of this place. The lounge like waiting areas are pretty good. Can have your selfies in the meanwhile on the couch and near the large bell chimes. 

Staff : Extremely courtois, actually they have to be. JW are the best in the business, and given that the name they earned in the past, they won't just let it down anyway. We got a table at one of the corners at this place, just so that we don't feel deprived, people came to us at regular intervals and were asking for reviews on food, hospitality and all stuff, pretty much happens every where but still felt good (told you review would be biased one). Helpful people. 

Food : Opted for the lunch buffet, the food menu was kind of okayish. Grilled fish and vegetables with chicken and paneer kebabs as starters, decent main course with biriyani, plain rice and sides of chicken, mutton and fish, the live counters serving pasta, noodles and roti of your choice was a plus though. Deserts were surplus, long list to choose from starting from pastries, custards, bengali misti, waffles and what not. Can't forget the ice cream parlor. The food was savoury and delicious to mention. 

Overall : JW in itself is a class predefined. The introductory buffet at 1145/- is quite a bargain. So as long as they are serving at that price I would urge people, please go and enjoy your share of luxury dining at its best.

Have been there twice already. And each time I was mesmerized by the food and service. The desserts are amazing! And so is the salad. The ambience is worth a mention. And the price is very reasonable. Overall a very nice experience.

It's a Massive spread. Starters are unique and diverse. Main course spread is equally large. Desserts are amazing. Food is nothing extraordinary though. Not a must visit as far as I'm concerned.

My first experience was better than the 2nd time......anyways buffet spread is good........the deserts are really mouthwatering...........decor and sitting arrangement is also good. But as per my stay in J W Marriott, Jaipur, I expected courteous staff and warm hospitality here.......but here in Kolkata It's not same.

1. The staffs recruited are top class. They will know what you would need before you could speak. It seems that they are trained to read your minds. They are courteous, well behaved and polite which you would expect from a brand like this. 
2. It has some of the best continental dishes in the starters section. The duck and pork preparation are simple yet delicious. The variety of expensive cheese at the counter is overwhelming. 
3. The fruit section is standard but was lacking mangoes which is a seasonal fruit. I expected some good local mangoes but in vain. 
4. Do try the variety of pickles. 
5. The prawns at the live counter was not fresh. I could determine by the smell. It seemed that it was kept frozen for a few days. 
6. The Indian main course had nothing new. Achari Tikka and biriyani were served along with some other dishes. 
7. The dessert section had a variety of options and all were good. 
8. The ice cream was limited to 4 different flavours and all were common. Nothing overwhelming. The chocolate ice cream tasted bitter. 
9. The ambience was classy and the service was excellent. 

I feel if the management could work on some different variety of food in the main course. We are all bored with almost the same main course menu in every buffet restaurant. Since you have opened a restaurant in the heart of bengal, we need a few varieties of fish to be added in the main course. It need not be bengali preparations but fish would work just fine. 

I would surely visit again to expect and explore more of JW kitchen.

Marriott is another good & reputated name in Luxury Hotels by JW Group. And JW Kitchen is holding its reputation by excellent buffet in the town.

Keeping a side that this place is huge, the ambiance of this place is modern, sophisticated & very much comfortable. Buffet spread across looks delicious & beautiful.

Buffet at JW Kitchen of Marriott is one of the best buffet I've tried among all the luxury hotels in Kolkata.  
Cold cuts, salads, variety of lovely cheese counters were top notch, giving the feeling of true luxury. Also Indian, Chinese, Thai & Continental spread with large variety of dishes gave the true multi cuisine experiance. Not only that live noodles & pasta counter over here adds another charm to the buffet. Each & every food over here tasted very good. But the best part of this buffet comes in the end. Dessert counter over here is something really brilliant & offers very delicious sweets for ultimate satisfaction of foodies.

This one is highly recommend & one of my personal favourite place. This place deserves each & every penny you spent over here. All total it is beyond extraordinary. A must visit for all the buffet lovers out there.

I have been to this place yesterday to celebrate my anniversary. Overall it was a nice experience. There were lot of options that hard to complete in one meal. They had lot of live counters and chefs were very fast. There were live counters for Asian, Chat, Pasta and Indian Breads.

Starter:
Crispy Chicken/ crispy vegetables with some sauce was good
Fish kebab with mustard was nice
Dahi Vada was just awesome
Past and Noodles were okay

Main:
Chicken was so good. Nicely cooked and soft
Biriyani was good too
Salt was very less in Paneer

Dessert:
Desserts were just awesome. It had so many options that you can not finish in one day. Rosogolla and sandesh were just king. Lot of muffins all are nicely baked. Tarts were good too.

I am giving 4 star because of couple of reasons.

1. Mutton was very hard and being a mutton fan it is very much disappointing.
2. They don't accept Food Plus card. Food card is nothing VISA prepaid card can be used for food purchases. It works even almost all the small restaurants as well. It was very surprising that Marriott like 5 start property does not accept this.

Sprwaled across a vast area and offering it's customers cuisines pan-continental... This place is better to be called a food park rather than simply a restaurant. It was my first experience of luxury dining so was looking forward to this... Table booking is a must( call them if u dont find available date on zomato,they will arrange..i did the same thing).
The place welcomes u with its sheer dazzling interior..floral themes..mirrored walls and panes..plush sofas and ever smiling and courteous staffs... Gonna win ur heart on the first attempt.
Buffet had two live counters ( italian serving risotto and spaghetti with sauce and add ons of ur choices) and another chinese ( about five types of noodles with every topping u can think of).. a main course counter with starters(2 veg and 2 non veg) and main course... One table with huge jars of achaars and gujrati cuisines...cheese of about 5-6 types.. different kind of breads... And a huuuge 'make -ur -own-salad' table...i actually lost count how many things was there on the table cause its impossible to eat everything even from one single table.
Apart from that the dessert section had separate wings for Western and Indian section... including rosogolla..goja..to tarts ecclaires and tiramisu.

Food was exceptionally good. Dessert section needs special mention cz i have never tasted such mind-blowing desserts for a very long time.
 Dont feel lost if u dont know what to eat there cz thats very natural..just seek out to the good samritans(the stuffs of course) there.;)

Lastly.. coming to the budget... Well quality does nlt come cheap and its aint exception here as well... We were four people and it cost around 4600 rs for lunch buffet on weekdays. But its worth giving a try if u want some unusual tastes on ur plate. 

Highly recommended place.. would definitely visit once again! :)

Cheers and happy eating!!

The occassion my daughters fifth birthday... the venue ofcourse JW Kitchen, the meal of choice the  JW buffet. 
Lets start with the decor ... very nice ... spacious , the table spacing is ample and gives u a languid kind of feel.
Courtesy is beyond belief ... very polite... from the security personnel to the servers are well mannered and extremely observant .. empty plates , empty glasses etc.
Food ... the variety is huge and unless you happen to be a garguantuan eater it is not possible to taste the entire fare. The cold cuts section is decent, the bread buns freshly baked, the salads are above decent, the starters that I had ( fish and chicken kebabs were well  made). The live Asian counter did blotch up my order but they are probably not aware as I chose not to make a fuss. The Mac and cheese from the live pasta counter was very nice. However the star of the buffer has to be their dessert section. Tarts, pies, payesh, cakes and so much more leave one spoilt for choice. My personal favourite was the French Apple pastry.

So why after such a good review do I rate it a 3.5 ... there was one thing that they did which I shall not mention nor did I create a fuss about as it was my daughters birthday and I did not wish to mar the occassion that left me unimpressed. 
Otherwise a good experience.

If I compare JW Kitchen with different restaurants of other 5 star hotels then it does not stand chance in front of others. Though its decor is magnificent and mesmerizing but due to the restaurant's location just left of the entrance, it is too crowded and noisy.  Could have had a better ambience experience in such a hotel. 

Now coming to the service, it is fast and very comforting.  I will specially like to mention Aman and Subhodeep in his team who made our dinner at JW more worthwhile. 

I loved the starters especially Paneer with the coating of papad. Never had this great a dish of paneer. I had a mocktail which had a passion fruit in it with rose flavor - loved the drink.  Main course didn't had a good impression on me.  Breads were not fresh and hot and the sabzi didn't have that exotic flavor. 

The whole experience is with the hotel decor which is no doubt the best in Kolkata :)

We went to JW kitchen for our anniversary lunchüòÄ. As I have heard it is really good. Though there was some confusion about the reservation but still we got place since it was weekday. So prior reservation is highly recommended. Ambience wise it is really good and since it is 5star the settings are likewise. We enjoyed the wide variety of buffet. Surprisingly it was quite crowded for a weekday. So stuffs were bit struggling but still somehow they managed. Now when it comes to food it covered all the varieties. But I enjoyed the desert section most. Price wise it will not make a big hole in your pocket (only in the weekdays, else in the weekend it willüòÄ)So I would definitely suggest this place to one who wants to go for special occasion meals.

Ever since its opening, JW Kitchen has created quite a stir among Kolkata foodies. So much so, that I tried and failed to land a table twice before. Finally got one for the Sunday brunch on father's day and now I know what the fuss is all about. Considering everything, the range of items served, the quality of food and service and the price, this is probably the best buffet in town.

Starting with the decor, it is modern and sophisticated, with sunlight streaming through the glass fa√ßade lending a certain vibrancy and dynamism to this place. The buffet spread is absolutely huge, covering mostly Continental, Indian, Chinese and Thai elements. Most importantly, they manage to maintain a very high standard throughout. It is not easy to serve dumplings and cold cuts and naans which are of equally high standard, but they manage it quite well. Last but not the least, the desserts are the true star of the show with a huge array of pastries, mousse, tarts, waffles, ice creams and Indian sweets on offer. They looked really attractive and tasted equally good. I wish they include the coffee as part of the standard buffet fare. Since the buffet already includes so much, why leave out the coffee ?

The restaurant was absolutely full, but despite that, the service remained prompt and efficient. The orders ended up on the right tables and the glasses were filled without prompting. Overall a nice experience at a price point which is very competitive with other 5 star properties.

This is the best 5 star buffet in Kolkata. The ambience is mesmerising. Also the staff is very courteous and remarkable hospitality. The food is marvelous and with the widespread of choices of cuisines it's hard to decide what to opt for. I had been here for a Sunday brunch and it was quite filled already. It is recommended to make a reservation though. There are few live counters for Asian, Italian, Shawarma and Chaat. Along with that the there are all kinds of Salads and Sauces for the calorie conscious. There is an Indian counter as well. But the best of all is the dessert counter. It's hard to leave any dish at all. From waffles to pie, macaroons to marshmallows, they have it all. This was by far one of the best lunches I've ever had. Totally recommended to drop by for amazing experience for all the foodies!!

As Marriott Vivera open its grand buffet spread for the people of kolkata, its time to pen down a vivacious details of both the place and of course the food. Landed in Marriott a couple of days back on the occasion of an office party, the place is absolutely grand. Coming directly to the food, the buffet spread was huge. Starting from  cold cuts, salads, variety of Cheese to a whole some main course ranging from Indian to continental and to wrap it up mouthwatering dessert. All of the items in the spread were nicely cooked , meats were tendor and juicy, the live counters were pretty quick. The dessert section are till now the best in the town loaded with pie, ramalai, cakes, muffins and everything that a foodie could ever ask for. All over a very good experience with pretty decent pricing but if you are someone who likes only Indian food then you might get a little less variety in starter and main course however the dessert won't disappoint you .

Wonderful experience after enjoying the lavish buffet dinner at JW Kitchen. As expected, they have a royal interior decoration and ambiance was just fabulous. Coming to food, the moment any one steps in, the whole heart will fill with joy and satisfaction looking at the overall presentation of all these dishes that they serve. In non veg, they have Prawn, Fish, Chicken, Mutton, everything, Pickles, Live pasta, chat counters, Breads, Biriyani, main course dishes, followed by the special Dessert section, which is the best among all and the amount with which u get all these in a 5 star hotel is unbelievable. Food taste was quite impressive, when it comes to starters and main courses, did not try the live Pasta counter, so not sure how they are doing in that. Few things I would like to share as feedback are given below:-

1) There is no soft drink/Lassi/Mocktails included in the buffet, at least something need to be done, as otherwise it allows customers to get rid of thirst by having plain water only
2) One Cold Prawn preparation is served in continental section, which I felt is just salted boiled Prawns and taste is not good at all
3) I feel that a refreshment counter to be made with something unique like Ice Pan or Pan masalas which contributes to a good experience at the end

Overall very happy to explore the new 5 star hotel and with their unmatched hospitality, I am sure it will be a great experience for all. Highly recommended to all my foodie friends....

Want to know, what the best place in for breakfast in Calcutta is?! This is it. Of all the places that have a breakfast buffet, the jw kitchen has not only the largest selection of food items but they are well done without exception. As someone who is very fussy especially about fruits the very first thing that makes an impression on me is the quality of fruits; while the choice of fruits in most breakfast buffets is the same(papaya, pineapple, some melons and some seasonal fruits), the fruits and fresh fruit juices here are delicious. But so is everything else. But, the biggest strength of this place is its staff.They are the most polite, efficient and prompt bunch of people ever. I hope the vibe and attitude of this place doesn't change.

Visited J W Kitchen yesterday. The 1st thing I want to mention is that it has an awesome ambience and some great interiors. Coming to the food it was below average. Considering a hotel of such high standard, such quality of food was not acceptable. Either the dishes were excessive salty or there was no salt at all. The menu was also average. The salads,both veg and non veg, were highly disappointing having no taste at all. Unexpectedly there was no prawn in the menu. The buffet is not worth 1145. Also the behaviour of the manager was not friendly. I had my grandmother with me and they provided a seat which was not suitable for her and they refused to change the seat at first inspite of plenty of available tables. My experience was not at all good and would never ever visit the place and also not recommend anyone.

Went this year may to celebrate my birthday 
Had one of the best birthday dinner in ages 
The  steward handling our table was quite professional and when he came to know it's my birthday he even gave us a complementary cake which was extremely sweet have been to so many fine dine and five star restaurants but no one took the initiative to know if I was celebrating a special occasion...i was highly impressed üòäüòä
The food was mouth watering and with so many varieties it's just impossible to taste it all...ü§£ü§£ü§£
Best buffet dinner I have ever had
Even the service was quite good given the kind of rush this restaurant has though a little brushing up of skills is required specially when serving wines and giving cutleries and glasses
Overall an excellent place for a lavish dinner with ample choices of cuisine to tantalize your tastebuds without burning a hole in your pocket
Good value for money a must recommended for food loversüòäüòäüòä

Most common reason why this place is so highly rated is definitely for its ambiance. The buffet spread is average but elaborate as expected. The salads are a bit disappointing and oh yes they serve cold soup which is just unacceptable. The main course is largely Indian which is again average. The desserts are however pretty good and the highlight of the buffet.¬†

Undoubtedly The Best 5 Star Restaurant I have ever visited in Kolkata. The interior and the ambiance is just beyond my expectation. I t is the 1st time I visited for my post Birthday celebrations and the experience was awesome. I enjoyed the dinner as I got so many variations with outstanding food. Our Table Manager was also very helpful. How can I forget the Desert? It owns my heart when I walked in the Desert section. Every foodie should visit and feel the great taste. You must book your table in advance or else you won't get it instantly as it is the Best 5 Star Restaurant of the city of joy. Great Service with awesome food and classic interior. Highly Recommended.

Well after 3 weeks of no reservation, I finally got the reservation and visited this outlet in J W Marriott. Definitely because of the price for the buffet you would not get any booking if you are planning to book before 5 days, take a minimum of 15 days in your hand or else you would be disheartened like me every time. It was my postponed birthday treat and I heard so good about this restaurant that I was very much excited. The decor of this place is nothing but classy and looks very much a 5 star restaurant. The spread of menu in the buffet is perhaps the best in the 5 star category hotels in Kolkata. The buffet has a spread of Indian and world cuisine and the combination is really worth it. The cold cuts are a real wonder with a variety of meats. The price at which they are serving the buffet and the quality of food in compare with the price I feel it is absolutely worth it. The only negative point is that the deserts are not replenished timely once it is over so you might miss few desert cause of that. But overall I would recommend this outlet highly.

The grandeur and opulence of Marriott will undoubtedly astound you. The interior is stunning to say the least. The buffet here stands out because unlike its contemporaries, here each item retains its individual taste and does not feel like just another one from the buffet-herd. From starters to main course to dessert, every item is exquisite. Stuff is courteous and highly professional. This place is a gem.

One the nicest place you can visit. The price compared to the quality of food is low. And the ambience and the hospitality rather the pampering you receive from the Manager and the hotel staff is astonishing.
In this case I would like to mention the name of the of the manager Mr. Sourav also credit goes to the chef also but I forgot his name.
On asking the manager with the help of the chef made two very beautiful dishes for us one was based on prawn and the other was on mutton. Seriously both was very very good.
More over the number of dishes they have in the menu list was very high. Like going for a Dinner or a lunch and having so many items just to taste is very difficult.
In short if you want quality food with very good hospitality and pampering a must visit place.

Innumerable items served..u cant decide from where to start and where to end.
The desserts are mind blowing. Never seen so many sweet dishes together before! 
Starters- Paneer Malai kabab, 5/5 , salt n pepper chicken- 5/5, Chicken tikka kabab-3/5 , crispy fried veggies - 4/5
Pasta live counter - pasta in white or red sauce with choice of veggies..5/5
Chaat section- Aloo tikka chaat, papri chaat, dahi vada, raj kachori..lip smacking!
Main course - chicken biriyani, veg dum biriyani, steam rice, mutton rogan josh, chicken makhani, fish curry, palak paneer, dal makhani, aloo gobi, all r good nothing special.
Dessert - Now thats the show stopper...cant describe in words about the uncountable and heavenly sweeties. The chocolate mud pie is best of the lot.
The ambience is royal and elegant.. service is 5/5 and even more than u expect. 
A must visit for the best buffet experience.

The restaurant awes you by its magnificent architecture the moment you step in. Half the battle's won right there. The elaborate spread leaves you overwhelmed and you're spoilt for choice. What makes matters difficult is each one of the dishes is cooked to perfection. And the waiters win you over with their pleasant behavior. I don't see anything this place lacks. You cannot visit this place just once.

Best 5 star Hotel's restaurant in Kolkata. Spread is by far the best in town. Quality is top notch. Service is absolutely superb. Decor is a Big Wow. Parking can't be a problem. Seating arrangement is good-it's better you book and reserve a table before hitting the place. CHEERS TO THE TEAM

My first 5* visit.It is better to book a table before hand as because during the lunch and dinner this place is always crowded.So you face inconvenience to get your table.Three of went there.We were greeted warmly.And the place was huge the ambience was mind-blowing.Then we moved towards the JW kitchen and to be honest we were confused.Where ever you look there is food.So we were obviously in a dilemma that are we going to take all of them?Are we allowed to do so? Anyway We were indeed so happy that we will be able to taste so many items with such varieties.Its a Must-VIsit place for the foodies.There were various sections of food.From Indian to Chinese to Italian including chaats and deserts.To be honest some of items tasted really good while others were so so.Next moving on to desert,well thats something incredible.They have so many items on desert.Each of them were perfect.You cannot miss the desert from JW.Finally the Staffs were good enough to cooperate.And I think the price is also quite reasonable to that of the large number of items they serve.

Went there on monday afternoon and opted for the lunch buffet.Had made a reservation for 2 beforehand so got the seats instantly.The buffet had such a huge variety of spread that one will surely get lost deciding what to have when ,.There is something for everyone-for the one who diets,for the health conscious one,for the chatpata food lover,for the indian food lover,for the continental food lover,for fruits lover,for the ghas phus eaters i.e.salad.Infact there is huge spread of aachars and different kind of cheese and buns.This is a Paradise for dessert lovers.The dessert section consists of a variety of more than 30 types.I made a mistake of not keeping any space in my stomach for desserts.But dont be a fool to do that.Mud cake,cupcakes,rashogollas were to die for!Overall a satisfying experience.
P.s.nothing gets served on the table.U have to go and bring your own food.Just in case of live food counters u order giving ur table no. And it gets served there.For 2 people the pocket pinch was 2289.

My sister and I were very excited to try out the restaurant on reading the reviews but little did we know that such a prestigious hotel will have such a weak management system. We had booked a table for lunch for Wednesday on Saturday and they informed us that the table was booked. Since it was the first time we were going there, we didn't know much about the procedure. We just called and they said it was booked. So on Wednesday when we were on our way, we called once again to inform that we were coming. But they told us that there was no booking in that name. We were surprised. We told them to check the register as we mentioned the date and time of booking. They were even reluctant to check the register or find out who was at the reception at that time. We asked if we could book then, they said we may come but it wasn't confirm that we would get a table. Then we asked if they could book our table for dinner, they said they were booked for the night. It is really disappointing that we had to suffer for a mistake of their management team. It's really disheartening‚Äã as we were expecting a great lunch but we came home with a heavy heart and empty stomach. Such carelessness isn't expected from such a reputed hotel.

A huge variety of food, with quality and perfection, great ambience and most importantly, it's not that costly too. I am looking forward for another visit as soon as I can. Loved it.

Visited JW Kitchen last Friday for guess what!! (Buffet of course!!) The assortments of dishes with decorations and ambience was overwhelming. There are 3 live counters, one for noodles, second for pasta and the third for chat. I liked to taste the three kind of cheese present (though the bread and pitta was not crunchy enough). Besides the salad table and table for desserts were too good. For a average middle class family, this is the closest seven star luncheon experience you can get!! It will set you back by 1500 INR per person( plus taxes) . But worth the experience. Highly recommend!!

JW Marriot is one of the most popular name among luxury hotels in Kolkata. 
Therefore it needs no introduction at all. 
JW Marriot provides a greatbuffet & offers various international cuisines.
The ambience of this place is extremely decent for corporate party to date with your special one. 
Ambiance over here only can be felt in real not by words.
Their service is excellent just as expected. 
¬†Price- it's ‚Çπ2500 including taxes for 2 so it's bearable but the liquor price are through the roof. 
Still it's a bit on higher side but the quality of food on offer u won't mind paying so much.
¬†North Indian , Chinese, Italian , Lebanese . I liked their noodles and risotto with Parmesan the most.Lebanese was bland. North Indian was also okay. . 
Desserts were wide ranged and good in taste. Their ice creams are a must have.
You can ask for any dish made of anything you are ever desired & there is a high chance they will not deny it.
Yes its really true. Live buffet spread across was very nicely presented.
I must say besides the classy, perfect ambience, the service is topnotch. They also served us a complimentary Chocolate for our special day. 
Altogether, it was an amazing night It is definitely on the top of my recommendation list.

The first thing that comes to my mind regarding this place is WOW and WOW!!!... A beautifully decorated lounge to welcome us ( that is expected though) and then the ambience of the resturant was mind blowing.. The staffs were courteous enough..
Coming to food, there were so many items that you just need  a guide to tell you which food section lies where.. We covered only 40% of the night's menu and we were highly full.. The starters.. Varieties of salads.. Pasta noodles the chineese section.. All were equally good.. And the  special mention is  the desert section.. Will visit another say to explore the desert section only..

I can only say that no say. Just go and experience the dining at this price tag of Rs. 1300 around including tax. Total 200 ITEMS!!! Famous dishes from around the world including India. I can guarantee, if some one take just spoonful of each item, belly will surrender much before finish. Quality of food is as per standard of this kind of eatery. Pretty rush... so need to book earlier...for weekend at least 7 days before...

One would always have high expectations while visiting a restaurant of this calibre. 

Food: Sumptuous. We went with the buffet. There were separate counters for Indian Snacks, Mediterranean, Thai/S.E. Asian, Cold Salads and an expansive variety of Indian dishes. Naans were served fresh from the tandoor. The dessert counter had two sections one each dedicated to european and Indian sweet dishes. The options were so numerous that a little bit of each is likely to leave you full. Each dish tasted fresh (no wonder since they are prepared in the open kitchen in front of guests) and was presentable and soothing to the eye as well. All dishes were spiced subtly which leaves your palate ready to keep on trying the next course. However, this may not be to the liking of foodies who are looking for an explosion of flavours from each bite.

Decor: Exactly what is expected of a place aiming to meet the best standard - comfortable and understated. It is a mix of linear design accentuated by the use of earthy colours. Look around and be pleasantly surprised by the use of metal bells as curtains and the work of wood and glass on the pillars. The drooping lamps overhead would remind you of the street lamps during the sixties.

Service: Quick, effective, efficient and above all discreet - professionals you would expect here.

Overall a very pleasant experience which we will like to revisit.

When we reached there they said that they eern't sure whether they could accomodate us as they give preference to their in house guests...I was lil dissapointed by the statement they made and as I was told waited for 10 mins...
After 10 mins we were being alloted our tables which was very sunny and we were literally sweating.
Coming to the food there was a huge variety of food cobering Indiaa Paratha.. Dosas.. and wat not..we were confused wat to eat and wat to leave..
The food and service is pretty amazing and finally made our day..
Breakfast buffet is a must try..

Only there are varieties of dishes but quality is very ordinary. Desserts are all tasteless. The noodles taste like street side chowmein shops. One time hopping there is okay. Even the staffs are not friendly. Every time we have call them for filling out our drinking water glasses, even if there is not much crowd. Ambience is good.

Had the lunch buffet which had three live counters-pasta,noodles,chaat,followed by cold salad-indian and international,main course which was mainly indian,breads and live counter items are served on the table. Finally the dessert section which for me was the best.There is a wide variety to choose from.All the items were delicious.Kudos to the pastry chefs.Tried cupcakes,cakes,pastries,waffles,icecream,mousse,etc. Although I feel the portions should be smaller because a lot of food goes to waste otherwise. The buffet doesn't include any drinks which is a downer for me.Otherwise it's a nice buffet.

We have visited JW Kitchen,  a part of JW Marriott, on  our 3rd Anniversary. It was a buffet with a huge spread from Samosa & Kachori to 5 kinds of cheese to Koljata style Chicken Biryani to Waffle with Brownie & vanilla. Only dessert section had around 26 dishes. In starter there were Aachari Murgh, dry chilli chicken, paneer pakora, mix veg pakora. Coming to main course there was Gobi masala, dal makhni, yellow daal tadka, plain rice, veg biryani, kolkata style chicken biryani, bhuna gosht, chicken butter masala etc etc. They had 6 types of mayonese, all kind of breads, pork salami, chicken salami, pickles. GOD it was sooooo huge we couldn't even touch all of them. They had live counters for pasta, noodles & chaat. We tried their special rice noodles with squid and pasta in white sauce. The desserts were elegant and mindblowing. They had a huge options for condiments while having ice cream. 

After a long list of food lets come to staff and ambience. The ambience was awesome. Staff were very courteous. It was a value for monry endeavour. The price was 950 + Tax per person.

It was definitely a 5 star.

Jw-marriott is one of the biggest name when it comes to hospitality industry and they do live up to their big Billings.the hotel is truly beautiful and posh and the experience world class.
Ambience- perfect but the crowd can be a bit displeasing but what to expect when Ur in a buffet.
Food- extraordinary variations and selections. U will be spoilt for choices. The pasta though was okayish,Chinese was much better with squid n all available. Main course is also pretty good but the one that takes the prize is the dessert section. U will get tired of eating yet the selection in desserts won't be over.
Service- very courteous and nice. U just hv to order at the counter and they will serve it up in Ur table
Price- it's ‚Çπ2500 including taxes for 2 so it's bearable but the liquor price are through the roof. Still it's a bit on higher side but the quality of food on offer u won't mind paying so much.
Overall a total thumbs up,go ahead and fill Ur plates for a gastronomical adventure.

It takes a lot to have them put together all around at the same time and it shows the will and the commitment of the staff and their urge to be the best . Food , well its more or less good in all the big guns but what attracted me is the variety and the behaviour . Its a must visit if you are foodie and its a lot given the price being quoted . Will be there soon again ..keep it up guys and keep us feeding ¬†delicious stuff's.

Me and my family visited JW kitchen on Mothers day and needless to say, i have never been so disappointed in my life before. Being a renounced 5 star chain properly all over the world, i am afraid their buffet food has greatly disappointed me. This review will only focus on the food quality. The service, however, was very nice but when it comes to billing, it took more than 20mins. Maybe it is due to the fact that it was crowded. We used our JW membership voucher and got 50% discount on the total bill. It was supposed to be 10,000rs but it came to around rs5000 after discount. It was not worth it, according to the food that they served us.
Here are the list of things that disappointed me:
1) creme brulee, the caramelised sugar is supposed to be hard on the top but it was way too soft. It was overly sweet as well.
2) rasmalai did not taste like rasmalai.
3) waffles were too hard.
4) the cocktail sauce for shrimp cocktail has less tobasco in it 
5) the pasta was too hard.
6) lack of taste in biryani 
7) the bread they served for cheese was hard. 
8) the garlic bread they served for pasta counter was hard.
9) thai red curry has less taste.
10) they served dragonfruit and when I asked for it, the person said it was out. But I saw them serving dragonfruit to someone else.

I could go on but I am afraid 10 is enough for now. The only thing I liked is the cold cuts of meat, which is not prepared by the hotel  ( it was already prepared and manufactured before). I am definitely not coming back here again.

The food and spread are great but it's too crowded and chaotic. The hotel does not give the feel of a five star. The buffet should not have been so near to the main gate but somewhere inside the hotel. Maybe the prices are comparatively lower and therefore its more crowded. But if you are looking for a peaceful meal at a fancy hotel this is not the place for you. However if food is the main criteria then definitely the spread is the best in the city probably as of today.

Some places let their food speak for them !
JW Kitchen is one such place. Be ready to be floored with the vast yet scrumptious menu on offer. Did try their dinner buffet. What should I speak about , as all the items were stars in themselves. 
FRESHNESS, of the food and NOT OVERLY SPICY is the trademark of the place. The aroma and the preparations were very delicate. 
Special mentions need to be for the desserts, I had been to many 5 stars restaurants and had their desserts in buffets however I can proudly vouch as this was the best. Also the wonderfully thing is that JW Marriott is redefining the value for money. 
Also appreciate  the attendees and the manager was generous to have a friendly chat with the guests.

Please keep up the show team JW Marriot. Cheers!

Truly a 5 star experience right from the beginning till the end. Went twice once for breakfast buffet and other for lunch buffet. Breakfast was better compared to lunch. For lunch and dinner one needs to book a table before a week. Widespread menu. One cannot taste everything at one go I suppose but every item on the menu is sure to attract you. Worth the money spent. Will visit for dinner soon

The ambience is great. But I'm really disappointed to say that the food was just average. The buffet seemed more of salads, breads and cheese than actual food. But the desserts were good. The buffet has two slots for lunch, 12:30 pm and 1:30pm and it closes by 3pm, which is actually a very short time considering thar it's a buffet. Overall it's ok with the price tag of Rs.1100 for lunch per person.
PS: dinner has a higher price tag than lunch. (1300approx)

Horrible experience. Had rain water leaking over our table. While the staff was courteous enough to shift us to another table, by the time we finished, water had started falling there as well.

Would have rated less than one, except for the food, which was decent and nice.

The rain water experience was rather annoying and bad, if not harrowing.

What we thought to be gastronomic delight turned out to be a pretty poor show. Considering the price, the spread mammoth with countless number of dishes from India, oriental, continental among others. So first, one is spoilt for choice and actually trying a number of dishes made me full. Ok that should ideally be good. But it wasn't. The food was mostly bland and didn't match up to the hype it created. The main course was pretty ordinary. One of the major problem in a buffet spread is that if the tables are much away from the counters, going up and down to fetch food makes the entire experience tiring and so was the case for JW Kitchen. The desserts were disasters and I found a number of them stale. Sadly there was none to take feedback.

This is ¬†a heaven for foodie's ! I made a booking for a lunch date with my fiance at JW Kitchen on 17th April, 2017. Since we were a little before time, we waited at the lobby area, which is very tastefully decorated. We ¬†entered the dining area and were seated at the designated table. I lost count of the spread, because it was huge! They had North Indian, Chinese, Gujarati, Italian, and what not! Trust me we had almost nothing for breakfast (I had a glass of milk only!), still we were not able to ¬†taste each and every item. In short, we loved the starters and the desserts, and we will definitely visit JW Kitchen again for savoring mouth-watering delicacies, which we missed out on that day. The servers are well-trained and showed warm gestures. So are the chefs at the live counters. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.
The only thing I would like to point out is the lack of adequate cooling facility, which makes a person uncomfortable in this weather. Hope that this issue will be taken care of.

When the best in the hotel industry decides to open a plush restaurant for the populace of Kolkata, we are privileged with the JW Kitchen. The restaurant sits at the ground floor of the opulent Marriott building. So here is my detailed review of my visit to this grand restaurant on a hot summer afternoon, for their famed lunch buffet.

Pros -
i. Ambience - The internal decor and ambience is truly a testimony of the grandeur of the Marriott namesake.
ii. Staff - Each and every staff member is extremely courteous and professional.
iii. Variety - The range of food served is huge, and by huge I mean actually huge. A brief summary - live chat counter, live salad bar, live pasta counter with a dish of chicken and fish, live chinese dish counter with a dish of fish, starters one each of chicken and fish, chicken biriyani, mutton gravy, chicken gravy, large entr√©e of dessert (cake, waffle, flavoured yogurt, indian sweets), choice of ice cream. Plus every non-vegetarian option had an equal number of vegetarian counterpart.

Cons -
i. Food - Surprisingly, the food was bland, there was nothing remarkable about a single dish. From starters to main course, the only positive thing about the food had been the variety, but the taste was totally so-so. Further, in my particular case, all of my companions unanimously agreed that the preparation of mutton was the worst of the lot.
ii. Welcome drink - given the price tag, it wouldn't hurt to have at least some sort of welcome drink. Almost all buffet entr√©es offer this. Inclusion of this, even with a minor price hike would surely make the buffet course complete.

Overall verdict -
My visit to the JW Kitchen had been a mixed bag. Yes, I would surely be visiting there again, but just for basking in the ambience. My earnest request to the management would be to focus on a few signature dishes to tantalise the taste buds, because variety alone cannot be enough for making a restaurant great, given the high expectations. This place has excellent ambience and extremely courteous service which will make an individual feel like royalty. Looking forward to another visit.

After having heard about the grandeur of JW Marriott, I called up the restaurant requesting for a reservation for 3 people for breakfast. I was told that reservations were not taken for breakfast and we would be able to secure a seat upon arrival. I headed out for the place together with two of my friends only to find that all tables had been "Reserved". When I requested for an accommodation for 3 persons, the manager was rude to me and I was asked to leave. In my opinion, a Five Star Hotel with such rude staffs should not even be allowed to operate!!

I hope never to return in the near future...

This had been on my bucket list right from its inception in Kolkata.So when an opportunity to came to indulge in a gourmet luncheon experience I just had to grab it.Firstly the reception at the entrance and the decor in the reception area was really admirable one.Let me now come directly to the buffet part which we opted.The buffet price is flexible and it varies from day to day and the most important thing is one should book a table in advance to avoid any unpleasant experiences.As soon as the buffet opens the steward and all others gets busy but then also they make it a point to visit your table and ask about your experience and see that the glasses are filled.The buffet menu ranges from Indian bread chowmein to Biriyani to plain rice Posto dahi vada Chaat paneer and chicken d fbishes pasta and what not .The Posto preparation and the chicken‚Äã in the starter was really nice otherwise all the dishes were average.Last but not the least was the dessert spread which was such a huge and mind blowing and even the decorations was so nice it will break your heart to break them.There were different types of Bengali sweets 2/3 types of cakes and 2/3 types of cup cakes Panna Cotta mud pie three types of ice cream waffles custard.They have rightly concentrated on the dessert section as Kolkata folks have a sweet tooth.The mud pie is surely one should not give a miss and the sweets are really sweet.Overall it was really nice experience to cherish for but they should also try to make their main dish more palatable as Kolkata people can really spent on their food .

We visited the JW Kitchen couple of days back. The reservation was confirmed. As such, getting in was smooth with a warm hospitality. The widespread menu on offer was just awesome! The starters covered Indian as well as Continental varieties. Literally, anything and everything! Live counters were serving it hot and fresh. The main course was good as well. Had space for Biryani only :-) The icing on the cake was the dessert section. It was like a wonderland with so much of sweet items. Despite being full, could not resist indulging in them. The price was not a hit to the pocket of course and reasonable by the brand's standards. Raring to visit soon!!

I went to dine at the place on a weekday. The place was bustling during the dinner time! 
Had variety offered .  North Indian , Chinese, Italian , Lebanese . I liked their noodles and risotto with Parmesan the most . Lebanese was bland. North Indian was also okaish . Desserts were wide ranged and good in taste. Their ice creams are a must have. One disappointment I faced was that they didn't have any buffet menu present on their tables which is quite a let down . This place will run better if little details are kept in check. :)

Currently its the most hyped about place in the city, firstly because its JW Marriot and secondly because of its relatively cheap buffet rates considering its big brand. 
I went there with a friend on the 19th of last month. We got table number 40 which has a fantastic view! 
The buffet spread is huge! There is an indian section,  continental section, a salad section, a dessert section. There is also a cheese section with a wide variety of cheese and dry fruits. The indian section is the best! Also there continental chicken roast and fish dish was great! They have live counters for indian breads and pastas. You just have to order and give your table number and they serve it at your table. Coming to the dessert section, the spread is huge! I could not taste everything since I got very full! They have cute mini cupcakes, eclairs, a large array of layered desserts and indian sweets too! I don't remember all the dishes since there was so much! 
The best thing is that you don't have to ask them to clean the table. They clean you table while you are away to get more food so that you can come back to a fresh clean table. Also, the entire staff gets into resolving a problem which any guests goes through. They give their best to make you comfortable while they look into the problem. Any kitchen can get into trouble but how you overcome it shows the true quality of any brand. This is what you expect and also get from a big brand such as Marriot.

I went here with a few friends in my last few days of the joy that is Kolkata. It was one of the best buffet breakfasts I had eaten in the city -- and so value-for-money! The items I had eaten are listed as follows: 

Orange juice, watermelon juice, mango juice, aloe vera juice, carrot juice: Freshly made and none of that artificial sweetness. 

Blueberry Danish, Apricot Danish: Both were light on the stomach but still flavourful and not too sweet. 

Butter croissant: Light and fluffy, overall perfect!

Berliners: A kind of custard doughnut - it was heavenly!

Bircher museli: Well-made and flavourful. 

Smoked Salmon: Absolutely delicious! 

Cold cuts: Portions of ham and turkey cold cuts, went well with the sauces and cheeses. 

Cheese: Brie, Edam, Gouda. 

Olives: They had a selection of olives which paired well with the cold cuts as well. 

Flavoured yoghurt: I ate the mango one which was fairly decent. 

Pancakes: Could have been lighter but went well with the cinnamon honey. 

Waffles: I had these with cream and dried strawberries. The waffles were a little dry and I would have preferred fresh strawberries. 

Hash Browns, Grilled Tomatoes, Saut√©ed Mushrooms: Well done but pretty standard. 

Sausages: There are very few places where sausages are done right and this wasn't one of them. I was also disappointed by the absence of bacon in such a large buffet. 

Eggs Benedict: This was a bad decision. The eggs weren't poached properly, there was barely any Hollandaise sauce, and the bread was stiff and chewy. 

Aloo Paratha: Absolutely delicious, went well with their mango and garlic pickles. 

Momos and Glass Noodles: Below average, even the great sauce couldn't salvage it. 

A few items that would have been appreciated: baked beans, bacon, mashed potatoes, cheese spreads and crackers.

I went for a family lunch on Saturday. I thought it would be extraordinary but it was a normal buffet. Moreover none of the dishes tastes extraordinarily good. They have a huge dessert section which was good. The service and behaviour of the staffs are worth mentioning and my 4.5 points is for them. So I would say if you want to eat something good don't choose this place but if you want to feel the luxury then definitely visit this place.

Went there for lunch buffet. Price was 1145 per person. Spread was lavish and huge. Starters were good especially the mahi tikka. I just loved it. Biriyani was good. Pasta was made to perfection just like I wanted it to be. However I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the desserts, I had better expectations. Staff is extremely courteous and well behaved. Would love to visit again.

Whenever you think about JW Marriott properties you think about beautiful decor, great ambiance and sumptuous food. We had the privilege to visit the JW Marriott property in Juhu and tend to compare the other properties to the grandeur provided by the Juhu property.  
 
On our recent visit to Kolkata we decided to celebrate my Mother's birthday at the JW Marriott, Kolkata. The ambiance made me feel that I was in JW Marriott Sahar, Mumbai. We opted for the buffet lunch and was thoroughly impressed with the wide range of food offerings. From Indian, continental to Italian, they had it all. There should be a special mention of the chicken kebabs and fish dishes. Being a Bengali and away from fishes for ages, it was a feast indeed.  We also ordered for three dishes from the al-carte menu which included prawn malai curry, yellow daal and rice- which were gracefully cooked and tasted great.  

In case of the food, this place is heavenly, however we were thoroughly disappointed with the staff and their services. It seemed like all of them were busy and running with no fruitful result. Firstly, at one of the live counters we ordered for spaghetti with white sauce and mushroom which didn't reach our table post 15mims. We went and reminded again and till the end we didn't get our order and felt no need for the reminder. Same was in the case of dessert live counter, after our order it never reached us and we also didn't bother to remind again. The al-carte dishes took almost 30-40mins to serve. Also, post our lunch we had to wait for more than 15mins for the bill to arrive. And another 15mins for the concerned person to come and collect the payment. Seeing all the mismanagement we directly went to the counter with the bill and paid the amount. It would have been great experience only if they can work on the services. Being a five star property this was expected. Nevertheless, all of us were really happy with the food.

Ambience was good at a glance but we shared our table with houseflies, also expecting a star service we did not even have our evening attendant. Neither did our tables have napkins, nor did we have prompt change of plates. Still we decided to proceed with food. The floor had an unattended pool of water which lead to my mother's fall, spoiling our evening. About the food, the kebabs were cold, fish not to the standards as it tasted stale, nor was the chicken well done as it was over cooked and dry, Paneer lacked spices as well as freshness. The salad counter was the one which satisfied our pallets. Pasta and asian counters had very limited options also the name placards were missing. We missed the authenticity in chaats. Overall quiet a disappointment as we were treating our guests hoping your service and food to be best in town. We do appreciate the managers concern for the uneasiness experienced over our meals and sharing with us the 2 delectable desserts.

I visited JW Marriott on my birthday for lunch with my family.  The spread looked extremely appealing . However to be honest only 3 items from the main course stood out for me. The fish tikka kebabs, grilled chicken and  pasta. Everything else seemed to have scope for improvement. However, JWM has the best dessert section I have ever tried. I liked all their dessert items. A special mention goes to their ice cream, mud pie and raspberry filled mousse. What lacked in the main course got made up in the dessert . The chef made my day by sending in a cake and a few chocolates as a surprise for my birthday celebrations . I'm adding an extra 1.5 to my rating just for the dessert section.Will definitely visit again to try more items.

It is said that breakfast should be the most lavish meal of the day, befitting royalty. This norm is taken in great stride at the JW Marriott, Kolkata where the spread truly is fit for a King (or, Queen).¬†As someone who is in a torrid on-again, off-again relationship with breakfast, I truly endeavour to make the most of the good times in our relationship, usually at a breakfast buffet. So when a friend suggested we head out to the newly minted luxury hotel in Kolkata, the Marriott, for breakfast with the girl gang, I all but said game on.

Many live counters builds up for many mouth watering starters 
I could only taste ~40% of the mammoth spread 

Indian Chinese Continental major cuisines are covered and that too with wisely picked items

Variety of sinful desserts

The table availability speaks of the way it has won hearts of the people in the city.

I had written a review about my visit on 26/03/17. It somehow got deleted - my mistake. Anyway, I am happy to write it again. The management had responded to me saying that on Sundays, they only have a buffet for brunch and not lunch. Well, I did go for the brunch and I had no complaints in those regards. I really appreciate the management calling up and informing us about their change. :-) The only issue I had was we weren't aware and were not informed that drinks were not part of the buffet. We only came to know that after receiving the cheque. 

Decor/Ambiance: Lovely decor with soft music. The selection of music could have been better. Comfortable chairs. 

Staff/Service: Courteous staff. Good service.

Food: They offer a variety of cuisines from Indian to Italian to Chinese to Mexican catering to all taste buds. I haven't seen such an amazing collection of food in any other buffet across the city. They have a live counter mostly for Italian cuisine. Though there is a diversity, the food tasted average. Nothing made me go wow. 

Overall Feedback: beautiful ambiance but the food offered in the buffet tasted average.

A great place to have breakfast. There is a good spread for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. Carry your shades as there is too much sunlight streaming in if you seated near the glass exteriors. You might start to feel a bit hot too. But it must be nice in winters. The ambience is solid 5. Right from your tables ( we were seated on a bluish glass mosaic sorta one). Food was good especially the desserts. The pancakes were so soft they melted in your mouth. A must visit place. At 650 + taxes it is not an experience to miss. We had met for celebrating a friends bday.

Given the grandeur attached with the brand, J.W Marriot kitchen, Kolkata did not make a lasting impression to the extent I wanted. Let's break the experience in pointers-
1) the entire pocket friendly buffet that Marriott Kolkata is offering, is almost astounding. However, as much as it gives me great joy to see so many people getting to enjoy a star quality experience, it also pains seeing all the cacophony around. I mean let's take it for a fact that when you go to a star restaurant you expect a very sorted ambiance. But I think that lacked. Of course everyone has the right to enjoy the grand experience. But I think the charm of the place would have been more, if they kind of maintained few norms inside the dining area. It was a mini mayhem. 
2) AMAZING variety of food. I mean worth every penny. From Chinese to cheese, from North Indian to middle Eastern nuts, they had it all. 5 points on that. However, I had higher expectations when it came to the taste of the dishes. 
3) Service was mediocre- nothing to astound you (which should be the opposite because we are talking 7star here) however, a special mention to chef Abhijit, if I'm not wrong. His charming smile despite the crowd and individual‚Äã attention was very pleasing. 
4) Finally the space - it's huge. But one can expect a far more grand setting when we are talking about a 7 star hotel. 
Over all a statisfactory experience. Nothing out of this world.

Dont expect too much here, the food does not match to their 5 star quality at all. Tried their buffet, only a few items were good, many did not even match the basic standard. The prices they charge for the buffet are much higher than other places in Kolkata so its not fair that they dont serve even one drink like its done in all other places, and they come up to the table and ask us for ordering drinks separately mentioning extra charges which looks cheap because it denotes they want us to spend even more from our pockets and its important for you to note that since this is a 7 star hotel, a simple drink like ¬†lemon or apple juice will cost no less than 300 INR a glass so all in all it will bear a burdern on your pockets too even if you go for the buffet. ¬†The quality of food is sub standard as it is as per the high price we are paying for the buffet They have many items in terms of quantity but are a serious let down in terms of quality. I can understand why many people have given high ratings here because the ambience is really good and so is their behaviour but thats just about all you will get. I would prefer a small place with better quality food and which serves mocktails in the buffet unlike here because I am going for the food, not for enjoying the hospitaIity or the ambience, plus no one can have so many items, even if they had half of the number of items they have now it would be better if the quality of food was better because you will be full anyway just by trying 30% of their items, there are so many, strangely even being being a 7 star they focus on quantity and not quality so I dont see any reason why people would go here as there are cheaper and better options with much better quality food and with drinks (unlimited moacktails) available in buffet in Kolkata unlike this place, unless you just want to enjoy the 5 star ambience and hopsitality.

I had visited the restaurant in November 2016 and it was an astounding experience. The buffet spread was the largest that I had ever seen in the city. The list of dishes in the buffet was mind boggling and varied. The food was excellent. The dessert section was awesome and it left me heavily satisfied. Willing to visit it again and have recommended Jw Kitchen to as many people I know.

One of the biggest buffet dinner I've ever had at the JW Kitchen.  Starting from DIY salads to North Indian  cuisine to the Italian counters to the Rajashthani and Gujrati counters to the chaat counters.  They have it all.  And no to be missed out is the desert section.  The baked curd is especially delicious.

Had a family dinner here today. The buffet was good, although certain dishes may not have hit the mark like for example the Roast Chicken in Cajun Sauce and the Bhuna Ghosht. 

The highlight is of course the dessert section.

This place could have been so much better .Make sure you do the reservations before you go.You dont want to wait after you reach the place.Ambience of this place is way too good.The quality of food should have matched its profile. Even though there was more than enough options for Non veg dishes, i could not get my hands on veg dishes .The choices were so less. Desserts section was bliss. I liked all of them.
If only they could make the quality of the food bit better ..

Went here today and opted for the non vegetarian buffet lunch. Price is Rs 1150/- all inclusive. It is located on the E. M. Bypass just beside the ITC Sonar and the Science city. Ambience is nice. The JW kitchen is in the ground floor beside the reception. They have an extensive collection of oriental starters consisting of both vegeatarian and non vegetarian dishes which included ham and turkey. The breads were very hard in consistency thus making it difficult to eat. The cheese counter had various items to choose from. The live pasta counter served almost all forms except the lasagna. There is a live noodles counter also. The main course had essentially indian elements like lamb biryani, lamb roganjosh, chicken curry, schezwan chicken. In the vegetarian section, there were steamed rice, veg biryani, matar paneer, paneer kebab amongst the many side dishes. The dessert counter served all forms of dessert ranging from bengali sweets like the rasgullas to western desserts such as creme brulee. Overall the dessert counter had over 20 items to choose from. There is no complimentary drinks included in the buffet. The staff is very attentive and cordial. Overall had a nice experience. Would like to visit again soon.

JW Kitchen serves varieties of food in their buffet from Chinese to Continental to North Indian even they had Live Chaat counters.
They even had live noodles and pasta counter which allowed you to have your food of your taste.
From starters to desert they had varieties of delicious mouth watering foods to have.
They do offer varieties of salads and their dressings.

The JW Marriott hotels in India are beautiful. Their flagship hotel in Juhu has all of Mumbai agog with it‚Äôs vast lobby overlooking the beautifully landscaped poolside and beyond that the Arabian Sea. I like the JW Marriott at Sahar Mumbai and it‚Äôs huge L shaped coffee shop. The JW Chandigarh looks very imposing.

¬†
While the beauty of the hotels is undisputed, their food is another matter altogether. After years of despairing, I have to say I find the food in most JW properties rather mediocre. I wish I did not, but c‚Äôest la vie! ¬†Here is my latest Marriott meal saga.
The Kolkata hotel on JBS Haldane Avenue, on the way to the airport is the latest addition to the¬†JW Marriott stable. The hotel is tall and sleek with a glass facade and half the city is found dining there since its opening in December 2016.

¬†I¬†am rather excited about a friend‚Äôs invitation to breakfast at the much touted JW Marriott Kolkata. First visits are usually special!¬†I have seen the hotel a few times and had attempted to dine there once post Christmas, but the proposed one hour wait did not appeal.

¬†The buffet breakfast, spread across the spacious coffee shop named JW Kitchen looks splendid. I love high ceilinged, spacious eateries with¬†an open kitchen area¬†and this one is just gorgeous to look at. The all day dining area follows the circular structure of the building, with a curved glass front and double height ceiling as in the lobby. While this looks beautiful, it makes the air conditioning rather ineffective, especially with sunlight streaming in during the day. Seated at one of the smaller tables towards the edge of the room, the sun makes us borderline uncomfortable. I wonder how they plan to combat this during peak summer months!

¬†
But this post is not about the architecture so I will get back to business. Here is the list of items consumed, in no particular order.

¬†
Beetroot juice: I pour a large glassful since this is one of my favourites. It has the heavy texture and weird aftertaste of a juice that has been left standing a couple of hours.¬†Clearly, too much of this was made and too little consumed since most people make a beeline for fruit juices.

¬†

Mango smoothie: More smoothie than mango.

¬†

Watermelon juice: Good

¬†

Make your own noodle soup: The dumplings have been taken out of the freezer. Despite thawing, the dough coating is hard and chewy, spoiling its taste completely. The stock is insipid lacking both flavor and seasoning. There are enough sauces to compensate but I do not like overpowering the taste of ingredients.

Akuri: The bright young counter chef assures that he can/will produce an authentic akuri. I ask for some bacon with mine. The akuri is 60% there. Though I can‚Äôt taste ginger and the powdered spices haven‚Äôt blended completely with the eggs,¬†it is not bad.

¬†

Bacon: A disaster! I salivate waiting for a pile of succulent bacon but what I get is a heap of dry, hard bacon which is used to make bacon crumble! The pieces are sharp enough to hurt the insides of my mouth! My dreams of juicy, dripping bacon rashers is shattered; I am so shocked that I forget to take a photograph!

¬†

The sides:

Warm, super flaky Butter Croissant which I love. But why do they make their croissants so big that you can‚Äôt bite into one without it going into your nose? Perplexed!

¬†

Cheesy corn and spinach: Lovely!

¬†

Hash browns: Great texture but way too much salt.

¬†

Sauteed mushrooms: Good

¬†

Smoked salmon: Not good. I love, love salmon and do not waste food as a rule. It breaks my heart to leave the fish unfinished but it is just not fresh enough to be relished.

¬†
Lassi: I ask if I could get a glass of sweet lassi and the smiling server responds in the affirmative. On enquiring after 20 minutes, I am told the lassi is being ‚Äò freshly prepared‚Äô. What I eventually get is more slush than lassi, with so much crushed ice and so little yoghurt that it has very little taste.

¬†

Service: Young, energetic¬†and very enthusiastic team. The¬†Human Resource Management is clearly done well.¬†¬†But while it is nice to see smiling faces in the morning, they don‚Äôt quite compensate for poor food quality.

¬†

I hear a lot of people exulting about the great price of INR 750/- plus taxes for the buffet and understand how ‚Äòcool‚Äô it is to be seen at a fancy new hotel without burning a hole in the pocket. But I do not find value¬†since the food is average and nothing on the buffet is exceptional, let alone unique. I am happy to pay more and get great food or go to a smaller eatery where my expectations would not be so high.

It was really great to experience the food at JW Marriott at just about 1.2K. The place is so nicely decorated and has such a nice ambiance that it makes the dinner very luxurious and memorable. The buffet consists of variety of delicious dishes from different Indian cuisines, I hardly had any buffet with such variety of cuisines. Their are also a hell lot of delicious and beautiful desserts to taste. They have different counters such as noodles counter, chat counter, pasta counter etc. The service was very good and active as expected from a place like this.

This was my first 5star visit where i went after getting my first salary 
So this means a lot to me 
And before talking about food 
Lets talk about the ambience and decorations and staffs 
Well my table was booked at 12:30 but due to traffic we reached there by 1:30. I went to the reception and the lady there gave a smile which meant 'its okay you are late you are always welcome here' 
So she showed us our table and we were greeted again with smile.. 
The decorations were so premium with the helpful staffs i was overwhelmed... 
Now lets talk about the foods 
It has so many variety of different cuisines and the food they were amazing 
As a starter i had chicken kabab to offer which was a bit let down 
But the fish tikia was beautifully cooked 
I tried the panner which was not up to the mark 
They also served lasagna which was exquisite with garlic bread 
I tried sandwich and ham 
They had a whole lot of cheese section 
If you are a Gujarati you can try dhokla, fafra , thepla 
Etc etc 
There live counters was up to the mark 
We had chicken white sauce pasta and sea food noodles which has squid and prawns and it was beautifully cooked 
They have so many things to offer one cannot try everything in one visit 
Biriyani was well prepared and it was also good with mutton ..  
Then lets talk about there speciality 
Desserts: i was told that they have 50+ desserts 
And guess what they really have a big section of cakes,  mousse, rosogollas ,sandesh , rashmalai 
Everything 
I tried all the chocolate cakes, cup cakes 
Pineapple mousse, coffee mousse 
Waffles with ice cream 
Choco chips on ice cream 
Waffles also are lively made on demand 
The overall experience was very good 
Valur for money? Yess you get so many things under one roof and most importantly its a Marriott

Best. Buffet. Ever. 

This was in my wish list since the very first day and I finally made it last week. The ambience doesn't need my approval. Its spellbinding. You must keep one thing in mind ; though its spacious,a prior reservation is a must since many people visit the place for lunch and dinner buffets. 

The staff are extremely courteous and helpful. Our table had a little problem and they fixed it in a jiffy. 

Coming to food,they serve north Indian,Oriental,European,Gujarati and Bengali cuisines(I hope am not missing anything). There is an array of chaats too! The kebabs and oriental starters were lip smacking. The posto-bhaat(yes you read that correct!) was amazing too! Their live pasta and noodles counter will serve you hot and according to your choice right at your table. 

Their dessert section steals the thunder! It has a spread of more than 20 kinds of sweet dishes ranging from variety of cakes,puddings,custard,shondesh(a Bengali dessert), fresh fruits, waffles and ice creams. You will never be able to taste all! 

Amazing place and amazing food.

It's was really horrible waiting for our dnnr for such a long tym..it was really not expected from "JW MARRIOTT".It was our mistake that we took a decision to go to ur branded hotel.Your services were too late.we checkd in at 10:30 pm in ur hotel bt we were served with our dnnr at 12:00am.we wasted a lot of tym der instead we should have went to some other hotel which would have provided us with better treatment Nd facilties.its just bcoz of the branded name of JW that you are getting customers.After getting your such services m sorry I m not going to visit your hotel again in future.
Yes,being honest your ambiance and food was undoubtedly awesome but I would like the whole Jw team to work on your services.

Never ever rated any restaurants so low, sorry to say "JW Marriott Kolkata" was not at all up to the expectations. We were kept waited for dinner for more than half an hour, as it was quite late at night we had no option but to wait..everytym we asked they said just "10 to 15 mins" don't know what arrangements they were making but we had to ask for each n every small thing which is expected on the dining table whether it be water, napkins, finger bowl, mouth fresheners..they had no mouth fresheners and even the breads were not served as they had closed their tandoors even when people were dining...VERY VERY SLOW SERVICE..we got ourrself registered at 10.15 but we were taken in at 11.30 that too on constantly following them up.. lman at reception told us he will buzz me up but No calls from his side

Thankgod, food quality was good and decor was even brilliant..but since it has got a brandvalue It should be taken care of..to compensate the lack of mouth freshner misti doi was arranged as complimentary which we couldn't accept as we were already late..it was around 12.30 midnight, we rushed home.

JW Kitchen, the buffet restaurant of JW Marriott has become the latest happening place in the city of joy. This was my second visit to the restaurant, this time for the Sunday Brunch. Having thoroughly enjoyed my first experience I expected nothing short of an extraordinary experience. However the experience began on the sourest possible note. We were a group of five and had reserved our table from before. On reaching the restaurant, one Nabanita after going through the computer flatly informed us that there was no reservation for our name. The restaurant manager Shubhendu too informed us of the same. We were very surprised on hearing this and asked them to recheck but were kept waiting. At this point in time we were considering going to the nearby ITC Sonar since these people at the restaurant were not helping out. After waiting for 15 minutes we called ITC Sonar and just before confirming our place there, we checked once more with the restaurant. This time some new guy was there with Nabanita and he at once found our reservation. Now this could still have been overlooked as a mistake but for the attitude of Nabanita. She was asked by this new guy who found our reservation to take us to our seats. While taking us to our seats, Nabanita instead of apologising quite rudely told us that our reservation was found on the latest reservation chart which had just arrived. This just didn't go down well with me as it was she who was at fault for not knowing that there is a final list and instead of being apologetic about it, made it sound like it was our fault. Now this kind of unprofessional behaviour is just not expected from a 5 star restaurant and specially from a renowned chain such as JW Marriott.
The above experience resulted in a very sour beginning to our meal. The only suggestion I would have for people visiting JW Kitchen would be to avoid Nabanita at all costs and find some other staff to solve any problems. The management of JW Marriott Kolkata should really appoint staff after strict scrutiny as I have never experienced such unprofessional behaviour from JW Marriott staff anywhere around the world.
Now after sitting at our table, we found that one of the table mats and one chair had oil stains on them(I have added the pictures for reference), which however was instantly cleaned by the staff on bringing it to their attention. But something like that after a bad beginning to the experience because of the reservation fiasco simply further detoriated our mood. The point is that it is just not acceptable that when you sit down at the table you notice such things. Also another most annoying thing was that our table was not stable and it kept moving for the entire duration of our meal. At that point of time, we were too disgusted to complain about the table and so continued to sit at the rocking table.
Now coming to the food. This is where JW Kitchen shines. The variety on offer for the Brunch was unbelievably huge. There is everything on offer from Pizzas to Biryani. There were a lot more counters on offer compared to the dinner buffet I had had earlier. Another welcome addition for the brunch was the presence of a drinks counter where 3 different kinds of ice tea and atleast 4 different types of Sangria were available. I thoroughly recommend the pineapple and cherry sangria. The dessert selection was as usual excellent.
To summarise, I would say that JW Kitchen is a foodies paradise let down by unprofessional behaviour of staff and overlooking of small details such as table cleanliness and furniture maintenance.

The lamb preparation was tempting..üòç

We were soooo full but yet dessert was left...so we had one glass of water,and said to ourselves No for god sake we can't miss those Desserts..üòÇ

Finally, after a long wait of 2 months (because of my exams üòÇ) I got a chance to visit JW kitchen today for a lunch with my friends. The first impression when I stepped inside can be described using only one word 'amazing'. Trust me a must visit buffet and definitely one the greatest buffets in Kolkata. Pretty reasonable. Food is really good. Hospitality is amazing. Everyone working there is friendly and really very helpful.For decor, I would say it's totally sophisticated. Outstanding ambiance. Clean and hygienic. Washrooms are soo well maintained that once you enter you will feel that your house is not that clean üòÇ.Coming to food there are various options available. Indian, thai, chinese, italian, continental and more cuisines are available. Trust me this is the best place to pamper your taste buds with their extravagant spread. Definitely, i couldn't try each of the items but it's worth another visit just to try others. Desserts will blow your mind. Soo many different options that you will die trying. Both mineral and normal water available. Coming to Indian cuisine it was nice but the mutton (kosha mangsho) was a bit hard it needed to be tenderized a bit more and the biryani was okayish I mean it wasn't that bad but it could have been better. Dal makhani was amazing. Chowmein with squid, prawn, egg, tofu, baby corn was just amazing. One can customize their own chowmein, pasta. Salads have their own table and once you go to that table you will be confused which one to choose. Turkey ham was soo amazing that I had 3 on them in one go. There were wafers, chaats, ice creams, breads, tandoori rotis that I didn't try actually didn't had any space in my stomach. Paneer just melted in my mouth as it was so nicely cooked. Definitely value for money.Hot gulab jamun with a dash of pistachios and almonds will make your day trust me they will and kacha golla along with mud pie cake is love.Cost per head on Monday to Thursday is 1084/- all inclusive (no beverages)They must add a small beverage like lime soda at the beginning it will make the buffet more interesting to start with.A must go for every foodie and best place for a party.Go pamper your taste buds! ‚úå‚úå‚úåüëåüëåüëåüòçüòçüòç

My wife took me in my birthday. We reached around 1:15 pm. The front office lady greeted us with a smile and escorted us to the table. The food....!! Well it is awesome !! Last January we went to Oberoi Grand 363 Restaurant to celebrate our 9th.anniversary. But JW Kitchen is too good.
There were 2 types of soup: (1) Mushroom and (2) Chicken sweet corn. The 2nd.one is not good.¬†

The ¬†starters had Chicken fry, very tasty, mustard chicken, one potato item and one paneer item. The paneer was very soft and tasty.

The salad section was awesome. It contained exotic items like Turkey and chicken salami with cold cut of pork. There were 7/8 type of salads along with different mayonnaise.

The live counter contained Chats and chowmein. The chowmein was excellent with dressing of prawn, squid, baby corn, brocolli. There was white noddles and wheat noodles as we tried the white one.

Coming to the main course, Indian part had veg.biriyani, chicken biriyani was was toooo soft and delicious. Most importantly my daughter, 7 years ate biriyani as it was so tasty. Then there was mutton do piaza -- good taste, doi mach (so so kind) alo posto, steamed rice, various types of papad.

Then you have fresh fruit section which contained fresh apples, oranges, pineapple, guava, watermelon. Never is it possible to eat so much,

Also there was fresh cheese section. Special sandwitch with Turkey and lettuce.
Then comes the REAL GRAND SECTION *****DESSERT****

Five stars to JW Marriot. My goodness !! How can you eat? There was Indian sweets, 'sandeh', 'malpoa' 'phirni' and what not.....

There was different cakes, mud cake, pudding, pastries...............Sorry friend ! I cannot explain. Watch my pictures.

The total cost Rs.2166/-¬†

Very cheap !! Great food !! Great people !! Excellent ambiance !! Must must try. I remember the lady Suchishmita who talk to us at the end.

Great Experience !! Love to go once more.

This is by far the most lavish buffet I have ever come across. Right from the salads to desserts, there was a wide array of foods on offer. Each & every item on the menu was delicious.  The buffet had dishes from Indian, Chinese , Italian, Thai & continental cuisine. On the menu there was salads, freshly baked buns, starters, rice & option for Indian breads, pasta (a live counter which serves customized pasta), savories & a huge spread of desserts. No complaints on the food spread but my only suggestion would be to add some beverage to the buffet menu, atleast a fresh lime soda or a cold drink. Nevertheless it is one of the best buffet in town & it is very reasonably priced. The service & ambiance of JW is also awesome. Thumbs up to the JW kitchen team.

Last Saturday we tried out this property but instead of a classy experience we had something little better than average. Never saw or heard a five star property serving RUI MACHER JHOL as a part of a buffet..biryani was sticky and not upto the mark in comparison to other famous biryani joints in Kolkata.. Dessert section was quite OK.. But overall the wow factor was actually what we missed..

It is on my wishlist for long to taste the food of some best chefs in the world. It was a pleasant evening with the excellent service staffs around. Starting from the entrance to the table we occupied, the ambience just got in my nerves. The wall decor along with the soothing lighting conditions owned my heart.

Coming t o the food, the green mutton was not only delicious to eat, it also satisfied my visual treats as well. Frankly speaking the pastries are not up to the expectation level but the rice we got was the best I ever had in long years. The chicken pieces were tender and perfectly blended with spices to satiate my taste buds. Cheers to the service guys . Keep it up. Thanks for not making us wait even though we were there in one of the peak hours of the week

JW MARRIOTT is world renowned for its hospitality. And after a long wait atlast it entered the city of joy. Since JW opened their gates it was wish to dine there as already it was flooding with bookings, but last week was the day! 8 of us went there to try its extravagant Buffet!
The Place looks just‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è no need to describe the place!
The food has a lot of variety and different cuisines, but as a Vegan myself found a it a bit hard to pamper my hunger, but still the variety was fine. But for a meat lover this place is heaven for the price range.
And if anyone feels disheartened by the food or service once they check there dessert corner their complains will just fly away. Hands down the best dessert corner in the city in any buffett. ‚ù§Ô∏è
It was a good experience. Increase the Vegan Menu JW my family will be pleased to dine again‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ

Heavy lunch,  lovely ambience, good food, and great service. Pretty much sums up my today's Saturday binge. Quality and quantity both did justice, though quantity of food which I ordered from Asian platter was quite heavy, I couldn't finish it whole. Coming to the price, it's way too reasonable and affordable. Not to forget, the service, well behaved and they even help out with the menu suggesting the best of what we should try.

We were in awe from the entrance till we entered the buffet place...So huge the arrangement of buffet...People will literally find it difficult to find where to start dining from..
The ambiance was just awesome...Everything done to perfection ...Their service..The decoration...their attire

Coming to food...I would say that was good...I cannot say it was excellent...Special mention of their gosht biryani, creme brulee, white sauce pasta, daal bati churma and their veg dishes..
The rasmalai was very hard..I did not.like it...
The prapti chat, raj kachori chat and dahi vada was good...

Taste of the foods are ok nothing special,it is like any other good restaurants. We had high expectations about the taste. But it disppointed us. May be alakart foods are better but if you have high expectations about the buffet food it will not fulfill your expectation.

If you are looking for a wide buffet spread at an affordable price, that also in a renowned posh place, then is where you need to visit.
Gujrati to Italian , Tibetian to Continental and what not. And not to forget the Oh-so-awesome dessert section. It has variations over which you can drool. This is definitely something which one shall not miss.

Coming to the management. Super courteous and helpful people you have at your management. Also, this is exactly the kind of behaviour one can expect from one of the top notch hotels.
Overall I had a great time and experience. The Tibetan dishes have scope of improvement though. But for the rest, I can't complain.

Below are the pictures of what I have tried. 
Note: Mocktails are not included in the buffet.

Amazing look, truely a 5 star experience, great food but as we walked in without prebooking they were repeatedly poking us to vacant the seat...  It was very disappointing,  not expected from JW Marriott at all... Once u were alloted a seat u cannot poke ur customers...  Its totally on ur customer whether they want to sit till 9 or 11. In staff service no can compete with TAJ. Hyatt is also better in manners. 
M giving it 3.5 star rating only bcoz my parents were happy. ..  Otherwise could have given 1*...

This review is post my second visit. 

I'm not commenting about the menu or the choices but the taste. There's a lot to choose from but for a foodie like me, the food has no wow factor. 

The temp of everything is luke warm to cold. Very unprofessional staff at times, I had request more than once for water and ice, everytime! No one clearing the table! Love counter takes too long and of you order and sit down, you're ought to get disappointed. The food comes according to the chef and not according to what you ordered. 

Overall you get what you pay for and nothing more! Don't expect a 5 star service or food quality. Just an above average experience, both times!

Service - 5/5.

A place with great ambience and hospitable staff, there are a lot of options for food starting with the popular Indian chats to Indian and Continental foods, with an even larger oprion of desserts.
The quality was food was good too, but not exceptional. I was pretty disappointed with the pasta they prepared. Most of the desserts are also good.
Definitely worth a visit once, but I do not think I can rate it as a must visit place.
Cheers.

We went here this April on our anniversary. The buffet lunch started at 1 pm approx. However we enjoyed our ciggs outside in. The smoking zone. The ambiance of this place and decor is truly western and no doubt great.
Coming to food. Lots of variation in starters were not present. But ample option to meet your tongue desires. The biriyani was quite good and so was the mutton dish. The live parlours were really very good and dessert section just took me to another world. 
Price is quite reasonable. Point to note it was neither a holiday nor any special day but during 2pm it was almost 80 to 90 percent occupied. So if you are planning for weekend try to reserve your seats.

1. Starters- Could have been improved.. Certainly not the best part of the Lunch buffet.
2. Main course- Good. Ample options available.
3. Live corners- Amazing pastas served
4. Desserts- Heaven on earth. The most delectable ones..you need atleast 3 visits to taste them all.. the high ratings i gave..is actually scored by the Desserts section.

The over-hyped 5-star dining at around 1000 INR, and that's too buffet, Kolkata people rushed to JW Kitchen, which in turn serves several types of cuisine which fails for me. Well first impression would be great considering the five star ambience, but when coming to food I'm not much impressed. 

The worst is their hospitality at the desk, and I may not return for their buffet.

Dessert paradise !!!

The buffet has amazing variety in terms of main course and desserts. Very well presented food and being a weekday yesterday it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded. The noodle from the live counter is a must try and the desserts are fantastic (they even had dairy free options). The main course had Continental, Thai and Indian options but the food was a bit of a let down. Wasn't blown away by the flavours is what I mean. 
But one should go on a completely empty stomach just to try out their desserts.
Lastly, Service was impeccable and the staff are really sweet natured n well mannered.

Ambience,decor,food all were vry vry good.."BUT".. when we went to pizza counter..we were puzzled as the DONKEY (who was baking pizza @ the counter) asked us what are toppings we wd like..Now in any pizza eatery we went till date there is always a pizza name n we order it and have it..as they was huge spread of topping we got confused n asked him twice to name the toppings..n yess we as 1st timers in a 5üåüdid get puzzled in the name of toppings..and reaction of this chef was lyk uttering ..what do u think u are.., dnt knw frm where he has learnt to speak 2 english lines and one Fancy english slang..jst dat u wrk in JW marriot..u cant t
reat 1st timers to ur restraunt like these..there are many who may not have an idea about ur multicuisine lavish spread..n its quite normal fr us to not know the nuances of placing an order in a 5üåü hotel bcz evry1 doesnt visit a 5üåü everyday..really was sad fr such a behaviour! cnt expect dat from JW Marriot!!

A big celebration requires a big place. JW was the perfect place to celebrate my gf's birthday. After repeatative cancellation and booking ,finally got reservation for that day.
Note: Please do a reservation prior 2 weeks.
The place is amazing with imported decor and light works.It was a Saturday lunch and daam it was crowded. It was like Durga Puja over again.
we were taken to our seat and waiter on charge asked us to help ourselves with the buffet as they will close the buffet by 3 pm.
That was the last of him.... @jwkitchen- bad service.
Anyways I had to go and ask the other waiter to clean up my table.
Comming to the food-
There was a huge variety of foods from gujrathi namkeen food ,to continental, to simple fruits or make your own sandwich.
Being a Bengali or rather a likie of spicy food,the option were very common ,like biryani,kabaabs ,panner tikka,fish starters.
Nothing out of the world or exquisite in the Indian section.
Now the continental section had few options but we're tasty.Pics attached.
The desert had lot of option and by lot mean the most by any buffet restaurants in Kolkata...Starting from tarditional Bengali sweets,to @cakes,pastries,icecream and lots of topping to name a few.
Overall JW kitchen is place where u have a lot and lots of option but none of them standout that high.
Amazing decor and food presentation,polite staff but mostly invisible staff.
Costing around 2200 for two, has a big brand name but if u judge with food and just food,not worth the money.

Visited this place yesterday. We had a prior booking, so when we reached there we were directed to sit on table no. 40 from where we had such a lovely view of outside as well as the entire restaurant. Now coming to the ambience, the restaurant is beautiful. The decor, the colour and the furnishings, everything was top notch and gave a soothing feel even when it was fully packed with people having endless conversations. 
Now coming to the food, there were endless number of preparations and it is not really possible for any single person to try everything just in one visit. There were so many things that I can't even remember the names of most of the dishes. 
The things I tried includes a Chicken Kebab, Black Pepper Fried Fish , Paneer Malai Tikka and Crispy Vegetables in Plum Sauce, Roasted Chicken with jus, another herbs coated Fish preparation, Rosemary Potatoes, another Potato preparation with mustard sauce, then some dish with pork and mushrooms, another Fish preparation in some salad like thing, some mini sandwich with turkey, Bread Sticks, Cheese, Sabzi Biryani, Murg Biryani, Methi Murg, Bhuna Gosht, Papad and then the desserts. 
Among all the things I ate I really liked the Chicken Kebab. The chicken was tender and it was full of right kind of flavours. It melted in the mouth because it was cooked so well. The kind of kebab I could have all day long. 
The black pepper fish fry was a little dry and the taste was okay-ish. Nothing special about it. 
I personally found the malai tikka too sour. Anything having malai in it is supposed to taste a little bit on the sweeter side but not here so it was kind of disappointing. 
The crispy vegetables in plum sauce was really crispy and tasted good.
The dish with pork and mushrooms, the Fish preparation in some salad like thing and the mini sandwich were very bad except the potatoes in mustard sauce. It did not taste well at all and it was so bad that both me and my bff could not finish even those small amounts that we had taken on our bowls. 
The roasted chicken with jus had with skin chicken. It tasted good and looked good too. 
The fish with herbs was the show stealer. It was boneless fish (beckti I guess)tossed with herbs. It was tender inside and slightly crispy outside. It was so amazing that I wouldn't get tired even if I am given that fish all day long. Other than taste the quality of the fish was superior one. That's why the flavours came out so well.
The rosemary potatoes were amazing. I really really liked it very much. 
Both the sabzi biryani and murg biriyani were good especially the murg biriyani which tasted amazing. 
The methi malai murg was also very flavoursome and the flavours were quite similar to the home cooked chicken. 
The bhuna gosht was the best among the lot. It was packed with flavours of spice yet retaining the oh so good! taste of mutton. It went really well with the biriyani. 
Now coming to the desser section, there were so many things ranging from sandesh, ras malai, cakes, mousse cake, gulab jamun, cupcakes, pie, coffee cake, so many kind of chocolate chips and ice creams as well. Couldn't taste everything but among the things I tasted, I really liked the chocolate cake, coffee supreme cake, a nolen gurer sandesh, the ras malai which was amazing and another dessert with pistachio base. The mousse cake was not good, it had salted caramel on top and in the middle and it was way too salty. Another dessert was there which again had the same salted caramel on top which was again too salty. If the salt was less, the dessert would have been good. The cupcakes were good too but by the time I started eating the cupcake, I didn't have any space left for it so could eat it entirely. The milk chocolate chips and the dark chocolate chips both were good.
Yesterday I couldn't try the thai curries, various chaats from the live counter, soups and pastas from the live counter. 
A special mention to the service department there. The service was top notch and they were very attentive to every single table. Cleared the table as soon as we finished eating and went to get some new ones. 
The management was very efficient and cater immediately to resolve any problem a customer faces and work towards providing them full customer satisfaction. It is really praise-worthy the way they handle situations and does not shy away from any mishap on their part and provide all the help they could. I am really very impressed with the way they work. 
If I were to rate the place on the basis of food I would have given it a 3 or 3.5 but for the efficient management and top notch service I am rating the place 4.
I guess I will visit the place again to try out the things I had missed yesterday. üòä

Visited JW Marriott for dinner ¬†on 18/04/2017 with very high expectations, specially after going through the previous reviews.

But sadly, it was way below the expectations. 

The service, the food, the drinks nothing could pull out a 5 star quality.

Service was extremely slow, we had to nag for everything, to clean the table, to get a spoon , to get the orders.¬†
The appetizers, main course, desserts absolutely lacked taste and the food was extremely bland. 

The kebabs served was not tender enough, the main course menu was very common and extremely basic.

I had ordered a Margarita for a drink, the salt on the rim of the glass melted by the time it was served, leaving no taste of the salt when i had it.

Only the decor left me a feeling that i might be in a 5 star, sadly nothing else.

I am extremely disappointed, as i visited JW Marriott on a very special family occasion and thought it would end with a special dinner.

A beautiful place with some delicious buffet. In a sunny afternoon we entered the place at 1:30 pm and it was already full then. Coming to the food, it had a really wide spread buffet starting from some kebabs to Thai to continental to Chinese to Indian. Among Indian cuisine it had Bengali, Gujrati, Marathi, Rajasthani etc. Some live counters for pasta/ chowmein would catch your attention.  In the desert section they had separate Indian and continental deserts along with ice cream section. Among drinks we tried nolen gur vodka, mango pulp and couple of beer. The cocktail was really unique and tasty. 
Over all, stuffs were very well behaved, food was good, with some excellent decor. This buffet costs 899+tax for Monday to Saturday lunch which is a good deal.

We were there for the Sunday brunch and the experience was tasting a world cuisine under one roof  in its  true sense. It was not just  a huge spread of Indian,Continental,and Chinese dishes.A sincere effort of presenting the varied tastes of the finest cuisines across the globe was very prominent.Starting from the Easter Sunday Ham Roast to the little delicacies like cheese wrapped sea food cannolies-all had  that  authentic uniqueness which we expect from professionals.Also liked the presence of Israeli cuisine -  one of the most well known for its plethora of rich flavours  but still not very  prominently present in Kolkata  food map. (Although expecting some more delicious  dishes other than the falafels and chicken shashlik rolls with traditional Humus and Tahini dips.)
                  I 'll like to mention the oriental lamb shank.I generally don't prefer lamb in oriental cuisine.But I'm glad  that I gave it a try and the result was unbelievable.The rich aromas of  star anise and five spices were  blended with the lamb so nicely that was beyond my expectation.
            Plenty of veg options in the continental  cuisine were also delights for the veggie lovers.We tried the Biriyani as well which was of authentic Awadhi style and was  superb with Handi Gosht.
           But the most delightful delicacy of the entire buffet was the Cheese section.I am not going to mention the different variety of Brie,Emmental.Gouda and even the finest   French Roquefort that were present  there  and are also found in any good buffet. Marriott offers some freshly made house cheese including  mozzarella and Burrata.The freshness of those  succulent,smooth,creamy delicacies are the greatest reason of visiting the buffet more often.I am sure I have never experienced house made fresh cheese in any of  such buffet in Kolkata.Last but not the least I must mention about the staffs who are well versed in any of the  cuisine  and were ready to give suggestions and share information about  any particular dish.They specially prepared  a red wine based cocktail for us to pair with the fresh mozzarella and the combination was the most enjoyable one of the entire afternoon.
Thanks
Shall surely visit again.

I had my client meeting in JW and the overall experience was very good. Our client also liked the place but after that whenever I tried to call JW Kitchen to know about the Sunday Buffet (LUNCH or DINNER), I always got one reply that it is House-full. So i would still ask Do we need to call and confirm a table before going for Sunday Lunch and do the buffet offer still on?

Had lunch buffet at JW Kitchen with 3 of my family members today. On the whole, it was a good experience. Ambience, service and the spread were good. But the following things disappointed me :

1) The air-conditioning left a lot to be desired. It was uncomfortably warm and, mind you, summer is just about starting in Kolkata. 
2) Bongs love mutton. There was only one mutton dish - a curry. During the course of my lunch I visited the mutton curry counter twice. On both occasions, I found that very little quantities of mutton pieces were available and the pieces themselves were very small. 
3) There were no barbecue items. 
4) There were no pork dishes. 

The dessert selection was good. I liked the cheeses and salads too. My daughter tried some Thai preparations and found them yummy. The bill for 4 of us came to Rs 4,333 (no drinks).

Got the booking for dinner after waiting for 1long month, the wait was worthwhile though. The ambience was great, but the rush is high. Undoubtedly, a classly experience. You will be spoilt with choices. There are series of counters with variety of cuisines, like north indian, Gujarati, Thai, Chinese, Italian etc. There are few live counters, who take your customized order. The service was good. The best part was the dessert portion, which alone occupied 3 big tables, including variety of sweets, cakes, custard, moose, pastries etc.

The moment you enter J W Marriott, you get that classy vibe and trust me, you'll love it.

Now coming to the food, J W Kitchen definitely brings up a palate of assorted food items which you simply can't stop enjoying. We had gone for a buffet and I would suggest you to visit the buffet at 12.30 pm to have a less rushed and laidback lunch, since their buffet closes down by 3.15 pm.

The starters were delicious and what I loved the most was the diverse range of food items. For the main course, the Biriyani was awesome and the Live Pasta counter too was great.

The dessert items were too many and we could hardly try out all of them.

I enjoyed my lunch and hopefully I will be visiting again.

We had chosen their Dinner buffet.Live noodle may look good ..but the noodles prepared by them  a is really awful..fish was smelly, the chicken dishes were over cooked the desserts look but few tasted horrible, the waffle seems like papad , in short food was horrible. The only good thing was the staffs there , they were extremely polite and helpful always greets with smile..overall J W Marriott food was horrible

The breakfast spread was average at best. The waffles and pancakes were extremely ordinary. Preparation of scrambled eggsare really below average ..Not even matching their standard! Very slow service. Lots of unnecessary items like khakras and fafras were a part of the spread. Dumplings were overcooked. Overall, a very ordinary experience. Did not meet my expectations of a five star breakfast buffet.I had earlier very high expectations from JW Marriott with their Crossroads kitchen .But this JW Kitchen ..Does not meet the standards.

Had breakfast on this Bengali new year day. Feeling was just wow....just lavish. Everything from samosas to parathas, from croissants to cakes are just so perfect. Only areas for improvement are :
1. Increase capabilities of the South Indian live counters. The average waiting time was around 25-30 minutes for dosas and uttapams.
2. The seats facing the facade gets direct sunlight and might not be a great idea on a Calcutta summer day.
The billing is very reasonably priced @650+ taxes for breakfast.

The walk to JW Kitchen is through the lobby and it gives you the feeling of something grand.

Lovely decor with hanging lamps for a beautiful evening time too.

The buffet is a luxurious spread of what not. 5-7 types of starters. 
The live counter didn't live upto my expectations as most of the things were done in similar sauces.
I don't go much through the main course section, but the Biryani was really good.
They had a Jain section too with Gujarati cuisine of Fafda, Dhokla, Khandvi and Raj Kachori etc.
The exotic cheese section was a eye catcher. Since you need to develop a taste for such stuffs.
What blew me away was the Dessert section. More than 15 types of desserts and live waffle section. I'd pay any amount for such type of dessert spread.

Hospitality was great. Food spread was great. The taste wasn't spectacular but worth it.

Highly antipicated JWM finally opened at Kolkata. The hotel next to my home, was eagerly awaiting the day when I will get time to visit it. So one fine Sunday I called up hotel restaurent JW kitchen for table reservations. Unfortunately the brunch was all full and reserved the table for next Saturday. 
The hotel entrance is grand with nice decor inside. Finally we got our table and we were eager to hit the food. The variety is great. You have Indian, Italian, Continental Chinese etc. 
The food taste was ordinary and few of Indian snacks items were having foul smell which was not at all expected.
Quality of desserts is good. You get varieties here too. Ok one time visit.

Food - The food served is excellent in all ways. The presentation,taste,quality and quantity all are perfectly balanced. Indian, Chinese, Continental, Italian; many cuisines are available. Special mention of the dessert section. Four counters serve you with desserts making the sweet toothed go mad!

Ambience - Good and peaceful ambience to visit with family and friends. 

Service - All attendants are helpful and happy to serve you.

Rates - 1000+tax for the buffet. Being a new venue in the city JW Kitchen is offering good food at a reasonable rate!

Catch up fast before the rates go higher üòã

There are no points in guessing why JW kitchen is the most talked about place in the city right now! Firstly, it it THE JW Marriott and secondly it is offering a buffet having an enormous variety of cuisines at a very reasonable rate. If you talk about the decor, ambience or the service of the place chances are you would be short of words. From the point‚Äã you enter the hotel till the time you leave the staff offer you a very warm and courteous service. The ambience bestows class and elegance all at one time. Coming to the food section, make sure you have an agenda about where to start and how to proceed because they have a huge number of dishes at their disposal. Be at the turkey ham pork loaf, the cheese and dips, type of breads, salads, indian and continental it's endless. Though I have to say the salads and grilled prawn were ice cold which was what I started with so it was somewhere a turn off for me. The murgh biriyani, fish in black sauce, drums of heaven, live noodles and pasta counter and chat counter need an individual mention. But they did save the best for the last. The dessert section of JW kitchen is both droolworthy and sinfully delicious. The blueberry mousse, gazar ka halwa, tiramisu, chocolate pudding, mango cake or the types of cupcakes, simply amazing! You cannot finish having all of them at one go. You can't! If value for money and variety are concerned this place is foodies' paradise though the quality of dishes or the taste quotient is not something to remember if you expect it to be. So go and have an amazing time with your loved ones at JW Kitchen soon, if not overwhelmed it surely would be an experience you won't regret having over and over again.

** Location = Located by the EM Bye pass near to the Science City and also just opposite to the Silver Spring Arcade.

**Brief = We went there to celebrate the Birthday of a friend and made advanced reservations a week before and the same was confirmed the night before our visit. Once reaching the place we were asked to wait as they were getting ready with the buffet. We opted for sunday brunch.

** Ambiance = Very well decorated and the glass panes makes it more beautiful. We were attended by Krishanu and Duss, both were very much cordial and helpful.

** Things tried = We opted for the Sunday Brunch and they had unlimited Kingfisher Premium beer and Sangri La(red and white options). They also served iced tea which felt refreshing.

Started with french fries, Chicken Nuggets and Vegetable Burger. I was remembering my college days while having pop corn with beer.
The live dumplings and noodles counter was a delight. Duss was magical with the pasta also. The pizza counter was also doing a great work with the thin crust and cheesy pizzas. Both the chicken and veggie pizza was nicely prepared.¬†

The live shawarma counter was also preparing mini shwarma wraps and it tasted great.

Loved the chicken and mushroom soba noodles and chicken rice noodles.¬†
The mixed noodles with corn, sea food and chicken also tasted nice. The Chicken roast was a bit cold and I expected it to be more hot and crisp. The salads and chat counters were also visited and I liked the prawn salads. The salmond was fresh and tasted nice, I liked the preparation.

I did not like the lamb though, it was really cold and dry and would have been better if it was a bit more roasted and juicy.

In the main course there was biriyani and chicken which I tried and tasted decent. They served us the "Happy Birthday" cake as well.¬†
Special mention goes for the desserts section, serving quality sweetmeats and the ice creams were also decent, tried scoops of chocolate and kesar pista.

** Purse Check = Our bill was around Rs.10,650/- for 7 heads and I felt trice is the reason for the place being overcrowded.

**Overall = Loved the place and the food therein. Special mention of the gentlemen named Krishanu and Duss once again for the services they provided. Cheers! Will definitely come back for more such lunches and dinners.

Jw Kitchen is the place to go to if you want a 5star dining experience,however it is better if you do not expect much in terms of taste of the food being served.

It serves an array of dishes - non veg/veg starters(chinese,thai,indian)cheese counter,bread counter,gujrati dish counter,salad counter,live counters for noodles and dessert counter,out of which  i loved the biriyani,mushroom starter, DIY salad counter,creme brulee and chocolate mousse cake.


There are some disaster dishes too,especially the dessert counter as each of the dishes look spectacular but most of them dont taste up to the mark , hence it is advisable to have very small portions in the beginning while you are tasting them.

The best part about this place is the overall experience and its pricing-1100 (per head ,tax included,weekdays lunch)

We visited Marriott for the dinner buffet on th occassion of my father's birthday. We chose the 9pm slot and the place was bursting at the seems! However, we were lucky to get a table away from the hustle and bustle. The main course was good. We had biriyani, kebabs, dhokla. However, it would be a good idea to concentrate on the desserts, which were  beautiful. They had icecream, cake, waffles, cupcakes, pies and other little treats. And really, hats off to the staff. They ensured promt service even in the utter chaos and a gentleman even enquired how our meal was going. Rs 1200 is really a steal. The birthday turned out to be wonderful :)

A 5-star buffet experience at a very affordable price.
The entire meal costs you 1018 ‚Çπ /- and believe me, every penny is worth it.
There are separate counters for every cuisine.
The Continental Counter had Grilled Fish, Grilled Chicken, Potato Steak, Baked Vegetables, Chicken Noodle Soup made to order and a live pasta counter where you could have your choice of red and white pasta.
The Thai Counter with its chicken and fish items and Mushroom soup also made noodle To Order. You could have your choice of Brown Noodles and Rice Noodles as well.
The Cheese counter, the counter for Indian Regional food as well as the Salad counter had a multitude of dishes. Apart from this, there were also cold cuts and a counter where the cold cuts were tossed up with veggies.
I took a 0.5 off for the Indian dishes. While the kabas were falling off the bone and tasted delicious, the Biryani simply did not make the mark. The spread also had four starters, four mains and a variety of papads including prawn crackers.
Coming to desserts, this is probably the buffet with the biggest dessert spread in Kolkata. There were sugar free desserts, Indian sweets and a counter solely dedicated to eclairs, cupcakes, mousse, macaroons as well as a huge spread of other food items which dessert-lovers will crave for.
Surely a place to revisit again and again.

Had gone to this place with a lot of expectations but sadly all of them were not met. There was a lot to choose from. From chaats, salads, starters to desserts, there was a huge variety. One could simply not have everything. The chaats were okay and lacked the flavours that one expects from them. The pasta was very bland and one of the worst I've ever had. The main course and the starters were nice but nothing great. The salad counter was good and so were the desserts. There were more than 20 types of desserts and the ones I tried, were pretty good. Those going for the buffet, I would suggest- start with the desserts. The service and the ambience was great. However I expected better from the food.

It was our 4th anniversary and my boyfriend decided to take me to this place.. The ambience was really awesome and the staff was friendly. The buffet had too many items to taste each of them,but the ones which we tasted were awesome. The live counters were good too,but however, they served veg pasta instead of nonveg pasta,but that can be excused considering the good taste of it üòú
The main attraction was the dessert parlor.. there were so many desserts that we couldn't try everything there too but each of them tasted really great... And the cost including taxes were almost Rs. 2200 for two,which I think is quite reasonable considering a place like JW Marriott.. will surely recommend this place to everyone

This is my first visit to the place. I love buffet and heard good reviews from friends regarding the place. We went for lunch on a busy monday. After entering the place i was really amazed with the decor and the live counters(it was a new experience for me). Our table attendant was Mr. Krishanu and with his friendly as well as informative nature guided us about the where about of the place. We tried pene-pasta with white sauce and rice noodles from the live counters. It was very innovative to include a live chat counter in a lunch buffet. We mostly tried everything in small portions. Still at the end i was so full that i was unable to taste all the deserts, because for the extravagance of the buffet, so i have to revisit the place for the love of the desert. Also the atmosphere and the service of all the staffs including the chefs were extraordinary. Cheers! Krishanu for the complementary drink.

Went today to celebrate my hubby's birthday. As soon as we entered, we were welcomed very warmly. Ambience as we all know is just wonderful! Coming to the food, there was a wide array of food items. One cannot have each and every item. But what I really missed is Taste. Very few dishes were worth praising. Both starters and main course were average, except for the chicken lasagna, biryani and stir fried chicken. In the dessert section-so many items! Good ones were the cupcakes, mudpie and malpua ( according to my taste). But the waffles were the best! Reasonably priced. And the best thing in this property is their service. Have been to many places, but this place wins over everything with their Service! Keep up the good work.

Visited JW kitchen for its popular sunday brunch. The selection ranged from indian to italian from falfel to waffles, you name it. The nachos and tacos were really delicious especially when coupled with the baked beans. There are live pizza, pasta and noodle counters but the food from the live counters wasn't upto the mark. There is also a cocktail counter having several types of sangria and a range of beer cocktails. The stir fried mushroom starter was really amazing and the dal makhni was one of the best I've ever had. Coming to the deserts there were too many to decide, which ones you'd like to taste. Some were great, some not too great. They also have ice cream cones and a waffle counter which really was the best part of the menu. PS: Dont miss out on the gummy bears they have on the desert counter.

JW Marriott has a charm of its own. Was there on a Sunday Brunch, the Massive spread is beyond imagination. A bit unfair to Vegetarians as they get all regular dishes from the menu, however dessert is a dream come true. 
I started with Indian starters- Fried Mushrooms and Hariyali Paneer. 
Then there were live counters for Asian Specialities I.e noodles, Pasta and Pizza. 
Next we went on to Hummus platter, Tacos and Nachos. Varieties in the dips and fillings are so amazing. You feel full just with display. 
Then there was Indian Main course. 
Dal makhani Smells amazing and tastes way better than what you've tried in other restaurants of Kolkata. 
Brunch includes Cocktails and Mocktails. Just tell the Bartender how you like your drink, he'll bring you the best. 

Desserts I've already mentioned is a dream come true.Nutella waffles are Dreamy. Most of the Kolkatans have already Visited if you haven't make sure you book a table of the closest date.

The Food Array is Really Awesome.
Gastronomically speaking it is a mini world tour. In an hours time you can have Osso Buco from Italy, Ratatouille from France, Oriental delights from Thailand and China. Gujrati Theplas and Chats, Kababs and Biriyanis all jostle for space in your stomach as the foodie in you rejoices at the choices available. Its really not that expensive considering the five star status. Enjoy with a big gang cause there is literally everything for every category of foodie.

The newest addition to the Stars in Kolkata is this little ergo big kitchen of JW Marriot.
To start with the place looks beautiful. The decor, the set up, the lights and the staff are all super cool. No wonder we had to die to get a reservation (with some help).
Coming to the foodie part, The Spread Is Lavish and really long drawn. From Mughlai Kababs and Biriyani to Gujrati Khakra, they pretty much got your Indian side covered. The live Asian and Italian counters served their purpose well, although I wish I could find some chicken in my 'Chicken Penne' üò¢
Naan, rotis were served hot on order too, which, sadly, I was too full to even try.
For people with a sweet tooth, like me, Its Heaven!! The dessert counter had enough to keep me hooked for the night but I do have some suggestions there.
The brulees lost there charm as the caramel melted away as did the eclairs nd tartswhen they got soggy. The tiramisu was super as were the hot waffles. Others were at part but the whole 'Drying Issue' as happens with cakes and tarts made me a little sad. Indian sweets were nice as was the panna cota.
Overall, I would sure hope everyone tries this place out and hope the management keeps up there good work keeping the pocket pinch in mind.

Had dinner here with family yesterday. Here are my key takeaways from the experience. 
1. Spread is huge 
2. 2 live counters(Chinese and Italian) 
3. Only three starters.  But main course compensates with variety
4. Top 5 dishes that I  enjoyed were Squid  chowmein , Pasta in white sauce, lasagnes, Irish lamb stew and biryani. 
5. The buffet has more desert options than one can possibly count. 
6. At 1200 rupees (including tax)  for dinner this very good value for money
7.Staff are very courteous

It was a fine Sunday when I visited for lunch.
I had waited for 40 minutes almost loitering here and there before getting a table for two which was in the sun's exposure but we didn't say no to it because it was already 2 and the kitchen closes by 3.(the time should be extended till 4)
The spread is not too vast I would say..
I could hardly enjoy any of the starters,main course or desserts because I found them tasteless.
The presentation of everything is great but I would want them to work on their taste factor because we are paying for the foods' taste and not just the looks.
The fish was smelly like the ocean water.
To my disappointment there were no prawns.
Mixed sauce pasta from the live counter was terrible.
The Chicken biryani just tasted of Kewra and rose essence.
The only thing I enjoyed was the Thai Green curry with rice,rest was all waste for me lying on the plates.
Coming to the staffs,they get confused a lot. The naan ordered by me was served to some other table for which again i had to wait for another 5 to 7 minutes,meanwhile my curries got cold. 
The desserts were beautiful to look at which I didnt want to eat because they were too pretty to be eaten and actually it did happen. I hardly ate because of the bad taste. (A picture is posted where I am trying to show how much i left on the plate because of no taste.)
People who are willing to spend that much for a tasty meal,I would suggest they rather visit an ordinary restaurant instead of Marriott because you won't get taste here.
Never going back again.üëéüèª

Went there without a booking but the restaurant manager was courteous enough to give us the table within few minutes.
The variety of food is what I liked about the buffet.
The best section in all was the dessert section which was scrumptious and mouth watering.
Overall a great experience.

The food is very very mediocre, though the spread is pretty decent but there is no wow factor with the kind of hype that has been created. BIGGEST drawback, the air conditioner was absolutely at its worst possible state. We were literally sweating after a point, we did complain twice but no action was taken on it. Throughout the lobby not for once did we feel that we were in a 5* property, it was rather suffocating.

Not impressed.

went there on a weekday for lunch.the ambience is truely five star.i booked a table two weeks in advance.all the staffs were friendly.we started by having kebabs.we tried chicken,fish and mushroom kebabs.all the kebabs were delicious.then we ordered pasta with red sauce.after that we had noodles,which was quite unique in taste.then we tried grilled chicken and fish.i liked both the items and they were perfectly cooked.for main course we took chicken biriyani,mutton rogan josh.the mutton pieces were so well cooked.the biriyani was quite good too.there were many more items which we didn't try.then came the turn for the desserts and they had atleast 30-40 kinds of desserts.i liked the pistachio fudge,chocolate tart,cheese cake the most.there were bengali sweets too but they were just okay.overall an excellent experience and the best thing is that it is very pocket friendly.

This place has an unbelievable variety of food and it is humanly impossible to even taste all of the stuff. Great ambience, well-trained staff and a decor and ambience that totally lives up to the JW experience. Here's my tryst with the various food types:
Salads- I'm not a salad person but there's plenty of options for those who are.
Indian- For starters there were 3 types of kebabs- chicken, paneer and mushroom. For main course there was murg biryani, gosth rogan josh, mustard fish. For veg, there was jafraani pulav, paneer butter masala, spicy aloo and palak-corn. 
Asian- galore of Chinese and Thai cuisines. Had only roast lamb with sauce, and chowmein prepared from the live counter.
Gujrati- Tasted thepla, khakra, dhokla, gathiya with 6 types of pickles, and chutney.
English- I had penne pasta with white sauce from the live counter, also 2 varieties of sandwich and multiple types of bread, cheese, butter, ham, bacon, olives were available.
Chaats- This too is a live counter and you can get your favourite type of chaat/bhel/panipoori made and served to you. I tried dahi fuchka.
Dessert- This is the real deal. Almost 50 types of dessert were present, some of whose names I cannot even recall. My favorites were blueberry eclairs, white chocolate cake, barfi, gajar ka halwa, chomchom, mousse in a jar and muffins. 
Needless to say that the food was tasty, light cooked with less oil. The cons however were the fact that the choice of beverages (you have to pay extra if you want a drink) were low and there was no demarcation for veg. And non veg. For example the same spoon was being used to serve both veg. and non-veg. And it might not be acceptable to people who are purists. But the experience was value for money and certainly brag-worthy.

The buffet is tooo pocket friendly with large spread especially for non vegetarians but i found it quite chaotic. As a vegetarian, wasnt quite happy with the choice that i got. They had no division for non vegetarian and vegetarian food and it wasnt labelled properly too so i found it quite displeasing. Starters were nice. 
Dessert spread was huge but to my amazement, not even a single dessert was worth drooling over. It looked so pretty and tempting, and tasted bad. Overall the experience wasnt a pleasant one as per the standards

There buffet is a must try! We went for dinner on a Sunday evening..it was almost full. 
The huge salad counter was the first section which grabbed my eyes. They have chats , live pasta counter, farsaan , live noodles counter.......it seems endless.
Each and everything was up to the mark except the quality of fish, to me it was stiff. The ultimate treat to my eyes and tounge was the dessert counter!! Specially the chocolate waffles...it's surely a must try.

But the service should be more prompt. From a restaurant of this class we expect more from the service part.

I had booked the table two weeks in advance in order to avoid any dissapointment because I heard it was always fully-booked brunch. It was a great experience for my first brunch in my culinary life.
The restaurant design was simply huge and very bright. The brunch offered a huge selection of dishes from Asian, Mediterranean and local Indian foods. It gave me difficulty to choose where to begin and what to eat. At the end, I managed it. ¬†

I love the selection of appetizer and antipasti such as salami/ham, olives, asparagus, the thai glass noodle salad, different kinds of sauce and condiments; the bread and cheese section such as mozzarella, brie, blue cheese and kind of medium cheese . Besides that, They offers Indian snacks section and Tacos. I loved my first Puri with the sweet sour taste. On the other hand, the Asian appetizer such as Momo is in the buffet as well.¬†

Goes to main course: Selection of pasta, pizza, kebab and asian teppanyaki section is on the choice. I didn't try it because it was not on my list. I had the soft and tender lamb shank with selection of roasted vegetables.¬†
There were huge selection of Indian main course from lamb biryani, steamed biryani, dal makhani, dal tadka, chicken masala, murgh malai, vegetable kebab and many mores. I tried a spoon of dal makhani and piece of murgh malai. The taste was okay, needs some salt and dal was a bit bitter.¬†

Goes to dessert section: A huge selection of dessert from mini tart, cakes, waffle/pancake, ice creams, muffin, croissant, etc. It was very tempting section but I can't manage to try all. I just had the red velvet cake - it was very tasty.¬†

In conclusion, JW Kicthen has offered very good selection of food with really affordable price. The Service and Kitchen team has done really good job to manage the best service in the fully booked restaurant (more than 100 persons in brunch service). They do not forget to smile because of the hectic of the service. It is not easy but for sure they manage it. There is always space to improve. Good job and Good luck JW Kitchen team.

Currently the best place for buffet in town with a wide variety of choices. We had been here for dinner or lunch handful of times and it's worth the money. 
They got everything from fruits to various cuisines and lots of dessert. Ambience and lobby of the hotel mesmerise u equally each time we go there.
We started with the fruits, little bit chaats then some salad dressing followed by pasta and Mongolian noodles, some black dal sabzi naan and finally dessert.  Their live counters pasta in both in Arrabiata and pesto sauce and noodles were perfect and highly appealing. They also have some Gujarati and Jain dishes. After having 18 dessert i think some were still left to be tried for the next time. There's altogether 45 types of Bengali and western dessert.
Some dishes do taste bland or undercooked but with so much options one could overlook and move on. Hospitality is top class and @ 1200 the buffet is worth every penny. I would suggest to do prior bookings 2 days earlier otherwise u won't get seats.

You just cannot rate this place anythng less than 5.

When i had counted the no. of items that was on buffet, it closed down to 50 on my hand alone. I am sure, i must have missed out 5-6 items more while counting.

Dessert Counter would have alone held 20 items and really hands down to the cakes and varieties it had.

The staff and too too courteous and the ambience itself is top notch.

Pocket pinch: 1180 incld tax for dinner.

I had a lot of expectation before coming to this place and also I got excited when I saw various item. Apart from the chicken kebab form kebab counter and main course nothing was nice. Every food we tried ended up  wasting it and it does not worth the money if the taste is like this. Desert section has many choices but desert was too not so tasty as I thought it to be.
Only the interior and good stuff was the only thing I liked.

Great taste..at a 5 star..at such a buffet price is a deal worth taking! 
If you are into indian dishes..starters include kababs..fish fries..panneer.. I loved the chicken kababs..soft and mouthwatering.. The bean chicken soup is thick..sweet and sour...loved it.
 In the main course I really liked Rogan Josh..the flavour fills your palate and then it melts on your tongue like butter.. The chicken dish and the biryani were both great. For the vegetarians out there...choices are limited.
I feel the Fish Ajwain curry could have been better.. The flavours were all there..but the quality of the fish wasn't that good..(believe me..we bengalis judge fish better than people!) 
There were two Thai curries..I tasted the chicken Thai
.and found it tasteful. 
At one of the live counters..I ordered noodles with only prawn and some vegies. It tasted good. I even tatsed pasta with white sauce. If you are not much into pasta..or noodles I suggest you not to fill up on them. Ask for small portions to taste. There's another live counter serving chat. There are a few gujrati snacks like dhokla..(and more..whose names I keep forgetting) 
If you like seafood..there s a dish of muscles (I think).. I food it good. 
 There are blocks of various cheese..beef..and pork if you are into them.
The salad counter has various dressings.. toppings.. along with some dishes which in little bits were all I could taste.
At the end..there s the desert counter..where as you might have read before..the sheer number is appealing! You must know that when a particular dessert finishes from the counter..they may replace it with a different dessert. So you might miss the second helping you were looking for! 

My suggestions..
Go early for a good space. Reserving beforehand would save you from waiting for a table. But they usually have some table ready. 
Eat responsibly..don't go around wasting food and have fun!

Finally I dined at the lunch buffet. This is the finest dining experience I have ever had.
Ambience - 5/5:
The magnificent arena has far stretched food galore. Beautiful interiors ooze royalty in every aspect of a fine dining.
Food-4.5/5:
I wish they added adequate salt in the noodle I asked for. Then it would have been e perfect 5.Do mention about the salt measure when they they prepare anything of your choice, just a small tip :) Apart from that single dish at a connoisseur's tongue.
It was thoroughly outstanding. My picks would be the chicken noodles soup, the mutton kasha preparation(best so far in my experience) and super delicious desserts. Considering the varieties they have, the buffet platters every cuisine for you. It has Asian, Italian,Farsi,Indian and a 'phew' more!
All of those are super delicious.
Service-5/5:
Very courteous and polite gentlemen and ladies are designated service personnel. They are so nicely groomed that you will be charmed by their service. A big thumbs up to the service.
Everything is so perfect about this place my dear foodie pals. Dining here is an unforgettable experience!

Didn't like the service at all. We went there at 2.15 pm and within 3 pm they all started removing all the buffet items, which were not at all great. Before removing the buffet items they didn't even bother to ask whether we have finished nor did inform us that they are closing. We had to take the dessert items before hand before finishing our main course. Very average.

Great ambience, wonderful food and amazing value for money. This sums up the dinner buffet. We went on 31st Jan for dinner. It was our anniversary. We had made a reservation couple of days back and we reached on time. We were seated immediately and chose the buffet. It is one of the widest spreads that the city has to offer. Apart from the regular stuff, there were a lot of live counters as well. There was an Oriental live counter, an Italian live counter, a kabab live counter and even a dessert live counter which served hot waffles of your choice. All in all a great experience for just 1200 bucks.

First of all, i don't remember how many items were there! üòÇ Lots of dishes, fruits, dry fruits, live counters. Either u can have some salad , or go with pasta, chaat, noodles. You can't have each of all dishes. Lavish preparation. You can't get enough of it. Our dinner was awesome. Post dinner, we went up in poolside bar. Ambience up there simply amazing. Sitting beside pool with soothing music will definitely uplift your mood !

Lastly, go have a dinner, it's awesome at 1.2k bucks! üòäüëç

I visited JW kitchen for lunch with my wife and son on the occasion of Holi. The service levels right from security check-in , valet parking and assistance at the restaurant was impeccable. The staff was courteous  all through out and responded promptly to our queries and requirements. With respect to the food, the spread was significant and covered major global cuisines. Special mention to seafood and mushroom stew and stir fried noodles from the live counter!. The quality of the spread in the oriental section can be improved, but nothing to complain about.  We were spoilt for choice in the dessert section that provided innovative options such multi layered coconut and fruit cake. The spa section housing the infinity pool along with the overall decor and ambience of the hotel was a notch above a few of the older 5* establishment in Kolkata.  USP is overall value for money for the services rendered.

JW Marriot's Kitchen is the one thing Kolkata foodies are talking about everyday. A breakfast, lunch or dinner buffet at this price at a 5 Star Hotel  chain is something you don't get much often. ¬†
Live counters for chaat, pasta and Asian was incredible.¬†
Ambience: It was really superb as the names says it all J.W.
Staff: Really well behaved staffs.
Deserts were a special section in the menu staring with tarts,cupcakes to sandesh and icecreams. Close to 20+ items covering up all the Indian and International dishes.¬†

If you believe in the concept of feasting like royalty, JW Marriott Kolkata ensures you get just that.
Their elaborate buffet spread was not only a treat to the eyes,but also the body,mind and soul.

From quintessential Indian, Pan Asian to even Continental and Italian preparations- Its a foodie wonderland.

Personally, I've had one of the best preparations of kebabs, herbed potatoes and Thai fish curry.

The Indian section apart from the Biryani wasn't that great. The mutton Rogan Josh was in fact a disappointment.

The desserts however stole my heart .

This is one of the best lemon tarts I've had a chance to sink my teeth in. Mildly citrus with a dried candied lime piece was my happy ending at the Marriott kitchen.

The buffets are pretty reasonable which is why it is advised to make prior reservations.

The spread is big and nice.. Deserts were good. Had enough vegetarian options.. The only concern is the taste of the food.. The chats and starters were ok but the main course was not good.. There were many options but none of them tasted good.. The taste of the food is not good.. Specially towards the end of buffet hours the quality of curries and dal was bad.. The service is also not Upto the mark.. I had to request for certain things a couple of times before I finally got it..

I generally do not rate places as low as a 2.0 but JW Kitchen does not deserve a better rating.¬†I called up the restaurant at 8:00 P.M. and asked them if they had a table for 2 of us. They said, "Sorry, we are sold out". I wanted to try my luck anyway so I reached the restaurant at 8:45-ish and surprisingly (?!) got a table for two. I did not understand the idea of refusing me a table over the phone but allotting me one later.¬†Such things in the beginning of an experience spoil one's mood but I wanted to give the restaurant a fair chance to satiate my taste bud. Having opted for the buffet, we did not have our hopes VERY high but then the buffets at HHI etc. are fantastic and if the hotel wishes to survive in such a competitive space - the quality and taste need to be top notch. Anyway, if you're paying a premium (INR 1,200), the least you can expect is good food (if not great).¬†

We had Paneer Tikka and the JW Chaat for starters. The paneer was hard, under cooked and tasted terrible (it was paneer dressed with some odd spices but passed off as tandoori paneer tikka). The JW Chaat was the saving grace of my evening. Before I write any further, the fantastic thing about JWK is that they avoid queues at live counters by taking your order and delivering it to your table. The bad thing is that for someone so particular about their food, it kills the point of having a live counter and the food is more likely to not meet your expectations.¬†

We had the Paneer Do Pyaza, Dal Makhni, Pasta, Noodles, Yellow Curry for main course. Paneer was stale/undercooked/hard yet again; Pasta tasted terrible and unlike any mixed sauce pasta you've had and the noodles were anything but your traditional hakka noodles (overflowing Soya sauce). The naans were fine so I alternated between naan-daal and naan-curry. (?!)¬†JWK is the newest hot spot in Kolkata and the least they can do is hire some fantastic chefs OR change their recipes a bit. JW Kitchen at the Walnut Grove Spa in Mussorie's Marriott is all that JWK Kolkata isn't. I do not think it is a fair comparison to start with (since this is a business hotel and that is a resort) but then, these comparisons are inevitable.¬†
I have always believed that come what may - no restaurant in the world can go wrong with their dessert - and JWK's desserts were not up to the mark either (Barring one chocolate and vanilla souffl√© kinda dish). ¬†I was thoroughly underwhelmed, and feel INR 1,200 is much too much for a substandard spread and a less-than-below-average taste.¬†
The grandiose of the hotel is truly undone by an all-dressing-no-meat JW Kitchen, and I feel the restaurant has a long way to go before it comes just another coffee shop that remains empty on weekdays and weekends alike.

Tried lunch buffet today. Around 1100 per person including tax..
 Had a delicious and lovely experience. Food quality so good and "HEALTHY". Too much Variety  in food specially in desert.. salads. 

Chicken  kebabs..fried fish..potato pops..nd some many more fish and chiken were there as "starters"...!

In main course there was both veg nd non veg biriyani.. a chicken dish made up of tandoori chicken. A fish curry. Mix veg. Two types of daal.. THAI dishes also available..and many more..lamb was also available. 

4 types of  Cheese .. sandwich (which was so tasty and healthy according to me).. a sub type of thing..turkey ham etc etc were there

Farshan counter was also available. 

LIVE COUNTER  of PASTA, ASIAN DISH, And CHAATT (trust me on this the chaat  counter was amezing üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç)

Lots of fruits like Green and red  apple, watermelon , dragon fruit, sweet Imli etc

Deserts were amazing.. specially the "chocolate pastries".. those were soo sooo soooo yummmy.. sweets were also there to take your heart..
couldn't even tried all of them.. so waiting for the next time üòâüòâ  

Ice cream counter was also outstanding..it comes with lots and lots of toppings.

You can order for beverages too, we tried two type of smoothie which were  really outstanding..!!
It will be charged extra.. apart from the buffet price.
If you want mineral water it will be 150/- plus  for 1 lit..!

IT WAS A REALLY REALLY  LOVEABLE EXPERIENCE. 
J W MARRIOTT WILL DEFINITELY  MAKE YOU FEEL TO GO ONCE MORE..!!

JW Marriott is the recent buzz from all foodies around town due their great buffet with cheap pricing..
So I went their for Lunch around 2 pm two days back and found some issues with their menu, I dont know why they offer cheese, bread, fruits on lunch time, also they have 3 non veg Starters which was purely cold at the time of serving. Not expected at all from them. Chilli cauliflower had more salt and less taste. Chicken kebab was cold like chilled beer... Only one thing I found good is their desserts. They have array of desserts from Sandesh to cake and pie and muffins. 
Service was pretty good and fast. Also I liked they dont charged service charge compared to others big name. 
Ambiance was good and clean as expected.. 
I will rethink again for visiting this place in future.

Well... I had a lot of expectations from this place, I and my mother were supposed to have my birthday lunch there.. I tried to make reservations through zomato which was rejected.. then i called them up on which I was told that they are full till the 14th of March.. (rudely, I'd say) However I was so hooked on being there that I called them again at around 9pm on Wednesday (the day before we were supposed to go to lunch) and they said they can accommodate us.. I also mentioned that's its a birthday celebration.. next day we reached and were taken to our table.. Now.. the buffet had no soup.. no bengali food like they had mentioned in their displayed menu here.. the Indian dishes were very limited and the sandwiches were a joke.. the salads were nice but the mains were not up to the mark.. a lot of options for vegetarians but very limited choices for the meat lovers..I literally had to dig deep for the gosht in the nihari.. What they lacked in mains they made up for in desserts.. The dessert spread was rather refreshing.. specially the red velvet tiramisu.. But I was rather disheartened as there was no arrangements made for a birthday celebration unlike other restaurants who at least have the basic courtesy of arranging a complementary cake(specifically when I have mentioned that its my birthday).. Desserts are the only attraction..

Very much disappointed with the food spread at buffet. The price tag did look similar to other lower ranking competitors, but food taste was definitely inferior. That star type was lacking. Indian cuisine was pathetic and so was deserts. Definitely not the second time unless improved.

Had gone there on a Sunday with my family. I was trying to get reservations from the time Mariot opened it doors in Kolkata. We opted for buffet because I got tempted looking at the dessert spread. It was out of the world especially the waffles and those amazing toppings with it. The food was very average nothing great. Service was also okay. Mutton was undercooked but there was one chicken item called Kosha chicken that was just brilliant.

Lots of variety to choose from Indian foods to continental. Biryani, Naan, kebabs, pasta which u can make on your own choice, sandwiches and alot of stuffs. The best part was the dessert üòçüòç from cupcakes to ice creams pastries fudge. Perfect buffet

I have been here yesterday with my wife and kid. The hospitality was awesome. Now coming to food, the buffet is huuuuggggeeee. If you just go through the entire spread before starting your meal, you will get confused where to start. It had India, Chinese, Pasta, Chat, etc. etc. etc. The best part is the Dessert counter. You will get super confused once you are here. Thinking which one you should have. The only drawback which I felt was that in most of the main course and starters the salt is on the higher side. Altogether it was a good expereince.

What ever you want to have on your plate, you will get here. The buffet is just a perfect place for foodies like me. This place is a must visit, if you are in Kolkata. I went there with my family and friends. We couldn't finish our plates at the end because we were so full. The live counters are the special mention here. We just loved the pasta they made. The service was also great. And last but not the least the interior and ambience was mind blowing.

I am just not able to figure out from where to start. It's an owsum experience. Had in wish list from a long time. The main thing that attracts your attention when you get to know a 5 star hotel offering their buffet spread in 1000 bucks.

Location: just before the science stoppage called mathpukur on e m bypass.

Decoration: it's grand. The 5 star feeling. We went for lunch. Trust me it will look heavenly in the evening.
So, if you wanted to experience that just go for dinner buffet.

Food:

It's huge. I mean I couldn't remember the names even as the quantity is a huge in number.

They offered items for everyone. Veggies, non veggies, continental, pasta, salad, dessert all they offer.

The main highlight are:

1. Starters Indian type.
2. Live noodles counter
3. Live pasta counter
4. Continental dish
5. Sandwich, ham, salad section ( turkey ham is outstanding)
6. Chat counter.
7. Fresh fruits
8. Main courses ( biriyani, mutton, chicken tikka is owssum)

And yes yes yes the special mention is dessert section:

They have around 30 items. All are just superb and mind blowing.

And trust me no one can taste all those at one day.

It's an experience. The hospitality is superb. The quality is bang on.


Lunch buffet: 1080 INR
Dinner buffet: 1180 INR
Including taxes.

Do note this review doesn't give the exciting experience we had. So, do visit that.. to me one of the best buffet in town ( considering the amount they charge)

Go for it :)

Awesome place and ambiance is beyond any explanation..I went there yesterday and their services are really very nice. We have selected buffet for dinner. So starting from delicious salads there are so many variations on every item. Mouth watering kababs are one of the best dishes in buffet and also you can order customised pasta. Biriyani,mutton and chicken items will drive your mind in complete madness with food. But ultimately there so many options for deserts will force you to taste each and everything. Must go place and explore yourself..

It was my birthday and no better place for a foodgasam and that to a buffet.

Location:-Just beside spring club (bypass).

Ambience:-one won't get a better ambience than this.It will really really make you feel a 7* restaurant.

Food:- JW Kitchen has tons of variety in the food Department,name it and you find it there.The only thing that disappointed me was the taste,on every item found something or the other is missing.No complains with the number of items bt then they need to think about the taste as well.There are dishes that are too famous to go wrong on taste and that is what happend.
There were many a option when u think of Deserts.It wasn't that great but then i found it ok types.Even here taste have let me down.

Hospitality :- I went on 12th Feb at around 1:00PM and it was a sunday.The courtesy and hospitality that i have received was excellent.If on sunday i get this type of treatment then be rest assure they wont let you down on this department.

Had the tastes were better rating would have been grassy green.

JW Kitchen had been on my bucket list for quite a while now.It has been a great experience to finally try out this place.

Speaking of the ambience,first of all,words would be less to explain the elegant and magnificent atmosphere of this place.The place is enriched with glam and glitz which won our hearts ‚ù§.

Now coming to the food,there is a huge spread of food from different cuisines.We went on a lunch buffet which costs around Rs. 1100 per person inclusive of the taxes.

There was a wide variety of dishes to choose from.

‚ñ™Kebabs (chicken,fish,paneer and mushroom)

‚ñ™ Indian (White rice,Veg biriyani,Chicken biriyani,Dal makhani,chicken,mutton,fish,matar paneer)

‚ñ™ Thai

‚ñ™ Turkey,Ham,Salami,Beef

‚ñ™ Spaghetti,Pasta

The list goes on.And it is not possible to enlist the entire spread here.You will understand it better when you see it üòç.

Now,the desserts can itself be enough to fill in your stomach.Starting from a variety of indian sweets to muffins,cakes and other alluring and eye-catching desserts occupy two entire tables.You cannot finish tasting all of them in one visit,I must say !!

Judging by its taste,the food was not outstanding but good enough.If the quality would have been a bit better,JW Kitchen could have been then best buffet in town !!

The staff was quite courteous .

Had an amazing time ! ‚ò∫

I am completely floored by JW Kitchen ! Visited the place on my 2nd Marriage Anniversary in Feb 2017. It was a pre-booked lunch for two of us. When we reached JW Kitchen we were hungry and can't wait to kick start the lunch buffet. We started with soup and salad. Have never seen the kind of salad spread in any buffet in Kolkata before. Then we moved on to Main Course. In between the resto  attendant informed us regarding Live counter for pasta. We ordered for spaghetti with veggies. It was descent in taste. In the main course there were veg and non veg stuff. Not only that there were continental and surprisingly a separate spread for Gujarati cuisine like Dhokla Phaphra Thepla. Apart from that there were dry fruits spread, cheese spread of at least 3-4 types, ham, bacon, beef and separate cold chicken spread with at least 4-5 types of pickles and oils. The live counter was very prompt to serve the order at your table. The Biriyani and Lamb curry was out of the world in taste. So was the Thai fish, chicken preps and Tofu. The ambience and decor is the best in class. Since it is a pre-booked buffet hence there was no queue and crowd. The entire process was pretty hassle free as we booked a table via Zomato. The dessert spread was endless where it is difficult to taste all but painful to leave any one of them whether it is baked rasgulla or pudding or fudge or 3-4 different types of cakes and truffles. To end such a royal lunch perfectly there was a superb fruit spread with the chefs making a sumptuous fruit salad for you as per your choice of fruits. Overall it is a must go place for food lovers. It certainly added a good flavour to my D Day. And I would surely gonna come back to this place again and again. Thank You JWM Kitchen.

Have been there many times, but last time I went, almost all the vegetarian fried or gravy items were smelling of non-veg.
This is extremely non-acceptable from such a hotel. They should respect sentiments of Vegetarian diners. If they use  non veg gravy or oil, should not mark green on the labels.

Pure vegetarians, please be wary of the dinner layout

Service could be improved in terms of dining. Veg starters needs variety, it was dull. Main course was pretty good, especially noodles. Deserts also needs more variety in terms of eggless counter. It has nothing special for eggless people, just the normal deserts which you get in sweet shops. One time visit place. Just because of its low price point people are flocking here.

The dinner buffet at JW Kitchen is simply amazing....The foodies will be in there for a sumptuous treat and spoilt for choices. They have a massive spread of delicacies both veg and non veg. Live counters for chaat, pasta and Asian is incredible.  Was really impressed with the variety and quality of  food. Kudos to the team.

Desserts hold a special mention since in this section one is confused what to eat and what to leave behind. Close 15+ varieties of dishes covering Indian and international items. Tarts, crumble, panna cotta, baked flavoured yogurt, cupcakes, French entremets, sandesh, ice cream and so on.

Looking forward to visit them for their Sunday brunch
Cheers!!

JW Marriot's Kitchen is the one thing Kolkata foodies are talking about everyday. A breakfast, lunch or dinner buffet at this price at a 5 Star Hotel ¬†chain is something you don't get much often. ¬†Called for a booking on 14th of December and got the booking confirmed only for the 2nd of January. Thats how busy the place has been. So atleast a 15 day pre-booking is a must. Now coming to ambience - its outstanding. Its so spacious and grand. Food - where to start with? It was the same for me when I was there and its the same when I start writing about it. My pictures will speak a lot more this time. You need to be there with an appetite of two atleast if you have to taste everything. As it says "kuch toh chut jayega". The starters to main course itself has so many and so much to offer that you are bound to repent when you end up at the dessert section. It has a lot lot more to offer. It was a great evening at the Marriot.. A must visit for all. Thank you for such a great experience.

Jw.The name itself is enough to make you understand what you are going to be treated to.The desert section is definitely worth a mention.Ddnt delve much into the main course but felt the starters were a tad bit on the blunt size,probably cause of the wide age group they cater to.It did not take away the flavours by any means though.Ambience is what steals the show and make you forget everything,frankly.Definitely worth a visit :)

This place is currently the most talked place of the city. Firstly, it's J W Marriott. Secondly, they are serving an amazing buffet at some throw away prices. At the beginning of this review, I would like to mention the buffet prices for breakfast, lunch and dinner inclusive of taxes and then give a brief description of the food we had for lunch on 24th February, 2017. The prices are as follows -
Breakfast 783 INR
Lunch 1083 INR
Dinner 1203 INR
All of these prices are inclusive of taxes.
Ambience - In one word, it is fantastic. We went there for lunch. What I loved here most was the aesthetic use of natural light. Nothing can ever beat the beauty of natural light and this place has made brilliant use of it making the ambience perfect - lovely and romantic.
Service - The staffs were efficient, prompt and courteous. They gave us a detailed description of the menu available that day and helped us through out our dining courses by changing the plates and cutlery even before we asked to. Pretty much impressed by this.
Food - When I am thinking to start writing about this, I am getting confused every single time, where to start from and where end. Goodness! Such a humongous spread that was! So many starters, main course and desserts from various cuisines. Loved most of the items. The huge variety in the salad spread was very impressive; special mention must be made of the ham salad. There were so many cold cuts and cheese - brie, gouda, emmental, smoked cheese, goat cheese etc to accompany with the bread sticks and bread. I didn't like the breads much and think they could have kept crackers for the cheese tasting as well. The cheese types were extra ordinary and beyond this world. The cold cuts machine was a cool thing to see and making use of it was even more fun. There were so many local Indian snacks like the dhokla. khakra, thepla with required chutneys. It was one of the best dhokla I have ever tasted, so soft and juicy. Live chaat, pasta and waffle pancake counters were also there. The pasta wasn't upto the Marriott standards. There were kebabs, fish fries, aloo dum. khichdi, biryani, chicken and mutton Curries. The mutton curry was brilliant. J W Marriott didn't forget about the southern part of India. So, Idiappam and a few more South Indian delicacies were also present. That's all that I can recall from the appetizers and main course now. I am sure there must be at least 5-10 more items which were there in the spread but I have missed out. Now, coming to the dessert section, it was huge. About twenty types of dessert including Indian and Western kind. They looked pretty impressive, but honestly, except for a few, the rest didn't taste as good as they look. Moreover, there was a dessert called Blueberry Passion or something, which got over before the buffet got closed. But you should definitely try the Creme Brulee, Blueberry Cheesecake, Mango Blueberry Pastry, White Chocolate Prune cake, the cupcakes. I was so full by now that I didn't have space to try the Indian desserts. They looked delicious no doubt. Oh! And there were many fresh fruits as well - watermelon, pineapple, green apple, guava, plums, peaches, Californian grapes, sweet tamarind and dried fruits like prunes and apricots. The spread was very gigantic, boasted of immense variety and most of the items tasted excellent.
Value for Money - Hey! Don't even ask this question. You get such a beautiful vast spread in a property like Marriott at just 1000 bucks. The food is excellent and also the ambience. It not only satisfies the value but overshadows it. Just go for the buffet!
I had been there on a very special day of my life - on the day of completing four years with

JW Kitchen - Buffet in a Five Star Hotel.

Do I need to tell about Ambience !!!.

The Five Star Hotel gets 5/5. It is brilliant. Aesthetically pleasing, the shimmer and glitter all around. I was pretty much bowled by the all these. Being the first 5 - star experience , I think it was supposed to be.

Now coming to the central theme food.

Sultani Chicken was the best for me. Rest all were usual. We had Fish items as well but all were ok nothing special. I missed complimentary drink, would have been great to have and so would little more variety of Sweets in Desserts as it is kolkata - the land of Sweets. Prawn Delicacies were missing as compared to buffets at other leading outlets across city. Overall for Food, I would rate 3.5/5.

Staff were courteous.

Overall 4/5.

Been hearing about this place and it's rich variety of desserts and other delicacies. Couldn't stop myself from trying it out for myself until I visited it for Lunch yesterday. Firstly I liked the main course. But I think there should be more variety of starters. Being a sweets lover, the most important course of the meal for me is desserts. I was disheartened with the variety of desserts as there were hardly any desserts that I could try as most of them was eggfull (as I am pure vegetarian). Please try and include many more varieties of desserts which are eggless and can be eaten by vegetarians like us. It was a good experience all in all.

I became a member of jw marriot corporate program. Under the scheme i am entitled to a few discounts on buffet and on ala cart menu. However i called them to book a table and mentioned that i am a member and would like to available one of the offers. It was my wifes birthday and i wanted to treat her some place nice. It was the main reason for taking the member so that i could celebrate special occasions there. However they informed that the table needs to be booked atleast 10 days in advance which i found to be ridiculos policy as its impossible to decide where you will be dining after 10 days. And even after repeated request they didnt provide us a table and i was not left with many other options. 

I have heard a lot about the hospitality of jw marriot and it might be one of the best places to dine in kolkate right now. But i was utterly disappointed by such a behaviour. If you cant provide tables then you should not be selling such memberships to make money. I spend around 15k to become a member and now its seems as waste of money.

I would suggest everyone to not buy the corporate membership as it will be impossible to redeem the coupons you will receive and hence your money will be wasted.

Variery of Food whens comes with great taste in a 5 star Hotel..JW Kitchen is the perfect example. With variety of Cuisine from North Indian to chaat to Continental etc. 
Order your fav noodles,pasta or may b soup then it will be prepared in Live kitchen and will be served to you in your table...
Worth for money. And a special mention is required for their dessert section. You can grab many becoz of its taste & look.

So I visited JW Kitchen yesterday for the dinner and opted for buffet I was not happy with the services though the fnb team were trying their best but still they couldn't made it well . I had ordered for Indian breads to have my main course but it took 1 hours to get it. The buffet was good especially the Chinese and desserts. But you should keep some refreshments welcome drinks in the buffet .
I hope it will improve in future.

Words fail me as I sit down to begin this review. Such was the grandeur of this place, that it leaves no room of any second judgement. We were greeted gracefully by every staff member we encountered. The interior is absolutely marvelous with the high ceiling. The decor and all the gliteratti left us absolutely spellbound. The reception holds a comfortable oversized couch and a high-chair which is pretty impressive.

The dining area is huge and spacious. The buffet selection is very sumptous and delighting. We mainly enjoyed the Thai cuisines - a various assortments of vegetables, fish, chicken, prawns and mushrooms. I particularly enjoyed the sauted eggplants, the roasted paneer, the chicken kababs and the fish fries. The continental section was awesome as well. There was turkey ham and salami and sandwiches which were really worth trying. The main course section was pretty decent as well, mainly based on the Indian cuisine, ranging from biriyani to mutton gravy. The sweet dish section was overlaid with pies, tarts, cakes, pastries, an assortment of jellies, indian sweets and fruits which was a winner as well. 

A must try in my opinion.

JW kitchen is located in the ground floor of the hotel on the left hand side of the entrance. The hall is big with options of two seats, four seaters and upto 10 seaters (couch). They have an outdoor seating arrangement too. To start with the starters, there are enough options to pick and choose both for veg as well as non veg. Lamb with smashed potato is the best. Live counters are there where u can order and they will  serve on the table (just inform table no). Coming to salads the options are huge, couldnt try all. They have a separate chat counter (live counter). Fruit counter is also there. Main course was normal with good amount of options for veg as well as non veg items. We were almost full when we completed main course. Now came the desserts. We were in awe when we saw two tables full of different desserts. I tried to taste as many as I could but iwas pretty stuffed by then. One suggestion if u want to try all the desserts, go easy on starters and main course. It is a complete value for money and service is pretty impressive. Staff are extremely courteous and attentive. Do book your table few days beforehand through zomato or you can call them. On a weekday afternoon we saw the dining hall jam packed with people. 3 PM is the time when they remove the food from the display table. Overall I would say it was a 5 star experience befitting the JWM brand. Dress code is casual. Bring your loved ones for an amazing experience.

Eating in a 5star hotel is itself a pleasure.and when you have a variety of dishes to offer, it makes it even better. There were infinite dishes available in the buffet section and Im sure no one can even taste all of them. The introductory price of the buffet is so cheap that majority of the people can try their buffet once. I bet it is worth the money spent. Very sumptuous items, royal decor and a never ending collection of food is bound to make your dining experience a wonderful one..

This beats the other buffets in terms of variety.
A worth for money buffet.
The highs were the amritsari fish, marinated chicken salad, prawn cocktails and Lal Mans.
A special mention for the stir fried wheat noodles they were outstanding.

The chicken Kali mirch kebab and the grilled fish was disappointing.
 There were a few standout deserts, a combination of coffee and hazelnut and a melon combination.

This was my first time visit to JW Mariott as a whole. Went there last last Thursday to try out the lunch buffet of JW Kitchen with a friend of mine around to 2pm. It was already quite filled up but there was no delay in finding a table for us even though there were no reservation done from our part.

The restaurant occupies a vast stretch of the left hand side (from the Entrance) of the Hotel.

Spacious Simplistic yet Elegant Decor. But the first thing that would attract your attention is the spread of food starting from Bengali, North Indian, Gujrati, Continental, Oriental, Italian so on so forth.

You have choose / ask the stuffs as to what all are in offer as for sure you cannot try all. They also have live counters for Noodles / Pastas, Chats, Soups and Ice Creams.

Starting from Bhetki, Biriyani, Turkey Salami, Roasted Chicken, Chicken Tandoors / Kebabs, Pork, everything is in offer. They also have a fruit counter and salad counter separately.

Now the desert section would need a special mention as there were more than 25-30 items just in dessert consisting of Cakes, Brulee, Apple and Peach Tart, Muffins, Kaju Barfi, Jalebi, Sandesh, Custard, Pudding, Sweet Card, Gulab Jamun, Malai Chamcham and what not.

Just to summarise this is what I would call a 5 Star (Zomato) Restaurant Experience.

I visited the place for a lunch with my friends.   There were a wide variety of dishes and desserts available but not one single dish was even close to perfect. Also, I expected a lamb dish according to the menu but only to discover that the lamb mentioned in the menu is what we normally call as mutton. Overall, you can always go here if you want some quality dining but there are loads of other options available at this price. The staff were nice and helpful though .

It wasn't a very difficult decision to pick JW Kitchen for a sudden breakfast day out, with a very close friend of mine on a pleasant friday morning. We were greeted very warm-heartedly at our early arrival and the multifarious cuisines and overall ambiance at our first glance seemed very promising, which turned out to be far more pleasing and worthwhile with the passage of time. On encountering such a galore of desserts, we had to surrender to our choices that were prior to the rest of the items since we uniquely crave desserts and our love for afters comes second to none. The experience was quite exquisite with excellent hospitality throughout. Also, the personnel and all the in house staff members were well mannered, obliging and watchful at all times, as a consequence of which we were never short of anything, which we very singularly respect and appreciate. We spent a lot of time at the Kitchen after which we visited the area by the pool, offering us a magnificent view of our city of joy. Winding up my extraordinary experience, I would like to say that it was a pleasure to be a guest of JW Marriott, and I look forward to my upcoming visit before long.Wishing team JW Marriott all the success.

The newest 5 Star Hotel in Kolkata, JW Marriot is a spectacle to behold. As we entered the lobby which is magnificently designed, to the left is the JW Kitchen. The restaurant caught our attention due to the Buffet on offer at such a reasonable price and left us intrigued.
We booked our place through Zomato and the process was a breeze.

The decor of the place is elegant and gorgeous which is expected of the hotel of such a repute. We went for dinner buffet and the lighting of the place was done in a nice subtle way adding to a great ambience.

On to food, they have a large grand spread for buffet. The salad counter was so huge that we could only taste some the selections. There is a Chat and a Italian Live counter. The continental dishes were delicious. The stir fry noodles counter was also pretty good and tasted awesome.
The starters and the main course were ok and nothing great to talk about.

However what completely blew our mind was the dessert section. It has a plethora of options of around 40 types. It was literally a difficult job for us to taste all of them. Each one of them was awesome and we had a blast of flavors in our palate.

The service was pretty good too and they showed us around the buffet at the start.

JW Kitchen - JW Marriot is a premium upscale place and is classy and elite. It is a grandeur experience for all the foodies out there. I would love to be back again soon here :)

It was unjust on my part to not visit this place earlier but better late than never as they say. You enter Marriott and just to your left is the huge JW Kitchen with extremely subtle yet magnificent decor. We had booked a table for two before hand so it wasn't much of a fuss there. The seating arrangements are done very stratigically so that too many people don't bump into each other while walking around the buffet counters. There are 7-8 buffet spreads which also includes the live counters. There's a section of Indian cuisine, Chinese, Chaats, Italian, Contiental, A section of breads, salads including different dips and sauce, cheese and a colourful spread of desserts. I was a tad bit disappointed with the Chinese live counter as it took more than 20 minutes to serve our noodles and squids. There's a beautiful open area right outside the JW Kitchen for the purpose of smoking. There is one attendent alotted for each table who's supposed to take care of their guests/customers. Subhodeep was looking after us and he was extremely efficient at his work. Foodies of Kolkata, it's a must for you to try JW Kitchen even if it pinches your pocket. You won't be disappointed.

Dining at JW Kitchen was also my first visit to a JW Marriott. The hotel has intrigued anyone and everyone in Kolkata ever since it opened up. 

The buffet at the JW Kitchen is priced nominally(Rs1203 all inclusive per person) compared to what it offers. I will classify each aspect of the dinner.

The Decor:
Fabulous. Simplistic. Classy and Warm. 

Scope of Improvement? Yes. Table number 44( where I was seated ) was crooked; it shook every time I put pressure on one side of the table.

A little attention to such details is expected from a restaurant at such a fine chain of hotels.


Food:
There's so much to talk about here.
JW Kitchen offers a plethora of options to those who dine. The dishes range from North Indian to freshly prepared noodles at the live stations to European dishes. 

Even the Biryani was so much more aromatic and full of flavours than any biryani I have had before. 

The desserts truly deserve a separate section for themselves. They included everything from kaju barfis to jalebis to muffins, tarts and what not! And yes, ice creams too.

Service:
Very prompt and impressive. This is what will give you the feel of a premium hotel. 

All in all, for the price you will pay, the JW Kitchen is nothing but a paradise for food lovers and explorers.

The most talked about 5 star hotel JW Marriott has caught attention of many from city of joy having said that I was one of them from the bandwagon as well and so one fine day I decide to go for a lunch brunch with my friend at JW kitchen seeing the constant post in various social media platform of buffet offered by a 5star well reputed brand JW kitchen (JW Marriott hotel) at a price which is affordable once in a blue moon . We happen to book our table four days back from the final day of our arrival , we were allotted at 12:30 lunch brunch . And so did we arrive , and once we arrived we were taken aback by their heart warming hospitality. I was very pleased with the fancy decor and their warm greetings and service which they take very seriously. It was also my very first visit to JW Marriott.

Coming to the food the buffet was a lavish spread .
STARTERS - in straters there wasn't vast options as BBQ nation but enough to fill up your appetite , the mutton kebab was pretty soft and so well cooked it was lip smacking. MAIN COURSE- they have a lot of options be it in Indian cuisine or Italian cuisine.
DESSERT - there were 20 + dessert and each dessert was a step closer to heaven's door . They were well presented few were very lame but most of them were worth it , it was absolutely every bit of heaven on my platter .

They don't include any complementary drinks along with the buffet which is surprising as they have a whole counter for chaats ( Street food ) but not providing complementary drinks was bit off color .
Beside street foods are meant to be eaten from Streets .

P.S. it's a must must and must visit at least one should visit once in their lifetime . And no it's not pocket friendly, of course it is expensive its JW Marriott but then again INR1100 buffet at a 5star restaurant like JW Marriott I wouldn't miss that bliss.

Had gone for dinner buffet. The spread was huge. But it seems like quantity was given preference over quality. Ppl will be spoilt for options- pasta, khakra, noodles, spring roll, chaats but the taste was pretty bland. Same for desserts-huge spread, everything looked pretty but not that good taste wise. Although I loved the waffles, chocolate mousse and mango pudding. Majority of it contained egg so limited options for vegetarians. Go to JW just for the ambience and with low expectations with regards to food quality.

A lunch or a dinner at JW Kitchen needs a prior table booking (or does it really?) at least 2 weeks before the date. They try to create a pseudo arstrocracy which definitely gets shattered by the very much mixed class of crowd. However, if you provide such an extravagant spread of buffet in a chestful ambience at such a cheap price you shouldn't expect an elite crowd.
Coming to service it was fairly satisfactory. People out there were not too intuitive, yet took care of all our needs.
Variety of food was extraordinary. From thai to greek, from Indian to italian, fresh fruits, chats, cheeses, baked items atleast win you eye, if not your taste. Live counters, elaborated oriental main course wil soon fill your stomach. But wait, if you are done with, you will miss the most delightful section...yes, desserts.
That section lifts your dampen mood like no other. Perfect eye candy deserts tastes good too. However most of them are whipped cream based and are too filling. A nougout type desert with curd topping was the besttttttt sweet dish I ever had in my life.
Visit once. It will be a good experience. Visit twice, it loses it charm with the almst same manu.

Visited this place within a week of it opening. Was pleasantly surprised by the wide range of food they offered in the buffet. The highlight of the meal was the appetisers and the desserts and not the main course. Was a bit disappointed by the main course food quality which wasn't definitely upto the mark. However had a nice experience overall. The mango chocolate dessert is something I keep craving and would definitely go back for!

JW Kitchen gives you the full five star experience from the word go with its urban chic architecture, spacious layout, plenty of natural light and a mind blowing spread in the buffet.¬†¬†
There is hardly any room for complain when at the price of 899+taxes, the lunch buffet offers you a plethora of exotic salads, a full cheese board, plenty of cold cuts and an array of other entrees and desserts. The Gujarati section is pretty unique as well because that is not something you get in your everyday spread. Couple that with a live pasta counter, plenty of cheese, a full Lebanese counter and the Indian and continental usual stuff cooked to perfection : we probably get the best buffet in town.¬†
Despite a packed house, the staff paid individual attention to all of their patrons. ¬†

There, however, are a couple of minor grievances I hold, which is why I deducted 0.5 from the rating for a place which I'd have otherwise given a perfect 5.¬†¬†
1. On reservation of a table for 4, we were allotted a time of 2 : 30 pm. Now the lunch buffet closes at 3 and we were under the impression that 3 is the time after which they stop entertaining new guests. But apparently 3 is the time when the remove the spread itself. Hence it was, what can be best described as a desperate scrambling on our parts, to bring everything from the overtly lavish buffet spread back to our tables. That is something that should have been conveyed before hand.¬†¬†
2. After the buffet, we ordered the Berry Classico, a dish that had caught my eye after seeing the pictures by some of the reviewers here in Zomato. While the dessert was once again pretty terrific, it lacked the blueberries , raspberries and a few other ingredients that I had seen in the aforementioned pictures. That was a bit of a disappointment. One expects consistency in terms of preparation from places such as these.¬†
¬†
These minor kinks aside, the lunch at JW Kitchen was a great experience. I, on my part, am really looking forward to visiting Kolkata's first truly international buffet very soon..

This place was in my wishlist for long and visited here finally, It is one of the magnificent buffets in the city. The place is one of the best interiors in Kolkata. The dining area is equally stunning with comfortable seating arrangement. When you enter JW kitchen you will be mesmerized by the seeing the platters they had to offer.

They have entire cuisine to offer from Indian to Mexican to Chinese. One can start from the Indian starters like Chicken tikka, paneer malai kebab, veg spring roll or oriental starters like prawn / chicken / fish satay, live noodles counter, live pasta counter. We dint tried much in main course but this also have a lot of varieties like Gosht biryani, mutton rogan josh, chili chicken in oyster sauce. All the food items i was thrilled to see so many varieties of salads. One have to wait for some time to get food from live counters. Besides from starters to main course all the food items tasted nice but nothing extra ordinary. But the best part of this buffet is its desert section they are the real game changer, live waffles and pancakes counter, various kind of Indian sweets, puddings, candy s, various flavor of ice creams and various types of cakes and cupcakes. They also had a fruit counter for all kinds of healthy fruits.

All the staffs were really hospitable and welcoming. We were a group of 11 people and we all had great time. Its not possible to test all items in one visit ;) definitely visiting again.

After trying for months we could finally step into JWK on a Saturday evening. It was becoming jinxed with multiple attempts to get a reservation, ultimately booked through Zomato (that too we could avail on the second attempt).. was the wait worthwhile? 

The first thing which strikes you is the super-impressive buffet spread on offer, which actually befits the grand imposing gorgeousness of JWM. Endless varieties consisting of Indian, oriental, Italian, continental, Bengali and Gujrati delectable spread ‚Ä¶.jostling for your attention‚Ä¶ it is a happy sight, makes you feel good‚Ä¶ festival of colors, flavors, senses‚Ä¶. 

Once you overcome your initial euphoria, you can ask for a brief about the varieties on offer, that actually would help you in choosing your courses ‚Ä¶.

One can start from the Indian starters comprising Chicken tikka, paneer tikka, fish amritsari, veg spring roll, or oriental starters like prawn / chicken / fish satay, dumplings..live noodles counter, live pasta counter‚Ä¶

Or you can be health conscious and go straight to the salad counter‚Ä¶the best in my opinion‚Ä¶cold cuts, exotic fresh veggies, greens, dips, babaganoush, olives, saut√©ed veggies, fresh prawns‚Ä¶. Or what about going chatpata and go for the Chat counter or Gujarati counter?

Mains consisited of Gosht biryani, meen moilee, paneer and other veg dishes, special mention to lau-bori‚Ä¶ and some thai dishes 

Real feast for the eye and senses‚Ä¶. Now it is not possible for anyone to sample each and every bit from the spread, so being a quintessential Bengali, I opted for all the fish and seafood dishes on offer. AND I was disappointed!!

Fish amritsari as a starter was too dry, probably it was prepared long ago‚Ä¶fresh ones were not available during our stay of more than an hour. Meen moilee suffered the same fate, though the curry was flavorful, fish pieces were rubbery..Prawn and fish stay was way too ordinary‚Ä¶elevated only because of the accompanying peanut sauce

Only saving grace ‚Ä¶the fresh prawns adorning the salad counter, which I did savour along with other accompaniments as per MY WAY‚Ä¶

Went for the much approved dessert counter, I loved the fruit custard and creme brulee ‚Ä¶.rest were too sinful and decadent for me‚Ä¶.I decided to have a aloo tikia-ghugni chaat as a plate cleanser‚Ä¶worked well

So the verdict is mixed! Maybe I should have tried some other options‚Ä¶so I will give a benefit of doubt and try once more, ‚Ä¶ probably I will start from the chaat counter this time‚Ä¶

This is my second visit to JW Marriot in the last 3 months. I was impressed when I went there in Dec. The dinner buffet was 1204 pp all inclusive and I was wowed. However upon my visit on 11-Feb I could make out that the quality of food had dipped markedly. The major problem was that the cold cut prawns weren't deveined and we informed the chef of the potential health hazards. He acknowledged it and replaced the entire buffet tray. The fish tikka was smelly too, and this is quite unacceptable. The ambience and spread is good, and the deserts kind of make up for the lapses, but JW needs to maintain a basic quality, else increase the prices if they aren't able to sustain the quality with this price.

Managed a table after booking from Zomato or else its almost rare to get a table at the eleventh hour. Must say, i'm in love with this fine-dine resturant. It truly lives upto its standards. Baffled by the array of items they present. Service is amazing , we were hosted by Subhranil , whose behaviour was top notch, he guided us throughout. Coming to the food , its the best it can be. The varities of salads to salamis , appetizers to maincourses , one can find everything ( chinese , north indian , continental). Make sure you eat everything in small proportions to get a taste of them all , and not get bowled out by the starters itself. There's also live counters which serve you with freshly cooked seafoods , everything is so perfect which comes with a pricetag of ‚Çπ1200/- inclusive of taxes. Desserts section is my personal favourite and you are sure to leave this place with a smile of satisfaction. 5-star rating straightaway.

It's a food lover's paradise. All the starters & main foods were good. But the service of satays needs improvement. But the show stopper & main attraction was the dessert section. Mouth watering delicacies. I just loved all their desserts which were very nicely presented as well. Looking forward to another visit soon...All in all, a great experience.

Most delightful culinary experience I have ever had. 
Despite having a wide array of options for snacks, entree, mains, sides and desserts, and that too of several cuisines, it doesn't fail to be exquisite in presentation and taste. I cannot literally name the dishes served, because they are so many, but believe me when I say that they cover everything. 
The charges, to my utmost surprise are far below the general Marriott prices, at 999+taxes for the buffet spread. I recommend this place to everybody, and go myself at every opportunity I get. 
Please do visit and pleasure yourselves. This is a surreal experience for all gluttons.

And how many days before do we need to book the table..

Most affordable buffet in 5 star hotel chains. When the name Marriott come in you anticipate the standard. The food quality and variety did live up to or probably exceeded the expectation. Live counters, make your own salad and variety of deserts are surely gonna distract you from the regular main course, though no complimentary drinks included in the buffet. A little more attention from the staff would be wonderful. The affordable rate and quality encourages a definite comeback.

Finally it was J W Kitchen the most talked about restaurant in the city. I was awestruck with the  decoration, comfortable ambience and lots and lots of food to dig in. Honestly i didn't found the dishes to be extraordinary, i mean the taste was so so. Starters & main courses were okay not so much good. More vegetarian dishes then non veg dishes. But the eye catching part was dessert. They were yummy & had variety.

Dined here today on birthday purpose which went into disappointment!!
Wide range of foods from main course to desserts but foods tested average whereas desserts tested heavenly!üòã
Service??!!! Worst service ever where you're paying good you deserve good overall but it couldn't stand least either!! Staffs aren't attentive, unheeding, careless and so on!!üò£ You need walk on and call them every time you need their service be it water refilling, foods, clearance, bill and so on again. They served us birthday cake but didn't bother to give the candle even on asking twice!! They do busy always within themselves and specially with large group of people! This was worse experience and a bad pay off indeed!
No such recommendation!
Service : 1/5
Foods : 4/5
Ambience : 5/5
Our bill was of ‚Çπ2347.35!
They add Srv Tax 5.6% , Vat 14.5%, KK C 0.2%, SBC 0.2% this how bill becomes exorbitant!! üò•
Hope you find it helpful! Thanks üòÄ

I was planning to pay the visit for sometime, however today only I am able to make it. Interior is impressive as expected from a big brand like Marriott. They have entire spread of cuisines like Mediterranean, Caucasian, Indian, Chinese etc. however I like the dessert counter the most. It is heavenly.

Want the Marriott experience... it's not the right place. Went for a buffet almost 1100 per head including taxes. Embrace and decoration are good. But food ..... Not at all up to the mark. It's Ok, or average. 

Staff - Not trained, mostly trainees, always pretend to be busy. Clueless. Even you have to remind to refill water.


Want to show others -"Having Lunch at JW Marriott " - Go there 

Want good food and nice service.  - Please Avoid.
Because you are actually paying Rs 500 for food and 600 just for the name "Marriott".

We wanted to try out JW Kitchen since long and then finally made it on last Thursday for lunch.  The menu was too heavy on Indian food and not really portrayed world kitchen like most 5 stars would do. The items on the menu were very basic that we eat on a day to day basis anyways. We need not go to a 5 star restaurant for that. I couldn't find a single exotic item. The quality of the food was just ok but not extraordinary. The waiting staff seemed very unmindful. I had to ask for espresso twice and they kept getting me black coffee. Also after asking for the bill 4 times it came finally. The dessert section was the only thing that I liked. Another thing that was missing which most 5 stars offer was the kids corner. Normally for buffets they keep an area for the kids with some entertainment for them but this one didn't have any. Also there were no mocktails or specialty drinks being offered in the buffet. Over all the JW Mariott in Kolkata disappointed us big time as opposed to the restaurants of the same group in Bangalore and Delhi.

Visited this place for a Monday lunch. The place is done beautifully with natural lighting from the glass building.
I made a reservation via zomato and it was a quick and easy process. We were guided to our designated table when we reached but I did not like the seating arrangement of our table. The distance between the table and the sofa was wide, one cannot pull the table closer to you because the sofas were closed sofas ( meaning with hand rest on each side). If you pull them closer, you cannot get up and exit from there. Since it was a buffet, one has to get up frequently which made us extremely uncomfortable.

Coming to the food, they had Indian, thai as the main cuisine. They also had some continental and Mediterranean dishes. They had a pastas, chaats and a satay live counter as well. All the food was decent, nothing stood out for me. But I loved the salad spread which I think was the best part of the buffet. They also had a huge variety of desserts and they were really good.

I think they need to improve on the service front. It was difficult to get the servers attention and had to keep requesting them to refill our glasses of water.

Given the price, its a good deal. It is a one time visit experience for me. The ambience and the decor makes it worth going once.

The live counters are wonderful with variety of kebabs and also the continental and Mediterranean dishes are worth it.
I loved the dessert section. And I feel almost every dessert was present.. Must visit again.

Enterted the place with great enthusiasm but left it with a bad rather worse experience. We visited it on 1st February 2017 which happened to be Saraswati Puja day. The restaurant was already packed up by then after waiting for 1.5hours we finally got a table.
After coming back to the table we get to hear at 3pm the buffet will be closed. I didn't have problem with it's closing time but the problem was the manager should have informed us about the timings and also why did he let us enter at 2.50pm in the first place.
After having a word with manager he extended it for another 10mins. But it was too less of a time to experience such a wide spread buffet and when half of the items were being removed from the tables. We ate the leftovers precisely. Eg: biriyani pasta ice cream waffles brownies pasta salads and lot more dishes were removed. Service wasn't prompt at all. We weren't served with water which happens to be a basic etiquette, after asking for it thrice the glasses were filled. I found none of the staffs were helpful apart from the manager. He was generous enough to help and even apologised but his staffs were too reluctant to listen to him despite his warnings of not removing items from the tables.
Talking about the food it wasn't something very special or delicious. It was something very normal.
Was very disappointed. The only good part was the ambience of the place.

This place had been on my wishlist for a very long time! I had huge expectations from this place and it did not dissapoint me one bit! The number of items is so high that trying out 50% of the items would be considered to be a great achievement. Starting from gujrati to north indian to continental to chinese to mughlai, you would find everthing in its buffet. The deserts are to die for . As far as the ambience is concerned , its one of the best in town. A small tip : reservation is a must especially if you are going with your family!

Finally JW Mariott opens its door to the city of joy. I have visited their hotel in Bangalore and finally visited the one in Kolkata on a friend's birthday. The spread was lavish with a superior interior decor. It has a wide range of starters and live counters for the skewers and kebabs. It brings together food from different corner of the world and for a foodie like me its like hitting the jackpot. The main course had an amazing mutton kosha which tasted just like they serve in bong weddings. Been a while i tasted those and hence the mention. As you finish off your appetizers and main course you walk to their world of desserts which are loaded with cupcakes, truffles and waffles. Altogether it was a great dining experience and i will highly recommend to everyone who are fond of buffets.

This place was in my wishlisht for long and visited here finally on Saraswati pujo.
We had the lunch buffet.
It is one of the magnificent buffets in the city.
The starters had a wide spread of kebabs,pasta,salads,salami,skewers,roast,satay,soup,momo etc.
The main course is super amazing comprising of huge variety of veg and non veg food.
We had steamed rice,dal makhani,tarka,fishi in ginger wine sauce,mutton,chicken,murgi biryani,Salmon fish in coconut,papads and vegetables.
The main course is great especially the biryani,fish and mutton.
The best part was certainly the desserts.
From rosmalai to pudding,from brownies to tarts it had every desserts to allure the taste buds.
The place is very pretty.
Since there is a huge rush here most of the times,its wise for walk in guests to do pre bookings here.
Staffs are friendly and service is prompt.
Had a great time here. üòç

899 + Tax and it's J W Marriott's buffet restaurant called J W Kitchen. It adds up to 2166 bucks for two inclusive all. If you haven't yet tried this place. Please go and have the buffet if you are a foodie as I am. 

Plus points are:
1.The variety of foods and some of those are exclusively made here.¬† 
2. Interior, ambience and the polite behavior of the staffs.
3. Good taste and quality of the food. 
4. The dessert section was superbly decorated. Some of the desserts were very tasty and exclusive.

Minus points are:
1. For some of the dishes, name card was missing.
2. At some of the live counters, no one will tell you the options and you have to think and guess.
3. We ordered kebabs from the live counter twice and we were not served. This is truly unfortunate.

Some of the must try dishes:
Opera cake, Waffles with toppings, seafood soup, panna cotta, glass noodle salad, chocolate Eclairs, mutton.

Today on the eve of Saraswati Puja we went to this place. ¬†Just to avoid any issue, I reserved a table for two before 4 days over the phone. I got their number from here Zomato. ¬†Reached there on time and found our table as ready. Though I found the restaurant inside bit of high in temperature, don't know whether their A.C were on but otherwise services were satisfactory, all the service persons were always there to help everyone. Coming to the foods - array of options but if you are a north Indian food lover then you might find less choices as per your favourite taste, as most of the items were continental, and bit of Gujrati. But whatever they're offering those're certainly good enough to give it a try. But I would definitely mention the pocket friendly bill that we got - including taxes per person needs to pay around rs 1080 /- and then you're getting array of foods, good service and a 5 star tag. ¬†So it was a Happy & Nice 2 hour stay we had there today. :-)

On checking out various reviews on the site and Facebook,  was over excited to dine at JW Kitchen on the day of my wife's birthday on 28th January 2017 for dinner and had informed them about the occasion. We were allotted table no 23, which apparently was wobbly. Yes, the spread is huge but does not make your palette go crazy. It's average. What stood out was the tomato seafood soup which really did create the wow feeling.  The cheese section, nihari gosht and prawns on the grill was good amongst the lot. I was eagerly waiting for the dessert moment but can't say it that the taste buds exploded. Variety Yes but not exceptional. The service staff had to be reminded to fill up water on regular intervals. No one bothered to send the cake on the table for celebration, had to remind the server at end of the meal and get it packed. Overall a very well done up outlet and hotel but has a long way to create memories in the stomach.

Today was our second visit to this place , the first being on their inauguration day . The place boast of one of the best , if not the best , interiors in Kolkata . The dining area is equally stunning with comfortable seating arrangement & beautiful natural lighting . The buffet is spread over a considerable area which reduces chance of overcrowding even when they are working at full capacity. The staffs are well behaved & courteous as is expected from a brand like Marriott . We had made reservation over phone & the place was nearly full .
Coming to the buffet spread , one is spoilt for choices with salads & desserts being the jewel in the crown . The pickle section deserves praise . The three live counters of Indian , continental & desserts were functioning efficiently & with a smile on their faces . I am a bit disheartened with the prawn starter which should have been better . The biryani was perfectly made & so was Lassoni Murg . With ham , salami etc one simply can not try all the offerings .
At Rs 2166 /- for two this buffet is simply value for money . Will definitely come back again .

Went on a weekend dinner.  When you enter JW kitchen you will be mesmerized by the seeing the platters they had to offer. JW being a big brand itself so can question its interiors. The interior is grandeur with well placed tables. Now coming to food you are spoilt of choices. They have entire cuisine to offer ftom Indian to Mexican to Chinese, you name it. Of all the food items i was thrilled to see so many varities of salads. Besides from starters to main course all the food items tasted nice but nothing extra ordinary. But the real game changer was the dessert counter. For the sweet tooth person like me it was the perfect place to dive in. It has got more than twenty varieties of dessert. All the staffs were really hospitable and welcoming. We were a group of six people and we all had great time.

Best ambience ever had in a restaurant... This sums up our experience of lunch in JW Kitchen. They live up to their brand from entering the hotel to service in the restaurant. Obviously we were awestruck with the grandeur. Coming to service, Krishanu really left a very good impression. In food, variety was the key. Though all the dishes did not have the same quality, I think some of them were really superb. Special mention for the variety of desserts. Overall, a great experience.

To be true, as a global brand Marriot should maintain its distinctiveness in food offerings in the starters and main course. The grandeur was there. We took a corner table and it was really nice ambience. Quiet and exquisite. To go with food, There were multiple offerings but nothing that sort of to mention. I liked potato balls more than the fish and chicken starters. The option to have live counter and chats is different but the taste of dhokla, patra, khammam, pasta were not actual. Fresh fruits were in offering along with continental dishes. BUT I was amazed at their sweet offerings. I could not taste allllll. I tried to adjust my plate with most. Will visit again for sure.

Mariott the name says it all. Right from entering you will have butterflies in your stomach experiencing the hospitality and warm behaviour of the staffs. In one word it's huge. The buffet spread and as well as the the sitting arrangements is beautiful and spacious. The ambience in one word is magical with the natural light entering the area. 
Now comes the food -The buffet spread is HUGE. You can eat anything you desire for and any cuisine. 
Cuisine wise from Chinese to Continental to Indian( Gujarati even) to Mexican and Mediterranean it's all the shots in one goThe staffs amiably served anything you wanted...like the live counters were served on our table. The various chats like samosa chat, paprichat and even the pasta were served Sooo. There were various salads, other tasty veg dishes and wholesome various cheese..and what not else. 
The dessert spread was the main attraction with its huge spread and almost having 40 variants.I loved it the most. 
Overall it was a very good experience with loads and loads of tasty food :*

This 5* Hotel is what truly defines luxurious hotel with good food quality.

Most people prefer the buffet at JW Kitchen, so did we . The spread of dished totally pleasantly surprised me . Generally there are not many Veg food option in 5* hotel buffets . But not here . Everything from the Soup , salads , starters , Cheese , Farsan , Live counter , Main coarse was there.¬† 

There were 2 types of Veg soups ,8-10 types¬† of salads and the list does on and on . After Having the salad and the starter we headed for the Live counter . There are many options of pasta and
rice that the chef cooks up as per your liking.¬† We really enjoyed the pasta and flat noodles that were served to us .
Now to the main coarse , there are 3-4 veg dishes , veg biryani and pulao also . The Indian breads are served directly at the table .¬† 
Finally for a sweet , we headed to the dessert counter . Here also the options are unlimited . 
I opted for the waffles , they were just awesome . Some other pastries and Bengali sweet dishes were also yummilicious . 

I am sure no one can try out all the dishes in one go . The introductory price is also very reasonable . You wont get 5* food at this price and with this quality anywhere else. 

I just loved the place and would be visiting again really soon .

I had gone there with high expectations after reading the reviews on zomato. Booked a table for 13 people before 2 weeks. The decor and the ambience of the place is beautiful. But the location of the restaurant just beside the reception was weird. The layout of the food was looking very beautiful. The garnishing and presentation was fantabulous. When we started eating, we realised the food was pathetic. I have never eaten such bad food. The stuffing of the spring rolls were tasteless, the momo was not eatable. I have never eaten such bad momos is my life! The chicken kebab was very mediocre, nothing outstanding. The prawns on the salad counted and also the satays was stale and had a foul smell. The satays were burnt. I had no idea why the food tasted so bad. I have eaten at so many places but never have been this disappointed. The only thing good was the dessert section. But the main course was so bad that i did not have the heart to enjoy my dessert. I am never ever going back again. I had to come back home and eat again to fill me up!

I had visited this place yesterday on the occasion of my parents 26th Anniversary and I must say that celebrating my parents anniversary there had been an excellent choice. The hotel screams of luxury and the interiors are just mesmerising! I loved the entire salad section. Usually just a fan of Caesar salad but this time tried various others. The management staff was very cordial and we had no such problems that could have let my expectation down in any way possible.I am absolutely in love with their desserts and that is one thing that'll drag me back to this place real soon! 

All in all I had a great time with my family. Thank you JW Marriot for making 21st janaury a very lovable and memorable one for my parents and me! Here's hoping that you keep making people fall in love with what you've got to offer! All the best!

Finally JW kitchen!
I don't know where to start and where to end!
First let me talk about the ambience- it is just mind blowing! The huge space with loads of natural light coming in and beautiful seating arrangements and finally the buffet, that is spread across a huge area and you'll be spoilt for choice.
The food: Each and every dish is blissfully tasty. The starters are simply heavenly. And the salads, dahi vada, papri chat, fresh fruits, nuts, breads, dhokla and pasta are all in top notch!
In the main course I found the posto chicken very yummy
I was already full so couldn't try the asian cuisine.
And finally the dessert section. Here also I'll say all of them had a unique beautiful taste of their own. I tried to eat as much as possible! The ice creams are delicious too!
Hospitality: The staffs are extremely courteous and helpful.
So all in all, my dear foodies, do visit this place and it won't burn a big hole in pocket too which is so amazing!üòÄ
---------------------------
We had opted for the breakfast on our third visit to the Marriot. And whoa! A complete 10 on 10. Buffet includes parathas, pooris, dosas, fresh fruits and fruit juices, muesli, milk, cornflakes, buns,eggs and many more. I've attached pictures to go with. Do have a look and yes do give it a try.

I had gone there with high expectations and was very disappointed. Food was not at all up to the mark. The prawn and fish satays they served had a foul smell and appeared to be stale. The first batch of prawn satays were served raw. Several dishes in the main course were undercooked, oversalted and so on. Nothing worth eating. Only the salads, sauces, dips, fruits, cold cuts, cheeses and breads were worth eating. The dessert section was still better though I was not fully satisfied with it either. They were taking up a long time to clean up the used plates and it was causing a lot of difficulties for us. They had served a complimentary anniversary cake for my parents and that gesture plus the ambience only prompted me to give 2 stars. Otherwise my experience was not nice at all.

P.S. You don't really expect houseflies swirling around in such luxury hotels but Marriott gave me the feel of a roadside Dhaba too in that matter. A housefly almost went into my mother's nostrils.

......At this point, all of us at the table decided to go around and try out the items on buffet. Though there was hardly any tummy space left, I took generous helpings of their salads. The wide array of cold cuts, dressings and veggies is sure to make any salad-lover do a happy dance, right in front of their salad counter. Mention must be made of the beautiful, ceramic salad bowls, with doubled the happiness instantly. But sadly, couldn‚Äôt try much else as I knew the desserts were too good to miss.

Thankfully, I went back to the JW Kitchen again, for my birthday dinner the very next week, with two of my school friends. And this time around, I got to try the buffet properly. The daal-bati churma counter was a great thing, and so were the live counters. The only complaint was that the counter serving satays was very slow, and our satays reached our table almost an hour after we had ordered it, in spite of two reminders in between, while we were half-way through our desserts.

As they say, all is well that ends well. And what better way to end a big, beautiful meal with some pretty looking, sweet bites. The Berry Classico was definitely the show-stealer on 28th. The shades of red and pink adorned the plate, and I almost didn‚Äôt have the heart to destroy it and turn the plate into what looks like a crime scene. But a hungry woman has to do what she has to do. So I plunged mt spoon deep and plundered the plate, while laughing a maniacal laughter. Aaaah! The berries, the mousse, the ice-cream all came together with their different tastes and textures and created magic inside the mouth.

They also have a waffle counter, and I had the warm, crispy-outside-soft-inside waffles with a good drizzling of caramel sauce and white chocolate chips. However, on both days the creme brule got over before I could grab one. Thankfully there were tons of other options to keep me happy and engaged.
                                          ...

We had an amazing evening followed by a hearty buffet meal at JW Kitchen.

Food : Wide range with great selection of salad bar,chaat counters,live pasta n noodles counter,dimsums(only veg though;don't know why),satay,indian (varied selection of non veg n Veg),thai curry,fresh fruits n cheese and one of the best dessert assortments.

Ambience : New property will always have it's shine and glitter.This property is no exception.Interiors are quite well done up.The silver bells at the entrance exude a simple yet artistic touch.

Service : High quality staffs who know their business.Special mention of Sandeep at Front desk and Karan who attended to us in the restaurant.

Highly recommended.

I had been here a few days back with my parents for dinner. The entrance to the buffet was just fabulous. The place has been very well designed. Coming back to food, I fell in love with the variety of appetizers. Had a hard time choosing due to the great spread. I started of with prawn satay and chicken before starting my main course with authentic Indian food. I loved the dal and paneer tikka. And the dessert counter was the star of them all. The Tiramisu martini was a complete standout for me. The best I've had in quite a while. Overall a great experience, including service of staff.

We went for our anniversary dinner with our daughter. We had reserved the table in the morning but to our utter surprise, we found that we were not registered and we had to wait for half n hour. Service definitely needs loads of improvement and senior supervision was clearly missing. We didn't expect it while being out for a five star dinning. Coming to the food, starters were good, they serve pasta, noodles n chaat in table. There is a whole variety of starters which fill up your soul. The lamb needs a special mention. Main Course is also delightful, specially the mutton preparations. There are loads of varieties which you will relish. Deserts are also equally good and i presume if you consider overall with respect to pricing and since it is new, it was a good experience. Only issue is once it gets crowded, if gets a bit cramped up. You ask me if I would like to revisit once more  my take would be a yes

JW Kitchen certainly promises excitement when you walk through its doors. But like a mid-range buffet is bound to be, the quality was average and disappointingly so. The spread itself, I had heard raves about. However, I did not find anything out of the ordinary.¬†

Mildly impressive were the exotic veggies served in the salad counter. It was just about 8pm and I'm not sure if they ran out of starters but the only vegetarian ones I could find was paneer kebab and a chilly honey potato type of dish. The Indian main course featured uninspiring obvious choices - palak paneer, a do pyaza, dals. The dals were good though. Dal bati churma, thepla, khandvi, pathrode - these were the interesting regional fixtures. They were again of middling quality. Per usual, the Chinese section was generic and the continental section's highlight was ratatouille, as scattered as it was. The pasta live counter dished up a subtle arabiatta, a hint of the real deal. I forget mentioning chats, but there is nothing significant to mention. 

The vaunted dessert section fared better. The fruits were fantastic. The selection of cakes, pastries, puddings, icecreams, Indian sweets was fairly satisfying. Maybe I had sky high expectations :-/

Final word: The spread and the menu featured here on Zomato are miles apart.

We went for the buffet dinner they offered us. First of all, the interior is splendid hence the ambience. For the buffet they offered a variety of cuisines; which included Indian, Continental, Thai, Mexican, etc. Along with that they also offered several confectionaries and salads. They also had live counters for some sections/cuisines. And at the end they had an equally huge section for desserts. In short they had lot many options to offer, given the price.

Ambience- Splendid
Food- Good
Service- Good

Well what can I say about Marriott, it's a well known hotel chain around the world and on top at that price which they are offering a buffet at Marriott Kolkata, I dare you to complain. 
They have a wide variety of cuisine and the place feels soo classy and modern. The quality and service is exceptional but due to the reason it's quite crowded you might feel service could have been better. But if you compare that to the wide variety of cuisine they are offering, you just cannot complain.

To start with, I'm still in awe of the place. The ambience is very soothing, seating arrangements is good and covers a huge area. The idea of having different counters for different cuisines or dishes is something I found interesting. The buffet is amazing at such a cheap rate( for a 5 star), thers's many varieties but the food can be better. The white sauce of penne pasta could've been a bit thick. Desserts were amazing and many varieties. Salad was great. You should definitely give it a visit. :)

The brand says it all. Beautiful decorum, great service, and the interior is something to die for. We went there without prior booking. the manager was considerate enough to provide us a table and gave us a specified time because all the tables were already reserved. But later we didn't face any issues because there wasn't much rush when we were having dinner. But I would suggest that prior booking should be done. The staffs would suggest the same. They provide a vast range of cuisines, starting from Indian to chinese to continental. Their main speciality is wide varieties of desserts and salad. Overall a very nice experience and a pocket friendly hotel.

First of all let me start by saying this that when Marriot calls , one simply never hangs up . Boasting of being one of the finest brands in the hotel industry across the world , their setup was perfect to showcase their pedigree in every way possible . Starting from the hospitality we received right from when we walked in , to the eye catching dishes the buffet had to offer  , to the lighting and grandeur of the whole atmosphere that surrounded us , to the service we received right till the end . Everything was as I had expected and maybe even more . It was an experience that I'll never forget and that I am going to cherish for the rest of my life . Thank you JW Marriot , you were too good to be true .

This place is being talked about almost everywhere i go so, i had to try it out myself. Finally had the time to go there today for lunch . I have to start by saying the spread is fantastic as usual! They literally have everything, from ¬†Indian and Chinese to Italian and continental , whatever cuisine you want they'll probably have it! They even have a chat section which was awesome for a street food lover like me. And oh! the salad section is absolute bliss.Now being Marriot I expected the quality of the food to be a bit better specially the Indian section ( the kebabs were not good and the biriyani was very average). ¬†Most of the food were average in taste. What i really loved are the chats, the salads, the pasta (available at a live counter) and the dessert bar ( which has so many things that it alone is like a small three course meal). Also they do serve roti and naan at the table if you want some but, any drinks are not included in the buffet and are chargeable. The ambiance is beautiful and is right beside the main gate. The staff is very polite and helpful. Since, it was very busy even on a Wednesday afternoon I would suggest you book a table a few days before you plan to go. Overall my experience was fantastic and it definitely is a steal of a deal.
p.s you will over eat here so might as well go on your cheat day!

Dear management at JW Marriott Kolkata, 
It was my father's birthday today and my brother and I had booked a surprise lunch for my dad and mom. I reserved a table for them through zomato and had also clearly stated the occasion. I even called your table reservation desk to confirm the booking and rightly pointed out that it was a lunch booking for my dad's birthday. I was promised a complimentary birthday dessert at the end of the meal. My mother had to walk up to a concerned person at the reservation desk and remind her of the same, however, no one seemed bothered about it and they left after lunch. It is indeed a displeasure, more so because of the brand name and the valuable customer loyalty that you have. You have really failed to live up to the promise made. It is a disgrace that your staff did not even acknowledge even after being reminded not once but twice!

We went there on 12th December for dinner to celebrate my parents anniversary and i am glad I chose this place .
I was actually kind of mesmerised by the entire setting .
The spread was lavish and you are spoilt for choices .
Starting from choice of soups to tandoori starters , live counters of Italian food and Chinese food , an entire section for live Indian chaat counter , a separate Gujarati food section , North Indian main course and Rajasthani special Dal Baati and churma !
And lemme tell you about the dessert section.
It is hugeee.
Yes from live waffles and pancakes counter , various kind of Indian sweets , puddings , candys, various flavour of ice creams and various types of cakes and cupcakes.
They also had a fruit counter for all kinds of healthy fruits .
You literally will be spoilt for choice . 
Just loved the entire experience and can't wait for many more such meals ‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòç

The lunch buffet has a huge number of options at a quite reasonable price..the food quality is pretty good,but not excellent..they have a lot of dessert options,i really liked the sticky date pudding, but the service needs to improve especially at the live waffles counter..the guy there first sent our order to the wrong table, was not at all courteous and then finally we got waffles which were burnt...so apart from these glitches,the buffet is quite good value for money,but keep in mind,that u have to reserve ur table atleast a week in hand before...

Me and my special one went to have dinner on 9th of january 2017 on the eve of our completing 1year 6months of togetherness..

The decor and ambience goes without saying was classy and hospitality was equally up to the mark..

We availed of the dinner buffet and we were escorted to a couple table dimly litted.
It was perfect to spend a romantic evening..

We started with the kebab starters.. Tasty they were.. yumm..
Then we tried the soup of the day.. tom yum soup.. it was tangy and delicious..
There was a variety of indian food.. salads.. fruits.. desserts.. and what not.. and all these around 1200 per head inclusive of all taxes..

There were live counters for tandoor and pasta..
That was a bit slow only for the reason being the heavy crowd.. nevertheless live counter food was served at the table after taking down the table numbers..

We were so happy with the delicious food.. and the service..
The crowd was also nice..

To conclude, such divine and vast food in such a pocket friendly price in a five star like JW Marriot was a treat..
Generally five star hotels have a thing that their food is not up to the mark.. But for Marriot i would say they have done a great job and have lived upto the expectations of the foodies around... (atleast me and my partner)..
We would definitely visit for another lunch or dinner may be sometime soon..

Thank you JW Marriot..

As every foodie in the City Of Joy, i too was super-excited about having Marriott in the city! To me it meant another couple of fine-dines to binge in!
The lobby area is beautifully designed with all crystals & gold ‚ù§ perfect place for your 'facebook dps' üòÅ Oh! the lighting! üòâ
Now, to the food, i was amazed at the size of the buffet spread.. So much to choose from! Most of the food, unfortunately, very mediocre & served cold. here i was..amazed, again. And as you can guess from the pictures uploaded alongwith, i mostly dug into the desert section.. With almost 20 odd items to choose from.. Some of them, lovely.
All in all.. Very mediocre experience. Modestly easy on the pocket for a 5-starer but somewhat not worth the time.

Have had three meals here, one of them being the Christmas eve buffet. Firstly, I must admit I was stolen by the ambiance when I went there for lunch. Loved the amount of natural light that floods the coffee shop. The buffet is very bright and looks very appealing.

Coming to the food. I simply fell in love with the place because of the salad spread. The selection of cold cuts, the mezze, the dips, and the salad. The garde manger chef of the hotel needs an applause. The use of color on the Salad bar is stunning. Simple adored the sun dried tomato dip and the hummus was really silky. Stunning offing of olives and Pickled vegetables.

The next highlight were the achaar cart and the farsaan selection. My heart was stolen.

The mains were nice as well. I fell for the stir fry section. They made me a brilliant stir fry in practically no oil. Killer!

The choices of cheese to stole my heart. On Christmas eve, the turkey and the barbecue counter were absolutely gorgeous.

The desserts are crisp and clean. Although I'm not much of a dessert person, and they didn't have a sugarfree dessert on the menu on my first visit. But on telling it was so promptly taken care of that I'm elated. And there has been a sugar free dessert every time after.

The staff is very very humble and they make you feel special. Finally an international level buffet in the city. Absolute indulgence at its best.

Kudos!

The ambience is amazing and so is the hospitality. Special mention to Krishanu who was our server for the day. His knowledge of the different kinds of liquor and the zeal to make the experience fulfilling for the customers was most helpful. The massive spread of desserts is a heaven for sweet toothers and is highly recommended. And all this for a very low price. What more can a foodie ask for?

Lovely interiors, exquisite buffet display, satisfactory options and the pampering staff members; this is what perfectly defines a meal out at JW Marriott. It's not extremely different from what all buffet are like but the fact that they have sufficient major items managed so well that positions it a bit on top over others.

A visit to this place was much awaited.The ceremonious interiors with neat seating arrangement and a number of buffet counters displaying major variety of cuisine is what you see when you enter JW Kitchen.We firstly thought that the waiting of two or more weeks was for creating hype but when we visited them on our booking date we saw that all the tables were equipped.Now starting of with the ambiance-

Ambiance-Being a 5-star property it was expected that both the interiors and ambiance will be of top notch.The transparent roofs gives you a lively feeling and inspite of having a huge seating capicity you wont feel conjusted.All the buffet has been arranged in a particular order and there are few live counters for serving you particular dishes.

Food-They had an immense variety for vegetarians and non-vegetarians in savoury and sweet dishes.And being a vegan we only tried out vegetarian dishes from this place.To be honest the savoury dishes didn't satisfied our taste buds but the variety and taste of desserts made us lick our fingers literally.There were approx 20 desserts and we tasted nearly all of them and it was the dessert which made our money spent,worthy.

Ambiance-4.5/5
Food-3/5

First of all, Buffet Lunch @ 899+tax @ JW Marriott is really attractive for every Foodie. I am here on Saturday 7th Jan, 2017. It was amazing atmosphere here, nicely decorated allover. Interiors are lavishly done, loved the restaurant area. Amazing experience I had.

Starting with sandwiches, mixed salads with Turkey Ham, verities of mayonnaise. Lots of options are there. We can customize them as per our requirements. Then Kababs are there, specially the Afghani Paneer Tikka, Fish, Lomb Potato, Paneer Tikka, Boiled Chicken. All of them are too good. Lots of options in live counters. One of them is BBQ type, Chicken, Fish, Prawns are there, But I didn't like Chicken and Fish of this, Prawn was good. Other options are pasta, noodles also there. Some of main courses items are too good like Biriyani, Kalimirch Chicken Tikka are too good, but some of them are not so tasty. Last but not the least, Special attractions here is deserts. Lots of options are here, more than 40 items are there. Varity flavors pastry cakes, Bengali Sweets, fruits and lots more.

One thing I felt that as the hotel is in Kolkata, so they should offer more authentic taste of Bengal to their guests specially who are outside from Bengal. Not such options are there.

JW Kitchen at JW Marriott is currently the most trending restaurant on Zomato Kolkata and it's there for a reason. Impeccable ambience, unparalleled hospitality and delectable food makes JW Kitchen a class act. 
JW Kitchen opened its doors before Puja 2016 and has been a runaway success since day 1. And why wouldn't it be? You get to dine at a star hotel, possibly the biggest hospitality brand in the world, for an affordable price. The interiors reflect the chic and panache of the JW Marriott Kolkata and the diner is spacious and delectably decorated to say the least. 
The menu is extensive. You get a spread of about 90-100 different items and thankfully JW Kitchen has thought well for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. 
The salads are enticing. You get as many as 25-30 compound salads as well as fresh veggies and processed meat to make your own. For me, the salad section was more enticing than the starters or the mains. The starters comprise of tandoor items and oriental savouries. The main course is again exhaustive. You get Indian, Chinese, Thai, Mughalai, Continental and Bengali. However, the Thai and Chinese gravies taste much better than the Indian or Bengali curries. The gosth (mutton) biriyani served in the main course was a dampener. The dhokar dalna in the mains was another stuff gone bad.  However, the Chinese mains and the fish in Thai green curry were rather good. The live pasta and satay counters are great. The creamy pesto and spiced mixed sauce pastas were hearty and really deserves mention. The same goes for the chicken and zucchini item in the continental section. 
The highlight of the meal has to be the desserts. The dessert counter is a treat to the senses. Not only do they look good, but almost all the desserts taste extraordinarily good. A special mention must be made of the pannacota, Black Forest and mud pie. The lime meringue tart was another standout. 
Service was impeccable. Our server, Subhranil was really courteous and made the meal an affair to remember. 
However, the only gripe is that JW Kitchen wouldn't serve any drink with the meal. Serving alcoholic liquors in a buffet spread may have constraints, but a complimentary glass of soda or cola should be included. I hope JW Kitchen looks into the issue. 
JW Kitchen is here to stay and it will certainly retain its topmost for months and years to come. I wish them all the best.

Treating oneself at JW Marriott at 1200inr(including tax) is every foodie's dream come true.
Coming straight to food, they had a wide range of salads to choose from. Personal favourite was smoked turkey. The kebabs were average. They had varieties of cheese to enhance the taste buds. The snacks section had typical gujrati snacks that we come across, for ex. thepla, dhokla, phapda. In the main course, mutton tasted good but Biryani was average. Now, the desserts section was the real game changer. The truffles, mousses, Bengali sweets, waffles. Everything was mouth watering.
This place has undoubtedly uplifted Kolkata's standard of restaurants.

Excellent place. Amazing spread of dishes and cuisines. All cottage cheese dishes were fantastic and fresh. Live counter was really live. Funeral potato is a real tounge catcher. Ambiance is great too. However could be a little crowded as there are just 2 functional restaurants at Marriott. 

The key reason I prefer 5 stars is the quality of staff. We were served by Mr Dweep, who took real good care of us.

Last but not the least, this place is really up and running because of the prices.

Foodies are in search of good food; secondly an ambiance that serves as appetizers ! Marriott is a perfect place to flow in rich quality lunch menus that are displayed well, served superbly and prepared with finest excellence of the cook. We so loved the desserts and the assortments associated with them! This place gave me a feeling to visit it one more time sooner. Every bite of the food was awesome.. Thanks Marriott staffs and cooks for your cordial behavior and promptness to serve customers the best!

Truely remarkable food. The variety of cuisines was overwhelming - from Indian to Italian, Thai, Chinese, and French - never have i seen such variety at a buffet. What teased me even more was the dessert section. Having more items than one could try out after the mains. And at the price of roughly 2 dishes with beverages at any 4 star restaurant, you can get all the flavours of the world here. So why go to some place else. My experience here was great. The service was top notch and quick. And one cannot forget the luxurious ambiance. Will surely visit again soon.

I do love Kababs, so the Afghani Paneer Tikka and the Kalimirch Chicken Tikka are both added to my plate as I make another round around the buffet spread. To this, I also add a steamed bao, generously stuffing it with some chicken filling kept on one side, a portion of which D2 very calmly swipes off from my plate with her bao, and for a few seconds I forget which plate I am supposed to be eating from, such is her degree of ownership on my plate.

We finally have welcomed JW Marriott in Kolkata a month back and what a welcome it is that ended on not getting the booking for the buffet even in the mid of the week. Yes, this is what happened to me when I and Mehebub decided to visit the place with Pasta end December and I ended on not getting the reserved table after two consecutive attempts and it was kind of a shock to me! I mean, I do have little idea about the food scenario of the city of joy but not getting a booking is something new to me. Naturally, discussions started with the friends (read social media posts) and I found it was not only me (fortunately!) however; I finally got my table booked with a little interference by my dear ‚ÄúP‚Äù. By that time, I heard it was nothing but a gimmick but my visit prove the same wrong at least for the weekday dinner. It was completely full and believe me, I was happy to see the crowd in a five star for that matter. Now the reason behind is actually simple, the negotiated price JW Marriott Kolkata is offering now which if compared with city based buffet rates is far below than the buffet cost by other five-stars and in fact quite at per with ¬†the general fine dine rate. Naturally, after having a decent rate next thing came to my mind was the food spread and service and with that note let me share my experience of visiting JW Marriott Kolkata with the family followed by attending the bloggers‚Äô table.

The worst booking experience ever. Almost 2 weeks ago I booked a table for three on 8th January and the authority even told me that my booking has been confirmed. But today when I called them to confirm the status of my booking they said that no booking status was found. Instead they kept pressurising me to book a table for a separate date. The matter was highly disappointing and I'm never gonna visit the place ever in my life!!!

So let me say that I have been to JW at other parts of the world and I will evaluate JW kitchen accordingly. Firstly, I do understand the business point of view of having a low price buffet to cut its competitors but this should not in any way reflect on the quality of food. 

The spread here is enormous as in the quantity of food and the choices. The salad bar, main course, 4 live counters and the dessert counter: full marks for having loads of options!

Now comes the sad part. The quality of food did not meet my expectations. The afghani tandoori was extremely dry, the spicy chicken drumstick was not cooked sufficiently, the chilly fish was more like lemony fish etc. to jot down a few. The rasmalai in the dessert section was a grand letdown! Also not having soft drinks included in the buffet just beats me. These are a few things somebody needs to sit down and think hard about. 

I personally would have been ok with paying more and being offered the quality I usually get from JW but then this is my personal opinion. The price is a good deal to dine at a 5 star so other people might be willing to make the compromise.

First of all you need to make a prior reservation,at least 2weeks before to try out their ravishing buffet spread. Finally i visited Marriott on 1st January to try out their buffet dinner. What an amazing experience I had, this is the best star hotel buffet that i have ever had in kolkata. They had big prawns, chicken, mutton, fish. Just name it and it will be served to you. The dessert section was truly a treat to the eyes. It looked amazing, tasted awesome. The waffled were very tasty. Service was too good. Decor and ambience was amazing. Really very impressed. Would try their lunch buffet soon.

Happy New Year my pretties! I hope 2017 is our best year ever and there is an abundance of love, prosperity and happiness. This is the first post of the new year and I was in two minds about what to write. Should I write a beauty related post or a food or a travel one? It is said that whatever you do on the first day of the year, you will do throughout so after much contemplation, I decided to go for a food related post. I would absolutely not mind eating wonderful food throughout the year especially if it is as delicious¬†as the food that is served at¬†JW Kitchen, the all day-diner at JW Marriott Hotel Kolkata.

JW Kitchen has the best spread among all the coffee shops of the five star luxury hotels in Kolkata. Tried their New Year brunch and we were floored!¬†
What I liked most was the salad bar and the infinite options to choose from. I swear next time I visit this place I would only have salads. They are simply divine!¬†
The restaurant offers an array of Indian and international starters to choose from. ¬†The aroma of the Indian pickles made me go weak at the knees...¬†
The chicken mushroom soup too was awesome!
The live counters included grill, pasta, risotto, noodles, rice and chats. Unfortunately they did not have pizzas.¬†
The main course spread too was huge, we tried ¬†the continental options only and they were equally good.
The fruit section too had a wide spread.
The dessert section had a selection of about 30 Indian and international desserts including a live waffle counter. ¬†They all looked tempting. ¬†In addition they had four ice cream flavors on offer. However, apart from a handful I did not like them much.¬†
But all is not well here. They still have some scope of improvement. And here are the reasons why I stopped short of rating it 5.:¬†
The chanar payesh did not taste like authentic Bengali sweet (The other Indian food on the buffet tasted authentic). And for a restaurant based in Kolkata offering global cuisine I feel offering authentic taste of Bengal to its guests is very important. Also, I felt that JW Kitchen could have included the quintessential Bengali style chutney ¬†in its spread. The staff, though was very helpful and courteous but they were all confused with our booking. No one had any clue about our prepaid booking which was inclusive of wine. The staff told us that wine will be separately charged and on our insistence he ran and spoke to several of his seniors, made several cross checking before coming and asking us about our preference of wine.
But having said that I would reiterate that the salad section here is to die for and has made me a fan of this place.

A disappointment. Shall prefer other buffets in Kolkata like the Barbeque Nation. The brand does not live up to its name. Realized how average ratings in social media apps can be misleading. Went there after having looked at 4.3 rating at Zomato. 1 is apt for the restaurant.

Had been there twice and both as walk in guests for lunch.the spread is good though they don't have much of sea food or red meat.it's just about fish (bekti), chicken and mutton n tiger prawns.there's no pork, beef or seafood.however they have a variety of desserts.
Service is OK nothing exceptional
Worst part is they don't accept reservations over phone and are always ready with one answer 'we r sold out'.However if u happen to walk in u will get a table and also find dat there are many empty tables too.
The spread is good but nothing out of the box..I guess JW Marriott Mumbai has a far better spread and is much more organized
The staff too lacks proper training and skills where they need to work hard...

We went in at an odd hour in-between 5 to 6 pm for a later lunch. The area is situated on the left side of the lobby, seemed like the 24 hrs coffee house for the hotel, the ambiance is great with the high ceiling & the glass fa√ßade. Between three of us we ordered an Aloo Posto, Dal Makhani & a basket of Indian Tandoor breads. While we were waiting for our order I ordered for a beer which was priced reasonably at 350/- bucks. We also asked for some of there buns, they gave us the house speciality buns, which were warm and tasted amazing with a dash of butter. We ended up asking for another plate of the same, best part they were complementary.¬† 

I really enjoyed there Dal Makhani, it was good in balancing the taste, neither too sweet nor too creamy as most high end places seem to do, it tasted just right. The Aloo Posto on the other hand tasted medico; among bread we tried stuffed kulcha, lachadar paratha & naan with the naan tasting best, it just went perfectly with the dal. We finished our meal with a forgettable desert. 

We paid about 2.5k for all the above, considering we got up with stuffed tummy among three in a 5 star it seemed a bargain.

When you walk into JW Marriott, you'd expect the best ambience to dine in, and I wasn't wrong. The ambience is great. For the price we paid (Rs. 899+ taxes) for the buffet, it was more than worth it. But I came back home wanting more. There wasn't any particular dish that wow-ed me. The items were good, not spectacular. The service was slow, we ordered a few items from the live grill and it made it to our table on our 3rd attempt, but after desserts so it wasn't of much use. Some of the starters initially were cold, you don't expect that when you walk into a 5 star. The dessert spread looked spectacular, but having my food blog and experience in baking, I wouldn't say they tasted as spectacular as they looked. Ending this elaborate review by saying: Going there for the whole experience on NYE was definitely worth the price we paid for. Expect them to improve their dishes a little bit more.

This was my second visit to a Marriott property after JW Marquis Dubai and it was quite satisfying.
Had a wonderful 31st lunch at this beautiful place. The lunch buffet had a wide variety to choose from. The lunch was highly satisfying. Lal mirch kebab, paneer tikka, Potato wedges, Biriyani, Nan, Penne in red sauce, Awadhi machhi were some of the dishes I tasted. Awadhi machhi, potato wedges, and kebabs were a notch above the rest. The food tasted pretty delicious except the Penne pasta in red sauce with olive onion capsicum and broccoli (as per our requirements), it was quite tasteless, could've been better.
I must mention that Krishanu Bhattacharya, the guy who was looking after our table was very impressive, very friendly and very helpful. He looked after us really well, we came out very satisfied.
At last, the most important part ie. the Desserts section, it was a delight to be there, I was quite confused with the huge variety of Desserts in front of me, waffles, tarts, cakes, sandesh, pastries and loads more!! This was the best part of our meal!!
I would definitely go back to this place and recommend this place to all, you must experience Marriott dining, believe me, it's special!!

Stepped into JW kitchen for our anniversary lunch. As the stars suggest ambience is quite decent. Staffs are lively (Apart of one of them who looked disinterested).. sitting order being bright and spacious. Live counters serving with priority and in order. Indian Chinese Thai Italian cold cuts salads bread and variety of cheese dry fruits all in variety served at its best with a never ending spread. However consistency of food tastes changes among the side platers with some being wow and some could have been even better. If you are a dessert lover, JW kichten buffet is what you should look for. It serves 40+ desserts starting from marshmellows to cream cup cakes.. berry mousse.. nolen gurer sondesh.. Tiramisu.. pie..baked bonde fruit yoghurt and many more. After having such a sumptuous and lavish spread..... they even served us with a complimentary anniversary cake with greetings from them which made it even more memorable. I would say... it's a must go during this festive season

The buffet layout is  amazing...it is an endless array of food...but here are a few things which surprised/shocked me
1. We got seated and was just about to start eating when the waiter came and informed us that we needed to pay first.
2. We had reached a little late for lunch and we were informed that the buffet would shut in half an hour after we finally got our table. And just as we were in our first course the waiter came and declared the buffet is closing and they closed almost right away without almost no  time for us to even take our food.
3. It took really long for them to serve the drinks we ordered and that too after multiple requests of first taking the order and then getting what we ordered. This is definitely not the kind of service you'd expect from a 5star.

Multi cuisine coffee shops in star hotels are usually indistinguishable from each other but this one has something going for it - sunlight! Owing to the glass facade of the hotel, sun streams in and it makes for a great breakfast destination. The spread is also quite extensive though they struggle to deviate from the buffet. Hence if you ask for a type of paratha a little different from what's in the buffet, you won't get it. The service is good though; they make efforts to greet you by name and remember you which is quite commendable given the mad rush here on some days. Good place for a breakfast.

The day construction began from that day we wished to visit there. And what better than visiting there with your entire family. I will try and give as much details as possible in this review. We visited there for dinner and here follows the review. 
 Ambience - I'll give a full 5* for the ambience as it was elegant and beautiful. It was quite neatly decorated with no extravaganza but it was as glamorous as it could be with its minimality. 
Food - Awesome food to say the least. The food was really of the global standard. Each and every item was great in taste and was cooked to perfection. It really lived upto it's name as a premium hospitality chain. They had a great collection of items of different regions to satisfy people with different food habits. Last but not the least the desserts section was amazing, it really puts you in a dilemma about what to taste and what to leave. 
I suggest all food enthusiasts to try at least once.

Finally managed to visit this place after my friends went gaga over it. This place excels in quality hospitality. From the moment you enter till you leave the place you would feel the warmth and the radiant energy vibrating from their team.¬†

The decor is basic and not over the top they have made good use of day light and space.¬†

Coming to the food I think they serve a great spread at a reasonable price. Though I don't eat huge quantities of food but I made it a point to taste almost everything ¬†in little portions.¬†

The place is an absolute heaven for dessert lovers though, however I loved their live Italian counter which makes fresh pasta and also the middle-east section.

The Indian section especially the mughlai has a good variety from subtly spiced biryani to tender kebabs and many more.

One Suggestion: ¬†If they could keep some beverages in the spread that would be perfect. ¬†

I wish them all the best .

The salads, the kebabs were so delicious & so are the main courses. There were lots of varieties in deserts & all of them were lips smacking, sumptous though we didn't tried all of them but still after you gets full your toungue will crave for more. The ambience of the place is mindblowing. The staffs are very cordial, helpful and are very well-behaved. Overall a best place to experience the sevenstar service in a pocketfriendly price

Went to this place for Dinner , staff behaviour is cordial, gentle, and helpful, ambience good, decor well somewhat gives a feeling of an airport lounge, overall nice. Now coming to the food.  Starter was good, served kebabs which were well cooked and perfectly flavored.  Next moving on to Dumplings not so properly done. Stuffing should be a bit tender, felt bland.  Salads options are good. Fresh and properly seasoned with a couple of dressing options, over all good.  Back to main course,  they have options to choose from Indian, Chinese and Italian. 
Biriyani was a complete let down, meat average. Then there is dal papad etc.  Overall not much to look forward to.  
I did not check out Chinese, opted for Italian and here I am a bit impressed. I had ordered Spaghetti with pink sauce and my colleague had ordered penne with white sauce.  Perfectly flavoured, fresh veggies, well cooked, live counter. Properly made.  
Moving on to dessert üç∞.  
Too many options to choose from. A lot of dessert options is laid before u, luring and tempting you !! üòé
Fairy cake, tarts, pies, gulab jamun, rashmallai, cheesecake, blueberry tart, candies, and many more.  With so many options to choose from,  dessert counter would not let anyone down, specially dessert lovers and people with sweet tooth. 
Overall - not a let down,  perfectly made,  and properly presented.

Went for lunch yesterday. Decor n ambience is good. It's a humongous n lavish spread with a great dessert spread. It's a heaven for people with sweet tooth. Only two things: firstly, I think they need to increase their non veg options in western mains. Secondly getting a reservation is a tedious process (had to call up almost 4 times as my reservations was booked for a wrong date). Staff is extremely courteous n polite.

Bad experience. I called up several times. They transfered me to the restaurant but they put me on hold for 10 minutes and then disconnect the call.

Firstly it was quite difficult to get reservation there. I wanted to treat my mother on her birthday and this has been on her wishlist for a long time. We finally got the booking confirmed three days after her birthday. Still since my mother wanted to visit this place so we went ahead with the plan. Firstly the staff is extremely courteous. The decor is just right.Now coming to the food ...they have a very good salad counter, cheese counter, an okayish chat counter, again a good spaghetti , pasta and satay counter ( though my satay dnt arrive even after I had placed the order). They have dimsums but only veg and no pizza counter. They had a number of fish preparations which were really good. Both veg and non veg biriyani were good. They also have a farsan counter where you get dhoklas, which were soft and nice.
Their best part of the buffet is the dessert counter. The nolen gurer paturi sandesh was so soft and fresh that it melted in our mouths. Then they had brownie in date sauce, cheesecakes etc. All of them were excellent. 
The only problems were no pizza counter, veg dimsums and no drinks complimentary with the buffet. Pricing is low if compared to spread. 
I would seriously like to visit the place again for the sweet dishes and the biriyani, highly recommend this place to everyone. We loved it!!

Excellent ambience, worth the wait, the service was great, with a smile. Enjoyed eating here, the food was good and the buffet spread was lavish, it's value for money. The dessert section was to die for . however the butter chicken was cold and the fish satay is best avoided, very strong flavor.

The hotel was much awaited and finally the wait has ended. I have followed the structure coming up right from the beginning and there I finally was enjoying an Amazing buffet meal. I was surprised at the buffet price, pleasantly at the pocket friendly prices at the star address.

The buffet has a vast array of choices and it's a great culinary experience. The salads were really good so was the Indian food and we loved the desserts part. A special cake can be requested. 
I loved the Talumein soup , mushroom stuffed zucchini roundels, the Italian counter and Punjabi food counters were impressive. 
The childish side of me was extremely happy to see details like a bowl of jelly beans as a part of the dessert counter.
Do save space for the desserts. One is definitely spoilt for options.

Upfront it's a very modish property virtue of being the latest (2016) in the Kolkata market. It almost gives you the feel of newly launched jewellery showroom with all the glitterati of chrome finish hangings and brilliant props.¬†
The All-Day Dining restaurant was pretty well setup with 4 distinct kitchens catering an array of World and Indian cuisines. The variety and the arrangement were truly hearty and enticing, though, the quality of buffet stuff wasn't above any regular buffet of a competing 5 star. However, a special word of praise for the outstanding desserts and the patisserie, it takes the cake. The waffle counter too was indeed a tribute to Abe Doumar!! That's where I splurged in the end. ¬†

Going back to the variety question, buffets are a real trying proposition in as what to have, one can‚Äôt even try everything. The options outweigh your desires and ability. Thus, I tried some of the most basic items from the Indian section first, the Dal Makhani and Mutton Rogan Josh. I am a believer in the culinary fact: one can judge the quality of food of any institution by trying out the most basic preparation. In a Chinese restaurant a simple and popular Sweet Corn Chicken soup can tell the entire story of the kitchen hands expertise. As a thumb rule I did not go with a pent up expectation from the buffet, thus, I would say that the fare was just about above average.  On the flip side at 899++ for Lunch and 999++ for dinner, which of course are promotional rates, this buffet was far too good to miss out on, while it is there.

The interesting stuff is always in the A La Carte menu and Chef‚Äôs specials, for which, I had reserved a section and must say that I don‚Äôt commend myself for it. A Lamb Chop dish with Asparagus and Cherry tomatoes on side was truly delicious in sight and prep. The lamb was juicy and smoky as well as surely char grilled to perfection. After this I gave a shot to the live pasta counter and tried a well made and a very robust seafood pasta, which also was a delight.¬†
¬†In all it is a welcome addition to the Kolkata Epicurean map and surely many more outlets are planned out here, including a specialty Asian restaurant, night club and a rooftop lounge.  Overall a rather prestigious change Kolkata deserved to have. Now, we are beginning to get happening.

Regarding the sunday brunch:-

Frankly, it's a huge huge spread and considering it to be sold at 1800+Tax is a still. I won't say much about the cold cuts and dessert counter, which anyhow is one of the strongest point of J W Kitchen, but apart from them, the two special dishes made by chef Sudip's team were killers. The first one was Loklak. It's more like a vietnamese spring roll - basically lettuce leaves were to be stuffed with the spicy beef strips and other condiments and enjoyed. The second one was that heavenly pork belly cooked with pineapple and star-anise. Both were brilliant and once I go back there, these will be the sure shot items on my table. Way to go ..... and definitely recommended.¬†

At the time of opening:-

                        The new luxury property has started its operation in town and frankly, everybody is excited. And why not ? Frankly, JW Marriott is a big name and it has become sort of a competition for the city's food enthusiasts to reach the place- either on a lunch or dinner and if not anything else, on a breakfast event.
 "But, less than 1000/- for a buffet in a luxury 5* property in Kolkata ? Like are you serious ? " This was my first exclamation once I was researching about booking the seat for a family meal.¬†

"But wait, now's time for the bad news" - my friend said and the place is sold out for next 10 days.  And, I was laughing at her. "Boss, these 5* property are never sold out and anybody, just anybody can get a reservation with a phone"- I was confident enough. But, things were a little different. Firstly, getting the Marriott landline (033-6330000) is a bit difficult and the next challenge is getting through the busy line of JW Kitchen and once I was through, voila, they ACTUALLY were sold out. So, I got a lunch reservation at last. Well, even there's a story behind that. Maybe for promotion, they floated a photography competition on Kolkata and promoted via their photography page. And, somehow, I managed to win in one category and a weekday buffet lunch couple voucher was the prize (the cover photo was the one winning the prize).

And, on the said date, we reached JW Kitchen, along with my queen and my monkey prince. Firstly, I must say something, as we came to know, the pricing is very very competitive and though a penetrative pricing, it is probably kept at that level, keeping in mind the price sensitive nature of Kolkata. As we found out, there were 4 live counters apart from the widely spread buffet. The Italian (preparing pasta for lunch, maybe pizza was for dinner), Asian (satay and various noodle dishes and surprisingly momo, not dimsums), The chaat counter (which we didn't taste, but with quite a good variety and the Waffle counter (which I loved personally). Now, by no means, I am a heavy eater and same goes for my family. So, we could manage a small portion of the following items. Taste-wise I felt they're pretty good (nothing special though) and the options were pretty good. A special mention for the penne with white sauce and and from the Indian section, Murgh angara. The biryani was pretty ordinary and is not recommended.

For the sweet tooth ones, dessert counter was the perfect place to wait for. It had got some 20 varieties of sweets (from across globe) and their Indian desserts are commendable (especially the chhena paturi and baked rasogolla). I got the chef's choice from the waffle counter, which was waffle with chocolate sauce with plenty of nuts and was pure heaven.

the good part is they've got a great service team who takes care of the guest's need every single moment. For example, I am a bit finicky about water service and here, surprising, my glass was never empty. Definitely happy.

Probably, the next time I visit, I'll be carrying my camera and my sincere apologies for these bad quality mobile pictures. Now, some quick facts:-¬†

Reservation:- (033)66330000 and ask for JW Kitchen. Reservation time, as of time, at least 10 days.

Pricing:-

Breakfst: INR 650+ Tax

Lunch: INR 899+ Tax

Dinner: INR 999+ Tax

Overall, a great experience and I'll definitely come back for second time (provided I get the reservation).

Bon Apetite !!!

A nice 5 star restaurants at a not so crowdy area of Kolkata 
Here are the facts
Ambience ::as expected it was nice .Although the restaurant doesn't entirely separate from the lobby but the long hanging bells give it a posh look.
The open kitchen concept was nice .
I roamed around different parts of the kitchen .The outer side also has a seating arena but the chairs are not so classy
Food:: the buffet has many offerings but for usual dishes, i was disappointed. 
A la carte was good but not according to expectations again.
Behaviour :: welcoming 
After finishing your food you can roam around or stay as the place has a good capacity. 
Waiters are helpful.
Pricing:: surprisingly low.My bill was within 3 digits and ordered 3 things . They also offer some combo meals which you will find in the photos .
If you are short of money then these are saviours. 
Anything special..??
Oh yes 
The dome here is nice 
The corner seats give you a personal feeling .
The open kitchen.
A sophisticated lounge .

Recommended and worth a visit to 5 star 

Enjoy..

Kolkata's newest and the first Marriott opened doors few months back. The place is beautiful with natural lights shining through yet the charm has been preserved! The buffet starts from one end and ends at the other extreme. You will not be able to walk away from the dessert menu, they have it all, a waffle and a dedicated six flavoured ice cream counter.
The thai curry was outstanding and the sticky white rice transported me back to my Asian stay days!! The indian fare is nice too. To add to that they provided us with a lovely chocolate mousse three layered cake! What an yummilicious afternoon üòÄüòÄ

I s wish that my experiece was as nice as the interior of the Marriott! The Buffet was okay.. nothing great. The staff, specially the guy attending to us was just not bothered. He forgot to serve us the naan he gave our drink when we were almost done eating, replaced my cold yellow daal with daal makhani, forgot to give us the finger bowl and so on. The icing on the cake was a strand of hair in my husband's lemonade. Thankyou JW Marrriott for the most amazing experience ever!!!
Also the glasses in which we were water were dirty :)

Went there for lunch. The inaugural price is Rs 899+ taxes. Being new the decor and ambiance are just amazing. Great work.
Buffet was a good collection of indian and some continental dishes. There was cold salads, farsan counter(dhokla,khandvi etc) live chats, live pasta and noodles. Indian main course consisted of 3 vegetables and dal. Overall good food ingredients used were very fresh . Deserts lacked the feel good punch especially in western vatiety . The Indian desserts like gur sandesh, baked rasmalai, chenna sandesh etc were very good.

Marriott !!! I would say its an experience.
The imposing structure had caught my eye every time I crossed it when it was being constructed. So dining at Marriott was always on my wish list.
Just a month after it opened doors I enquired for the booking and as usual I get a reply that its overbooked for 2 weeks. Well I luckily got through the kitchen manager and she was kind enough to book me 2 seats for a weekday.
We entered the imposing structure which was just so beautiful. The restuarant gives you a feeling of royalty where a sumptuous buffet is laid before you and you just think where to start from.
The live counters are amazing. The pasta was just too good and so was the Thai soup. The papdi chaat was very nice and also the paneer starters. The cauliflower was not upto the mark. The dimshums were overcookek. The best part about the live counters is that they serve you after noting your table number. Many items were left untried as there was much more to explore.
There was another section which had jars of pickles...dhoklas and many non veg items too.
We headed to the main course which was a disappointment. They had 3 international vegetables which tasted bland. Now what do we have those with. It seemed incomplete.
There was gatte ki sabzi...paneer...aloo...biryani and the biggest disappointment was the rotis being served. No rajasthani rotis. Only tandoori roti and naan which was also not upto the mark. Hope they work out on the main course.
The biggest saviour of the day was definitely the desert counter. What a lavish spread of sweets...cakes...ice creams.. cupcakes and what not. I mean you just cant decide what to try and what to leave. Tiramisu was good and so were the ice cream flavours. My next visit would definitely explore more of the deserts.
It was a memorable experience with great staff service and looking forward to being there again.

Behold !!!one of the biggest 5 star franchisee hits the City of Joy...
Marriot-the name exudes finesse and class and yet the dinner buffet spread was like a strip down version of the Marriot

Just creating variety and multiple live counters doesnt make sense if the cooks cant rustle up delicious food

All the dishes that I had were like food from any basic restraunt....the yummm quotient which makes you keep going back for more was soooo missing

Marriot needs to work on the flavours of its offerings if it wants to beat the Tajs and ITCs

Woof that was a lot of food ! One of the most expansive buffets in town and with an introductory inexpensive price . it's too good to miss. It has its hits and misses. The salad bar and the dessert selection is definitely the star of the show. So save some tummy space for this. The mains are not shabby either. The cheese counter is limited but good . The Italian counter has the usual pasta and risottos but the presentation is lovely. The Indian section is superb with its selection of marwari food and the popular Punjabi fares.the biriyani and lal mas was an excellent combination. The kebabs are good too. The oriental section isn't bad but we are spoilt for choice in Kolkata and this doesn't pass muster. I was delighted with the saboo papad of yesteryear , the ones you get now in the market are sad in comparison. There are great many things to keep you happy here but nothing compares to the delightful dessert spread . The service is genuine and warm the ambiance not so much. The restaurant is smack in the middle of a the lobby separated only by a bell curtain if sorts. God help you If  there's a wedding in the ballroom you'll be stuck in the barrage of wedding guests . What the place lacks in opulence  and grandeur it makes up in its style . It's a sparkling new addition to the city.

One of the Best Buffet I had in town. It was like a big bazaar of Buffet with Cuisine ranging from Chinese, Italian, Indian, Japanese etc. Fruits, salami, salads are just so fresh. Biriyani, Chicken Kebabs, Paneer main courses, Malai Methi were among the best. Apart from this a live counter to serve your favourite noodles and pasta in your style. Desert section was pure beauty.

Food-Sumptuous buffet spread which has the right mix of appetizers, maincourse and desserts.

Ambience- One of the best aspect of this restaurant is the soothing way the interiors have been laid down. It is modern in every possible way and is pleasing to the eyes.

Service- The service personnel here will make you feel at home what struck my attention was the anticipation made by some of them which really impressed me. Shubodeep and krishanu served us really well.

Conclusion- I really had a splendid evening at this place. Special thanks to sous chef Viveknananda for taking good care of us and making the evening even more memorable!! would recommend all the gourmand to bookmark this place asap!!üòç

I had gone to this newly opened JW Kitchen for my Anniversary Dinner. Ambiance of the restaurant is Excellent.Staffs are very courteous always with a smile. As I am a vegetarian I will review for veg dishes, paneer afghani tikka was excellent, There was selection of chaats like papri chat, aloo tikki chat, samosa chat, rak kachori chaat. I tried aloo tikki chaat and papri chaat. If you don't like spicy kindly inform them not to make it spicy. There was live counter for noodles and pastas. Soy noodles was very tasty. For the main course I veg biryani was good, dal makhni was not that great, palak paneer was ok, aloo dum was nice, there was gatte ki sabzi, yellow dal fry, plain rice, dal bati churma, assorted fried papads. You can also try veg dimsums too. Desserts have lot of choices, there are eggless options too. Overall a very good experience. A very good Inaugural offer for just Rs.1200/- inclusive of taxes for an adult and Rs.600/- for kids.

When the grandeur that is JW Marriott was building brick by brick, foodies like me across the city were excited to explore the food options here! It finally arrived- the JW Kitchen.
A plethora of worldly food experiences and lavish spread!
The JW Kitchen opened doors to the city of joy with a huge buffet spread consisting of everything possible!
Here goes my experience - 

The place is big and spacious with strategically placed counters. 
On offer were a vast range of salads, chaats and more. 
The Gujarati counter had the choicest of farsaans!
The mozzarella tomato sandwich was delicious!
Loved the paneer tikka though the Gobi was not too good. 
The live pasta counter was a delight for Italian foodies!
I tried the aglio Olio and the pasta was also dente. It was cooked very well. 
Next up tried their double spicy chilli garlic noodles with assorted vegetables. They toss it in front of you and make it as per your requirement.
The grilled veggies were really good as a salad. 
The Lebanese counter had all possible fix ins including olive varieties, pita hummus, lebneh.
The Asian counter also had dumplings.

For main course their was a good spread including dal Paneer, kofta etc and choice of breads and rice.

The best part was the elaborate display of desserts which looked divine and tasted wonderful! 
From mousses, to custards to pies and cupcakes the spread was eye dropping! 
Tried so much that I hardly remember what I ate but desserts were definitely the best part of the buffet 

Overall a good experience. They can improve in some areas like their kebabs and pay a little more attention to service but overall was a good experience!

I went to this restaurant on 17th November 2016 for lunch. Superb buffet I must say! Loved each and every item that was there in the buffet! One would find it difficult to choose from the widespread menu .. so my best suggestion would be .. taste everything. I assure  that you will not regret! I simply loved it. 
The desserts are something to die for .. variety and taste both par excellence!

I certainly enjoyed the experience and can't wait to go back again!

We were desperate to have this buffet as I have great memories of Marriott Mumbai. But after doing it yesterday, i must say it needs a lot of improvement and comes nowhere closer to my mumbai experience. Starters were O.K but had too less varieties in nonveg. Same goes for Chat and Live Counters. Indian Main course was not satisfactory. Same goes for continental Counters. However deserts were really good.

Today finally I had the opportunity to visit the newly opened JW MARRIOTT in Topsia ,Kolkata on the occasion of my mother's birthday . I had no idea that the restaurant was sold out totally upto Dec 4 . But the staff , hearing that this day was special for us , arranged for a table for 4 of us . Now coming to the buffet they had every dish a foodie desires starting from Europe to Asia . The starters were mind blowing and the best part were the live counters where they made us items on our choice so that one can satisfy their buds fully . The variety of salads was amazing . The Indian main course deserves special mention , the biryani and the mutton seemed no burden at all after those sumptuous starters. And the deserts omg they were so damn unique and the best part of our lunch . And most importantly the price was reasonable enough since they r providing you with so many dishes . So pls do pay a visit coz all that you need is your card at this moment üòú .

Lavish! Flamboyant! Class!

Finally had the chance to visit the luxurious hotel and it's restaurant. 

We opted for the buffet, which in fact was humongous with a lavish spread.
You cannot have it all.

Starting from the service, we were greeted with namaste everywhere right from the security guard to the server. Full of warmth.

Starters were not that great. The gosht and chicken kebabs could have been better and softer. The baby corn wasn't that crispy either. 
Next up were saut√©ed fish, chicken, prawns and baby corn. They were dry and lacked taste. They tasted better with the dressings. 

The highlight was the main course, be it the biryani, non veg and veg sabzis. We enjoyed pasta and the vast salad spread. The dessert was overloaded with tons of sweets. It's impossible to eat them all. Waffles were absolutely lip smacking.

Just try the watermelon mojito. It will surely be a blast of freshness and taste in your mouth. 

I'm really happy with the service and exquisite lobby. Food could have been a little better.

Went there yesterday for our Anniversary lunch...Overall experience was good but would like to detail out a bit...

Since it was our 5th anniversary so we thought of having lunch at a 5 star hotel.So we called them up to book a table but all in vain.The phone kept ringing and nobody answered.Maybe it is a new 5 star hotel pre-requisite!!Still we thought of giving a try on spot.The lady at the reception was answering calls when we asked for a table. I asked her that how come she is answering the calls now and over the weekend my calls went unanswered.You will be surprised to know the answer-" Madam actually we are booked till 28th Nov so we are unable to give bookings and hence maybe calls were not answered". Hats off to the management for giving such nice courtesy training to the staff for politely not answering the calls.I can suggest you a better advice, have the decency to answer the calls and state the issues which you have as you are not the only hotel in Kolkata. Well, finally we got a table as the restaurant was completely empty. Now the staff behavior, not consistent. Some people are extremely polite who will make you feel very comfortable but there was one waiter who was extremely rude.Now the food, the buffet spread is no doubt a value for money but there are more vegetarian dishes than non-veg. Dhokla and khakra were served as starters which was a bit shocking to me. The salad section had a very nice spread and i liked it.The cheese and breads were too good. Fear of getting full soon i did not taste all the breads.In the Asian section we just tried the chicken and fish starters which were amazing especially the fish.The prawn satay was too good but the chicken one I did not like much. We moved on to the Continental section.We ordered for a Penne pasta in white sauce , there was no choice for a non-veg one so had to have the veg one. But it was too good, I liked it.We had a chicken side dish and Italian rice. The Italian rice was too cheesy and creamy, awesome. The food from the live counters was very good. We had initially thought of skipping the Indian section and going to the desert section but we gave a second thought. The Indian section had fish paturi, chicken and mutton preparation which were good. The mutton had smell so I did not like it much but maybe some like this smell. The chicken was so soft that it melted in the mouth.Too good.The paneer preparation was also very tasty. The Nan was the best I have had so far, it was very soft.Now coming to the deserts.The apple pie was just yummy.Simply loved it.I do not remember the names of the rest of the desserts but all which I tasted were awesome.The best buffet desert I have experienced so far. I was so full I could not taste all. I regret that :(

So overall the food is great and the buffet spread is value for money(don't know if they increase the price later).But the staff needs some training to meet the 5 star standard.You need to provide a flawless experience.Looking forward to improvements if possible.Hence I would have given a VERY GOOD rating but considering it to be a 5 star rating I am giving it a GOOD rating.

Lovely ambience, awesome spread of salads mains and desserts is how I would sum up my experience there. Considering it has opened recently I would be willibgg to overlook the lacking service though - servers start with enthusiasm but loiter away later leaving heaps of plates on the table. Even the live counter is ill managed since the risotto we ordered did not reach us but we got extra portions of pasta instead! 
The salad spread is huge and the good part is that one can pick and choose and then mix with their preferred condiments. Starters are good. The hiney chilli potato was great and ran out of stock..the refilled version wasn't as good. Kababs were nice. Mutton biriyani had succulent boneless pieces. So was the main with gravy. Didnt taste the other mains. Desserts had a good spread and the chocolate icecream and mousse were very nice.
Overall with the ambience definitely worth a visit.

Went there for their buffet for sunday dinner. The place seems to be booked for long time but we somehow managed to get a table. I don't know where to start from about the food. Starting from excellent starters including several types of satay kebabs and Italian cold salads to gujrati delicacies they had it all. The main course consisted of Italian indian gujrati and Oriental and I only wished I could eat some more. The food is exceptional and the best I've had in any star rated hotels in kolkata. There were almost 15 types of deserts and I think I've counted less. I will definitely go back again and I'm so so sooooo happy that this place is offering such exquisite food at such affordable prices right now. A biiiig thumbs up!

Absolute disaster..Hotel is over booked, ridiculously understaffed..Ph lines don't go through for reservations..Plethora of guests keep arriving as there is a wedding or anniversary perpetually on..Visited Marriott in more than 15 locations worldwide and this has to be the worst experience by far..

A special occasion needed to be celebrated on a special place. Wanted to try this newly opened marriot as got a hint about it from a friend. Though i had a bad experience at chennai marriot, dunno whether they are of the same group. But this place as you enter mesmerizes with the dazzle. Being lucky as we got place in spite of not having any booking so i must say whoever goes get a booking.
Now coming to the food, we went for the dinner buffet which is ‚Çπ999 plus tax and i would say its worth.
Salad- a wide range from veg and non veg, particularly liked salami salad.
Starter- liked the achari chicken and fish fry, also tandoori paneer.
Indian section- lot of dishes from dal baati churma, dal makhani but as always i went for the non veg dishes , liked laal maas as well as kancha lonka murgi, very very tasty
Oriental section- live noodles counter plus momos, though veg momos only were there
Continental section- bassa brocolli as well as tamarind chicken , i liked the mushroom aubergines too, pasta didnt try
The food i didnt touch also was the gujrati as well as chat section, both looked good though
Desserts- i must say the best  dessert section i ever had in my life , may be 30 items were there from french apple tart to ice cream , a heaven of sweet tooth
A blissful night and i would love to come back just for the sweet dishes, amazing experience what i had.

So after a long wait, visited the newly opened Kitchen.
The courteous and very friendly staff welcomes with a smile and help you walk through the Kitchen neatly explaining about every detail about it .

Coming to the interior, it's gorgeous yet simple.Full marks to it !
The restaurant mainly serves buffet at a very affordable price and you will certainly get bowled over by seeing the widespread of food . Asian,Thai,Indian, Chinese,Italian everything under one roof ! Ample varieties to chose from. 
Starting from veg to non veg items available, nothing will disappoint you. Don't miss the fruits section either. The exotic fruits are quite awesome. Name any fruit and they'll serve it to you in no time.
Special mention to their dessert section. It's to die for. So many varieties. Indian desserts to pastries to cupcakes. The list is endless! 

Personally I loved the Italian and dessert section. The chef will note down what you will like to eat and the way you would like it to be. They will prepare the pasta,penne or ravioli that particular way ! You just need to quote your table number and they'll serve the personalised dishes at your table. 

In all,excellent buffet place.Total value for money.Looking forward to the next visit when Vintage Asia opens !
Well,I deducted .5 because the fish preparations were not satisfying. It could be bettered.

Food was awesone,
But it was confusing wheather the food was veg or non veg.
They had printed veg/non veg mark in black & white paper. 
Now even 5 start hotel cannt afford color prining. :p

Visited this place a few days ago with my family. Have to say that I rather we were really very impressed with whatever this place had to offer. 
We had opted for the lunch buffet. Needless to say that the food was scrumptious. 
Ambience was very  cozy and comfortable. 
Special mention to the service. Extra points for them. It was very prompt and polite. No complains whatsoever. 
Thumbs up üëç

Ecstatic. Humongous buffet spread for Lunch. I have not experienced such anywhere in recent times...and authentic taste. Perhaps no cuisine has been left out. So tempting that can't leave out any item. Loved it üòç

To start with, the place looks swanky enough. Though, somewhere it reminded me of an airport. :) Not really a complaint, and doesn't in any way influence my overall experience.

Coming to hospitality, the attendants were warm, cordial and helpful, always with a smile and fairly prompt to help patrons out.

With these out of the way let's get to the food. We opted for the dinner buffet spread. The spread itself was huge, looked delicious and was modestly priced at 999 plus taxes( probably an introductory offer of sorts not sure ). I'll provide a rating on each of the small subset of items I tried from the spread.

Starters: There weren't a lot of options to choose from here. Three kinds of kebab, mutton chicken and paneer respectively and a few varieties of dimsums.
The chicken kebab was decent(3/5)
The paneer was soft but not flavorful(2/5)
The mutton kebab was hard enough that I had to give up on eating it after a few minutes of wrestling with it with the knife(0/5).

There was also a wide array of salads and cold cuts. The smoked chicken and eggplant salad was mildly flavoured and tasty enough(4/5). The rest( I tried a few) were pretty meh.The prawns were stiff and fish smelled, well, fishy.

Main course: There was a lamb stew that really stood out simply because the meat was cooked to melt in my mouth perfection(4.5/5).
Had requested for pasta from the live counter. They'd definitely taken al dente a bit too seriously(1/5)

I also tried white rice( slightly undercooked for my taste but that varies from person to person ) with paneer( this one was very tasty: 4.5/5 ) and dal makhni( too bland for my taste 1/5 ).
The main course spread was huge so there might have been many other items which are superb but I never got around to trying them.

Getting to desserts, the array was again quite large and had equal and sizeable options in both Indian and western choices.
One complaint: Please put name tags on your desserts JW Kitchen.I found there were a lot of items without tags reducing my friend to suggesting me to try " that yellow cheesecake like thingy". Not very convenient. :)

There was a vanilla pistachio cheesecake( naming it myself due to above mentioned reason) that was good( 3.5/5), a coconut mango pastry that stood out(4/5), a strawberry flavoured pastry(sickly sweet 1/5) and gulab jamun( cold and stiff 1/5) that I tried. Again, there were lots of choices and I might have missed out on something really good but desserts did not really stand out for me.

Finally, on the chef's recommendation we tried a mocktail that was outside the buffet menu, again modestly priced at 250 a glass. It was a green colored drink with indian spices along the glass rim. It tasted like the ill planned progeny of sprite, excess sugar and mint toothpaste( Couldn't finish this one. 0/5 )

Overall:
Ambience 4/5
Hospitality 4.5/5
Food 1.5/5

P.s. I get to visit my home city just once a year mostly and was really looking forward to the JW Kitchen experience. Overall I feel kind of let down.

P.p.s. All personal opinions obviously!

Was there on a weekend for dinner buffet and the spread was lavish with Indian,Asian and Continental options.The starters were really good barring the fish which was not upto the mark.The Italian dishes were good too especially the pasta.The dal makhni was fabulous too but when it comes to the desserts section I think it wins hands down.With everything from eclairs to ice creams to sweets to mousse to brulee just brilliant.Reasonably priced,nice ambience,friendly staff and good service.I would recommend it.Keep it up!

The place was great.The hotel was huge.I went there was a Monday lunch.It costed me ‚Çπ899+taxes for a buffet.The variety was good.Although the Asian counter wasnt that well.The dessert counter was mesmerizing. The chefs and the waiters were very well mannered but as soon as the clock struck three it was like they were forcing us to leave.But all in all the food was really tasty for a vegetarian. As for something new in Kolkata it is definitely worth a shot.

JW Marriott ultimately opened in Kolkata. I am a Mumbaikar who came for a brief family visit to Kolkata. I love good food and a being a frequent face at JW Marriott, Juhu, I decided to bump into the newly launched Kolkata version. My experience started with the reservation which I found out was already sold out till 21st November. When I gave my introduction about my profile, I got the reservation. Fina and thanks. Now, today me and my school mate came for lunch and we looked around the menu. The food seems good, nice posh decor and extremely reasonably priced.¬† 

I opted for Brunch buffet priced around 1200 bucks and my friend opted for Salmon with Lemon Butter. In the buffet, salad were good. In soup, there was only Lung Fung Soup which was nice. In the Kebabs, the fish Kebab was awful with it's fishy smell. Good were their Asian live cooking counter, Thai items, and some of the Indian meat items. The best of all items was the Thai Veg Green Curry. It was the BEST. Two fish items in the buffet - Amritsari Machchhi and Herb Crusted Bhetki was awfully bad with raw fishy smell which indicated that they were not marinated. In Indian, Mutton Tariwala and Chicken Biryani was good. The dessert counter had a huge array of desserts and all of them were good. Till now, so far so good.

The bill came which was reasonable Rs 2107 all inclusive.¬† Fine. But now for their payment, I was not carrying much cash and as usual, I gave my card. I normally use my Public sector bank card which in it's entire lifetime never saw a transaction being declined. Their machine declined twice. Then I took out another card and this time it was my Rupay card. This transaction was also declined. I was awestruck and my thinking process stopped completely. A never before experience of my life. I will always remember my Kolkata Marriott intro experience. In the current situation of Currency Surgical Strike, I kept my friend seated over there and rushed to nearest ATM. After combing out entire south Kolkata, I got a Stan Chart ATM which rescued me out of this situation. I reached sooner and paid it. NOW, the main thing, the staff at Marriott vehemently denied that they have problem at their payment terminals. But they do they have problems. Being new, their terminals only accept Diner, JCB, Visa, and Amex cards. The payment terminals are not tuned to accept Desi bank cards. In Kolkata, it is the public sector bank cards that are in circulation maximum, unlike in Mumbai. After revealing to the GM, that I know the owners of JW Marriott Juhu in person, they became suddenly aware and started to be nice to me. Anyways, it was a very embarrassing situation as I felt bad for my friend who kept waiting for me and tolerated the staff's so called 'niceness'. If I visit Kolkata in future again, I can't give guarantee that I will visit again Marriott.

Was there to mark my presence on the inaugural night.A gala night.The buffet offers an array of cuisines to choose from and most of the dishes are served custom made at your table,ready to pamper your taste buds.From Indian to Italian everything had its distinct flair and a lasting effect.We had Pasta, Ravioli from the Italian counter,freshly delivered on our table.And we raided the Indian counters as well which offered an ocean of mouth-watering Indian Street food.The hospitality was outstanding and service as quick as it could be.But hands down, it was the desserts counter that steals the show for a person having a soft corner for sweets. It ranged from traditional Indian sweetmeats to delicious dessert shooters. Every bite that sped down my throat left a content and pleased curve on my face and some delicacies pushing my eyebrows to arch upwards in stark amazement.Eternal Bliss. I highly recommend a dining experience at this opulent hotel.
