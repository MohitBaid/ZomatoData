Painfully Slow Service. Everything takes 40 mins to cook. Even a Chicken Manchow Soup, leave aside any Tandoor Item. Have been to this restuarant thrice in a month due to logistical issues and all the three times have faced the same problem of poor service. Its a major embarrasment when your own guests start complaining of such a shoddy service. 
Food is good though, the only saviour for the restaurant.

I am writing this review after my second visit to Kaviar because
 first visit at late night after watching Under-17 football world cup final couldn't satisfy my food cravings fully after going through the menu card!!  
Beatifully decorated Kaviar is actually WB Govt.
 initiative and probably meat lover's paradise with so many diversity from Haringhata firm products.In two days we actually had Tandoori Quail,Roasted duck,Turky patiala,Duck dakbanglow accompanied with butter nan. For sweet tooth we had tutti fruity,Choclete ice cream and Hot gulab jamun. Each & every item is very delicious and must try for meat lovers those who are ready to experiment. 
Lastly the less pocket pinch and courteous staff...additionally if
 you want to take away some raw products from Haringhata firm like Quail egg,Frozen meat or Ghee..it's available in ground floor store.

This place is located quite inside Salt Lake but is definitely a very decent place. This place is an excellent initiative by the WB government n they serve products of Haringhata. They serve various types of meat. The staff here are very courteous. The ambiance and decoration is  pretty decent and the food is also good. The price is also very reasonable. Overall a good place to visit.

When I dream up a secret haven adequately supplied with all my comfort amenities, the food from Kaviar is a must on my list. That is how much I love this place. The typical Bangali appayon of their friendly staff makes you feel at home and the excellence of the chef working the magic in the kitchen brings that added feel good factor. The food here is not out-of-the-world, it is everything in combination that earns that adjective, the callous government planning behind the technicalities of this restaurant included (they forgot to add Mongolian rice in their final menu and it happens to be one of their most popular dishes). Now even this attitude being typically native to Bengal feels funny and I laugh with this awkward frustration. So Kaviar feels like an extension of my culture, my habits, myself at times and eventually they are so good at what they do, I end up loving them for their shortcomings. No matter how nonchalant the government is in addressing some of the issues troubling Kaviar or may be just too overwhelmed with its reception (you hardly expect a government venture to be this good and it has its flaws that way - a government satisfied with the much it's doing and feels no need for further improvement) but despite of everything, I love Kaviar and the credit for what it is truly goes to the person/people behind the stove and the staff who always greet you with a smile. Kaviar could happily be my Boroline, to be appreciated for ages without any change, because of being so originally good. The renovation it recently underwent is much appreciated but a washroom on the same floor as the restaurant would have been a blessing!

Excellent Food, Excellent staffs, Excellent Initiative by Government of West Bengal (Meat lovers paradise)

History: Animal resources development department of Govt. of West Bengal has long been helping rural people in rearing livestock animals and helping in their growth and sell. The major unit of this department is the West Bengal Milk federation whose product is the famous Haringhata milk. Haringhata also started selling frozen meat items from their stalls after 2011. However, in 2014 or 2015, an welcome initiative was taken by the dept. to sell the Haringhata meat in cooked format. The dream-child of that initiative is Kaviar - the experimental project of the dept. If this succeeds we can hope to see more such outlets across the state.

Food: As is evident from my rating above, I am totally bowled over by their food. Be it their quail egg devil, quail kosha, rabbit, lamb, turkey or the emu (which u might get if u are lucky enough), I am totally fan of their meat items. The food quality is very very well maintained with enough ingredients and ample quantity. The Chinese and Mughlai items available here are both good, but still I would say that the mughlai items are slightly better than their chinese counterparts. 

Ambience: Located near the RBI staff quarter, close to the Sports Authority of India on the Saltlake bypass, this place is a bit hidden from the main road. One has to trust google maps and reach this place. The interiors are simple but well maintained. With a seating capacity of around 20 people, this restaurant also sells the others products of Haringhata like fresh honey, butter etc. Clean plates, with a rose kept on each table, this place actually tries to make a difference in the way government initiatives are seen in the country.

Staffs: The staffs are extremely well behaved and very very helpful. They tries to make ur visit a memorable one and leaves no stone unturned on their effort to make it so. Cash and card are accepted. No system of tips are allowed. Parking is available. 

Overall: Definitely recommended. Please do visit and make this initiative a grand success. Awesome place  for meat lovers.

Came here with my colleagues during lunch break. There were 8 of us and we ordered Chicken Biriyani, Fish butter masala, Chicken Bharta, Veg chow and Fish thali.
Firstly, service was too slow (we were pretty late in reaching office after lunch!)
Secondly, the Fish thali was served in installments which was highly dissapointing. Items like Posto and fish came after my friend finished his rice and chutney! So he had to order rotis again. And when we were just about to get up, the waiter came up with one gulab jamun (included in the thali).
Food was good though, but service was extremely poor and hence the poor rating.

It was an official programme of librarian day and this place got the sponsorship. They order almost 10k packets of chicken biryani. As we were a part of the programme we bought some. Biryani is a thing that no one has to introduce itself. And about the taste, I have to say that it was completely delicious 😋. The rice of the biryani was so soft and boiled well. The chicken pieces were soft and succulent too. It was not so oily, but not fully dry. Less spicy still mouth watering. Even I felt that the potato given with it was delicious too😂. They put some "alu bukhare" pickle with it which made it more tasty. Thumbs up for the biryani because this is the only thing that I've tried. surely wanna try some other things here.

It's very surprising for me that a place like Kaviar exists so close to me, but haven't tasted their special meat items until yesterday! We had planned a birthday party over there.

Service and Ambiance: We had a prior table reservation for a large group and they arranged tables for us well before we reached. :) Place was not much crowded as it was a weekday and it is located a bit far from the main road. Throughout our course of meal we received very well behaved, coordinated and friendly service. Moreover they had decorated the cake, played birthday songs to make our celebration more lively. Kudos to the Kaviar team. :)
Ambiance was nice as well, small but well maintained place.

Food: "Kaviar's Specials" in the menu were the items we were craving for. We tried Tandoori Quail, Tandoori Chooza, Achari Murgh tikka, Assorted Chicken Platter in the starters and Kaviar special Noodles, Peas polao, Duck Dak Bungalow, Turkey Patiawala, Chilly Fish in the main course. Starters were all really tasty, though tandoori and tikka items were bit spicy and the mashala tastes somewhat same. Duck Dak Bungalow and Special Noodles should be sought after. Peas Polao was very tasty and rich in ghee. Turkey Patiwala is another nice preparation which is a bit sweet and good for a change in taste. I was disappointed with the Chilly fish though! Not upto the expectation.

Pocket Pinch: The quality and quantity both are great as per the cost. It was a great dinner for us without any dissatisfaction regarding value for money. Cost for two is around Rs 900, fair enough!

Verdict:

Food: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5
Value for money: 4.5/5

Had been to this place few times.. Not a superb ambience but obviously a nice one..plus the food is expected to be fresh and healthy..I had chicken cutlet, fish fry (my favourite), fish finger, duck meat, chicken, quail, Vita eggs from here.. Since these days we find issues with different my restaurants, we read in newspapers that they provide stale meat and other rotten raw materials so I think we can already trust this place.
Cheers to the team and the waiters.. They are really friendly and easy to talk to !!

When you are supposed to go for a walk to burn calories and end up having an early supper you know the place is worth a visit, or several. Well Kaviar has been that joint for me. It's near my home and the alley leading to it is perfect for quaint little strolls. Sadly for my diet regime, the strolls mostly end up in elaborate feasts. Their food never gave me the slightest enthusiasm to restrain myself. The North Indian affair is recommended and they make some of the best Indian bread preparations. Also the staff is caring, something that can't be said about a lot of government run joints. The "uber" foodies might want to try their exotic meat and poultry platter. I can vouch that one isn't likely to be disappointed unless they are fussier than one of my favourite Mr. Jerome's Uncle Podger...

Kaviar was in my wish list for quite sometime & finally decided to visit this place today . For residents of Salt Lake who are acquainted with different blocks of township finding this place will not be a problem but for non residents it may be a bit tricky . People entering into Salt Lake from EM bypass via Beleghata more ( building more) take the right turn from the SAI Complex traffic signal & drive straight towards the Lohapool ( bridge over the drainage canal ) - Kaviar is on the right-hand side of the road . If you are entering via Chingrihata then cross the Jadavpur University Campus to reach the Lohapool then take the left-hand turn & Kaviar is on the left side of the road . It's a small yet cosy restaurant . Decoration is simple , neat & clean.The staffs are really nice & try to help with the best of their knowledge .Coming to the food we tried the following :
Fresh Lime Soda : The presentation is nicely done , tastewise OK type .
Tandoori Quail : One of their signature & most popular dish . It contains 2 pieces of perfectly cooked Quail. One word to describe it - HEAVENLY . With right amount of spices , onions & pudina sauce it was simply out of this world . 
Butter Nun : Usual type , is a good combination with other side dishes .
Turkey Masala : Another stunning preparation . It contains 4 pieces of Turkey with gravy . It is oily but the taste is mouthwatering . Meat was nicely cooked & came out of the bones without any effort . The synergy of butter nun & turkey masala was just awesome .
Szechwan Hakka Noodles : The portion is quite large & had generous amount of egg  & Chicken with vegetables . Tastewise it was average .
Kung Pao Chicken : Contains 8 pices of fairly big sized boneless chicken . Gravy was again average .
Bhuna Rabbit was unavailable as they had gone out of stock . 
From my experience I got the impression that they are brilliant when it comes to their specialities but lags a bit when it comes to Chinese though the effort must be commended .
Will definitely come back to try other signature dishes in future . 
Highly recommended for their specialities .

Kaviar - by Haringhata meat shop is a great initiative by the W.B government. Its like heaven for meat lovers. Alongwith the availability of regular chicken and fish, here you can get exquisite rare meats like Quail, Emu,Turkey and Rabbit.
So this gem is located at Saltlake, Sector 3. Interior is nice and cozy. The staffs are so corteous. They will help you in giving their generous advice like about their speciality in ordering the foods, even after completion of the meal about the quality and if there is any mistake. So a thumbs up in service.
Now coming to the food i wished to have Rabbit Bhuna but the attendant told that right now rabbit is not available. So tried their other signature dishes.

*CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUP (1:2) - The amount was really good. Chinly pieces of chicken with corns gave my pallate a soothing taste. (4.5/5)
*TANDOOR QUAIL (2 pieces)- A must must have dish. I had quail quite a few time back. But this innovative tandoor quail took away my heart. Its fiery chilly flavoured. So good. The quail was served with onion slices and pudina chutney. The amount of each and every masala was so perfect that brings a big smile. (5/5)
*TURKEY PATIWALA WITH PLAIN NAAN- Huge sized patiwala. Big chunks of turkey meat wrapped in an egg on a bed of white sauce and cream alongwith small pieces of meat,chilly slices. The patiwala goes perfect with naan. This dish was quite v.sweet for me. That's totally my personal opinion. As i am not v.fond of sweet flavoured dishes. (4/5)
So our total bill was Rs 795.32. Quite reasonable for such rare dishes.
Altogether a must try for foodies who want to try out new dishes. And yes they even sell raw meats. So cheers peeps. 😊

This is my 2nd visit over here. So directly going about the fooding details.
●MIXED FRIED RICE comprised of ample amount of chicken pieces, prawns, scrambled eggs and veggies. The amount is more than enough for 2 people. Tastes good.
●LAMB KASHA - 4 chunky pieces of tender lamb served with spicy gravy. Liked the flavour of tomatoes in it.Compliments the fried rice well.
●TURKEY MASHALA- Again a good dish that complimented the rice. The gravy was spicy. It was garnished with egg slices and peas.
Our total bill was Rs 903.
Kaviar is such a delight. Yes will visit again 😊

My personal favourite for raw meat specially chicken . They sell chicken, mutton, rabbit, quail, emu, pork, duck everything! Have tried their raw pork which was really good quality meat. Quail eggs are fun too. They have a restaurant as well, very easy to locate, situated on the main road near tank 16, Saltlake. It's a basic restaurant with good food. I must appreciate their quality and quantity. Service and behaviour both are equally good. So people living nearer to this  place can give a try!

The availability of emu, quail , turkey , rabbit and other meat at reasonable pricing was the reason i wanted to visit Kaviar. Since rabbit is banned , decided to try the TANDOORI QUAIL and and ASSORTED CHICKEN PLATTER .
The tandoori quail is a must try dish here, lipsmacking marianation of the poultry meat grilled to perfection. The chicken platter had chicken popcorn , sausages, nuggets tossed in a spicy and tangy sauce , it was a great starter as well.
The staff support is great , giving proper guidance through the menu .
The interiors are simple and decent , with roses on each table , a row of artificial flowers bordering the window glass panes .

Very much satisfied with our first dining experience , i strongly recommend other foodies to visit Kaviar.
Cheers ✌️

Governmental arrangement to great success!
A meat lovers paradise with rare birds like turkey ,quail available along with rabbit and normal fish items possible.
Ambience is good only if the big tv could be shut down. Sitting arrangements are unique with plush seats and decorative tables and faux flower arrangements. Staff are really courteous so ask abt quality after every meal and about problems at every step.
Had malai chicken kabab, smooth creamy right amount of sweetness! Tandoori quail was also great, whole game bird was cooked with indian style masala and served whole. Mixed hongkong noodles was a bit down as was stuffed with dried red chilli which could be less. Hunan prawns served with gravy was again delicious. Lastly a large tutty frutty satisfied dessert cravings.
Location is a little awkward and difficult to find but its a great place requires advertisement and maybe more branches.

Oh, my! I am positively bewildered right now. I hadn't expected to find a restaurant such as Kaviar where I found it. Restaurants like these suit fancy expensive places such as Park Street or Southern Avenue, not some forlorn lane in desolate Sector 3. But well, I can say that I am happily flummoxed that I found this one. Kaviar, in one word, is admirable.

First of all, they serve one of the most exquisite varieties of meat in Kolkata. Quail, Emu, Turkey, Rabbit, you don't find delicacies like that in every corner, even in a food paradise such as Kolkata. That alone scores a big brownie point. Secondly, the place is damn cheap. If you can afford to eat at a decent restaurant anywhere in the city, you can easily afford this one. No fire in your pockets tonight, Sir.

I had ordered a Quail Tandoori for starters, Duck Dak Bungalow, and Butter Naan for the main course. This was my first time eating Quail and I was glad that I chose this dish. The meat was extremely delicate, full of juices, and very aromatic. Loved every bite of it. It was definitely better than plain old Chicken Tandoori. 
The Duck preparation was a little too oily for my taste but given its Mutton-ish texture, I think that might have been necessary. The gravy accompanying the duck was very rich. It went perfectly well with the butter naan which in itself was very smooth. 

The ambience of the place is nothing extraordinary but that is excusable given its location. The service was very good with the head server there checking up every few minutes or so to enquire about the food. And reiterating, the place is damn cheap. If looking for novel prey to feast upon, Kaviar is the place to be.

Kaviar, an initiative by Haringhata Meat, is owned by the WB Government itself. An earnest venture, that provides delicacies at pocket friendly prices, and you get to select your meat from a wide range of options too.
Apart from chicken and mutton, they also serve pork, lamb and duck, and they have also introduced newer variety of meat to the ever-hungry Bengali, like turkey, emu, quail and rabbit!
This being my first visit, I tried Quail tandoori for starters. It was awesome, quite like chicken, only much smaller and leaner, served with a tasty pudina chutney. For main course, it was Turkey Patiala, with butter naan. The dish was extremely tasty, a bit too buttery where minced turkey was served, wrapped within an omelette, in a thick cashew based gravy!
Would like to try rabbit and emu next time.

Guys, I feel cheated. This was a new year Sunday evening. I ordered for a New Year special dish, Roasted turkey. They charged Rs.900 for only 4-5 small, bony pieces, with merely any flesh on them. This is no way to do business...! I am disappointed!

Ordered chilly fish special, chicken butter masala and peas pulao last Friday. The food was delivered piping hot and very well packed. The delivery man was very well behaved. Coming to the food, I did not have such tender and juicy chicken in recent times. The chicken pieces were big, and tandoored before putting n the gravy. The chilly fish was made of pure bhetki, 8 large pieces and  very well prepared. The peas pulao was cooked with very good quality basmati rice, with the right amount of oil, lots of kaju and kishmish. Special thanks to Kaviar for such lovely food. Looking forward to order again.

This is a great initiative taken by the livestock department of WB government. Be it variety, quality, service quality or affordability - this place stands out. From the less frequently tried Tandoori Quail to the ever so common chicken sweet corn soup, Kaviar speaks out excellence. The duck meat served here is by far the most tender and juicy duck meat that I've ever tried.
The staff is also very welcoming. Unlike most government owned places, the staff here will actually make u feel like coming back.
Along with the restaurant part, the cold cuts section is also excellent. They sell very high quality meat and other stuff at the most compelling prices.
I think for anyone who loves meat and wants to expand the horizons of their culinary experience, Kaviar is a must try.

This Haringhata meat shop turned restaurant run by Livestock Development Corporation of WB govt has turned out to be a real winner for me. Though they serve exotic items like rabbit, quail, turky but I didn't have the courage to try those, instead I ordered common items like fish fingers,  chicken tikka masala, bhuna mutton, masala kulchas, ordered via swiggy. To my utter surprise all the items turned out to be absolutely wonderful, delight to the taste buds. The fish and meats were so fresh and soft and wonderful that almost melted in the mouth and the kulchas were different but very good. order was delivered within 40 mins , thats also a plus point. After having a wonderful experience with the common items im really eager to taste their exotic meat items also, hopefully they will be as good as well. Keep up the good work.

They offer different speciality meats which are not commonly avialable in Kolkata.Ordered a tandoori quail and kashimiri pulao for home delivery.Quantity of the pulao was nice but the fruits used in the pulao was overcooked and mushy.The overall taste was good but the texture was not very nice.Next the quail,which I was quite excited to try,the tandoori marinade was very well incorporated in the meat.It tastes very similar to chicken,the bones are very fine and the meat contains minimum fat.Will be looking forward to try tge rabbit and emu.

Their Tandoori quail is top notch followed by their bhuna rabbit.

Well, I could not stop myself from Reviewing Kaviar. This is a great attempt by WB Government in terms of promoting  our strength (Dairy,Farming Product) as well as making a great place for foodies .
Let me start with the looks, it's well decorated and seating arrangement is also good ,you will not belive initially that it's a Govt Project .
Extremely well behaved staff ,atleast 2 I have seen heard and experienced. 
Now the major USP , it's their food and menu , well from Quail Kabab to Duck Roast , Rabit ,Emu , You will get all such unconventional food item which is considered majorly as food of villages . Not only that they have gone ahead and making it a selling point of all Haringhata Product like raw meat, pork,chicken and their ready to cook items.
If you talk about price I find it economical . 
I had Quail Kabab ,Fish Fry (As expected fish to be fresh) ,Fresh Lime & Soup . Let me tell you all are up to expectation . However as expected FishFry is exceptionally good . Quail I tried first time which is soft and tasty. Some glimpse to make you hungry ☺
