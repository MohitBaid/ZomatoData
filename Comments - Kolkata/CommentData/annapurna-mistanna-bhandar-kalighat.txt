Average kinda sweet shop among the thousands that are widespread here and there in Kolkata. The sweets are okayish, so are the samosas and kachoris. Have been here once. No plans as such to repeat this place. That's it!

The sweet shop just next to my college. Have numerous fun-filled memories. Had sweets, lassi, alur torkari kochuri, sweets so many times. Was more of a hangout place.
