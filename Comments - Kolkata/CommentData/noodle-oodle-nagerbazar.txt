This is very close to my home and I have been more than about 10 times. This is an absolute delight to have authentic Chinese dishes. The special mixed fried rice along with its hunan chicken garlic chicken are absolute delicacies and yummy. I recommend this place to one and all.

Talking about the food here, it seems they maintained the authenticity of preparations, without much experimentation to impress and satisfy Indian palate.
 The service was fast with the staff being very attentive and polite. The preparation was definitely impressive and praiseworthy and to maintain such nutritive and quality standards is really commendable. Quantity was surplus and superb quality ingredients were used which was evident from the taste and all these  at very reasonable prices. Thanks for a delicious food experience, keep it up the wonderful service you’ve got an ardent fan in me! Keep it up such an overwhelming service. Many Many Thanks to Apurba Chatterjee for his kindness towards us .

Located just opposite to Diamond plaza mall, this restaurant has some delicious Chinese dishes to offer. The ambience is really good and can attract customers from the outside, with colourful chinese lanterns hanging inside. Food is really delicious but service was really pathetic. Had to wait atleast 40mins for just 2 plates of Mixed fried rice and Garlic chicken. Price is a bit high.
Ambience and food are the only plus point.That's all.

I just visited this place tonight with my family. This is a very simply decorated place with a sober yet bright settings playing Chinese music in the background. We had Smoked Chicken and Lat me Kai as starters. Both were good specially the second one was damn good. For main course we had Noodle Oodle Special mixed Fried Rice,Noodle Oodle Special mixed Noodles and Fish in Oyster Sauce. All the items were very good and tasted great. Quantity is good and price is very reasonable.

The whole place is decorated against a red shade, umm okay okay ambiance.
One plate of each item is sufficient for two. The place is very pocket friendly I must say. Worth give it a try.

I visited this restaurant with great expectations but was very much disappointed. Although the decoration is good, they delay a lot to serve. I ordered smoky chicken which was very salty and then I ordered Chopsey which was fine but the quantity was very less. I'll never get back to this restaurant again.

Dinner at NOODLE OODLE last  Sunday-Pan fried noodles (veg), Smoked Chicken,crispy chilli baby corn,  Veg Manchurian, NOODLE OODLE special mixed fried rice, Chicken Pad Thai, Kung Pao Chicken, fresh lime soda,masala coke, honey noodles with almond flakes and ice-cream. 

Now coming to the quality of the food.... crispy chilli baby corn , mixed fried rice,Kung Pao chicken,veg Manchurian,Pad Thai, pan fried noodles and smoked chicken was really good. Dessert was good but the amount of ice-cream could have been increased considering the price that was charged for it. 

The waiter served smoked lamb instead of chicken and when pointed out there was no apology. As if it was normal to make such a mistake. That was a little disturbing for us.

Washroom needs serious cleaning. The wash basin was clogged with food remnants. 

Overall if you just consider the taste and quantity of food .....a big thumbs up.👍👍👍👍👍👍

This place looks beautiful from a distance of Diamond Plaza. Chinese lit lanterns hanging from the roof creates an wonderful ambient dining that can be seen while passing by, this is what attracted me the most about this place.

This branch of Noodle Oodle isn't very old. Sittings were comfortable & ambiance of the dining was pleasant.

Service was very pathetic I would say, it took me quite a while to make them understand that I've purchased vouchers online. As soon they understood it their behaviour suddenly changed, I didn't got any justification for that.

Although full portion of every dish was mentioned in that deal, they served only half portion saying that is what they serve for voucher. This bad scheme is done either by the restaurant or little to attract people at first & then fool them.

Noodle-Oodle Special Chicken Hakka Noodles : 
This were thick noodles, very well mixed with spices and vegitables. In vegitables mostly zucchini was present. Small chicken pieces felt okey. Overall it was tasty.

Chicken Manchurian : 
6 pieces of chicken, soft, juicy and well marinated into dark spicy & tangy gravy with mild flavour of Manchurian tasted very nice. Somehow this item wasn't present on their menu card, I ordered this by seeing it on what people love  section on Zomato.

Apart from this, we took 2 soft drinks that was served simply in a glass.

Noodle Oodle doesn't redefine Chinese cuisine experiance but their approach is quite nice. Food quality is enough good to enjoy but their service can definitely be improved.

Went to noodle oodle as I was hungry and wanted to eat Chinese. I heard about this place before but never got an opportunity.
Today, went there. The ambience is awesome. One will feel like he's in any place of JAPAN. 
Ordered Seafood Wanton Soup, Chicken Drums of Heaven, Noodle Oodles Special Hakka Noodles and a side dish of Lamb. 
The food was too good and the quantity was more than enough. 
Side dish had pieces of 10. Soup was tasty. 
One should visit if want to have Chinese.

Located just opposite of Diamond Plaza, this place definitely a reason for you to smile if you're a Chinese lover and Noodle Oodle is one for you! Being an in and out Chinese and Asian cuisine lover, this place didn't disappoint me at all. It has an eye-pleasing decor, a brightly lit place which will no doubt lift up your mood. A nice choice for couples to have a date here! 😉 Coming to the food we had "Mixed Burnt Garlic Butter Fried Rice" and "Chicken Tossed with Hunan Sauce". The chicken dish was mouth-watering and sumptuous. And the fried rice was also tasty. The quantity was much more than we expected. The staffs were nice. Overall a good experience. Would recommend this restaurant for sure!

A pure Chinese restaurant with nice ambience and music. Food quality and quantity is good. Pocket friendly. 
Ordered 1. Smokey Chicken - tested heavenly. If you like smokey flavour with honey mixed sauce then this should be a must try. Recommend!!
2. Burned garlic butter rice veg - good in taste. You can actually feel the flavour of burned garlic.
3. Kun pao kai chicken - average in taste. Nothing more than a simple garlic chicken with cashew nuts and bel papers.
Overall nice experience will surely visit this restaurant again.

So another chinesse joint ticked off from the list.Just opposite of the Diamond plaza,it's on the second floor.entering the stair ways we have a glass locked laughing Buddha attending us,With some dragon pics & all.First impression of the staff it self made me upset.we had already booked a table for 5 when we entered the attendants were either too confuse to approach us or they had some other things going on mind, finally I asked one of them about a booked table they didn't even knew where to accommodate us first they pointed us to a table,later they suddenly got the brain jolted with lighting & got Thier sences back & placed us to the right table.Even they were very sloppy during taking the order they didn't even knew what they have in there own menu,we asked for pad thai noodles which comes only in chicken but they with the flow asked if they can served it in mix.So for service it's just 2 out of 5. Coming to the interior some Chinese pics & the celling was full of Chinese lantern with some simple Chinese instrumental music.so a 3 out of 5.Coming to the foods now for starters we had smoked chicken, konjee crispy lamb & chicken manchow soup.so the smoked chicken was really nice a bit on the sweet side but was good to balance it the lamb was bit spicy.The soup was also good & balanced it was complimented with crispy egg noodles.For main course we had Burn garlic butter fried rice, Noodle Oodle special fried rice,Pad thai chicken noodles, chicken in choice of your sauce (hunan) & PLA Nung manow.. they all good except for the veggies in PLA Nung Manow were bit raw.so a 4 out of 5.
But at last again disaster striked when we asked for the bill, we intended on paying by card but hopefully their machine was not working properly for which they gave excuse of I was giving wrong pin & all.so I would really appreciate improvement on their service.

This restaurant is just opposite of Diamond Plaza Mall. We visited the place last Sunday ( a week back) for dinner and my wife & I had a good time over here. We ordered a 'chicken corn soup', 'Fried fish Mongolian style' & 'Cantonese noodles' and I must say that all the items were very tasty. Specialy the fish item was just awesome. We both liked it a lot. Their service was also good. I can't give 5 out 5 as we find their staffs r not very well trained - initially they have choosen a table for us & after some time they asked us to move to some other table. This should not happen. & They don't accept Amex card as well. But overall it is a good restaurant..

Well, it so happened that one fine sunday we(me and hubby) decided to dine and this new restro(to us though). Sunday being a Sunday, thr restro was fully packed. We were too hungry to wait yet our patience skills proved us good at it. The restro 's interior has been done against a red tone. There are chinese wall posters and chinese styled lanterns hanging overall giving it an  up to that. Comig to food, we ordered seafood wonton soup, chicken lollypop and panfried chicken noodles. The soup wasnt that special and could not keep up to its name. But, the chicken lollypop and panfried noodles compensated heavily for that soup. The noodles were correcty fried, not overcooked nor undercooked. We left the place with a smile to visit again last night. We went for chicken sweet corn soup, noodle oodle special fried rice and kung pao chicken in white garlic sauce. And none of them disappointed us! Great place for great chinese food👍

Noodle Oodle comes to the rescue.
The interior gives typical Chinese ambience with red lanterns hung from the ceiling.

Service was very slow even when the restaurant was empty.
They took almost 10minutes to take the order.
Food was lip-smackingly good.

1.Kung Pao Kai- Gravy is heavenly, with roasted cashewnuts and spring onion.
2.Noodle Oodle Special Fried Rice- Egg wrapped rice. And you get egg, lamb, chicken, prawn together.
The best part about this restaurant.

Quantity was too less for the price.
Average experience altogether.

Noodle Oodle is a Chinese restaurant located just opposite to Diamond Plaza Mall,on Jessore Road. It is quite convenient to locate.

The interiors are beautifully decorated. The ceiling has magnificent lanterns which give the typical Chinese ambience. The instrumental music which they played adds up to the atmosphere. The ambience ,in one word, stole our hearts 💓

Coming to the food,we ordered the following.

|| Starters ||

√ Smoked Chicken : This tasted delicious. It was generous amount of chicken pieces and the gravy was amazing. This was mainly a spicy dish. But only one complaint,the taste of the garlic sauce was a tad bit more than it should have been.

|| Main Course ||

√ Kung Pao Kai : This was a slight sweet and slight spicy dish. This was also really good. The chicken pieces were a bit undercooked.

√ Noodle Oodle Special Noodles (Chicken) : This was really great. They give a generous amount of chicken and veggies. Recommended !!

|| Desserts ||

√ Honey Date with Raisins : This is an innovative dessert. They fry the wanton slices and fill it with dates and serve it with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Recommended again !!

One thing I loved a lot was the crockery they use. It looks elegant and classy.♥

The service was good enough. Only while asking for the bill and paying it, we had to wait for long as no one came to attend us then.


To sum it up,the place is good enough but in this competitive market, they need to work more on everything to get to the excellent mark.

You must visit the place if you love chinese food. 
Although the service is quiet slow, but the food quality is very good so it covers up the service speed.

After a lot of official work we just needed some food at around 3 PM on a Friday. The place wasn't crowded. The ambience was good and warm. We got a table by the window that gave a clear view of the Jessore road. The service was warm and courteous, even if it was a tad slow. Being in a hurry, we just ordered a pan fried mixed noodles with a stir fried fish Mongolian style. The noodles was OK, but the fish was a big disappointment. While spices had a decent taste, the fish itself neither Bekti not Basa, but some kind of low cost seafish with no great taste. Next time, if ever, wouldn't order fish.

The place is quaint and cosy. The upholstered red chairs and those pretty lantern on top add to the ambience. The food is quiet tasty but a little overpriced. Cost for 2 is definitely going to touch 750 if someone orders non-veg items. The baby corn was yum, the burnt garlic fried rice was ho hum and the Cantonese chicken light and nice. If they control the pricing this place is good to hangout with your friends and family alike.

Didn't enjoy the food at all. I went there during Durga puja and the food was horrible. We ordered chicken sweet and corn soup which was toooooo sweet. I had to add entire chilly-vinegar enhancer. For the main course we ordered mixed Cantonese noodles and something of chicken. Cantonese was just yack, it was more of cornflower stirred boiled veggies and the prawns werent fresh. It was smelling. I wont recommend this place to any of my friend.

Located just opposite to Diamond Plaza Mall, a cosy and comfortable restaurant. The food served here is okay-ish. We had tried the Cantonese Mixed Gravy Noodles, but the taste was not that good.

Great ambience and seating..but menu was a disappointment..Very limited menu with made available compared to what’s there at Zomato..Also, server explicitly asked if spice needed to be medium or high for Schezwan Noidles and despite telling it to be Medium, the spice level was SUPER high..Never had that much spicy Schezwan Noodles before..need to leave half portion..Masala cola but no ice..it was room temperature only..Overall pretty average..

Heard about the catchy ambience and wanted to try out the place so went there recently. The ambience and decor is nice and the use of black crockery with it really looks well.
But sadly that's about it, the food is not at all good. The staff are not attentive and courteous.
We ordered Lat Mai Kai as suggested by their staff but when we received it the food was cold and felt like it was prepared earlier. The mixed Schezwan Noodles were no good either.

This is the 2nd tine here, guys please try 'Drums of Heaven' once its really justify the name. Good affordable chinese. I want to rate it 5+.
We have been there on the day o Maha Panchami 2K17. Overall experience is great.
Pros:
1. Good decoration.
2. A very pleasant ambience and hospitality.
3. Short and Crisp menu ... I assure confusion regarding food selection will be less.
4. Good food and especially if you love spicy food then it is just the place for you.
5. We ordered lat-me-kai it is good as a starter hot and spicy.
6. Main course is also good..

Cons:
As it is the first visit I think they should make some variations in their menu.. then it will be great.@

Food you must try are hunan chicken, smoked lamb, chilli garlic chicken, sezchwan fish and definitely try the noodle oodles special noodles, mixed fried rice along with it you should be fine with proper meal.

This outlet of noodle oodle is very easy to locate, as it is just opposite to the Diamond Plaza mall. I've visited the restaurant about 4-5 times, and it has never failed or disappointed me. The food has always been great, tasted amazing with the right flavours. However, once chilli garlic rice tasted a bit stale or weird. But, otherwise the place is really amazing to have chinese food. The food tastes flavourful when hot.

Located just opposite to Arsalan Jessore Road. They also have a take-away counter for fastfood. Its a brilliant place to hangout with friends, family and close ones. I loved the ambience. Another thing I liked about this place is that they serve their food in all black textured crockery which looks damn decent and appealing to the eyes. We ordered Chicken Cantonese Noodles, Chicken Wok Tossed Noodles, Burnt Garlic Rice, Manchurian Chicken, Hunan Chicken. The food quality and taste was at par. I liked their service quality too. Price of the food was preety moderate. Overall nice hangout place with good food, service and brilliant ambience.

Visited on a busy Saptami day but didn't have to wait much longer. We tried out Lat ma kai, smoked chicken and cantonese noodles. I must say that all kinds of chicken tasted the same. I am not satisfied with the noodles. It's better to go with classic things at this place.

Perfectly located opposite diamond plaza mall this restaurant has a nice ambiance with chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling. It was during puja time so had to wait for our seats. They had a restricted menu for pujo which was a dissapointment. We ordered wok tossed mixed hakka noodles and chicken manchurian. The taste was overall very bland. Quantity is sufficient for 2 people from one serve. But they didnt live upto our expectation may be because of pujo rush.

Its a decent place for a meal but you are a food lover i will not recoment you to go there

>Food 8 out of 10 (i liked the Chinese food there. Dunno why they put zucchini in noodles but still its good in taste. Ordered mixed special noodles with that a side both are good)

> service 2 out of 10 (its my second type i went there and the service is awful both the times. This time a 10 or more people gang went there and all. The staff went busy accomodating them even i have to find my seat on my own.. And after that i called 3 times to take our order.. Took too much time to serve the hfood though they have told me it will take 25-30 minutes to serve. After eating waited 15 minute to receive the bill. Even this happened both the times)

> ambience 6@ out of 10 ( nice Chinese feel with the hanging lamps and music but the plates and bowls looks old and usded which caught my eyes and i will surely ask the owner or the authority please make different wash rooms for men and woman. This one is a suggestion from myside)

All in all its a one timer. If your are in nagerbazar or dum dum area it may be the best Chinese place bt not a frequent place to be in kolkata

 I loved the ambience, the food was sumptuous as well as quite tasty. I had lamb pepper sauce and special noodle oddle noodles which was mixed noddles have quite a no of lamb pieces ,prawn and chicken to offer. 
The lamb pepper sauce was quite tender and well cooked. Last was fried icecream. I really loved the crust of the icecream which was mostly made of coconut. In total it was nice experience. And quite pocket friendly. The saddest part is I wanted to try the dimsum platter but it was unavailable due to no chef. Hope they can provide that next time cz I would love to revisit

Celebrated a friend's birthday here. The ambience of this place is simply breathtaking! The huge glass windows and the Chinese lanterns adorning the ceiling sets the mood just right for some memorable moments in the making with friends and food.But wait right there......the food to be true aint that amazing.The rice that we were served was not at all good,quite lumpy.The fish tasted awesome though.The chicken side dish was quite bland for my liking. The mixed noodles was tasty. And the sweet and salty fresh limes were passable. But the staff is quite customer friendly , as they allowed us to cut the birthday cake and dint budge even when made a huge mess after cutting the cake.

Well..an economical place serving average chinese food..the ambience is catchy..but the food..not that impressive..they serve limited items..
We ordered chicken hot and sour soup..something was a tad bit wrong from the very beginning..the flavour was not fresh..not at all recomended..
The chilli garlic chicken noodles were good..a bit oily but palatable..
The sliced lamb in pepper sauce was good..though the meat was a tad bit chewy..overall a very average place..but pocket friendly..

I had an amazing experience in noodle oodle express today. We came here for the first time, we were the first customer for the day and we ordered for hakka noodles and gravy chicken. Unaware that we have a fried house fly in the dish. We presented that to the manager and he apologized for the same. He didn't charge for the dish. Yet this is to highlight that a flaw like this is simply unacceptable on the part of the cook.

Hi, I am Gayatri, you might know me as thefoodiebong. I have a confession to make. There might be nothing more sincere than the love for food, my foodie friends would agree to this. But to me, it has always been my unapologetic love for Asian cuisine (mostly Chinese food), that has been the most sincere kind of love. Not only me but the entire population of India prefers Chinese cuisine to a great extent. It is the second most ordered cuisine after, north Indian or Mughlai cuisine. An Indian’s love for Chinese has always been deep, so much so that even the Chinese have modernized their food in order to suit the Indian palate. After all, no one wants to lose a customer base of 1 billion!! Right?

Would give a negative rating if such an option was available. The service was pathetic. Had to go to the staff desk and beg for water. There was hair in one dish served to us. Shocking ! The place was hot and overcrowded. The staffs were untrained and least bothered about the customer's needs. There was total chaos among the staff. Even the manager was found to be absent on call.

Lets come to the point.
Pros:
1. Nice ambience
2. Good staff
3. Awesome food, customization available.
4. Fast service
5. Plenty of options to choose from.

Cons:
1. Tables are not arranged properly
2. Feel congested if it's rush time.

Overall good place for dinner with family. Must try mushrooms here I never had this good mushrooms ever.

Being an in and out Chinese and Asian cuisine lover, this place didn't disappoint me at all.
First of all I liked the place where it's situated. And if you're getting your table at the glass window side, nothing like it...You can have the proper Kolkata feel, actually the scenario of Kolkata Traffic from atop.

The decor is okay. One suggestion I have that is too much if Chinese lampshades is giving the restaurant a clumsy feeling. Otherwise it's fine.

And now I'm coming to the food.

Chinese cuisine is always one of my favorites among any other cuisines. Chinese foods are known for mouth-watering taste & exceptional flavor. the preference for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups. Chinese foods are depended color, smell & taste are three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food as well as the meaning, shape, and nutrition of the food. Chopsticks are the main eating utensils for Chinese food, which can be used to cut & pick up food. in Calcutta there are many joints which serve really good Chinese food like that another place recently added to my list “Noodle Oodle”. right now they have two branches in Calcutta. located just opposite of Diamond Plaza, Jessore Road, Nagerbazar, Calcutta. nice innovative decoration with extremely good ambiance looks quite beautiful. it has a capacity of around 50-55 people at a time. a meetup arranged by the management of “Noodle Oodle”, I and my fellow foodie friends were invited there for a food tasting.

The noodles was also tasty..as well the lamb item.
Reasonably priced.good behaviour of the staffs.
A must visit for chinese lover.

It's the second time am visiting noodle oodle. Am not huge Chinese cuisine fan but i quiet like this place. Good ambiance with cute chinese lanterns;(but the environment inside is too noisy which turns me down)foods are tasty and sufficient for two. Though recently i tried out garlic oyester paneer;the dish wasn't that good.The staffs are quiet well trained and well behaved.
Conclusion:pocket friendly restaurant. Great place for Chinese lovers and the biggest con is their service. Do not go empty stomach there because it takes millenium century for them to serve food.😧

This is based on just a day's experience when I had taken a parcel (so please don't judge). 

I ordered for Mixed Fried Rice and they literally forced me to try their "speciality"  Smoked Chicken. (I wanted Chilli Chicken). Anyway. 

The rice was very ordinary. Rather I'd say it was dry. Very dry for a fried rice. 

And the smoked chicken. Where do I begin! It was terrible. Some pieces of chicken left fried in burnt garlic. That's all. It tasted bitter as well. 

Bad experience but comparing the other reviews, I'd definitely try the other varieties of food here.

If you are in Nagerbazr area and want to try some delicious and tasty Chinese food then The Noodle Oodle is the place for you. They have loads of seating facilities and is nicely decorated with lots of Chinese lanterns and all red and black interior. Not only this family style dine-in restaurant offers a great food but it also gives you a pleasant ambience. Recently they invited TeamPanchphoron for their Rakhi and Friendship day special menu launch. The spread was huge and each and every dishes were equally tasty which included : Garlic Oyster Paneer, Crispy Chilli Baby corn, Smoked Chicken, Stir Fried Fish Mongolian Style, Crispy Noodles Salad, Braised Black Mushroom & Bamboo Shoot, Vegetable Sweet & Sour, Kung pao kai, Pla Neung Manow, Special Fried Rice(veg), Special Fried Rice(non veg), Mei-foon(Chicken), Special Noodles(mixed) and Honey Noodle oodle in Almond Flakes.

I was thinking of being here from a few months, somehow couldn't make it. Got good reviews. We had ordered from here today.

- The first impression was quite good as it was very well packed. Even the sauces were given in small boxes.

- We had ordered a Noodle Oodle spl. Chicken fried rice and garlic chicken.

- The food was good, however wasn't that outstanding. Little average kind.

- Quantity was a little less. Would be difficult to share for those who's appetit is slightly higher.

- Chicken and other ingredients were sufficient.

If you are a pure nonvegetarian and love the Chinese and Mongolian food then there is definitely a reason for you to smile. Noodle Oodle brings the best of the Chinese and Mongolian specialties straight from China . Located at the 965, Jessore Road, Nagerbazar Kolkata , Just oppsite Diamond Plaza, Jessore Road. This place can be easily spotted. Noodle Oodle as the name suggests is a complete family dine-in restaurant with a great ambiance . You get to choose (mentioned below) and lip smacking food, Noodle Oodle is the one for you!

1.	SALAD

a.	Crispy Noodles Salad

2.	STARTER VEG

a.	Garlic Oyster Paneer

b.	Crispy Chilly Babycorn

3.	STARTER NON-VEG

Great ambience and service. Probably the best place to have chinese food in its locality. The food is good and quantity can serve 2 people (noodles/soup). Will surely visit again and try out various other cuisines.
I would recommend this place , if you are looking for restaurants near Nagerbazar to hang out with your family / on a date.
Recommended: Honey Lemon chicken .
Not recommended: Masala soda (pepsi).

Located opposite to the diamond plaza mall. And I went there thrice. Amazing ambience with low music. Perfect place for Chinese food. The main speciality of this is pad Thai noodles. The mixed noodles/rice contain lamb Nd mushrooms , which amazes me always. As a starter, smoked lamb is really finger licking good. Food quantity and quality are equally good. Though their service is a bit slow. Still it's one of the best Chinese restaurants according to me.

A brightly lit place always lift up your mood and the interior of Noodle Oodles does just that. But that is where it stopped for me. Once the food was served it was all downhill. I had kimchi salad, mixed pan fried noodles, honey lemon chicken and chilli chicken. The salad and the honey chicken were loaded with sugar! The chili chicken was the only saving grace. It's spices somehow balanced the sugary overdose. I really love kimchi salads but I was very disappointed by their preparation.

Located just opposite  Diamond Plaza, this place serves good chinese food to people tired of eating at KFC(people like me) and obviously others too. The decor is cool and the ambience has a nice feel. The food is great, especially the starters. 
  The only problem with this joint is their service. On our first visit, we had to wait for an hour to get two dishes...that too, common ones like noodles and chilli chicken. Though the preparation time has been managed and lowered,nowadays, but still it takes 20-25 minutes for them to serve the soups and appetizers.
    If you're not in a hurry and  keep the chill to get served with good food, this place will not disappoint you.

Noodles was less spicy but could be better,
Chicken was bit stiff and not tendered well.
I have tested better kung pao in many other other restaurant in kolkata.

After a long tym it was chinese cuisine day out...So went to this place which had a tongue twister name...The first feeling i had OH MY GOD!! am I in China...😄😜...the ambience and the music wil surely give u that feeling..the decor was nice and cozy and the men in black working there were very nice and well behaved.😎..now coming to food experience we ordered Lat mai kai chicken which had a super stinging garlic flavour,main course was pad thai noodles n lamb in black sauce...which had a great flavour of lemom grass..loved it..den the desert was fried ice cream and that disappointed me a lot...the coconut batter used was not so good and the pineapple too was not sweet...but the food was nice..love the place ..price and quantity was quite reasonable... the menu is not huge so u wil not get puzzled what to order , i found this was positive about the restaurant..

We went for our little outing at Noodle Oodle. The restaurant was in a prime loacation. It was opposite of Diamond Plaza. We ordered Chicken Lat mai kai, Pad Thai noodles, Lamb in black pepper sauce and a Fried icecream . Chicken was little bit stiff but taste was fine and rest of the other dishes was average. Interior was very nice bit cozy type good for small hangout. Choices of musics are poor they will keep repeating same chinese music again Nd again which eventually will crack ur head at a certain point of time. Though we had a great time and will recommend others.

Yesterday I went for the first time. And surprisingly my experience was quite good. 
Decent ambience with a light music playing.
We ordered Honey lemon chicken for starter's it was good enough. And in main course we ordered one plate of Schezwan chicken rice ( little spicy) that's quite enough for two and Chicken tossed with chilly garlic sauce was also a good choice.

This one holds a special place because it is related to my school and it was a splendid first visit for me. We ordered for a lemon honey chicken which was amazing n then noodle oodle special hakka noodles which was equally good. I didnt like the cantonese chicken much. The service was pretty quick. So if you are around the area, do try it out coz this place can prove to be economical yet tasty!

This restaurant stands just the opposite of diamond plaza mall.... When I entered into the place,it was a bit crowed since it was a Sunday.. I had to wait a bit for my table..the ambience was pretty good.. Especially the lights hanging from the ceiling....loved it 😊 


Coming to the food.. I had ordered mixed fried rice and chicken tossed in Szechwan sauce (yumyummmm).. 
In one word the food tasted splendid.... I simply loved it..both quantity and quality was more than good....the quantity is sufficient for two..the service is quite good.... Nice place to dine with family and friends.. Overall its worth a shot!

I went for the first time and was very happy about the food and the service.
The interior was pretty with chinese lanterns but the music system was not working so missed out on the Chinese music.
For starters we ordered lat mat kai. It was crispy on the outside and juicy within. It was lovely!
For mains we ordered burnt butter garlic rice which was fantastic.
The lamb in black soy sauce was succulent and heart warming.
Will visit again.

this is my second visit to this place and the only reason for my visit was their pan fried cantonese style noodles, i think with its subtle taste and slight crispy noodles with loads of veggies, mushrooms and choice of protiens was outstandingly delish!! the quantity of food in one portion is good enough for 2 and certainly suits the price.
the place was clean and staff courteous.
the only downside was the service was pretty slow and the music played did not go with the type of ambience they were going for.
will definitely recomend but would also love to see more variety in the menu.
cheers!!

Mainly for tjose items for which tjis restaurant god excellant feedback.
@ Noodle Oodle management- Sorry to give this rating...i feel that this is totally FLOP z😞

It's located bang opposite to Diamond plaza on the busy Jessore road. You have to go up a flight of stairs in order to reach. 

The decor was fine. Little cramped up I felt. Although the place looked clean and the staff were decent enough. We ordered a Lat Mai Kai for starters, Pad thai noodles and Hunan chicken. The lat Mai Kai served was cold, didn't seem like crispy enough. The taste was average though. Then the pad thai noodles was great. One portion of the noodles can easily fill up two individuals. It tasted great. It's one of the better pad thai I've had recently. I'd recommend it to everyone. The Hunan chicken was average, nothing to write home about. 

The place is budget friendly and would definitely give another visit. Hoping to get fresh hot food :P

Noodle Oodle is quite easy to locate as it is located just opposite to the PVR: Diamond Plaza, Jessore Road,Nager Bazar,Kolkata. The ambience was really good with some music playing in the background. It is well decorated with red chinese lanterns all over the ceiling. Coming to food,it was really tasty though the service was bit slow. People should definitely visit this place as the price is affordable.

Location: this restaurant being placed at the heart of Nager Bazar is quite easy to locate which is also just opposite to Diamond plaza mall.
What really attracted me towards this restaurant was the decor-bright red Chinese paper crafted lights hung across wide glass gives it a very pretty-to-look at look😍
Coming to food,well this food serves Chinese cuisine which tasted okay but not bad🙂
We ordered lat mei kai,chilly fish,veg Hakka noodles n mix chilli garlic noodles🍝 n all of them were tasted well!
But I personally felt tht the chilli fish would have been better.
And for dessert we had their special Fried ice cream wch is a bit twisty but I think one must try it for a change of taste bud🙂
Had a nice evening @ noodle oodle 
Thank you.

I had heard a lot about this food joint in North Kolkata, so I called them to place an order this evening but they refused to take any orders as there were no delivery staff( Once you open a delivery counter, who doesn't keeps a delivery staff on a Sunday). Anyway, I just asked them to bear with me and requested them to start preparing the food in the meantime I would send someone to pick up the order or would order through swiggy. The person on the other end said no to this. He was rude. Throughout the conversation he kept blabbering simultaneously as I was speaking to him. I really had high expectations from this place, but the restaurant seems to be very unwelcoming. If I'm not forgetting his name was Mr. Prashant and he claimed to be the superior.

I recently visited the place with my sis after hearing so much about this restraunt.Decore of this place is perfect as chinese dine in but when it comes to food then it is average restraunt.There is nothing so special.After seeing the menu we thought we will try some new dishes for a change so we ordered----

1. Mixed Cantonese Noodle:- It was nice dish if u love gravy noodles but the taste is little different from typical gravy noodles.It was full of fresh vegetables,good amount of chicken,prawn nd egg.We loved it.

2.Pad Thai Noodle:- Pad thai was too spicy and taste was not so good.I would recommend not to try it.

3.Kung pao chicken:- This item was totally blunt in taste.

4.Fried Ice Cream:- God knows what was that.It tastes exactly like coconut and it was so hard that you cannot cut it with the fork or spoon.There was no sign of ice cream,we only tastes the coconut.We tried a lot to cut it but lastly we gave up.We complained about it to the waiter but they were also confused about it..

All over except cantonese noodle rest of the items were horrible.

Well it promises to be a good Chinese restaurant with some good lighting, decor, ambiance and presentation but it takes a backseat when it comes to taste. Firstly the turn around time for an order is painfully long you will be on the verge of giving up and suddenly your food will come. The quantities are excellent and you'd be happy to see  the presentation as well. Now when it comes to taste it got confusing I liked the starters as it was cooked well and fresh like the fish but the main course were a problem. The noodles were bland and too simple and the chicken and fish tasted kind of sweet. Well it was difficult for me to come to any conclusion but finally when I saw the bill I decided to rate 3 as I thought that it's a tad overpriced considering the location and quality.

Yesterday marks my first visit to this place. After much sceptisism, I finally went here to enjoy a delicious chinese dinner.

My experience here was surprisingly quite good and better than what I had expected.
The price of food is reasonable for the quantity of food served.
The ambience was good with faint music playing in the background and chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling.

For a bill amounting to 485 INR (inclusive of taxes) we had-

• Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice (mildly spiced falvourful rice with shreds of chicken)
• Schezwan Prawn (four pieces of prawn served in a spicy and delicious schezwan gravy)

The only downers for the night was the slow service and the lack of variety in the menu for prawn gravies.

But in conclusion I would say this place is worth a visit as the pocket pinch is affordable for eveyone and anyone!

UpDate: Visited this place again on Eid. The bill was of Rs 494 (Tax included). Ordered for-
• Schezwan Chicken Hakka Noodles (spicy and falvourful)
• Hunan Chicken ( bland chicken gravy)
• Fried Icecream
The noodles were quite thick which I don't quite prefer and the hunan chicken had no taste whatsover and lacked proper.seasoning.
The icecream was good though I have had better.

After watching movie we really felt Hungry and as we always go to KFC, Domino's, Pizza Hut and all the food centres in this mall, we decided to go there. Coz this name and the Ambience we could see from the outside used to attract us.

This outlet is famous for Chinese food. 

The Ambience : 4/5
Food : 3.5/5
Staff : Good enough

Their Fried Ice-cream was WOW ❤

One of the worst places you can probably pick to meet up old friends.. Few items are overcooked while most of them are undercooked.. However one thing that's consistent is tasteless and stale food.. Talking about ambience it's pretty mainstream, nothing innovative. Staff takes your complaints as jokes.

Noodle Oodle Special Hakka noodles and Kung Pao Kai chicken were the choice for the evening.Food amounted to was sufficient for the price and was freshly served.
A more detailed review awaits, until the next visit.This time though, to the restaurant itself.However, from what I have had, seems like a good deal of culinary delight to me.

I had ordered LAT MAI KAI chicken for starters, but unfortunately all the pieces were not cooked properly. The bigger pieces of chicken was not tender from inside. Moreover couldn't enjoy the dinner as the restaurant was full and the ACs were not up to the mark, making the place a bit claustrophobic. I was literally sweating in the middle of my meal. Please increase the number of ACs as you guys can't increase the space. One more suggestion for the restaurant management, please train your staffs for handling large crowd, they were mixing up the orders.

Located just opposite to Diamond Plaza, a nice option if you are looking for some decent and proper Chinese meal in the locality.. The place is not that big, hence you might need to wait during the busy hours of the weekend.. Luckily we got a seat by the big glass pane overlooking the busy streets below.. Ambiance is elegant and comforting, with exotic pictures on the wall and circular lanterns with Chinese inscriptions hanging from the ceiling.. Service was appropriate and efficient enough.. We ordered:
Fresh Lime Soda: Usual one, could have been a tad less sweeter according to my palate..
Smoked Chicken: Ordered on server's recommendation as it was supposed to be their signature dish.. Way too sweet and way too much use of soya sauce.. Portions were sufficient though..
Mixed Pan Fried Noodles: Quantity was more than enough for even double sharing.. Taste wise much better and authentic.. Loved the crunchiness of the dish with the proper assortment of veggies and proteins..
Overall, I felt the portions of the dish justified the prices charged but they need to work on their taste and may add a few more variety to enhance the visibility of this place.. Our total cheque was Rs.544/- (all incl.) for 2 people..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

They couldn't cope up with the situation as there were much crowd ... Also, the place is too small to occupy more people ... Staffs were cordial though ... Chilli garlic noodles was awesome ... We took different types of noodles and chicken and pork as side dish ... Taste as well as quantity is really good ...

Awesome Chicken Manchow Soup and American Chopsuey!  Ample amount of chicken in every dish. Amount is exact for price. Very good quality and taste of food. No wonder it attracts many customers even though it's in the vicinity of top notch places like Bhojohori Manna, Aminia, Kasturi, Buddha Bites ...

A nice place to enjoy chinese food. Very good quality and tasty food. Although the prices seemed a bit high, might be due to the location which is just opppsite to the Diamond Plaza mall. The ambience is also very nice where they have decorated the place with tibetian style items.

Ordered a special mixed fried rice and a Cantonese Noodle. The Mixed Fried Rice was made well. It contained ample amount of Eggs, Chicken, Mutton and Prawns. The Mixed Fried Rice contained pieces of Cauliflower's, Carrots, Spring Onions etc. The Garlic Sauce provided was amazing. The quantity of Rice provided was good sufficient for 2 people. The packing of the Rice was well done in air tight container. The Cantonese Noodle was again made well and tasted good. The quantity was enough to fill 2 empty stomachs. Contained ample amount if Chicken and Prawns. Was packed well in container. Would love to try their other delicacies soon.

Today me and my friend went to this restaurant opposite of diamond plaza Mall.
It is said that a good restaurant must have a good ambience. And yes,when I entered​ the restaurant,we both find it good, Chinese traditional instrumental music was playing in a very low yet suitable way. The wooden floor and the wooden chairs with the Chinese lamps,was matching with the music.
Now coming to the food,we ordered 1 plate of burnt garlic mixed fried rice and noodle oodle special chicken fried rice with Kung Pao chicken and lamb fillets with black pepper sauce. The side dish was of regular portion. Both The rice portion was enough for 2 of us,but yes if there was a 3rd person,he can also have the full lunch(me and my friend ate like a zombie and after finishing the rice it was like OMG,I need to sleep right now😂😂).
The kung pao chicken was marvelous,compared to this the lamb fillet with black pepper sauce felt a bit taste less though it was good.
Staffs are friendly,we didn't had to wait to long after ordering the food. The total amount of the bill was Rs.795.
The main thing is,the dishes were great. I would like to visit again. And yes for a pocket friendly lunch or I will definitely recommend this place.
(P.s- sorry couldn't take photos at that time coz we were super hungry that time,after eating half,it striked me..😛)

It is located in Nagerbazar just opposite of Diamond Plaza. I went in with my friends the other day and we had ordered Honey Lemon Chicken as the appetizer and for mains we ordered Veg and Non-veg hakka noddles, chicken tossed in garlic sauce, fish tossed in oyster sauce and Pla Neung Manow. The food was perfect and delicious. The interior is amazing and resembles the Chinese culture pretty well. The staff was cordial and efficient. Worth a visit!

A good place, nice food. I had heard mixed reviews about this place and finally last week decided to try it out myself. The ambience is good, gives a nice authentic  chinese feeling. The food was good too. I wouldnt say great but its good. The staff were properly dressed and courteous. They even went ro the extent of changing a dish for us when i mentioned the chicken didnt taste right in it.
The only drawback of visiting the place is, there is no proper place to park your car.

So we went to Noodle Oodle as a group of 14 to have a good time, and yes we did. Situated just opposite the Diamond Plaza Mall, it is one of the exquisite Chinese restaurants I have been to. The food along with the ambiance is quite a combination to have a 
good time. Both quantity and quality of the food is great. The warmth in the behavior of the waiters 
would make you to visit there again. Overall a great experience . :-)

This easily spotted restaurant cannot be a miss if you're visiting Diamond Plaza or the Nagerbazar area.

With Chinese tune continuosly played to keep up to the theme of restaurant, the interiors play good cards too.

Staffs are helpful and courteous too.

Day 1 : 
We ordered​ Lat Mai Kai for appetizers. It had a tangy taste and is certainly recommend to start a meal. The chicken balls were soft and juicy. However, the spring onions garnished with it were thick shoots and not fresh ones.

For the maincourse, we opted for mixed nonveg burnt butter garlic rice and Hunan chicken. That dish of rice is extremely a tasty preparation. It was well made. But I had better at another place too. The chicken was too dull, especially when we compared it with the starter chicken.

Day 2 : Reached 2 minutes before the lunch closure hour. We were ask to hurry with our order, lest the kitchen is shutting off.

So we quickly moved to the maincourse. Ordered the same rice again (I had a different company this day), and fish tossed in hot garlic sauce. The former tasted good like the previous day. But the fish was top notch. So fresh and tender, and the sauce was delicious.

I'm certainly visiting this place again.

Ordered their take away. The price is a bit higher on medium scale. The food however was great. Ordered noodle oodle special fried rice, kung pao chicken, chicken in hunan sauce and fish in hot garlic sauce. The fried rice had huge portions. Ordered 3 plates for 4 servings. Chicken dishes were good, though the pieces were small. Full plate contains 10 pieces at ₹220 and half is priced at ₹160. The pack also contained small containers of vinegar's and chili sauce. Plastic spoons were also provided. Overall good experience when it comes to taste of the dish. Would surely try out their dine in restaurant.

I visited with my friends twice. Both the time we had butter and burnt garlic rice. The taste was good. The ambience was nice. The price is reasonable. We ordered lamb once. The taste was not that special and may be the lamb was not cooked enough.. It gave away a crunchy taste. Other than lamb the starters and the main courses were all good.

This restaurant is located just in opposite of Diamond Plaza. 
They have recently opened a take away counter in the next building and they also selling snacks at a cheap price.
This is a great thing I personally feel.
Anyway, coming to the review ordered mixed pan fried noodles but all got was Zucchini noodles with little bit of meat and other veggies.
Maybe it was the chef who might needed take care of the zucchinis.

They should improve on the quality and try and use less zucchini cause too much of it could hamper the taste.

Since I live close by; noodle oodle has become a frequent haunt for us. My experiences otherwise have been good, including experiences with the staff. 
But this one time, we tried calling them and ordering. I don't know who answers the phone for them, but they need a replacement for that person. Not only was he obnoxiously late to reply; his attitude came across as bluntly disinterested and rude. On my visits all staff members I've encountered were pretty pleasant; that's why this sort of an attitude took us by surprise, and not a pleasant one at all. I'm afraid, at a busy place like where they stand, with an attitude like that, they won't last long. I hope they look into this and not lose more customers..

My experience here is good overall. There is no theme but the ambience is well maintained. Small but spacious, specially the Chinese lights are awesome. For food, all the menu items were available. We ordered lemon coriander chiken soup and pan fried chilli fish in starter. They used zucchini in many items, which is new. Soup was very sour but refreshing. Fish was tasty. Noodles was average, not much to mention. Garlic butter prawn was yummy, but we found prawn little stiff. They must work on that. 
Quantity, any single bowl is enough for two.
The stuffs are well trained and professional.

Went there 2 – 3 times. Firstly I must say about their stere case : This is situated on 1st floor, and they bad stere case ( too much narrow and height is very high ) which is very problematic for seniors & kids. Ambiance : this is really good one, lots of lamp hanging from celling is adding an extra toppings to the looks. Foods : Foods is above average, taste is good but nothing is great. Service : this is not up to the mark, too slow. Rate : Its not expensive but more then average. Its can not consider as fine dining but charges are like that. Conclusion : So so.. .can be visit but nothing great I found.

Lovely, peaceful and tranquil Chinese restaurant tucked away from the busy hustle and bustle of Nager Bazar, with neat and cozy interior decked with a bunch of hanging red Chinese lanterns on the ceiling. 
Located just opposite Diamond Plaza mall, visited it on the occasion of a friend treating me to their Cantonese chicken pan fried noodles and Drums of Heaven chicken lollipops.
The noodles with its generous portions of veggies and babycorns were delightfully tasty and flavoursome, when sprinkled with vinegar, and the chicken lollipops were crispy and crunchy to perfection. They were also quite mouthwateringly delicious.
Added bonus is the glass window through which one can view the busy steeet outside from amidst the serene ambiance of the eatery if one sits beside the window. 
At reasonable rates and pocket friendly prices a great joint for students and youngsters to hang out for some quality time and conversations - even some selfie clicks - coupled with satisfactory good food.

Ordered Lemon honey Chicken and Chicken pan fried Cantonese noodles. Both of them were good. I love the starters particularly of this place. But their service is bad. We had to wait for almost half an hour for these two items. They need to check on this.

Went there 2 – 3 times. Firstly I must say about their stere case : This is situated on 1st floor, and they bad stere case ( too much narrow and height is very high ) which is very problematic for seniors & kids. Ambiance : this is really good one, lots of lamp hanging from celling is adding an extra toppings to the looks. Foods : Foods is above average, taste is good but nothing is great. Service : this is not up to the mark, too slow. Rate : Its not expensive but more then average. Its can not consider as fine dining but charges are like that. Conclusion : So so.. .can be visit but nothing great I found.

Lovely, peaceful and tranquil Chinese restaurant tucked away from the busy hustle and bustle of Nager Bazar, with neat and cozy interior decked with a bunch of hanging red Chinese lanterns on the ceiling. 
Located just opposite Diamond Plaza mall, visited it on the occasion of a friend treating me to their Cantonese chicken pan fried noodles and Drums of Heaven chicken lollipops.
The noodles with its generous portions of veggies and babycorns were delightfully tasty and flavoursome, when sprinkled with vinegar, and the chicken lollipops were crispy and crunchy to perfection. They were also quite mouthwateringly delicious.
Added bonus is the glass window through which one can view the busy steeet outside from amidst the serene ambiance of the eatery if one sits beside the window. 
At reasonable rates and pocket friendly prices a great joint for students and youngsters to hang out for some quality time and conversations - even some selfie clicks - coupled with satisfactory good food.

Visited this place with a friend one evening. A small food joint just opposite Diamond Plaza. Decorated beautifully with Chinese lamps. Usually a que is always there. Ordered Lemon honey Chicken and Chicken pan fried Cantonese noodles. Both of them were good. I love the starters particularly of this place. But their service is bad. We had to wait for almost half an hour for these two items. They need to check on this.

Noodle Oodle is a nice Chinese restaurant located at Nagerbazar area. They have another branch near kabi nazrul metro station garia. I visited the other branch once and last Friday got another chance to visit this outlet. Ambiance is very nice with comfortable seating arrangements. Staffs are well behaved and service is fast. Tried konzee crispy lamb and pan fried noodles. Lamb was too good , a must try dish. Pocket pinch is reasonable. Very good place to try some good Chinese.

Awesome chinese and oriental food@Rodkal bang opposite to the Diamond city North .

The Chinese and Thai soups are amazing and I have promised the management to come down once again to have a group feat.

When I dropped in this restaurant with my friend it was time for closure, however,the staffs to my delight allowed me in and gave a delightful experience.

Noodle Oodle is a Chinese restaurant located at Nagerbazar.

Ambience & decor is very nice with ample sitting arrangements coupled with mild music.

Staffs are courteous with efficient service.

Tried pretty simple dish - 
Non veg Dimsum platter and Chicken Manchow soup.

Soup had good fillings and was tangy and tasty.
Dimsum had generous fillings and was soft & palatable. 

Pocket pinch is bit high but quantity is sufficient.

Initially with some bad reviews I was bit skeptical about the place though it is located very nearby from my house. The price is quite reasonable as they have two options regular contains 6 pieces  costs around 140 to 160 and large contains 10 pieces costs around 200 to 220,  rice and noodle amount is also good.  Taste wise not bad though not a stunner.  Therefore the cost for two you can keep within 500 to 600.  The only problem is if crowd is more the place faces a place crunch and also the order and delivery time ratio is bit high min 15 minutes.

Now coming to the food we ordered Three Treasure Vegetable in Garlic Pepper Sauce, Bamboo Shoot Rice and Schezwan Noodles. Bamboo Shoot Rice is to die for and I would highly recommend it to everyone. Three Treasure vegetable in Garlic Pepper Sauce was also very good and so was the Schezwan Noodles. 
Overall a good experience!!

I went for dinner, though as per Zomato recommendation, booking table in advance is required, I was a bit concerned as I can't wait for food 😎. Luckily it was almost empty.

Started with:
• Man Chow Soup: I really loved it, tangy, spicy! The portion was enough for two
• Lat Kai Mai: A starter with unique taste, must try! It was awesome 

After that what happened is really funny! We were so full that didn't dare to order main course. Simply paid the bill and went home happy...

• Food: 4/5
• Ambience: 3/5
• Cost: 4/5
• Hospitality: 3/5

and lastly I loved the all black crockery!

Everything from the interior ambience (not to forget the melodious Chinese themed instrumental in the background), overall cleanliness of the restaurant, the polite behaviour of the staff and lastly the quality and taste of all the items, makes you wanna come here one more time. Afterall, who doesn't love a consistently good performer?? 😊

It took them so long to bring the food. Dimsums weren't available at lunch time. The soup they said would take a long time to prepare. But still I would suggest you to go here for the food is delicious and that too Chinese!

We started with seafood wonton soup. It was so good. Sweetness of the soup made it more delicious.
We moved on to have mixed pan fried cantonese style noodles with Kung Pao Kai. The noodles were my favourite. Nicely prepared with white sauce, veggies, prawn, chicken and lamb. But, Kung Pao Kai didn't complement to the noodles. Still, we loved the taste.

This place is located at Nagerbazar, just opposite of diamond plaza. After completing shopping, thought to visit this restro. Entrance is so well decorated and same was from inside, sharing a complete Chinese look and feel. As expected I was embarrassed with their service. I haven't found staff members friendly and even their service was extremely poor. After ordering crispy chilly baby corn, manchurian, noodle oodle special, haka noodle and hot garlic paneer, they made us wait for more then 25 mins to serve one single item. Very disappointing. As read their review, baby corn and Manchurian was good and so was noodles but hot garlic was worst. They need to take care of the food and services.

Another pocket friendly restaurant facing Diamond Plaza mall adding to list of eateries by the Jessore road which has turned into a food street in the Nagerbajar area, this one serves chinese. The service is a bit slow but the food is satisfying and light, just the way I love. Yet to try the non veg momo platter which seems interesting from the menu card. I was there twice, the second time celebrating my birthday and they have no problem if you bring cake from outside and they even play the happy birthday song on their own! We quite enjoyed the dinner! The burnt garlic butter friend rice was love! Too many chinese lanterns but I feel they can use brighter lights!

Packed little Chinese joint, acceptable because ...... HO HO HO it's Christmas. 
Had to wait for more than half n hour for my parcel, and the food was worth the wait except for Kung Pao Kai as it had a bland taste considering the cuisine being orientally tangy. I have a spicy tongue, so I guess it didn't hit the right spots but it was nicely compensated by the Schezwan noodles and Smokey Chicken. 
Will definitely visit again to try the Noodle oodle special chicken fried rice as recommended by

Located opposite Diamond Plaza mall. A very narrow stairway beside the Rodkol bus stop leads to the restaurant located on the first floor. It's not very spacious, but has tables to accommodate around 30 people at a time, which is why you keep overhearing other people throughout. The decor is nice, with Chinese lanterns, but the wall hangings could do with a little more thinking.

SECOND VISIT: 10.09.2017
Adding the experience of second visit before the first one because I was completely ashamed of having taken a bunch of friends there because I liked it the first time. Ordered Masala coke which has Wostershire sauce and Sriracha, no fizz, and upon asking for ice, they couldn't provide that either. Did not even bother to serve water. Did not replace the drink upon complaining. Nobody bothered finishing that because IT BURNT OUR THROAT. Secondly, the mushroom dish we ordered was glorified poha, lemon chicken was too sweet and baby corn was soggy. Horrible experience. Staff was not at all courteous like the man who had served us on our first visit. DISAPPOINTED.

FIRST VISIT:
Went there on 25th December, 2016. The place was around 3/4th full. We were shown a table for two, but since we had to keep our bags on the floor, we asked if we could shift to a table for four, after seeing other couples occupying the same. But the person hosting us said we couldn't because management does not allow that. That slightly put me off.
Coming to the menu, the very same person was quite helpful in guiding us through it. Since we did not want to experiment because this was our first time here, we ordered
1. Chicken schezuan fried rice,
2. Hunan chicken (large).
The food was really good. Quantity was sufficient for the two of us, despite ordering only one portion of each. The rice was flavourful, with the right amount of schezuan pepper and proper pieces of shredded chicken. The chicken was mildly spiced to complement the rice, and the chicken pieces, though slightly uneven in size, were boneless and well cooked. No complains on the food department. Moreover, upon seeing a kid playing with chopsticks, I asked for one too, and they obliged, also changing my plate to a bowl for my benefit. Rated 4 instead of 3-3.5 just for that.
Now the cons. My prime complaint, besides overhearing every conversation because the place being cramped up, is that they took nearly 20mins after completing our meals to get us our bill. It's okay since we were not in a hurry, but for anyone who might be, that might cause some problem. Also, prices are slightly on the higher side. 2 items costing 470 bucks is slightly more than what I'd like to pay for them. But I did not deduct a point because they handed me the bill and not my boyfriend,a gesture which was like a breath of fresh air! It's the first time that happened to me anywhere, so definitely worth a visit. :)

Located bang opposite the Diamond Plaza parking entrance.

The decor is very refreshing and the roadside view adds on to the glamour.

Lit with chinese lanterns gracing the ceiling, this is an out and out chinese  thing.

A 24-30 seater located on the first floor, it serves a good chinese menu.

We ordered their special hakka noodles, which is basically the egg wrapped noodles and it truly is a delight.

Crispy chilli babycorn was great too.

Kung Pao Kai was well prepared with cashew nuts and taste nice too if not the best.

Fresh Lime Soda was okayish.

The ambiance was great and so was the food and staff behaviour. 

Must try for the North Calcutta visitors.

Located opposite Diamond Plaza mall. A very narrow stairway beside the Rodkol bus stop leads to the restaurant located on the first floor. It's not very spacious, but has tables to accommodate around 30 people at a time, which is why you keep overhearing other people throughout. The decor is nice, with Chinese lanterns, but the wall hangings could do with a little more thinking.

SECOND VISIT: 10.09.2017
Adding the experience of second visit before the first one because I was completely ashamed of having taken a bunch of friends there because I liked it the first time. Ordered Masala coke which has Wostershire sauce and Sriracha, no fizz, and upon asking for ice, they couldn't provide that either. Did not even bother to serve water. Did not replace the drink upon complaining. Nobody bothered finishing that because IT BURNT OUR THROAT. Secondly, the mushroom dish we ordered was glorified poha, lemon chicken was too sweet and baby corn was soggy. Horrible experience. Staff was not at all courteous like the man who had served us on our first visit. DISAPPOINTED.

FIRST VISIT:
Went there on 25th December, 2016. The place was around 3/4th full. We were shown a table for two, but since we had to keep our bags on the floor, we asked if we could shift to a table for four, after seeing other couples occupying the same. But the person hosting us said we couldn't because management does not allow that. That slightly put me off.
Coming to the menu, the very same person was quite helpful in guiding us through it. Since we did not want to experiment because this was our first time here, we ordered
1. Chicken schezuan fried rice,
2. Hunan chicken (large).
The food was really good. Quantity was sufficient for the two of us, despite ordering only one portion of each. The rice was flavourful, with the right amount of schezuan pepper and proper pieces of shredded chicken. The chicken was mildly spiced to complement the rice, and the chicken pieces, though slightly uneven in size, were boneless and well cooked. No complains on the food department. Moreover, upon seeing a kid playing with chopsticks, I asked for one too, and they obliged, also changing my plate to a bowl for my benefit. Rated 4 instead of 3-3.5 just for that.
Now the cons. My prime complaint, besides overhearing every conversation because the place being cramped up, is that they took nearly 20mins after completing our meals to get us our bill. It's okay since we were not in a hurry, but for anyone who might be, that might cause some problem. Also, prices are slightly on the higher side. 2 items costing 470 bucks is slightly more than what I'd like to pay for them. But I did not deduct a point because they handed me the bill and not my boyfriend,a gesture which was like a breath of fresh air! It's the first time that happened to me anywhere, so definitely worth a visit. :)

Well I am disappointed. They try hard but the results are disappointing but the service is quite good. Although the starters are good, the unique Fried Ice Cream had a very hard crust. The quantity of every dish is just too much. The Smoked Lamb was very rubbery.

As per the name suggest and also When I ordered Thai food I would expect Thai flavour. But yhe taste I have received is not at all expected. Sweet lime is also not conventional. I would say this as an average.

Located bang opposite the Diamond Plaza parking entrance.

The decor is very refreshing and the roadside view adds on to the glamour.

Lit with chinese lanterns gracing the ceiling, this is an out and out chinese  thing.

A 24-30 seater located on the first floor, it serves a good chinese menu.

We ordered their special hakka noodles, which is basically the egg wrapped noodles and it truly is a delight.

Crispy chilli babycorn was great too.

Kung Pao Kai was well prepared with cashew nuts and taste nice too if not the best.

Fresh Lime Soda was okayish.

The ambiance was great and so was the food and staff behaviour. 

Must try for the North Calcutta visitors.

Ambience : You will definitely get a feeling that you are in china...the music, the decor everything is chinese....was really impressed...

Food : The quantity was sufficient and the food quality was really good and preparation unique..loved both the dishes we had...

What we had :- 1)Schezwan style chicken noodles (was delicious and the first of its kind i had..all spice lovers must try this).. 2)Honey fried chicken (Was really good and complemented the spicy dish well enough)

Price :- Prices are very realistic given the quantity and quality they serve..Approx 500-600 would provide enough food for 2..

Service :- Staff is really well behaved..listen what u say...are patient..n look well after you.

very very impressed..proved to be better than i expected...it is just opposite the diamond plaza..do give it a try, chinese lovers...if im impressed the same way next time i visit, i would update the rating to 5..

Coming to food we ordered Veg Manchow soup, Noodle oodle special veg fried rice and cottage cheese in soy chillie sauce.
Food was good and Manchow soup was really yumm. The fried rice was oily which was a little disappointing.

It is  very convenient to find located just opposite to Diamond Plaza Mall, Nagerbazar. It is on the first floor.
Interior was something I liked. The hanging lights and good music created a nice ambiance. The seats are well arranged and comfortable.
We ordered lat mai kai chicken for starters, which was quite impressive it was juicy, tender and flavoursome. we ordered seafood wanton soup and chicken manchow soup, which was good and the quantity was sufficient. We had chicken tossed in chilly Garlic sauce and it was yummy. Burnt Garlic butter fried rice(chicken) was also good but schezwan style Hakka noodles was not as expected.
The pricing was good not at all pocket pinching.The staffs were cordial.

Noodle Oodle is a lovely restaurant serving Chinese delicacies, located just opposite to the Diamond Plaza Mall in Nagerbazar. It is located on the first floor, so you gotta climb a flight of stairs.
I would like to appreciate the staff at first, who was at our service, Mr. Arindam Nandi. I have been to 7 star hotels and trust me, this man beats any other server! The hospitality that he showed us and the way he behaved, hats off! He recommended many signature dishes to us and they were quite good.
I had one fresh lime soda to start with. It was very nicely made. Coming to the food, we had Lat Mai Kai on the server's recommendation and Pan fried Chilli Fish. The chilli fish was good; lat mai kai, lovely! Then we had Chicken Pan fried noodles which came with boiled veggies. Tasted very good. We also had Chicken Fried rice, which was kinda okay and Noodle Oodle special Veg Hakka Noodles. It was quite nice as well. Then we had Chicken tossed in hunan sauce, which I didn't find good to be honest and Sliced Lamb in Black Pepper Sauce. This one was quite good. For desserts, we had Honey Dates with raisins. This came with a chocolate ice cream as well. Didn't like the pancakes; they had a filling of dates in them but the ice cream was fine.
Overall, this is a quite nice and decent place to dine in.

Just opposite to Diamond Plaza, we visited this fairly new chinese joint for a Saturday lunch. The restaurant has a suitable ambience to go with the Chinese theme. While entering we discovered that there's an offer on the Little app and opted for the same. The person attending us (forgot to ask his name) was very helpful and courteous - helped us by accurately explaining the dishes on offer and helping with the booking process; also popping up couple of times to make sure every dish was good and if we liked it. Would rate the service a solid 4.5.

Coming to the food, we had 2 mocktails i.e. Blue Lagoon, chicken sweet corn soup, Lat Mai Kai (dices of chicken tossed in sauce and garlic) as starter, Hunan chicken and veg fried rice, ending with a couple of scoops of chocolate ice cream. The food was tasty and quantities were generous, enough for a couple but not awe-inspiring. It is probably the best chinese you can get in this area though!

Final verdict: a good option if you would like to have decent chinese food after a shopping spree or a movie at the mall, or a casual date without burning a hole in your pocket!

When you walk into Noodle Oodle as a Vegetarian you might think of ordering the same old plate of noodles and Manchurian unless you go through the variety that they really have to offer.
It's myriad and spectacular. Both the quality and quantity bowled me over. I ordered 3 treasure vegetable in pepper sauce and every bite had the juices of the fresh, well chopped vegetables and flavours intact. The garlic fried rice didn't look/taste greasy as it does in most Chinese restaurants.
The ambience has been taken good care of with oriental instrumentals playing in the background, just at the right decibel. The staff has been well trained to teach us laymen how to use the chopsticks. Overall experience has been very satisfying and a big thumps up for using fresh ingredients!

Situated just opposite to the diamond plaza mall, this eatery, demanded attention with their new quirky look. Very easy to spot and was located on the first floor. 

The ambiance is nothing too different, just that a glass wall, just next to the busy road and in front of the all, makes it nice, really nice to look at, while dining or having a conversation

Being it post Diwali, i found it empty at around 7 30 pm in the evening. We had a seat of our choice and since being full, we just went for snacks, and we just went for dry chili chicken to kill some tome conversing. the paper lanterns hanging from the roof, gives that Asian street feel.

The food was good, just as it was supposed to be and i liked the way they give the bill, in a bowl.
Overall, would visit again for another round of dining

This place is located bang opposite to Diamond Plaza mall on a busy road. It was during the Diwali time we thought of exploring this newly opened food joint. Without keeping any expectations we thought of trying out this restaurant.

It was on the 1st floor with chairs and tables arranged in rows and hanging chinese lanterns to add zeal to the ambience. The place was dimly lit and the service was quite welcoming and courteous.

We ordered chicken manchow soup, pan fried noodles and dry chilli chicken. We didnt want to experiment much with any new dishes so went for conventional ones. They mentioned that their speciality was that they dont use aajinamoto in their dishes to bring out the flavours which was really an impressive attempt.

Finally the dishes were served and we were not at all disappointed. Though it might not be considered to be topclass but the food was cooked well and I somehow liked the taste. The soup was nice but it required a bit of salt whereas the noodles was crisp teemed with lots of veggies and it was well prepared. The dry chilli chicken was the best one which added a smoky favour and had the right amount of spices. So we simply cant ignore the fact that inspite of being a novice restaurant their food was quite reasonable and piquant.
Hope to visit this place again to try something else and would surely suggest everyone to come down to have a nice experience.

The world's tastiest food is made from the world's dirtiest Kitchen. This restaurant fully justifies the above statement.
Heard of this restuarant a lot from friends and relatives that it serves the best Chinese in the area,so tried it.
Located on the 1st floor, just opposite to Diamond Plaza ,u just can't miss it.
The place was crowded and we had to wait,as I was with 3 other people. Now there was a 6 seater empty but they kept us waiting,as we were 4.Eventually later on a group of 4 only occupied that seat,ok leave that.
Now they were very fast in taking the order.I was impressed.we ordered Stir fried fish Mongolian Style and Drums of Heaven for starters.
The fish was amazing,spicy and just perfect.But the lollypop was just Street material which you get for 10 a piece.
Now we ordered Pad Thai noodles,Hunan chicken and Noodle Woodle Special fried rice.
It took them almost 45 mins to prepare I guess and after repeated reminder they servered the food.
The Pad Thai noodles was just awesome,spicy tasted like pasta but some what like a spicy Hakka pasta but very good.
Now when we were about to start the rice,found a hair in the rice. Called the waiter and he apologized and said ok,i will change the rice and chicken.
Ok mistakes might happen once but twice. The next rice again had a hair. This time the manager apologies and made the rice complimentary.
So overall delayed service, unhygienic food and probably the BEST Chinese in this baguiati Nagerbazer area in terms of only taste. Please choose whether you want hygienic food or tasty food as u might just find one here.

Situated opposite Diamond plaza mall, u can recognize it by its vibrant color and distinctive appearance from the outside. 
Its nice little( not so little, seating capacity is around 50+) place to spend your evening and to satisfy Chinese craving. Yeah...its probably best Chinese outlet in Nagerbazar locality. And trust me Chinese tastes like Chinese. There are multiple off beat Chinese preparations in the menu and they taste good( few are mind blowing) . For the people( like me)  who like "Lamb" , its a delight to have it in there menu. 
Dishes comes with two variety Regular & Large, so u can choose. Deserts are nice but bit expensive according to me. Rest all good.... Double thumbs up from my side.
Enjoy..............

Well... now the food was not ' the best ' but it was good. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn and lat mai kai for starters..both the dishes were good. Then for main course we ordered burnt garlic butter fried rice.. pad thai noodles... and butter garlic steamed prawn.. the rice was really nice.. noodles was good too. But the prawn wasn't properly cooked.. 
Overall its  good... Will definitely go there again to try other foods..

Visited this place last Friday.Was a bit confused of the quality as the ratings were not good but i really Liked it.It's a new addition in the list of restaurants in jessore road.After Many Years  a Pure Chinese Restaurant is in locality.  Decorations are nice, nice ambience accompanied by Chinese music in the background. Waiters were  well behaved. We ordered Crispy Baby corn as starters and  Sliced lamb in black pepper sauce and noodle oodle special hakka Mixed Fried Rice as main course. Starters & Fried Rice was good but the lamb was not up to the mark. Got hard towards the end of the meal. Will visit the place again but this time will try some chicken dishes.

The ambience is nice... both the quality n quantity of food is good.. pocket friendly...I think some variety in mocktail nd desert should be there...nd most importantly some pork dishes should be added in menu as it's a Chinese food joint..

A decent place for dining.. ambience is ample but the seating arrangement is pretty haphazard.Ordered a regular size prawn in schezwan sauce.the size of the prawn was quite small though the preparation was tasty.Wok hakka mixed noodles and Cantonese noodles with schezwan sauce was also nicely prepared.Many items from the menu were unavailable including the dimsum platters still i would say people who prefer Chinese cuisine should give a try..

Been to the restaurant infact sitting in the restaurant and writing the review about the environment and food. Environment and the restaurant is Above Average but the Food is below average for the amount they are charging for every dish in their menu. Limited number of Items in the Menu Card where few items was not available.

The name of the restaurant sounds pretty cool. Even the decoration inside the restaurant is well decorated, which appeals that it is a Chinese restaurant. 
But coming to the food, the food is very average like any other normal Chinese restaurant. And it is absolutely nothing extraordinary. 
For the starters, I had ordered a Fish starter of Basa fish, which was too spicy and that was absolutely not a starter because no one can eat that fish's preparation as starter for its excessive spiciness. Even for the main course we ordered Noodle Oodle Special Mixed Rice, which tasted very ordinary but, as it was mixed the prawns in that rice were rotten, they were smelling bad. With the rice we also ordered one Chicken's side dish which was also again a ordinary one. But the chicken was coated with a batter and was fried and then was put into the gravy, that batter by which the chicken was coated was undercooked.
Now coming to the staff's servicing, firstly they are very slow . Secondly they are not well organised how to help there customers. 
Overall, I would say not a worthy one to try for once even.

Located opposite Diamond Plaza Mall, Nagerbazar Noodle Oodle had a packed Friday night today given the long weekend coming up, when we entered the place. Decent decor. Average service. Good food. Started with the smoked chicken which was clearly the best of the course. Loved those chicken tossed in black Spicey sauce. In the main course we ordered the signature chicken Cantonese noodles which was really nice flooded with veggies, though their schezwan chicken wasn't upto the mark. Accompanied with masala thumbs up, I did enjoy my meal but the monotonous music was a real turn off. Please do something about this because it's a mood killer. All in all Noodle Oodle is easy on pocket, serves decent chinese food so if you are searching a place with mainly these two filters, go for it.

Wanted to try this new place, so after our movie we stepped in. The Ambiance was good and well decorated. 
We made ourselves comfortable and ordered Chill chicken dry, smoked chicken and chilly garlic schezwan noodles..  The chilli chicken, i felt wasn't cooked properly,  Smoked chicken was okayish and the shezwan noodles was good..  The service was  slow and they need to step up the pace. ..   For dessert we ordered Honey noodles oodles in Almonds flakes, didn't expect what i thought but it was something new and i enjoyed it. Overall its a good place to hang out with friends ..
                    

EDIT :  The place has CHANGED BIG TIME... AMAZING FOOD  but they need to increase more option for desserts ...

Believe it or not, on my third attempt I able to have a dining here. And yes this place deserve much better rating than 3.4, while you compare the food and as well as the cost.

Location: just opposite to the diamond city mall, dum dum.

Decoration: I found the place a bit clumsy, but Chinese decoration is very nice indeed.

Now coming to the food segment.

Starters:
______________

1. Hot garlic fish: it is very very good in taste. The chili n garlic flavour is just perfect. Fish is well cooked.

Main course:
__________________

1. Pad Thai noodles: this is just amazing in taste. The lemon flavour in this is just make the dish more more perfect.

2. Chicken in hot garlic sauce: we took the regular one. Having 6 pieces of chicken. Well cooked and nice taste. Going very well with the noodles.

3. Butter garlic steamed prawn : very good in taste. White gravy. I like this one.

Have to able to try many items on the 1st visit. Like to visit again.

Main drawback:
__________________

This is the major concern here the no. Of service person is very less. We waited almost 7 mins to get the menu card. And I , myself had to ask for it. Need to improve on that, humble request to management.

But yes a pretty good experience. Hope you will improve more. Overall a pretty good experience.

Good chinise and tastey also.
Cost :1120 for two person.

It does not matter how the ambience of a restaurant is if the food does not match up to it....that is exactly what is wrong with this place. With so many good Chinese food joints in the city, this place will find it real tough to sustain, if they continue to serve the below par food they are serving right now. The location might draw people for a while,but they are in real danger of being 'found out' real soon unless they overhaul the quality of food served.

We asked for replacement, even the replacement had hair. Probably hair is one of the cooking ingredient. Staff behavior was boderline rude. Even had to pay in cash since their POS was not working. Will not be visiting again.

Worst experience in this Durga Puja. The only satisfaction was their decorations. But poor service. Only a single person who takes the order for whole restaurant. They must change their cheff. I am pretty sure he/she don't even know the proper recipes. We got our food after 1hour almost. We ordered Ginger pepper chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken, fish in oyster sauce. The rice had hardly one or two pieces of chicken. The kung pao chicken was totally flop. The chicken pieces was so hard and stored long for sure. The recipe was also imperfect. The fish item was acceptable. Very disappointed.

Utter disappointment....I would not be able to get onto the food part because this restaurant opens at 1p.m. although in zomato it has made the committment to open at 11.00 a.m. We reached there 10 mins. Ago which is at 12.20pm to meet regret of the authorities..Learn to be honest and live meet stated time.This is really disgusting at the time of pujas. Kudos to your business plans that you open at 1 p.m. during pujas.

Visited on nabami afternoon 2016 for lunch with a friend. Waited for 30min for a table. After getting a table too we had to wait for around 30-40min more for service. No one came to give us water or menu card. We had to call for it innumerable times. Ordered sweet corn soup, mixed fried rice, chilly garlic chicken & soft drink. Way too costly. Fried rice was in sufficient amount. Our bill was 727rs. Service is so poor i would suggest none of my friends or family to go there. We went on asking for water or a plate to eat. And to top it all the food was cold af and tasteless. Ambience is the only reason to rate it 1.0

Visited on Saptami evening for dinner. Tried Lak Ma Tai as a starter after waiting an hour for a table. It was amazingly prepared, delicious. But the quantity was less for the price. Ordered for Cantonese Mixed noodles, which was also good. Really liked the preparation. Quantity was again less for the price kept. Tried their Wok tossed Hakka noodles too. It was just okay, nothing much to talk about.

Will rate this joint a 3.5/5 as the price is on averagely higher side with quantity so less. Still would recommend a visit apart from the Puja days to savour their offering. :)

Chinese with a tangy twist !!
Why do you go to any restaurant? For good food right, everything comes secondary !!! Yes ! So this place really has amazing lip smacking, finger licking good Chinese food !! Their menu has different things to offer not like the usual Chinese menu stuffs ! Its like a twist !! I had ordered Chilli garlic noodle and garlic chicken ... it was totally yummy !! Specially the noodles !!! 👌🏻👌🏻 
Now the secondary yet important things ! 
The staffs were really polite, welcoming and courteous! Orders very fairly quick keeping in mind the puja rush we have in town. 
The restaurant is petite enough to give you a china theme feeling with those red Chinese lanterns on the ceiling !! 
Definitely gonna visit again! Amazing food!

I took a visit to this somewhat newcomer last Monday after watching a movie at the adjacent PVR. Instead of the regular Arsanal, Aminia and Alibaba (Situated nearby) that our family generally prefer, we decided to try this new kid. The ambience and interiors were simply mind blowing, resembling Chinese restaurants. We ordered Noodle Oodle Special Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Pan Fried Cantonese Noodles, Honey Lemon Chicken, Crispy Chilly Baby Corn, American Non Veg Chop Suey, Soft Drink, and Honey Dates with Raisin. The staffs were very cooperative, and helped us in selecting perfect quantities and dishes that would suit our choice. 
Coming to the foods, the Chop Suey was served in two different bowls. While one contained the Gravy, the other contained the Crispy Noodles covered by a layer of egg. Quantity and quality were okay.
The Baby Corn was quite spicy but was tasty. Quantity was pretty good, but is not recommended for people having disliking towards hot and spicy foods.
The Pan Fried Mixed Cantonese Noodle came as a gravy version, and was well cooked. Quality and quantity impressed me, even though the solitary drawback would be that the chicken, egg and mushrooms lacked a bit among the vegetables.
The Noodle Oodle Special Mixed Hakka Noodles came in a big bowl, and was more than enough for a single person, and again came covered with a layer of egg. Quality was also very good, and as a surprise, it contained mutton along with chicken, egg, prawn and mushroom.
The mighty letdown was when we ordered for the dessert. Baked Ice Cream, and Banana Fritters with Vanilla Ice Cream were not available. So I ordered Honey Dates with Raisins. The dish came either with chocolate ice cream, or vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. I opted for the vanilla. It took almost 20 minutes for the dish to cone, and quantity was way too poor. At 150 bucks, the ice cream's quantity was even less than the small cup ice cream that are available at any ice cream parlors.
Overall, my first experience here was okay, with a mixture of being satisfied, and not so satisfied. The time taken for the dishes to be served was too long, and irritating at times. But being a new kid, I hope things will improve with time. Coming to value for value, it's a nice place to bet on, as the dishes come at quite reasonable price (With the dessert being an exception). For all the food we ordered, it cost us 1350 bucks. For foodies, I would recommend to have a bite here at least once.

The Interior decor is good with nice baground music gives u feel of chinese community

We ordered:- Burnt butter galic mixed Fried Rice & chicken with hot garlic sauce

Fried rice was just to good all it flavours was coming out nicely the butter garlic blend made it special a must hav dish if u visit this place & it comes with a very good quantity as well.......CHICKEN WITH HOT GARLIC SAUCE was tastey as well but one thing is that u people should improve size of chicken pieces,nd u should give the customers with bowlful of gravy....we got much lesser gravy that should improve if u want gain customers satisfaction nd trust other than that we quite delighted with ur joint wala!!!!!!!!

I went along with my family today and must admit that it has a really nice ambience.. quite spacious
.. properly air conditioned.. four to six seaters.. red n black hues..Chinese lamp n balloons..thus well decorated... 

We ordered.. mixed Cantonese noodles n stir fry fish in Mongolian style.. absolutely yum!
The special mixed fried rice was also good.
The lamb with pepper n sauce was not that great but nice to go with the fried rice...

And a warm customer service... 
Will visit again.. soon!

The restaurant is just opposite diamond plaza mall so very easily can be found. 
Situated in the first floor, you enter through a narrow stretch of stairs with different chinese posters on either side and a giant laughing buddha smiling at you. 
Overall quite spacious and moderately well decorated. 
The crockery had black appearance which was nice and new too. 
Window side seat is the most preferable. 
The waiters are very courteous and have profound knowledge of their stuff. They can help a lot. Do ask if any doubt arise. 

That being said comin to food. 
Lat mai khai as starter
Mixed fried rice noodle oodle special
Chicken in chilly garlic sauce. 

The starter was very good. 
Probably the best I had in a few days. 
The gravy the sauce the taste the spices the mix the blend everything was on point. 
8 pieces of awesomeness 

Coming to fried rice. 
The rice was of sumptuous quantity. 
Contained egg chicken veggies and lamb. 
Well i had a mixed feelings I liked in its own unique way it was presented and complimented by the chicken. 
But to be fair to chinese and their dishes, this has more of south asian flavour than the chinese counterpart like Singaporean,  Indonesian etc taste were more prevalent and dominating than proper chinese authentic taste. 
Things taste exotic, feel exotic and look exotic too. 

But that doesn't mean it was bad. It was very good but in their own unique way. 

Pro- I liked the hospitality. 
Con- the chicken was too hard or not boiled properly or was stale.  Idk.  Yet it was good. 

Please have a visit you won't regret.

Checked in for the first time. A new Chinese joint on the first floor just opposite of DP. Simple decoration with Chinese lanterns and subtle music on the background. Liked the ambience.started with their manchow chicken soup which was yummylacious .Their special mixed hakka noodles and dry chilly chicken were on the average side. Chicken was succulent.Just didn liked the sweetish kinda sauce which was poured over the noodle's top. Servicing was on time.Overall had a nice time.

Visited this place for the first time. A good place to get some tasty Chinese food. We had the garlic rice with pepper lamb. It was really good. Service was excellent, we did not have to wait long for the food to arrive. The staffs, waiters are well mannered and very polite. I would love to see more innovations in their menu in the days to come. Listed as my regulars from now on :)

Ambience : good. To be honest they have tried their best to make the place look like "china-town" with the floating colored lamps and pseudo chinese music. Coming to the food I really liked their Chilli Garlic noodles. The other dishes I ordered were lat mai and chicken in hunan sauce. Neither were up to the mark. Service was hospitable and the price I thought was reasonable.

Noodle Oodle is the newest destination for Chinese food in the city.So before visiting it I wanted to check out at zomato for its ratings and was shocked to see that the rating was 3.4.Nevertheless I visited this place today and I was shocked that the rating at zomato is so low.

We arrived at 1:30 pm and found the restaurant 3/4th full.We had booked a table beforehand so we were shown to our seats immediately.I noted the decorations and found that the restaurant was decoreated by Chinese lamps and low lighting.
The waiter arrived and we started ordering.

For starters we ordered smoked chicken,lat Kai mai (which was chicken deep fried and tossed in sauce) and crispy chilli baby corn.The food took some time to arrive but the wait was worthy.The smoked chicken was cooked to perfection and left my taste buds tingling for more.The lat Kai mai chicken was also delicious.The crispy chilli baby corn was really crispy and tasted the best of the lot. The starters had 10 pieces and was sufficient for us (we were a group of 8).

Coming to the main course we had noodle oodle special mixed fried rice,noodle oodle special Hakka chowmein and chilly garlic noodles.For side dish we took chicken hunan and fish tossed in oyster sauce. 
The food had the taste of authentic Chinese and was pleasing to the taste buds.The chicken fried rice was topped with an omelette and it had adequate portions of chicken,prawn,corn,zucinni and lamb.With it the fish and oyster sauce tasted  heaven.The fish also had mushrooms in it.The chilli garlic noodles tasted a bit spicy to me but went well with the hunan chicken.We ended our lunch with a fresh lime soda.

To tell the truth I was literally surprised to see such low rating when the food along with its quantity and quality deserves nothing less than 4.5. The food quality was on a level equal to China town's Chinese maybe even better than that.My only one complaint is that the service is a little slow.

Apart from that the food has total value for money.Hoping to drop by soon again for another luncheon.

Climb the stairs to enter this restaurant as you are greeted by the laughing Buddha statue at the top of the stair. The interior is done well in black and red, but I thought is a bit overdone with the lighting. Also, the music playing should be a notch softer.
Now coming to the food. I had chicken Manchow soup, chicken tossed in season sauce and Hakka chicken noodles.
Manchow was a bit thicker than required, which according to my taste buds took away on the taste a bit.
Chicken tossed in season sauce was delicious. The sauce tasted exquisite and the chicken was tender.
I liked the chicken Hakka noodles, though the veggies could have been grated a bit more, got a chunk of cabbage on my plate!
Mouth freshener arrives in the form of sugar coated fennel. Visit this place if you are looking for a tidy place for a dinner with your family, courteous service, though a bit on the slower side for those who are looking for a timed dinner, and a midrange restaurant.

Noodle Oodle is one of those good looking Chinese restaurants we had been waiting for for a long time at this stretch of the Jessore Road. And from the moment you step in you will find the ambience quite soothing and living up to your expectations. But then for some strange reasons the great experience will abruptly stop at that. Because when it comes to food and service, there is something so visibly lacking.Lets talk about the food first - the food is average to say, it is good, decent, but not to a level that will keep bringing you back. We visited here twice till now, and in both the occasion found the food rather salty. Also the offerings are quite average and the menu doesn't stores much surprise. I would suggest sticking to the time tested fried rice/noodles and chilli chicken.Now about the service - I found the team a little dull and less motivated. It may take ages for the food to take the trip from the kitchen to your table, the attendants are courteous but not that quick or committed enough. One area which needs a huge improvement if they want to make a good name for themselves.Ambience - Quite well, 4.5/5 and the music gives it such an oriental feel. But the quality of food and service needs to improve a lot for the ratings to increase.

The main dish was Schezwan noodles which was very oily and had a very cheap feel to it...
The chicken was again overcooked...
The ambiance is the only plus point of this place... but beware i found the plates to be dusty and dirty...

The have decorated the place nicely, it looks pretty from the ground floor. The problem is they have put in too many tables and we had to move our chairs when the tables behind me and my partner got filled up. The persons taking our order and serving us were good. We ordered a rice preperation along with chicken in garlic sauce both were nice. Later we decided to have hakka noodles too, it was a disaster, no taste at all. Some quality controll needed.

Noodle Oodle is the newest destination for Chinese food.

##Location:Located just opposite to the Diamond Plaza Mall this biggie can be very easily located from the road itself.

##Experience:
Dropped in to this place on a Friday evening for dinner. It's spacious and very neatly decorated. For the food we ordered:

Smoked chicken for starters which was suggested by them and turned out to be a lovely dish to start with. Followed by my all time favorite Pan Fried Cantonese Noodles along with a fish dish named Pla neuw manoi made with corriender sauce with added veggies like bok choy capsicum etc added to it. 
Their food really impressed me no doubt as compare to quality the pricing has been done decently. 

And the best part is the hospitality and service which was excellent. All the servers were very attentive. My special mention would be Mr. Arindam who has been a fantastic host of the evening for us. Thanks a lot for such a wonderful experience.

They claim that they do the Chinese right. Ok. They have done the location right (rather perfect). The interior right. The food almost right. But they do all the thing wrong in Service. The waiters have no clue how to talk or greet. They can't guide you to choose proper dishes and side dishes. And the dishes are served too too late. However, the quantity and quality of food is good. We ordered Wok tossed hakka noodles. That was fair enough. Kong pao kai was also good- a bit sweet, a bit sour, full of cashew nuts. Though the tastes are more like street food and lacks the delicacy, still worth trying.

On a rainy evening, this place was almost full. We liked the decor of this place, the red Chinese lamps, the Chinese background music. The staff was helpful in choosing the dishes. We ordered honey lemon chicken- it was average. Then mixed noodle oodle special rice, noodle oodle special hakka chowmein, chicken tossed with choice of your sauce- hunan sauce.All tasted average. The noodles tasted a little better than the rice. Quantity was good. There's plenty of scope to make the dishes far more better. Hope they will improve further.

Well this place is worth visiting as it is the only place offering authentic chinese cuisine in the area. The interior decor is quite good with well behaved staff. The food is just above average and there is a lot of scope for improvement. For starters we ordered pan fried chilli fish and crispy konjee lamb. The fish was good but the lamb was a bit undercooked and felt stiff and chewy. For main course we ordered szechuan haka noodles and american chopsuy. The staff felt a bit uneasy while serving chopsuy. The noodles tasted nice and spicy but the chopsuy was a big thumbs down owing to its tasteless gravy. With this we ordered hunan chicken which was just ok. Didn't get time to taste any desert. Not going to be judgemental but i guess this place can do with a bit improvement in their food and staff quality and should offer more choice of dishes on the menu.

I found this place to be one of the better ones Kolkata has to offer. Quantity wise this place is just pure gold. The menu is pretty standard and nothing to fancy except for a few items. The food they serve is quite tasty and the décor is amazing. Price is standard. Do give this place a visit, you will have a good time I'm sure.

The newest eat house on Jessore Road is this funky Chinese eatery just opposite to Diamond Plaza and beside Aditya Academy, Noodle Oddle. So what, its got to offer you?...well oodles of dishes with a dash of authenticity of Chinese culinary.

A steady flight of stairs help you reach this hunt on the first floor. The door gets opened for you and you are welcomed into a petite eatery decorated with all reddish shades of Chinese candles and a stretch of glass pane that offers a view of the road beneath. A light Chinese tune completes the ambience. Dinky tables with chic cutlery make your experience pleasant.

The menu, as mentioned earlier, offers a variety of Chinese delicacies many of which ae not common names beyond Kolkata's own ''Little China'' area. We ordered for Schezwan Mixed Fried Rice, Wok Tossed Mixed Noodles and Hunan Chicken(large). The rice was peppery and justly spiced and aromatic. Its neither too hot nor too plain and offers a tasteful experience to your taste buds. On a personal note I will rank the noodle preparation below the one made of rice. The noodle strings tasted a bit flat. However, its served with humble amount of shreds of meat, prawns, scrambled eggs and vegetables. The chicken was a perfect complementary for the spicy rice dish and heavily stuffed noodle dish. A large plate offers ten pieces of boneless chicken and a regular one offers six(probably). The chicken dish was lightly flavoured and stirred with diced chili peppers and onions. The quantity is a bit tricky to handle. A single plate is just a little less than what is enough for two but two plates are sufficient for three. 

The staff is generally helpful. We placed order in two installments. The second tray reached our table faster than the first which took more time than what was said.

The house provides for a more-or-less reasonably priced menu. Though the VAT they charge remains unmentioned till you get your bill at your table. A major drawback of payment procedure is that they do not accept cards.

This food venture proffers a mixed service and toothsome culinary experience and is recommended for visits with loved ones.

They are located just opposite the diamond city mall. The place is decorated very generically. Not that it looks bad , but doesnt really standout. The staffs are very confused all the time and are yet unprepared for this job. The food took quite a long time to be served . I would have been okay with that had the food turned out to be good. We had ordered the hakka noodles and chilli chiken. The noodles ,hardly had any spice penetrated deep inside. The chilli chicken was full of sauce and i could hardly find any other taste to it for the sauce being too Much. They surely need some time to set up properly.

I was quite sure that these may not make me happy, but I must say they proved me completely WRONG.
I ordered Noodle Oodle special Hakka Veg Noodle #Yes these veg noodles do have veg ,Masala Coke ,which is decorated superbly #very impressed
Chicken in hot garlic sauce and Three Treasure Vegetables in Pepper Garlic Sauce,..
Being at these place for long ,I think these place good in Chinese foodies .
I will definitely give extra brownie points for the decor of the restaurant.

Visited this place yesterday for the first time. It has a vibrant decor with the chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling. Great hospitality was provided. However, some more choices of items must be added in the menu. The burnt garlic chicken rice and the hunan chicken was good, the latter being a tad bit spicy. We also ordered chicken hakka noodles which tasted average. If you're in and around nagerbazar and hunger calls, this place can be given a try.

In onw word "Pathetic"
Located opposite diamond plaza,jessore road. 
The worst thing about the restaurant is the management, the waiters are clueless what to do. When we went there, seven tables were vacant, I asked a waiter where can we sit? He was clueless and asked me to wait for 5 minutes and went to the manager to ask,returned with a solution. We were forced to change our seats twice as requested by the waiters. Finally we get to sit on the same table from where it all started. The menu was short. We ordered crispy chili baby corn,noodle oodle chicken fried rice and sliced lamb in black pepper sauce. Apart from the baby corn..we didn't like anything. The rice was full of veggies..we found 5-6 small pieces of chicken only, the lamb was under cooked,the spoon failed to divide the pieces, but thanks to my teeth,finally we shared. Overall a very bad experience, but frankly I don't blame the waiters,I blame the manager, the waiters looked scared, they were forced to speak english with every customers, they need permission to do everything I guess. I would suggest if you really want to have good Chinese foods,go somewhere else, you will find lot of options nearby.

This food joint is probable the best place to have Chinese in that vicinity! 

Location: This one is just opposite to Diamond Plaza mall, so pretty easy to locate

Food:  We have ordered Cantonese Mixed noodle and Hunan Style Chicken. The Noodle was full of exotic vegetables, prawn, shredded chicken and lamb. The best part was that they didn't made indo-chinese version of the dish and kept the white sauce blunt  which was real good.

Hunan Style chicken was also nicely spiced with nothing but burnt red chilies and very good in taste too.

Both the dishes were good in quantity, a real value for money. You need to pay VAT and service tax over the price mentioned here.

Service: Staffs and manager were really helpful and courteous.  The guy who took the order, was having proper idea of the dishes. Only thing that could be improved is the service time I guess. This small order took them 20 minutes to serve.

Ambiance : Decor is simple and nice with rice paper lamps and comfy chairs.

Overall a very good place to have excellent Chinese food without burning a hole in your pocket.

It was 3 PM, so I was too hungry to take a snap of food! :(

A new place has opened up in Jessore Road, just opposite of Diamond Plaza Mall. Recently saw this place and gave it a try yesterday. 

Food:
We ordered Lat Mai Kai, Chicken Cantonese Noodles, Veg Manchurian and Veg Fried rice. Lat Mai Kai was deep fried spicy chicken balls, very nicely cooked and I loved it totally. The Cantonese noodles had a ton of vegetables and chicken. It was insanely tasty and the portion was great. The Fried Rice was usual nothing extraordinary and the Manchurian was less spicy (we ordered it that way) and it also managed to tickle our taste buds.

Ambience: 
The décor is very simple. The Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling and the red color gives it vivacious look.

Service:
They need to improve on this. It was a usual weekday and the place was very empty still they took a very long time to serve the dishes.

Lastly, they don’t accept cards.

Location is good, just opposite to Diamond plaza.
Nicely decorated.  Food quality and taste is okay, nothing great.
A few items in the menu are unique. Probable signature dishes. nice staffs!

Only bad thing: Cards not accepted and the music they play mostly are old Hindi songs and does not go with the theme at all.

One of the numerous chinese restaurants that's been cropping up in our city like mushrooms. We ordered chicken hotNsour soup, Smoked lamb & chicken lemonNgarlic. Although the soup was hot, the other two were cold with a hint of bitter taste in the lemonNgarlic chicken. 
Tastewise not droolworthy. Plus the items were not cheap. Out total bill cost around 700/- with taxes.
You can definitely give it a miss.

Located just opposite to Diamond plaza, Nagerbazar. The food was good and worth the wait. Not only that, the quantity of each dish is enough to serve two persons. The place very well decorated and very well maintained and so are the stewards who are very well behaved.

Spotted this place bang opposite diamond plaza mall few weeks back wanted to give it a try. Decided to take away lunch this Sunday. A simple inside with cluttered Chinese lanterns hanging from the top. On a Sunday afternoon, it was empty. I ordered their special fried rice, fish pla mewong and Hunan chicken. The rice was slightly spicy with ample vegetables like zucchini corn and chicken and wrapped by an omelette. Tasted good. The fish with lemon coriander sauce and bok choy was good. It was light yet flavory. The chicken was decent. The quality of fish is good. They offer the side dishes in large and regular size with six and ten pieces respectively and I think it's a good option. Prices decently, overall a nice experience. Their tag line says they do Chinese best and I feel their food is decent and honest. Would love to see some more options on the menu card.

The ambience of the place is pleasing and relaxing, the food is pretty good considering the lack of Chinese restaurants in the area. Be prepared to wait for the food since the place is new and there is a rush which is hard for them to handle. The staff is courteous. the only thing that the place lacks probably is good music. Im sure they will get better with time. One dish that we specifically liked was schezwan rice, the Manchurian was good too.

I like the place because food is very good. Decoration is average, staff is average and they serve very late. Last time when I visit there, they took 25 mins to serve a plate noodle and a gravy. Its a good restaurant to have lunch or dinner with friends. They have 4 people sitting arrangement per table.

Situated at the opposite of diamond plaza mall, noodle oodle is a nice Chinese restaurant. I have visited there with my family member. We have tried oak tossed veg noodle and kung pao kai chicken as a side dish. Both the item are tasty specially the side dish. The ambiance and the staff behavior is very nice and warm. Its quite reasonable restaurant where you can go and hang out with your friends and family.

We went for dinner on 8th of July. Noodle-Oodle is highly equipped with good staff and ambience. Food quality was good with reasonable prices. It is located in my locality and I can just say it provides the best Chinese in that area.But, I was not satisfied with the delayed service. We were offered food after 40 mins from our order tym.

Had to go because every time you come out of PVR, u see a roof full of Chinese lanterns through glass of this newly opened restaurant. I would say a nice attempt to make a decent eating place in this area where we lack them. Food tastes good. Ambiance is like normal chinese restaurants. Pinch in pocket lil high compared to the location it has opened. Also they are not accepting cards so be prepared on ur visit. Waiters are attentive. Best thing we liked are the regular and large portions of dishes in menu. So u can order as per your requirement.

Was able to get an entry to the restaurant after trying for the second time... The food quality is fair enough and the quantity is quite high and all these comes at a very reasonable price.. The restaurant is very well adorned and the staffs are friendly too... Only one disheartening factor is that it doesn't accept payment through cards..

A  visit to the Chinese restaurant Noodle Oodle on a weekend was a delightful experience. We were greeted by smiling waiters and were offered a nice and cosy seat. The ambience was very comfortable.
The food proportion was enough for two thus making it pocket friendly. Chicken drumsticks are worth a mention.

I can really  feel  the flavors of good Chinese again.  We went there for a family party everything was awesome,specially the ambiance and conduct of the management.You could tell the chef put the care into the food. You feel it is love and care as if a meal was being cooked for their own family.  I would really recommend this place and plan on going back as many times as I can.If you are planning to visit there please have the smoking chicken its really awesome.Yes, as per there tagline they really do the Chinese right.

Food is great...Exceptional ambience...Price is okay !!! But service is pathetic and delayed...we had to wait for 30 mins for the food to serve though there were hardly any customers...staffs are not trained at all...they are confused themselves. We ordered for the special hakka noodles, kung pao chicken and a shirley temple mocktail with floating ice cream. The complete rating for this newly opened restaurant is totally for its quality food and superb ambience. Hope the service will improve with time.

The first time I went there, despite the timing mentioned the shop was closed.i came back at their mentioned time. Again they were yet to open the shop. I get it that they have just started the restaurant a few days ago. But come on you are a part of Aditya group , tardiness and unpreparedness on your part is not accepted. So guys you lost a point there. The service was also delayed. And how can they forget people might need second serving of water. Now to the ambience. Ambience ,ain't anything great, just a clichéd copy of Chinese themes. I do like their seat covers though. And the food , well I ordered drum sticks. The drum sticks were nice. It had a sweet tangy taste. I can definitely recommend this. But then came the noodles and lut me and a chilli chicken . The lut me wasn't up to my expectations. But it's something you can try. The noodles were simply bad . I could hardly feel any dive. Given the price they charge i expected better. And the chilli chicken was also average. So this is a maybe place. It's very nearby to dc mall. So if you want a new option . You might give this a try. Hopefully they will get better with time.

Ambience, cutlery and crocery was bang on. Food was not consistently good.Some dishes were awesome while others were lost cause.The worst part is their staff.There was a total mismanagement.You have to wait for eternity to meet your request.After finishing our meal we had to wait 30 minutes and 5 calls for bill to appear.The manager has the audacity to tell me that they are very busy with other customers so the delay is justified..Then I realised that they were telling that to all their customer.Some of them lost their cool which led to arguments.Very bad experience

Beautiful decor. Best during evening. Food is above average. And staff is not upto the mark. Hope they will uplit these things.
We ordered mixed schezwan fried rice- 3/5 (it was just too much spicy)
Chicken burnt garlic butter fried rice- 5/5
Chicken in schezwan sauce- 4/5
Seafood wanton soup- 4.5/5
They charge Rs 30 for a Rs 12 coke bottle!! -_-
The quality and quantity of food was decent.
The menu has very less to offer which is a minus point.
Overall its a good restaurant for Chinese food lovers. ❤

Not at all good. Apart from the interior nothing is good. The food was very much over priced compared to the quantity. I ordered chilli chicken dry (Rs. 180). There were 10 peanut size pieces of chicken. Then I ordered fried rice(Rs. 170). It was under cooked and the taste was not good. Chilli garlic chicken(Rs. 180) was awful. Chicken was also smelling bad. Wasted my money.

I am the first one to give a review on this restaurant. It is located at a very populated place, that is, just beside my school , Aditya Academy and opposite to Diamond Plaza. A Chinese restaurant. They give 10% off to all Adityans. Pretty spacious and is beautifully decorated. Food quality is okay types. Prices are not so reasonable.
