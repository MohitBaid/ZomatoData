Been here many times. It's close to my home so I keep visiting it. I've tasted many items but I love their fried rice the most. I also love the drums of heaven , sweet and sour chicken. The biryani is also worth a try

Ambience is great.
Conveyance is a little problem though.
Food is obviously great taste..
Quantity is sufficient or you could say more than enough for one adult person.
Do try their Mongolian chicken along with noodles you will just love it.

Went in here for a lunch with a Scowling stomach screaming for food. Decor and interior ambience of the place is fantastic. Staff courteousness and Services are prompt and Humble. 

Now, coming to the food. Let me warn you that whatever you order, just keep in mind that their quantity for one plate is good for Four people. The quality of food is also awesome. We ordered:

Chilli Chicken Dry (Shredded) - 5/5
Chicken in Oyster Sauce - 5/5
Thai Noodle - 5/5
Chicken Hakka - 5/5

The food was great and Voluminous. But prices are a bit high. But again, great things come at good costs. 
Will surely visit this place again with friends and family.

It is mandatory to visit Hatari on my birthday. We had Mixed gravy noodles, chicken fried rice, crispy chicken, pan fried chilli fish , manchurian chicken and green chilli fish! The quantity was enough for 8 of us. One plate of rice was enough for 3. As well the quality  was too good! The bill for all these was just 2500/-(with tax). This is my favourite chinese restaurant and would recommend everyone to try this out!
