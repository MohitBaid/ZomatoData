Taj Bengal offers an unparalleled atmosphere right from the moment one steps into the lobby. 
It has the perfect setting for a relaxing cuppa in The Promenade Lounge to chat away a sluggish 
evening. 
The menu is quite diverse from Italian, Indian, to even desserts but I usually end up ordering appetisers to go with the coffee. 
One of the items worth mentioning is a delicious Homemade Mezze with salads and dips and the works. 
The presentation of their appetisers is usually simple, nothing elaborate but well portioned and tasty. 
However, one beverage I personally disliked is the Mushroom Cappuccino as the flavour of the mushrooms was too overpowering to be enjoyable. There was none of the creamy richness that has come to be associated with the soup and instead had a bitter aftertaste that may justify the cappuccino name but not its effect on the palate. 
The service has a relaxed pace that suits the mood of the patrons of the Lounge who are usually seen just hanging out. 
The place can be termed expensive but considering it’s a five star property and not an everyday dining joint, one would expect as much. 
Overall one can drop by occasionally for the ambiance and hospitality that is a Taj signature.

Just after the pleasing luxury welcome of Taj Bengal, A beautiful sitting place straight from the front gate took the eyes at a glance. Yes thats the Promenade Lounge of Taj Bengal.

The specious place is decored with statues, pots & pans, wooden chairs & tables. This place is beautiful, classy, elegant & true to the Taj Bengal standards. The ambience is lovely & makes anyone comfortable within few seconds. We ordered the following from their large menu card. Unfortunately their service is extremely slow they took quite a long to serve the food on our table.

Kolkata Beckti Fish Finger : Fish fingers were really small, filled with fresh & juicy fish. It wasn't served very hot so little but stiff feeling was present. It tasted somehow very basic, not very satisfactory.

Traditional Club Sandwich : The Club Sandwich was served the most premium way someone could expect from a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. It was huge in size served with salads & french fried garnished extreamly well that looked very delicious. Inside it was mostly filled very litely fried eggs, a very thin layer of ham & some chicken pieces. The sandwich tasted very lite & natural but nothing special. All together it was more of a tummy filling Sandwich with the luxury touch in it.

Conclusion : Taj Bengal is one of the most premium luxury hotel in Kolkata because of their excellent ambience & hospitality. So you pay for the ambience & hospitality only as their foods aren't something extraordinary. Each & every bit over here is enjoyable but this place is definitely not for foodies.

Visited this lounge located right in front of the lobby on entering, while waiting for a take away from Sonargaon. 5 star experience in terms of food, service, hospitality. I would recommend to try out their egg kathi roll which comes with chunks of boneless mutton wrapped in egg and roti - amazing taste. No doubt the prices are on the 5 star rates but its worth to try the same.

Absolutely disgusted for being served the rotten choco mousse. We were in a rush, so we wanted to have a quick bite here. We have ordered  espresso , mousse, and cheesecake. Both of the desserts were foul and terrible. Not sure if this cafe really goes on well for which they serve the rotten things from the canopy. Espresso was really substandard. Not recommending at all!

Doesn't actually lives up to the Taj Bengal standards,but always worth a try. Chocolate truffle is a must try. Staff and ambiance is as usual pretty good. The fountain in the corner makes is a enhancer. Coffees are also Good. It's usually packed with Emirates crew In the morninga for their photoshoot

After a heavy lunch at Chinooiserie, we were hanging around Taj Bengal. The dessert spread over there didn't impress us very well. So we thought of coming here and have some bakes. I must say, honestly, this place didn't live upto the actual Taj Bengal standards.
The place is spacious, guarded by railings and decorated with big pots and pans. I loved the comfy couches and big wooden chairs to sit in and have a word. The ambience was very classy and elegant. Loved it to the fullest.
The major thumbsdown were the cakes. We had taken their house special mango cheesecake as suggested by the person present at the counter and a white truffle pastry.
The Mango Cheesecake was too bad. Trust me, it made no way to live upto the Taj Bengal standards. I felt like eating a thick cheese slice over a cookie base with some not so freshly cut mangoes upon it. The White Truffle Pastry tasted good. It was creamy, the white chocolate part had the perfect balance and the cake was also delicious filled with butterscotch crumbs. I loved it though I think they priced us for the cake more for the Taj Bengal thingy compared to the quality of the cake. Portions of both the pastries were of standard sizes. But I think they can work on the baking really well as they have such wonderful La Patisserie at the same complex. Hoping for the betterment. Till then, happy dining! :)

I have always been loyal to Taj. Their hospitality is unbeatable. The Promenade Lounge is the 1st thing you will see at the royal Taj Bengal lobby. 

Ambiance: 5/5.
Food: 4.5/5. (Do try the Fish Ahoy. Also, their desserts are to die for)
Service: 5/5.
Price is reasonable considering it is a 5* property.
Portion sizes are okay.

Do visit. Highly recommended!

Went to a different restaurant at Taj to dine. Grabbed a few pastries on my way home. Not sure whether they were made at this place or came from the bakery. So this is a review of the pastries only and not of this place overall.

Must say that the three varieties that I tried, the praline, the black forest and the blue berry were among the best that I ever had in India, in fact any where. Sure they are expensive (INR 245 per piece), but when something is this good, one does not mind too much.

I attended the cherry orchid event today at taj , a lovely exhibit of clothes , Jewellery , after I was done I decided to have a quick bite at the promenade .

It was a complete disaster 
The service was non existent , I had to get up 3times to get the attention of the waiter . 
We ordered 1 cappuccino 1 expresso , cheesecake and a chicken schnitzel , the cappuccino was weak and the foam was watery , now a schnitzel is basically meat which is thinned by pounding with a meat tenderiser coated with flour , breadcrumbs , eggs and fried . 
What I got was a kebab with a sorry excuse of a salad , it was supposed to be served with potatoe wedges but I guess they didn't seem bothered to give me that even after I complained . 

Is this the kind of standard to expect from a 5 star hotel , a place were you are given importance by the car you drive and the clothes u wear . 

I rather eat a 175rs biriyani and be happy 
Terrible food and service .

Been going over the years and went recently again for a cuppa. Time seems to have stood still at this place, the trees, water...even the chairs and upholstery looks the same though the menu looked different. Good high tea and the expected Taj service which remains at the top of its game. While it's a nice place to sit for a while at the lobby, perhaps it's also time to bring in a bit of fresh imagination?

The Promenade Lounge is the best place in Taj to relax and set the mood right. The ambience alone is enough to get all the score here. Soothing music of the violin players, paintings of famous artists, comfortable seating arrangements, palm trees, rhythmic sound of dripping water, what else does one need ?

The Promenade Lounge is a nice place to stop over fror a quick bite or a snack. Ambience is good and inspite of being close to the main lobby you have reasonable privacy and a quiet relaxed atmosphere. The salads make for a good starter or a meal if youre on a health binge ! The sandwiches particularily the steak and onions is really good,as is Fish Ahoy which is fried to a golden crisp and the Beckti is soft and flaky. The Kathi roll not really on par with Nizams or Kusums as too much Capsicum and little chillies and lime squeeze abscent !1 The prawn cocktail is cool and filling but quantum of prawns is a bit low .Cold coffee was a bit milky and at 275 a bit of a ripoff .Overall the limited menu is fine for you if youre not in a fussy  mood and looking for a quick meal. Presentation and service is good.A good place to also relax over a tall fresh lime and watch the Calcutta Creme dela creme come and go.

Took my wife on a surprise date... And it was a good one... Took some time off from home office to enjoy our alone time away from everything!!! Taj this time worked... Ordered a promenade burger, frappe, exotic tea and a blueberry cheesecake... Each item was way better than the other i their own way!!! The burger was sumptuous and the cheesecake was lipsmacking!!! Finally had a blueberry cheesecake with real blueberry in Kolkata!!! A nice quiet date with my wife in one of the best lobbies in the world!!!

It is difficult to catch a bite between lunch and dinner in most Kolkata restros. Well, this time round, the coffee shop experience really worked well as we found out in Taj. The Promenade Lounge has soft live music and a motley crew of art display, it is a stage set of a very relaxed evening with a very typical English High Tea served in just the right manner! 

Service is amazing and the fact that the bite sized scones, pastries and selection of sandwiches taste authentically English is something that the chef should be commended about. Definitely fresh, the wide selection of coffees and teas can leave the best coffee shops in town behind. A must visit for anyone looking for a relaxed evening where conversations are encouraged. Very suitable for families with young children as well. Affogato is a special treat. Don't forget to try the bite sized banana and caramel cup cakes!

For absolute luxury cafe experience you should visit this place with pleasant staff and marvelous decor. Sandwich and soup was fantastic & not to miss the garnishing which was also very nice. Frappe was heavenly.  The complimentary dark-choco was also amazing.

A pair of very hungry and slightly irritated people entered Taj one hot evening and decided to chill out for the high tea. Turned out, the high tea had ended. Sigh! So we decided to go for broke and ordered some food and coffee. I have always had a complete and utter devotion towards the humble affogato, while my friend was in a surly mood, and decided to skip it in favor of good Darjeeling green tea. We also ordered Prawn Cocktail for the friend and a Steak and Onion sandwich, since we do not pass up red meat. 

I must say, the steak sandwich was EXACTLY what I wanted - juicy, spicy yet not overly so, perfect bread and great flavors. My friend was quite happy with the prawn cocktail, since I swatted away the hand which reached for a bite off my sandwich. My friend wanted dessert, but we were running late, so decided to hold that off for another day. Will return for the same soon!

One of Calcutta's fashionable address TAJ defines the new generation of style. I wish I could say its the ultimate luxury destination, in our bustling metropolis but many will disagree. So I say its the next best. The TAJ continues the tradition of defining luxury through unmatched five star service, with a contemporary spirit. Afternoon High Tea, a tradition at TAJ Promenade Lounge, blends an innovative menu with a formal tea/coffee service to provide guests a balance of service and flavorful cuisine. The tea menu is good but personally I prefer the coffee selection. A seamless fusion of traditional and modern and a passion for uncompromising service combine to create an experience that is indulgent, exquisite, and truly unforgettable.

My top picks - 
The English High Tea
Prawn cocktail 
Steak & Onion sandwich 
Club sandwich
Grilled Ham sandwich 
Nilgiri tea 
Darjeeling green
Makaibari Olong (one of my fav)
Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee
Columbian
Sumatra mandheling (one of my fav)
Hawaiian kona 

They finish by 6/6:30 - the high tea. Stroll in leisurely on a Sunday and enjoy the late afternoon, with a friend or even by yourself; some may even prefer their friendly iPad  as a companion - well who cares as long you have a good time. Enjoy !!

This is a good place for a business meeting or a catch up with friends. The English High Tea is good if your a couple of friends in the evening loooking for a nice long chat and catch up session (make sure that you have had a very light lunch). If your looking for a quick bite in a quite corner of the Taj Bengal then go for the salads or sandwiches. They are standard Taj Coffe Shop menu regulars. For the ones with a sweet tooth I love their Double Cherry Sundae. They also have a nice selection of Tea and Coffee available.

The Promenade Lounge is located at The Taj Bengal in Alipore
I highly recommend it for the atmosphere, quality, and service.
The high tea they serve with a selection of the finest cheeses, petit fours, cookies, sandwiches and what not is truly amazing !
A delicious line-up of salads, sandwiches. The cappuccinos and biscotti are also a nice treat. Besides coffee, this place has a whole variety of various snacks that you can munch on. These guys also serve burgers, grills, and griddles. They have a huge variety of teas and coffees which you can try too.

Good place and ambience to hold your meetings and have snacks. But the tea (served as First or Second Flush) are not really good. You may find a artist drawing your sketch-I like it but would you?
