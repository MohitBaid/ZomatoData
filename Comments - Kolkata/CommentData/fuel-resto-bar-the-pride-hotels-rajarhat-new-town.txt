My wife and I visited Pride Hotel for the first time today with the intention of having dinner. We first walked in to the cafeteria on the ground floor which had a buffet dinner but did not offer a la carte menu. So we landed up at the Fuel Restro Bar and had a decent dinner. 

We shared a manchow soup and then had a risotto and chicken steak. We liked the food and I would specially recommend their 'Valentine chicken steak'. 

The ambience, seating arrangements and service were good. Our bill came to Rs 1638.

The ambience is great. I was here for a party and I found the fish paturi and baked rasogolla great along with the starters. It is above economical but worth visiting if you are looking for something different.

Like I said about Caf√© Treat, the ambience and hospitality is way more impressive than the kind of food it serves. The quality and variety needs a noticeable improvement. However, this place appeals me because of its ambience. The pictures of this place posted by others and my rating do speak for itself.

Good place. Ambience is food. Close and comfortable place for people to hang out and have fun. Staff cordial and courteous.  Tried virgin mojito ( skip ),  paradise island, Shirley temple ( good find!),  screw driver ( skip - orange juice with rum).  Prices are decent. We had starters along with drinks. Fish fried, chicken Tikka tandoor,  panner Tikka, baby corn. Fish fried was fish nuggets only,  chicken Tikka good,  baby corn was bland and so hard. Difficult to chew. The only sauces available was mayonnaise and green     coriandar chutney. Could have added a variety of sauces to bring in a more better taste.

Although the food was mostly okay, the drinks, apart from a couple, felt short of our expectations. The pricing here is quite affordable compared to the location and ambiance, and somehow I felt that this place is way underrated. There is a separate open section, a bit away from this bar, where one can sit under the open sky and take a fag, whenever necessary in between the drinks. The service was up to the mark, and made us felt welcomed to this place. The management was cooperative, but the place needs to have a complete overhaul, atleast in terms of the popularity and also needs to bring in new faces to uplift their drinks section.
