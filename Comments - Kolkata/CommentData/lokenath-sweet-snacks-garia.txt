I came here twice after work for some quick eat.In this scorching heat I was glad to find an air-conditioned restaurant selling snacks at a reasonable rate.In the first visit I tried the momos.Though the coating was bit too thick..filling was flavourful and the soup served alongside tasted nice.But the sauce lacked the heat I love in momo sauces which is a thumbs down for me.In the next visit I tried the chicken hakka noodles.Portion was unexpectedly huge at the given price.It was amazing.Yes it's on the oily side..but typical street style well seasoned chowmein that I love.It was laden with big chunks of chicken.Total value for money.

Just beside the entrance lane of garia metro. They had a juice kiosk outside. Had mixed fruit juice and paneer roll. Juice was okewise, atleast digestible. Ordering paneer roll was a mistake. Oily, with rubbery uncooked unsauted paneer, finding hard to finish it somehow. I traveled in garia metro most of the time but simply pass this food joint even i'm in hunger.

Strolling the roads of garia, we came across this restaurant. It is a small ac restaurant with limitec seating. The food is good. We also tried milkshakes which could have been better.

Discovered this place few days back. If you are hungry and short on cash, this is your place. Its located close to Kavi Nazrul Metro Station(Garia Bazar Area). It is a small joint that provides you Chinese as well as Mughlai preparations and refreshments at very cheap rates along with the comfort of sitting in an air-conditioned room. I have tried their Chicken steamed momos that came for just 40 bucks, Chicken noodles and Chocolate Milk Shake. Good taste and great quantity. And the best part, you get the luxury of sitting in an AC room with no taxes. A must try!

Roadside eatery close to kavi nazrul metro station. I stopped here for a plate of momos and they showed me the sitting area, basic with chairs and few tables. The  steamed chicken momos were nice ones for the price , tad oily , but had decent amount of chicken fillings and the soup tasted good too. Also tried a glass of Chocolate milk shake , which was  also okay for the money charged.
