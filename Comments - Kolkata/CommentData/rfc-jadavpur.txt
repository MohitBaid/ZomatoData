It's situated near Corporate Bank in Jadavpur. Take the road along Bawarchi and keep walking (3-4 mins) in that direction. It will fall on the same side. I have passed by this place innumerable times. Decided to visit today finally. I went around 4:20pm. It still didn't open properly. The cook wasn't there yet. He came after 5 minutes. I ordered a chicken burger. He asked me to wait a while. Around 20 mins later it was packed. He said normally it takes around 5 minutes. The shop had just opened and hence the delay.
Now coming to the food, it was packed in an aluminium foil with 2 tissues and a sauce sachet. Taste was very similar to KFC's zinger burger. The size was smaller yet enough for an evening snack. The fried chicken inside tasted very similar to kfcs. Sometimes it even tasted better. It was very crispy though some parts of it were a bit fibrous. Tomato sauce was added inside too breaking the monotony of mayo (in kfc it isn't added). Quantity of mayo was adequate. Very few lettuce leaves were added too. The price (₹70) is half of what kfc charges. So it's definitely a good deal. Just the bun quality is better in kfc. But for such a price you can hardly complain. It's definitely one of the best burgers I have tried at such low a price! Would of course visit again for the burger and chicken popcorn.
Only drawback is that the service was a bit late and that there's no seating available. They should seriously consider expanding then it would be an apt place for hanging out. No GST and packaging charges.

RFC has gradually transformed into a food saviour for nocturnals in the Jadavpur area. The fried chicken delicacies comes at a price far below its branded contemporaries. Once you bite into those culinary showstoppers, you will realise that you are saving more while not compromising on the quality.

It was an extremely cheap place to have burgers and fried chicken a couple of months ago but they are increasing their prices very frequently.
Previously the burger was 50
Now it is 60 which is okay
But in swiggy it shows 70!!!!
The taste is good but it lacks a bit of crispiness

Tried their special burger with cheese.. Really delicious with the right amount of ingredients.. The chicken is super juicy and the Mayo is pretty creamy... Followed by crispy chicken (two for Rs 60) and Chicken Chizza... Yummy.... Light on the pocket.. Pretty decent options... Rfc is my new fav on the crispy chicken dishes front

Loved the food over here, although it's a small joint but the owner is a very good person and the food was served on time as well....I have just tasted the Burger and it perfect both quality and quantity wise. The pocket pinch is also not too high.
Highly Recommend for Chicken lovers.
