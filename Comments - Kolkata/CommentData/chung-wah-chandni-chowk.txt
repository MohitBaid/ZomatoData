This used to be one of the Prime Chinese Eateries of Kolkata once upon a time. Sadly that is not the case any more. It is not only about the quality , service , ambience but also the reputation and crowd. Sad to see this has gone down in every respect and turned into a very shady place. To put it simply , I would not visit this place with family. For friends it is still OK. Order the chilly pork to accompany your poison and spend some quality time without burning a hole in your pocket. If you are inclined to sit in a cabin behind a curtain you can do that as well , subject to availability ( of cabin and company ;-) ) though :D

Great place for a few drinks with friends. The place is a hit with college goers & working class as well.  Post 5pm, people drop in groups for a quick drink. Food & drinks are reasonably priced. Pork lovers will the the amazing ROASTED CHILLI PORK dish: it’s damn good. Other Chinese preparations are equally good. Try to avoid Indian preparations.

Visited this place but could not find the old world charm. The food was also very average. Neither we liked the ambience, the presence of liquor smell in every nook and corner of this place really took on my nerves. Ordered chilli chicken and chicken noodles. Did not enjoy anything.

Worst of all..the behaviour of the staffs was very bad.. we were 4 people and 2 were coming.so first they made us wait outside the cabins. It was not more than 10 minutes that one staff made us go outside of the restaurant..This was not expected from an old and reputed restaurant of kolkata. Won't ever go there again .

A pocket friendly place to hangout with friends anytime of the year. Located just beside the chandni chowk metro station is ideal to go... The old place with the ambiance showing the touch of old  restaurants.. Makes up a good eye catching place...
Service was prompt & staff was friendly..
Food was average to be honest while compared to other places.. However it's good enough for its price tag... A must visit place to hangout for everyone... #oneofkolkata'soldestrestaurants

If you wish to taste Chinese along with cheap booze, Chung Wah is your call. Located opposite to the LIC building, Chung Wah has got a charm of its own, being one of the oldest Chinese restaurant in the city. Don’t expect high class ambience.

Food:
•Pork Chowmein: Hakka noodles ccoked with perfection, unlike those of the degraded quality for which you’d probably need a toothpick after the meal 😂 though a lil bit oily, good amount of well cooked sliced pork meat was added to it.

• Shrimp Chowmein: This didn’t taste good at all. I guess the shrimps were in the freezer for a pretty long time. (Not recommended)

•Fried Roast Pork Chilly: Whenever I visit a restaurant I make sure to taste their Pork dishes. This one was out of the world, the onions were cooked till perfect brown, meat slices almost melted in the mouth. Ask for the one without gravy. (Highly Recommended)

Quantity:
A plate of any of the above dishes would be enough for two.

Pocket Pinch:
₹700/- for two(including booze).

All the folklores of the Chung Wah cabins, that I have heard since childhood, broke into smithereens after I paid my first bisit here last Friday. The food was a big dissapointment that looked half-cooked and stale. The bar menu also doesn't have a lot of options. The staff is inattentive and the crowd hostile. Nothing seemed special to me. Hence, disappointed

Just horrible! Couldn't even wait to leave the restaurant to write the review. This my fourth or fifth visit. Never was the food so tasteless. First we ordered chicken sweet corn soup. The chicken pieces were so hard that it was not edible and had no salt and no taste at all. Then we ordered noodles and fried rice. How bad can a fried rice taste? Even the road side stalls make tastier than what they served. Hot garlic chicken tasted completely bland. Only fish munchurian was somewhat tasty. I don't know the reason for this kind of service whether it's because of Christmas rush but it was a very very bad experience. You can visit this place at your own risk.

Located near Chadni Chowk's E-Mall, Chung Wah is a plain little restaurant, serving authentic Chinese food. The decor and ambience is nothing to boast about, some may even find it a little shabby. But nothing really matters because they serve lip-smacking dishes, especially the pork ones. The staff was prompt and swift. You get a cabin if you have a woman accompanying you, or else you have to sit outside the bar room. We ordered fried roast pork chilli and pork noodle soup. The pork chilli is the one of the best pork dishes I've tried so far, with spicy  notes and a good amount of fat. The pork noodle soup tasted good alongside the nip in the air, albeit a little bland for my taste. In a nutshell, this place is a good place to rewind with friends over a plate of hot chilli pork and beer!

If you are in Kolkata and looking for some oily and juicy pork experience, you really need to come over this place. The ambience you won't prefer but the food is quite a good quality with your budget. The best place for couples. They serve really chilled drink. The place is overall satisfying.

Price of any drink is also reasonable....  It is located near Chandni Chowk metro station....  So it's easy for me to travel in Metro cause i stay near Tollygunge metro station...

Chung wah is situated just beside Chandni Chowk metro station. Its a very nice place to have a drink with your friends and hang out. If you're tired of clubs with loud music and boisterous crowd, this is the best place for you where you can sit in peace and drink. Prices are really reasonable. One can sit at their table and smoke. The waiters behaved really well with us. The service was good enough. The food was really nice and the quantity was good too at a pocket friendly amount.  Dry chilli prawns are a must try if you go there. Donot forget to grab your bottle of beer with the prawns.

Over-priced both the food and bar menu.  The waiter is annoying, keeps peeping and enquiring. Once the payment is done he tries to persuade for tip and even tries to negotiate if the amount is small. The ambience too is okayish, Need to work upon the prices(especially bar menu). Really liked Mushroom and Chicken Reshmi Kebab. But, they really Need to check on their staffs.

Regarded as one of the finest restaurants of old Calcutta,Chung Wah sports a retro look throughout.
The interiors are dimly lit and much the same as it was many years back and take you back to Calcutta in the 90s.
There are 15-20 cabins which are tailor made for couples to spend time in private(keep in mind u need to be accompanied by a female friend,else they dont allow entry into cabins)...
Chung Wah is popular for its pork items and cheap booze..main course items are a bit more on the costlier side..The Hot Cantonese Chicken is a must with chilled beer..The staff are courteous and offer quick service(but blatantly ask for tips...they literally quote a figure😑)..A place much visited by office goers and college students on a tight budget,it would definitely be worthwhile to get the look and feel of this place..

This restuarant is one of the oldest restuarants in kolkata; its located just beside chadni chowk metro outlet which is opposite the LIC building. 

This being a very old restuarant is not at all comparable to the fancy restuarants and cafes which have come in Kolkata recently. It has an old world charm of its own. 

Coming to the food, they have quite a wide variety of chinese dishes. I ordered fried roasted chilli pork and chicken jhal farezi. 

The roasted pork was awsome in taste. The quantity is good too. Chicken dish was huge in quantity. Chicken jhal farezi was basically a fried dish having chicken pieces,onion, capsicum all fried together.

In my childhood i use to visit this place with my parents to have best Chinese where Golden fried prawn was ours fav... But today when I visited it after 20 yrs experience was shocking as the bill was high on pocket as compared to its quality ....
1. Fish Finger (3.5 /5) :  8 pcs. Of basa fingers average in taste... With only 4 pcs of potato wedges... And worst part was they served (which we thought) homemade Mayonise with maida and too salty...

2. Can Chicken (3.5 /5) :  Dry chilly chicken it is there house splty . soft pcs of chicken with a hint of Indian spices .. Though taste was bit diff but not bad..

3. Chilly pork (3/5) : Dry meat, with less fat and mild spicy bit flat in taste...
Overall taste and quality is similar to small joints...

Been here. They served one of the best pork in kolkata. Specially Roasted Chilli Pork. It’s heavenly here. The place is one of the oldest place for chilling. But only problem for the place is it is overcrowded whenever I stepped in here. This is very old place so you shouldn’t expect any cozy decorations. This is the beauty of the place. Foods are okay. They serves alcohol and they have cabins. But sometimes they runs out the thing you want. I mean everything in the menu might not be available for the moment. The staffs are not very responsive all the time. Rather that have less numbers. This thing should be looked by the authorities.




Food- 7/10

A classic restaurant situated in the heart of the city, it's more of a bar than a restaurant and it's advisable not to go there with family. It's a spot where middle aged or aged people come to gobble a drink or two after work. You'll definitely get alot to hear from the cabins situated beside, some good-some bad. It's a nice place if you're observant of things going around you. Talking about food, it's average. Booze prices aren't that cheap provided the ambiance of the restaurant.

Located conveniently beside the Chandni Chowk Metro Station, Chung Wah is one of the few places to serve good pork and alcohol together. 
Although they have recently upped their liqueur prices and don't offer the buy-by-bottle anymore, it's still on the cheaper side.
Their well-stocked bar and the roasted chilli pork is all you need for an evening to chill with your gang. 
The rest of the food however is pretty average , and they have no ambience to offer. 
They still have the cabin systems of old Calcutta eateries , and call for a visit now and then when you want to let loose, on a budget.

But still it has a feel which makes me feel comfortable and cosy. The food here exceeds the expectation, you might from it's ratings. The quantity is quite sumptuous and the quality, well its best you try it for yourself. I assure you you won't be disappointed. I have been here multiple times because it serves both pork and alcohol without burning a hole in your wallet.

An excellent place for drinks and good food with friends. The ambience is the only thing that might need a little bit of improvement. Other than that, the staff is extremely friendly and it is a different feeling to get out of the regular chair and table seating and enjoy a day out with friends and family in a personal cubicle. The feel is extremely retro and for an Kolkata lover, it is nostalgia wrapped in a restaurant. The food is good. I would recommend the fried roast chilly pork for anyone who loves spicy food and pork. :)

Visited this restaurant with my partner on an afternoon. I have absolutely no complaints. The food is lovely. The best pork, both in terms of quality and quantity, as well as the taste in town. The quantity is more than enough for 2. Coupled with booze this is the perfect place to hang out especially if you want to enjoy old charm Kolkata. 
Personally I found the waiters very decent and cooperative. And they also didn't bother us with any time constraints. I'm looking forward to visit again.

It's supposedly one of the oldest Chinese eateries in the city. But as things stand now, it's advisable to visit this place with friends, and only if you are too exhausted to look at better options. The place is shabby to begin with. The waiters insisted that we order Mixed Noodles and Chicken Manchurian, and it was evident that most of the other items enlisted weren't actually available. The food too, will disappoint if you expect something fancy or even remotely sophisticated. It just satiates hunger, nothing more.
It's not too difficult to maintain hygiene and quality, despite keeping the heritage of the place intact. I hope the management will look into this.

An old bar in central Kolkata was famous for its Chinese Cuisine and beverages. I have mentioned the word "was" consciously. I visited the place after hearing a lot about it's connectedness with the heritage Calcutta. But I am totally disappointed. The behaviour of the staffs is pathetic and the quality of food too. I have decided to give it a 1.5 rating, but the extra 0.5 for it's beverages part . It has lost it's old charm.

If you are a true chinese food enthusiast then this is your paradise. It has been the same for the last decade or two. Actually this place was not this shabby looking 10 years back. It was a must visit restaurant among the kolkata crowd of all ages. But now the charm of visiting Chung Wah have reduced drastically. Their are cabins where you can chill of you have a girl accompanying you. The pork dishes are best in town. Rather the chinese foods all are. Try them. Visit this place. Pocket pinch is reasonable. Just beware this is not a posh restaurant. So service and ambience must not be your rating criteria when visiting this place.

Their pork dishes are undoubtedly one of the best in town.Went there yesterday with two other friends. Ordered -

one plate of chilli chicken, one plate of pork schezwan,one chilli pork roasted, one mixed fried rice,one sweet and sour chicken, 5 beers and whiskey -

The pork and chicken were simply lip smacking. The rice was decent enough. But the sweet and sour chicken was horrible and  looked like prison swill. Bill came around 2300/- plus.

The servicing was poor and the staff was rude and impatient. 
Used to visit this place since I was  a kid and had somehow  developed a sort of nostalgia towards it. But for first timers the behavior may come across as too strong. I kinda missed the old days' decorations. 
Go there for their pork dishes. Price is moderate and they don't charge GST on alcohol but only on food. But be wary of their unprofessional poor customer services.

It's a heritage restaurant so the ambience also speaks for itself. It represents the old calcutta naturally. The not so impressive interior is only a signature of the past and not to be sobbed at. It reminds us of the traditional restaurant culture of calcutta. The food is authentic Chinese and pocket frndly too.Not much spicy and easyly digestible by 8 to 80.

Located right next to the Chadni Chowk Metro exit, this is one of those very old watering holes catering to the Office Para area of Calcutta. But this place is also famous for its lip smacking Chinese dishes. Though it is not so spick and span and not cleaned regularly it has its steady base of faithful customers who drop in most evenings to engage in some aantel drunk convos and soak in the typical oh so calcutta bong atmosphere.
Having frequented this place many a times, my first tryst with this place was during my university days. Enter this place and you get to know the few rules that they stick to :
If there is a female accompanying you, only then do you get entry into the small cabins that have some strange names. Some that have Bengali literary reference even. Strangely enough every time i got the same cabin named 'Nesha'. Else you get to sit outside which during the evenings gets pretty crowded. Also the waiter will definitely ask you how long do you plan to spend inside. Initially they'll start off with the 1 hour crap. And also you cant smoke inside.(yes its a bar cum restaurant)
Needless to say certain must try items are
1. Chilly & Manchurian Fish which is mind blowing
2. Dry roasted and Schezwan chilly pork and schezwan manchurian pork(do try it with extra fat). Their pork dishes will make you forget any other pork dishes you've ever had. This is a pork lover's paradise actually.
3. Their mixed chowmein in schezwan sauce(with pork) is also very good

The portions are quite decent and the pocket pinch is reasonable. Afternoon time would be a nice time to visit this place as it remains relatively empty during that time.
But beware of the waiters who seem to be nothing better than the lot you've faced at Oly Pub.

Always been one of my favourite eateries... With friends... Reasonable in price, great in taste, homely in ambiance... Old vintage look... Casual approach adding to the glory by itself... Cabins are there as personal place with romantic Bengali names... Love this place...

The pork items are something which beckons you every time you think of having it. Dont expect to have an ambience, its a place to be boisterous, just take your gang have drinks and chill out..been visiting it for a decade now and still think its pork is at par with china town 😃

One of the oldest (or is it THE oldest?) Chinese restaurant cum bars in the city of ours. Located just opposite to the E-Mall in the busy part of Central Kolkata, Chadni Chowk, this bar cum restro has been a hot spot, always filled with office-goers or couples seeking privacy in those dimly lit cabins. And the cabins have got interesting names as well! (I can't remember though at present. But will surely take into notice next time I visit.) The place has been serving good Chinese food ever since eternity. We had the usual. If you want to time travel back to a 60s 70s Calcutta, this is the place. :")

Extremely horrid. The ambience, service, food..everything is just horrid. I ordered for shrimp noodle soup which had a rotten smell and tasted even worse. The shrimps were very tiny and tasted really bad. The chicken fooyah was still better. The waiters were very impatient too. Overall it was a very bad experience.

This is a shady old school restaurant, located at Chandni Chowk. Not advisable to take along your female friends or family. Good if you are going in gang of boys only. However the place serves superb Cantonese dishes, which can anytime be compared to the quality available at any of the restaurants in China Town. Don't miss out on the Chilly Pork items. I also loved the Garlic Chicken Dry. I was overall satisfied with the food and drinks against the amount I paid. The waiters are not trained enough to understand what's customer service so don't even expect. Just sit and enjoy your drink.

Kolkata & its love affair for old places is a never ending romantic story, be it the indian coffee house,olypub of park street or mitra cafe of sovabazar!! Chung wah also holds a special place for those who look for after office relaxation with booze.

This is located at chandni chowk opposite of e-mall. The place has lots of space to sit & enjoy. The front part is a big place with 20 pvt rooms being available to enjoy your food & booze peacefully if you are with women. The outside usually consists of table sharing. The back end of chung wah has live singer with hiked prices(idk why). The front part is where you get cheap booze & food!!

We quickly settled ourselves & ordered the following:-

1. 7 beers(650ml)

2. Crispy chilli babycorn - A bowlful of thinly cut babycorns being served with full of chillies & capsicums. The quantity i felt was a bit lower. The babycorns weren't that crispy but the taste was great.

3. Chilli chicken dry - 8pcs of soft fleshy chilli chicken served with chillies. The taste was again superb!!

4. Roast fried chilli pork - For us this was the star of our evening. We liked it so much that we ended up consuming 2 plates of it. Shredded pork along with ample amounts of fat wok tossed in onions & chillies. The pork were tender & was cooked to perfection. The quantity was wholesome & is enough for 2 people.

5. Egg friedrice - Normal egg friedrice with wholesome quantity. Quantity is more than enough for 2 people. The rice was flavourful.

The pocket pinch was considerably moderate after all the items being consumed. Pocket pinch was 700 per person. No GST was charged on liquor however on food it was charged. The servers are quick & attentive to your needs. Would gladly go back there again

A very old place where you can get drinks and good pork dishea . I had gone there for one of my colleagues' birthday parties . We drank from morn till evening and the food was average however the chilly pork was out of the world whose taste i still crave for . The place still has the boothes with curtains which are very good for the couples as they can have privacy to themselves . But i do not have any pics to upload so will go another time and get some good pics for sure .

The old world charm. Curtained cabins and so-not maintained restaurant. I tasted chicken asparagus soup which was just the right consistency, think and could feel the asparagus and chicken both.  Tried the special fried rice which contained chicken liver apart from the regular prawn egg and chicken and the hot chicken.  While I will suggest a repeat for the fried rice...  One can give a miss to the hot chicken.

The food and service are getting worse day by day. Someone who visited the restaurant 10-15 years back can easily feel the change in food quality. The service is extremely bad as the waiters are rude and behaves like they are doing favour as they serve us. They still serve drinks in old glasses used by local tea shops to serve tea. Overall not recommended at all.

 He literally asked us the leave the place and even told us that ' we must order food worth rs 1000 per hour ' we were there for 2hrs 15 minutes .. we had beer, vodka, sliced chilly chicken , chicken fried rice and fish manchurian. What else can 2 people eat at a single time ??

On a hot and sultry Saturday as I sauntered past this restaurant something arrested my pace and I walked in to the restaurant having been reassured by a friend in the phone...

The first thing you notice about this place is it's quite old and antique appearance... The private cabins in a row on either side of the rectangular area begs for your attention... The wooden counter is a relic from the past - this is the place where the waiters raise the orders...

The waiters are reachable and helpful... After being seated I was delivered a refreshingly chilled beer...by the way, the drinks are reasonably priced...the complimentary grabs in the form of "chanachur" is quite addictive...

I went for the pepper prawns which were medium sized and quite tasty...however the highlight was the roasted chilly pork... I didn't rest until I went for a second helping of the dishes as well as the drinks...

I also struck up a conversation with some of the people out here and was surprised to find out that the restaurant is more than 100 years old...

It was good, tasty......loved their dry chilli chicken, chicken haka noodles  n sezwan chicken n fish fingers .it was so noisy n bad ambience that we were unable to hear our own voices . BTW food wise it okeyish. I don't know whether I shall ever go there or not . service was slow. We all drink but this place has become the hub of ill  mannered drunkards.

Chung Wah is a place which keeps calling me back from time to time. Due to the distance between my home and this place, I may not be a regular but I try to give it a visit at least once in a month. This is a place soaked in the old Calcutta charm with some really stunning dishes hidden in their menu. Try their pork fried rice, special chilli chicken or the gravy chpwmein and you will know what I am talking about. Couple them with a beer or two and you'll be transported to heaven. I don't know why it is rated so low in Zomato. Make sure you visit with a friend or two and watch as time passes between those glasses, your endless discussions and the brilliant food.

Located just behind the chandni chowk metro station, it reminds us of the old bar culture of Kolkata. 
With cabins on either side and tables along the centre.
Mixed crowd, mostly office goers and college students.
Goes relatively easy on the pocket. 
Alcohol served cheap and chilled. Pork served good. Other options also decent. Smoking allowed inside the restaurant after 10.30 pm at night. 
Ambience not very up market, but can be a good option for broke like urstruly. Only problem is, one needs to call out more than once to get a refill of the chakhna along with the alcohol. Otherwise , nice place to crash along with a few buddies.

This place is just located beside the Chandni Chawk metro station so it is not difficult spotting it. About the place, this has the old Kolkata bar cum restaurant ambience with separate cabins! Yes they got individual cabins separated by wooden structure n the entrance is covered by cheap quality maroon curtains. The food was not remarkable and so wasn't the service. So just left after a couple of pegs.

I was extremely disappointed with this place. We were three of us. This place serves liquor. But we were denied right from the first. The manager made an issue with our age. We had provided our age proofs. All three being 21+. In West Bengal the legal age to consume liquor is 21+. They said that customers above 22 were served. I asked the manager that was it because we were all girls. To our surprise he said a yes. And added that it would be okay if we were boys as they could be easily thrown out if they got high as they did not have female attendants to do so in case of girls. This is a shame to the society with such patriarchal mindset. So it would have been okay to touch a girl and throw her out if she was above 22 years. Somehow we were served with beer. The manager was quite satisfied with his argument. Also they were constantly peeking through the cabin we were sitting in and was in a hurry to shoo us off the place. We also expected authentic chinese food as this is one the oldest chinese restaurant. But the food was equally disappointing. Just the beer was cheap. I am never going back to this place and will never suggest this place to anyone.

We ordered fried roast pork chilly, chilly pork sezchwan and later chungwah special chow mein. For all the three dishes the quantity was a lot. Chilly Pork Sezchwan was the best. The ambiance is very nice mainly office goers. They have a common sitting area where you can choose your table and enjoy your meal or they have several private chambers where you can ensure your privacy while enjoying your meal with your friends and family. The place has a heritage touch to it. Probably the best place to have pork dishes in Kolkata...

Don't miss the fish fry out here...Which z the brits common man's food - fish and chips (p.s. not wafer chips)...along with a huge dollop of tartar sauce...which is also their signature dish...
Apart from this even chilli pork is not to be missed...also booze z available at competitive rates...

Now coming to the cons...the employees out here are not that friendly (until u r a regular and tip d waiter big)...also during evening time it becomes a pick up joint...

Regarding the ambience it is one of old school restaurant with cabins...a bit stuffy and at times it's too noisy...but no one can beat it in some of its menu!

Vintage- That's the term that defines Chung Wah...Situated near Chandni chowk metro..this is one of the oldest Chinese restaurant in Calcutta...Somehow down the way there may be some identity crisis regarding the degraded quality of food  they served but somehow over the years they managed to find their lost glory and they remain quite impactful as far as Chinese food scenario in Calcutta is concerned and that too within a budget price...Ambiance is nothing spectacular bt its all about nostalgia if u visited this place before...way before the days of fb or zomatoes or even orkut to be precise...Well my orders included mixed rice along with roasted chilly pork along with a pint of king premium...Quant was well enough and quality was really good specially the mixed rice...Chung wah produce great pork dishes so nothing more to brag about that..Its cheap, its fun yet its legendary !!

This place is located right outside gate number 2 of chandni chowk metro station , diagonally opposite LIC building , and is clearly visible from the street. The bar menu here remains the main attraction , and the people who come here are mostly regulars . The restaurant cum bar has little cabins on both sides, with peculiar names from literature and life that give them an old world charm and nostalgia. The cabins are comfortable with tables , chairs , and menu cards all packed inside . The best part is that they allow smoking inside the cabins . The bottled beer they serve is reasonably priced, chilled and served to the table . The staff here want to be tipped , so if you're being served by an ardent staff , don't forget to give him his little due. The dry chilli chicken we ordered as a side dish tasted average , with a whole lot of chopped chillies but no onion or capsicum. The special chilli chicken however had a generous dose of onion and capsicum, and was apparently the "best dish" they serve there ! The service was super attentive , just enough to keep a tab on each cabin without interfering with anyone's privacy . Overall a great place to grab a drink with friends and relax .

I'm kinda confused. What should be the rating here ? Some dishes are to die for, especially their pork dishes like dry chilly pork and the prawn balls (though they use shrimp paste), and some items are decent, like the chowmien. The gravy chowmien is a must try (they actually give a lot of toppings with sufficient meat to please a bong) and all of these, paired with some chilled beer in an ambience soaked in the old world charm- its a bliss. 

Statutory warning:- you might not want to go there with your family/ GF during the evening time.

Taste wise the food is good but hygiene wise it's a complete no-no. The garlic chicken we ordered was quite tasty but the quantity wasn't too great. The schezwan chicken tasted average and the quantity wasn't all that great either. We ordered mixed fried rice and asked them not to include pork in the dish but there was some pork in the rice which we were served. Also, the prawns in the rice were old and smelly and were not deveined properly, so I'd advise people to not order prawn dishes. Overall, not a terrible experience but could be a whole lot better.

Yet another gushy craving for Chinese in Kolkata landed me in Chung Wah!
Very close to my office and where I stay when I come to Kolkata, I scanned google pages and Zomato for options to eat Chinese as Chung Wah got my attention! Every time I travel to Kolkata on business I make it a point to reserve an evening to good, classic street food/locally influenced cuisine options. It gets boring to eat at those hip restaurants at starred hotels. Frankly, I do love what I do but sometimes I feel I stretch my luck by choosing places at dark lanes or creepy gullies to eat from! 
I was their first customer for the evening at about 6ish. There was a lady singing some offbeat tunes on a sort of stage with the two musicians trying best to keep the music alive! Apparently I had chosen to walk in to the bar end of the restaurant. I thought I walked in to the wrong place before I noticed the family seating spots and regular restaurant setup on my way to use the restroom. 😅
Well, I definitely was pleasantly surprised by the very friendly staff(once you get to talk to them) who did look grouchy at the start. 
My target was to try out pork and seafood options in a traditional Chinese recipe. I did and loved it! Amazing flavour and no irritants tasted! 
Chose to have Roast pork mushroom bamboo shoots, prawn bean sprouts and the shrimp fried rice.
The roast pork mushroom bamboo shoots had lovely flavour, texture and palate although the presentation wasn't all that great. Prawn bean sprouts was new on a menu I had come across; had a unique taste, sort of nutty, spice not noted with a fresh catch of medium sized prawns. Also found that they don't add artificial MSG! Having that said, the fried rice was wow! Just as you would get in a street food eatery, it was amazing! Oil to the right amounts and shrimp as good as it can taste! 
It was a really enjoyable meal at that. And service was quick(got my food in about 10 mins I would say).
I have been asked before why I rate so low when I have given rave reviews for the food. It'll mostly be for the seating or ambience or hygiene, which I will have to keep in mind and point out as well while reviewing. This place(the proper restaurant part of it is very much woman-friendly and so many girls had come occupied regular seats that day. Didn't spot stains on the plates or glasses used. I would suggest to buy bottled water though. 
For the costing, the food worked out quite 'reasonable' considering the taste, portion and quality as well. 
Roast pork mushroom bamboo shoots -180
Prawn bean sprouts - 185
Shrimp fried rice - 180
For the food I paid Rs.577.
Whisky costed 155 per 30ml, a couple of bottles of coke, water which all amount to about 990. 
Total bill: Rs.1567

Been to the place quite a few times. Good place with an ambience of old kolkata. Food is good and worth the money. Go with friends or that special person of your life and enjoy great meals with drinks if you like. A special attraction is the old style cabins, in fact the first time we went just to experience this.

Service in the beginning was pretty bad. But after we changed places, we got a good waiter, although he took a 100 bucks tips from us. 😯😯😡😡
Food is good. But the place was very crowded even on a weekday. It's an old-school restaurant with cabins. Gives you loads of good feelings and nostalgia.

Well, the oldest chines joint of kolkata .
Situated in chadnichawk. Bar cum dine family restaurant . Great chines stuff and amazing food quality. 
Recently visited this place, had mixed gravy chow, pork bamboo shoot and chili dry pork with some chilled beer.   

Costed for two of us was just rs 800..
It is very family friendly. Cabins for family .
Try the fried Chile pork and rosted bamboo prok.

Located right next to the e-mall this is basically the place where people go after office , students with budget constraints and the ones waiting for their electronic good to be repaired in e-mall (for eg. me) go to booze at cheap rates.
Its an old tattered place with nothinh much to talk about the ambience. Quite on the shabby side rather. The concept of the small cubicles with a special name assigned in bengali for each is kind of interesting. There is an old vintage look with dark polished wooden furnitures which if maintained would have looked better than its present stage.
Booze rates are really cheap. Food is good too. Tasted roasted chilly pork and reshmi kebab. Both are meduimly priced and tastes well. Waiters are very courteous. Would definitely come back again during month ends.

I have had heard a lot about this restaurant from many a mouths. It is believed to be a pioneer in Chinese eatery. Since, I am not quite a Chinese lover, I never felt the urge to try it until I was treated by my Uncle.
On reaching it, I came to know that they serve alcoholic drinks and being a strict non-drinker, I felt it safe to pack the food and take it home. Also, the area and the look did not seem to impress me much to have my food there.
Well, the service and attitude of the staff did not quiet grab the attention nor did they frighten me. It was just okay.
I do not expertise in detecting the taste of Chinese foods, but, since I have had tried fried rice often, I can assure you that the food does not taste out of the world, taking in view its cost.

Qs) Why have I rated them 3 stars?
Ans) Because the food isn't worth the heavy cost; area is not that good; ambiance doesn't suit me; quality of the staff isn't impressive.

Both my mom and dad are a big fan of Chinese cuisines and when we were kids they used to take us out for a Chinese dinner every now and then. So today when I sit to write a review on “Chung Wah” I am going back to 1984-1985. Situated at Chittaranjan Avenue on the Chandni Chowk Street in Dharmatala, Chung Wah can be termed as one of the best Chinese restaurant of Kolkata. 

In my experience it is simply the best. In the restaurant there are many cabins and they have been given special names in Bengali. One can enjoy delicious Chinese items in the personal space of those cabins. Also the taste of noodles is very nice. I love their Manchow soup (but then who doesn’t) mixed Hakka noodles, chili chicken and chicken 65. The restaurant has a nice ambience however as on date it cries for renovation and modernization. Their service staffs are as cooperative and diligent as they were in 1985.

Gist : Disappointing food, service, hygiene. Decor & food quantity is good. Maybe better if you take drinks!

On 10.10.16 I visited Chung Wah. I ordered Chicken clear soup, Sweet & sour pork, Chicken Hakka Chow. But everything goes wrong after that. Glasses were dirty. Spoon and plates were having traces of leftover food. Food came fast which is good. But staffs are giving more preference to those who are having drinks means if you need anything then you have to ask them twice or thrice per 5 minutes. How on the earth Chicken Clear soup is termed as soup I don't know, for me that was Chicken drowned in boiling water without giving even a pinch of salt. You got to be an artist to eat that dish or refer that to an enemy. Sweet and sour pork tested okay. Chicken Hakka Chow tested good. The quantity of the food was good. But I was disappointed with respect to rating and reviews. I seriously think that this food joint is overrated but I would try to revisit to give it another chance. Giving points due to decor and quantity but if the taste and hygiene is that much worse then nothing can do much.

A pocket friendly place, quality of food being good and price of alcohol being reasonable attracts customers, ambience is average , the restaurant has small cabins which gives you privacy but makes you feel a bit claustrophobic.  The service is decent . Overall if u are planning to head fr some decent quality food and alcohol at a reasonable price den chung Wah stands an option.

An old world, excellent Chinese restaurant in the heart of the city's business centre,Chung Wah is the olden days' equivalent to Tung Fong. This is the place where classy bengalis and Chinese went for their weekend quota of relaxation, food and hard drinks. It has a well stocked bar. 
I cannot comment on the north Indian dishes as I have never tried them there. Why should anyone want to partake of North Indian cuisine in a popular Chinese restaurant? I don't even remember seeing them on the menu as a kid. Perhaps they are later additions based on popular demand. 
The Chinese food is quality stuff. Pork dishes are available as well. Bamboo shoot dishes are seasonally available. Prawns, noodles, soups - all things Chinese are great.

After a long time I visited it..as I have heard some legendary people had been there and the place is heritage. You can smell a nostalgic smell here. The drinks cost so much less than other but quality is same. Some waiters are very good. Dry chilli chicken (boneless) was awesome. But it is very crowded between 6.30-8.30pm. So please avoid these rush hours either they can ask you to leave table/cabin in 1 hour unless you order lots of drink. Go there before or after these time . You can spend more hours with your friends.

I have been to this place only once. Won't go back again. The food was stale. The gravy noodles had no gravy. The Crispy Chilli Baby Corn was not Crispy and more importantly it was filled with capsicum instead of Baby Corn. And worst of them all, the waiters kept on asking us to eat quickly. They didn't let us eat in peace. 
Worst experience ever.

Many memories are associated with this restaurant. Located just beside the Chandni Chowk Metro Station  on the Central Avenue , it has another entrance beside the ABP office . An old traditional Chinese restaurant and a heaven for the wine lovers , one should find out some time to visit this place . The price is moderate and will not pinch your pockets. 

I always order Fish Finger, Dry Chilli Chicken, Chicken Cutlet, Green Peas Chicken, Boiled Vegetables to start with . The Dry chilli chicken is marvellous. Sipping a full peg of Whisky , gossiping with friends and good tasty food are what Chung Wah has in store for you. 

Though the ambience is not that great , bit oldish and not so well maintained, the warmth of the waiters and the tasty food covers the lacuna . I will request the family visitors to approach the restaurant from the ABP side , which is new and well maintained . My all time favourite also serves good main course - the chowmein, fried rice , chicken dishes worth mentioning . The cabin way of seating arrangement is quite unique and the family's can opt for them.

Ages after, few days back I visited again, same place with private cabins and a bar cum restaurant with old looks. We ordered the same gravy chowmein with chilli chicken shcezwan and soup. The food was good, but not as befor and the charm somewhere was lost ..

Recommended by My Father, must say he had done a perfect Father's job. Aroma of the old kolkata mingled with heritage. Red floor with a bit of modern touch which is the stainless steel and plywood chairs. It still houses cabins for privacy with names taken from poetry. Food quality it's very good. Taste is also good. Quantity here comes with One CAUTION Please Don't take two plates for two people, if you do at your own risk, unfortunately I made the mistake and after that I was feeling like A Python with Two Cows in the abdomen. Now the price which is too moderate or better say cheap. In a nutshell Long Live Chung Wah.

One of the oldest Chinese Junction in Kolkata.
Pros:-
1. Very pocket friendly.
2. Easy to locate. Just beside Chandni Chowk metro Railway station, near E-mall.
3. Vintage ambience. Many of the Bengali movies were shot here.
4. Must try chilled beer with dry chilli pork & hot chicken.
Cons:-
1. Delayed service
2. Quality of food is average. Because there are so many excellent Junctions are here in Kolkata which serves A+ Chinese foods.

Used to love going there with parents in my childhood. In recent times too, say 3-4 years back, I liked this place, but not anymore. I am a non-drinker and used to go there for their awesome american chopsuey and dry chili chicken. But the last couple of times it was a horrible experience. First I went there with my mother and the whole place was stinking so badly- of liquor and urine. We didn't have lunch and just left the place. The last time again I thought it would be nice to give it another try, maybe it was just a bad day. So went there with my friend and had sweet and sour soup, american chopsuey and dry chili chicken. Became seriously ill, started vomiting after coming back home, the quality was so bad, the meat was like rubber and the soup was so bad and stinky. It's not a lunch place anymore I guess, only a place to get cheap liquor and finger foods.

The place is easy to find, VERY well connected. (It's LITERALLY next to a metro station and a major arterial road in Kolkata). 

The place itself could use a minor makeover. It looks like a pice hotel. 

However, the staff are most accomodating. One even went as far as to tell us to order one particular pork dish which was heavenly. 

And of course, the food. One CANNOT ask for better food for so little. 

A must-visit hidden gem if pork cravings are what's keeping you from conquering the world.

This food joint was introduced to me by my father. After a hectic day, he took me to this place. This place smells nostalgia. This place eats nostalgia. As the ambience was quite dark & dull, I loved it anyway. They still have that cabin system as before, you can have a seat there if you want a private meal. Their food was quite good. They give you a fair quantity in a plate. They host you so politely that you can feel at home. I thoroughly loved the place.
P.s. This food joint provides a bar in itself. If you want to rejoice the charm of nostalgia, you can have a foot there anyway.

This restaurant may not be the cleanest or best but it certainly does have a priceless old word charm to it. Whenever I walk in her I feel like I've stepped into a time capsule. If you are free one evening drop by here with friends, it's not really the place you should visit with family.

People should know few points before going to this place:

a) Try out following items which are taste-wise superb & price wise very pocket friendly
     Roasted Chill pork, Basa fish fry, Liver chili, Hakka mixed chowmin, roasted chili prawn 
b) Drinks are very cheap (however, they have very limited stock) c) Ambiance has been degraded over the time.d) Waiters are not at all up to the mark. They keep on asking for tips.e) This place is become hangout for those couples who needs private space.f) Decor & wash rooms are pathetic.

My rating is 4 only for cheap drink & lovely food quality....

As the ambience was quite dark & dull, I loved it anyway. They still have that cabin system as before, you can have a seat there if you want a private meal. Their food was quite good. They give you a fair quantity in a plate. They host you so politely that you can feel at home. I thoroughly loved the place.
P.s. This food joint provides a bar in itself. If you want to rejoice the charm of nostalgia, you can have a foot there anyway.

This restaurant may not be the cleanest or best but it certainly does have a priceless old word charm to it. Whenever I walk in her I feel like I've stepped into a time capsule. If you are free one evening drop by here with friends, it's not really the place you should visit with family.

People should know few points before going to this place:

a) Try out following items which are taste-wise superb & price wise very pocket friendly
     Roasted Chill pork, Basa fish fry, Liver chili, Hakka mixed chowmin, roasted chili prawn 
b) Drinks are very cheap (however, they have very limited stock) c) Ambiance has been degraded over the time.d) Waiters are not at all up to the mark. They keep on asking for tips.e) This place is become hangout for those couples who needs private space.f) Decor & wash rooms are pathetic.

My rating is 4 only for cheap drink & lovely food quality....

Chung wah is basically a bar and that too not a sophisticated one.

Located near chandni metro at a walking distance of 1-2 mins

Should have given 1 for ambience. For people who dont want to drink, they will send you to the first floor, which goes through a shabby path.

Only the food is cheap and quantity is good. Quality is satisfactory. Really got annoyed with the behavior of the staffs. After serving food after 30 minutes they will ask for tips after the bill payment.

I will not recommend any couple to go there who have the intention to have Chinese food only.

This used to be one of my most favourite place for dineout during my childhood days, and i can still recall how i used to love my each and every visit here with my parents. Their chicken gravy noodles accompanied with their chilli chicken was an all time favourite of ours. But with time, our visits got less and with the advent of innumerable chinese restaurants round the city this place somehow got just tucked in one corner of the mind. So last sunday when i was in chadni chowk with my father and we were thinking about having lunch, we came across chung wah and both of us unanimously decided on visiting this place, just to relive the memories of the good old days. Now, we ordered for our favourite gravy noddles and chilli chicken( went with the safe choice actually). But the food was disaster. Their was no actual gravy in the noodles and some sticky brothy substance with vegetables. The  noodle was bland and was absolutely tastless. The chilli chicken was nothing better. It was extremely spicy but nothing else. The chicken pieces were huge but extremely dry and not at all juicy. We were extremely disappointed with our lunch. I felt the place to be extremely overpriced considering the quality of food served now. Also i found the waiters to be disinterested and little rude in their approach. Never going back there. I actually became quite sad to realise that chung wah has lost its glory days and it is just a sad reminiscent of its past glorious phase.

Went with friends. It was average. The american Choupsue was not up to the mark. The normal hakka noodles was much better. Had ordered Chicken Manchurian and garlic chicken. Both were good,but they ddnt look like chines, but was like chutny chicken. but were ok as a side dish to drinks.

This one famous place is now only a shadow of its past. Prices are reasonable and quantity served is big. But the positives end there. Food is oily and mostly tasteless. Most sides are prepared to go well with drinks and not mains. Even the fresh lime soda we ordered here was a big joke. Thick syrup at the bottom which could be clearly differentiated from the lemon water above.

This place is a legend. It is soaked with bengali nostalgia. Anyone who has read Sunil Gangopadhay or Satyajit Ray will familiarise with this place a lot easier. Now when I talk about food, there are two reasons to visit this place, and believe me these reasons are enough-
1. Very much affordable drinks
2. The best schezwan pork in the city.
Now when I say the best in the city, I am sanguine that anyone who has tasted it here will second me on this. The ambinace does not have much to speak of. The other items in the menu are decent, but not special

To get back the charm of old Calcutta, Chung Wah is a good place to gossip and eat. Each of the cabins have a particular name and we were in 'Sritituku mone rekho'. The ambience gives you a retro feel.
Go for a pint of beer and roasted chilli pork. One will really savour the taste. As for main dish, Chung wah special noodles along with a side dish one can love to have.

Service is quick and waiters knock the cabin before they enter. A good place for privacy and enjoy a dineout.

Chung wah. Immortalized by satyajit ray and feluda. Well I had my first taste of chilli pork here. And man was i overwhelmed. The pork items are still very good. They are very soft and the spices are thorough. The fried rice is okay.  The staffs are a little intruding when in the cabin maybe in the hope to catch people in action, ain't sure but it's damn irritating.  The other major deterrent is the price. They are a quite a bit on the higher side.

Known for its authentic Chinese food, the place definitely has some reputation. Time has taken its toll on this place and what remains is a shabby joint with glimpses of the past. The place can be a good hangout joint for a group who are visiting nearby places and looking for chinese food and cheap booze. However the place doesn't qualify for authentic Chinese food. It was more like regular Chinese food that you can see all around the city.  The preparations were good, given the price they charge but some how the chicken as well as the pork had a smell that suggested maybe the raw meaty smell still survived the cooking. Was it intentional or not remains a mystery. The service was good all around. 
If you are looking for a Chinese ambience restaurant, this is not the one.. but if food and booze is what you have in mind, this can be an option to consider.

As the name suggests, it is for Chinese cuisine. To our finding this is a very old establishment, the major reason we went there for. The food is good, considering the quantity and price. Ambience and service wise this place has nothing much to offer. 
I would suggest this place only for pickups.

Ambience- could've been better
Food- good
Service- could've been better

We had a nice outing at this place today. Very easy to locate near central Kolkata. The environment was retro type.

Food: Not a lot to talk about food quality. We had Chicken as well as chilli Pork, Chicken and Prawn fried rice, Chicken Manchurian to name a few.
The chicken could have been cooked a bit more to everyone's liking.

Service: Good.

Overall good experience.

A small eatery but very well maintained. We went there for take out but were surprised to see such clean and courteous staffs. We waited for a little while before our order was ready. The service was very impressive with quick delivery. We ordered for fish fingers, schezwan chilli pork(dry), and chicken hakka noodles. The fish fingers and the pork were awesome but I think the noodles could have been better. Nonetheless, pocket-friendly and the quality of the food is fresh and good.

I hear about this place from friends . I tried  last week.
Decor is old classy one. Name of the cabins are on old bengali filmy style. There is one more singing bar ,same name beside this restaurant.  Impressed with ladies cabin room etc. 

Food is tasty, wines are not costly . Hygine average. Washroom requires innovation.
One more important thing it is not a family bar avoid taking females here.

WEll the decor and the ambiance is downright hideous.... but yes, what I have to say is the themed cabins are very black and white bangla cinema and also the food is lip smacking! The pork preps out there.... oh my god! They were beyond my expectations... ! And when can chilled beer and chilly pork ever go wrong? :)
happy hogging!

If plush decor and classy ambiance is your thing or priority, then this isn't the place you should be in. Plus food here is average too, didn't like the items that much, though they weren' entirely tasteless or bland and well enough to satisfy hunger. If you are in the vicinity and have heard of Chung Wah and are extremely hungry, then you can go for it.

Having been told a few hundred times about how legendary Chung Wah is, the seeker in me fell prey to the allure of old school restaurants in central Calcutta. My mother did once tell me that Chung Wah was merely an after hours place for a beer and salties, but there's always more to a restaurant than that.

Chung Wah isn't hard to locate. It's right outside the metro station, on the footpath opposite E-mall. You enter into what can only be described as a forceful lack of ambience. If you're expecting service of any kind, you're in for a massive slap. Service is nonexistent. But we were expecting worse. We sat around for about a half hour before anyone even took notice of our raised hands and voices.

We were soon shifted to one of the rooms, like we asked for. Service managed to pick up after that. The ambience of the place isn't great, but the rooms are cozy. They've installed an air conditioner, which is breakeven for a food joint in modern day Calcutta.

We ordered a couple bottles of beer, the dry chilli pork, the schezwan pork, and a side of shrimp noodles. Beer and pork is a legend. Very few food items go as well together like these two do. The pork at Chung Wah is a world beater. Absolutely phenomenal! The quantities are very good. The waiters will also serve you a side of ginger and lemon, for reasons obvious.

A meal for 2 should come to 750, excluding alcohol. It isn't cheap, but it does ultimately satisfy. A lot of people seem to believe that Chung Wah isn't for ladies, because of the people you'll find inside. While that is true to an extent, it's also worth noting that they're your average office goers, coming in for lunch. If you get a room, that will never be a problem.

They have cabins made and you occupy those cabins. super cheap alcohol n food. The best part is you can also smoke in the cabin if you tip the waiters well ;)
It is super shady and better to go in a group.

Don't really prefer soups, however Chung Wah's special soup is something that I love to have, occasionally.

Pork dishes are the highlights of this place. Roasted pork with bamboo shoots, or with veggies, peking pork, fried roast chilli pork, pick any, and get an accompaniment of a hakka noodles and a beer, you are very much set.

I visit this place few times. There is no decor at all. It's has it's own charm - old Kolkata nostalgic flavour. Situated just opposite the famous e-Mall, it is a very old Chinese food destination. The rate is so cheap and the quality and as well as quantity of food is really very good. Entering there you see at your left few cubicles. Each and every cubicle has it's own name. This is a bird-nest for couple. They serve liquor at very cheap rate rather than other any bar cum restaurant present over this area. I love this place.

If u think you would a fantastic decor and ambience then this is not your place. Food was surprisingly good yesterday - dry chilli chicken, fish fry and egg pakoda. Its an apt place for a group not much bothered about ambience or people but rather plan to drink and smoke at the same time. Service was pretty good. One thing you can expect out of this place is that its a perfect place to drink and eat when your pocket isn't too healthy.

This is an easy to spot place along the roads of Chandni Chowk, opposite one of the metro gates. The primary reasons why one should visit this place is cause it's cheap and the service is pretty swift. What I personally liked about this place are the small cubicles lined all along the main dining area. What one must order here is the fried roast pork chilly. Although this place is a frequent for the office goers, an evening with friends couldn't hurt. But I'd obviously not recommend it as a regular.

Have been visiting this place since college days. Its been 16years since then and little have changed. Now the place is centrally airconditioned but the ambience remains the same. The pungent smell of alcohol mixed with chinese cuisine has a feeling of its own. Service has always been swift and the waiters are very courteous. Chinese preparations are there strong point. Dry chilli pork, special chilli chicken, mixed noodles have the same quality nd quantity as they had before. U can visit this place with family and friends. They have small cabins covered with large red curtains which separates u with the outside boozers. The biggest plus point of this place is its location which is just beside chandni chowk metro.  Will definitely recommend everybody to try this place atleast once to feel the warmth and legacy of this place.

What : AN AGE OLD CHINESE RESTAURANT HAS KEPT IS ALIVE AS BEFORE....
Where : Just opposite of Hindustan building beside Chandni Chowk Metro Station.
When : Week day evening @ 6pm.
Pocket Pinch : As per quantity and quality of the food,price is moderate. 👍👍👍

* Ambience : You can't expect an age old and of course always a very busy restaurant should have a great ambience. I ve visited this restaurant after almost 10 years and all I have found the same. The shabby interiors will definitely not welcome the snobs. The dimly lit cabins and rickety furniture might not entice you. Big and small cabins as usually are not decorated for a long time. So, if you go for ambience,you ll be dissapointed.

* Food : 1. Along with whiskey FISH FINGER is my always favourite in this place. 8 big pieces of pure Bhetki fish is so delicious and yummy for any food lover's taste bud. (rating 10 on 10) 👌👌👌👌
             2. HOT FISH is another very hit item here. As a fish lover rather than meat, I always crave for tasty fish items and Chung wah is always one of the best. Hot fish is very tasty,less spicy and so smooth that it melta in your mouth as you eat it. (rating 10 on 10) 👏👏👏👏
             3. CHUNG WAH SPECIAL FISH MASALA was something spicey,full of masala around smooth bhetki fish with lots of capcicum,carrots,fried onion etc. Any spicy eatery will instantly like it. (rating 8 on 10)👌👌👌👌
             4. Mixed Haka Chowmein was certainly above average and always hit as before. (rating 8 on 10)
             5. You may try out chicken items as HOT GARLIC CHICKEN, DRY CHILLI CHICKEN,CANTONESE NOODLES,FRIED CHILLI PORK,CHUNG WAH SPECIAL CHICKEN ETC. All are delicious and tasty,holding the the tradition of the age old restaurant very well.

* Management : Service staffs are all old,so they know how to handle the customers outside and also inside the cabin. The crowd are controllable and management is cool till 7.30 in the evening. But when office returns start to come,the atmospheric heat start to raise and so the manner and behaviour of service staffs. Somehow this kind of behavior is annoying, but its may be justified. (rating 7 on 10)

Why recommended : One of the best bhetki fish chinese items in kolkata.

This place has an ancient charm and aura once you enter. Located right beside the Chadni Chowk metro station, just across the sprawling E Mall, it definitely ticks the location box. Once you enter, it feels rather gloomy and claustrophobic ,though. The ambience and the decor are pretty backdated and that's the only thing that's negative about the place. We ordered chilly pork schezwan and Chung Wah special noodles. Both of them were well cooked and delicious. Maybe the best chilli pork in town,even. The tax they add on to the final bill is a major turnoff. The waiters are pretty courteous.

             4. Mixed Haka Chowmein was certainly above average and always hit as before. (rating 8 on 10)
             5. You may try out chicken items as HOT GARLIC CHICKEN, DRY CHILLI CHICKEN,CANTONESE NOODLES,FRIED CHILLI PORK,CHUNG WAH SPECIAL CHICKEN ETC. All are delicious and tasty,holding the the tradition of the age old restaurant very well.

* Management : Service staffs are all old,so they know how to handle the customers outside and also inside the cabin. The crowd are controllable and management is cool till 7.30 in the evening. But when office returns start to come,the atmospheric heat start to raise and so the manner and behaviour of service staffs. Somehow this kind of behavior is annoying, but its may be justified. (rating 7 on 10)

Why recommended : One of the best bhetki fish chinese items in kolkata.

Went there with huge expectations but  frankly speaking it disappointed me. Food quality below average. Ordered Chung Wah special chop suey and chilly schezwan pork. Chopsuey was horrible. Worst I've ever tasted. Schezwan pork was too much oily though somewhat better than the chopsuey.

foods are really good, specially those chicken items. but I don't think anyone would visit here only for food.. if you are fancy, then you would be disappoint with their ambiance, its not like other well decorated bars. tough its a affordable place for birthday treats or collage parties..

This place has an ancient charm and aura once you enter. Located right beside the Chadni Chowk metro station, just across the sprawling E Mall, it definitely ticks the location box. Once you enter, it feels rather gloomy and claustrophobic ,though. The ambience and the decor are pretty backdated and that's the only thing that's negative about the place. We ordered chilly pork schezwan and Chung Wah special noodles. Both of them were well cooked and delicious. Maybe the best chilli pork in town,even. The tax they add on to the final bill is a major turnoff. The waiters are pretty courteous.

This restaurant used to be the favorite of many yesteryear celebrities (like Uttam Kumar). However it's quality has fallen over the ages.The cabins have poetic names like "Prothom Prem","Banalata Sen", etc. The bar is located at the entrance and the sharp acrid smell of alcohol while setting my foot in was not a pleasant experience for a teetotaler like me. I ordered Chicken Sweet Corn soup ,Chicken with bamboo shoots and veg chowmein. The food was okayish,not very tasty.

Well known restaurant located opposite emall at chandni chouk.. I didn't have very high expectations after reading the reviews in zomato. But still I decided to give it a try. I took a delivery. Ordered the special chopsuey chicken. I was terribly disappointed with the taste..there was nothing special about it.. There was a good amount of chicken liver in the gravy which didn't taste that great.. It was pretty much the worst chopsuey I had in my life.. I think I am going to avoid this place in future

During my gastronomic ventures, I have found a striking similarity in most of the dingy dungeons I have visited. They all serve legendary food. While Chung Wah is not exactly a dingy place per se, the old world charm does indeed overpower you. And it is a masterpiece on its own right. Right from the perfectly named coups for couples, to the wooden table and chairs lining the middle of the floor, interspersed with pillars, this haven for food is indeed a delight. To top it all is the smiling staff. The only thing beating them in the game of hospitality is the food. Absolute bliss. Right from their chicken sweet corn soup  to the dry chili chicken fried to hot fried chicken alongside a dish of mixed noodles, everything works like magic. The service is a tad slow, but that has got nothing to do with inefficiency. The idea is to hunch back and relax. Take a sip off your favourite booze, and in my case, what I call my "thums up on the rocks", since being a teetotaler, I really do not want my group  to feel left out from the fun of not having to drink, yet get a high. The drink is definitely cheaper than most places. 
Chung Wah, is a haunt for the working class, with of course a huge dose of college students and at times old world gliteratti.  
This weekend do make it a point to visit this astonishing piece if history, neatly tucked beside the Chadni Chowk metro station on Central Avenue. Regret you will never and thank me, you will, forever.

Every Restaurant has its own USP. If you are planning for a family dinner in a cool, sophisticated ambience, Chung Wah is not the right place for you. So those who've rated it low, must have had a different expectation altogether. 
What Chung Wah excels in, is its variety of starters and alcohol at terribly pocket friendly rate. So if you're tired with your boss's tantrums or bored with your university classes, take a few colleagues or classmates and relax over chilled beer and succulent pork & fish starters. You'll love the place.
Went there for a friend's birthday party. They allowed Birthday Cake inside which is really great on the management's part. The staff were very helpful and the food was pretty good. The quality of fish they serve is unexpectedly outstanding. I loved the Chilly Fish dry and the Fish Finger.
Typical old-Calcutta addazone ... and it's good that they didn't fall prey to the current competition market. It's beautiful in its own way.

If you are looking for quality Pork items and in a pocket friendly budget then this is the perfect place for you. 
The Chungwah special chowmein, Roasted Pork Chilli, Chilli Pork Schezwan and Pork Bambooshoots are the four preparations that I have tried so far on the two occasions I have been there. They are just heavenly I must say.

The gloomy ambience is somewhat a bit of spoilsport and it might not be an apt place for a family treat but once the food touches your taste buds every bit of negative feeling will get washed away!!

I first came to know about this place during my school days in a famous song of chandrabindoo - "তার পর দেখা হত হেদুয়া, আমিনিযা কিংবা চাঙুয়া" 😀😀
Being located just beside Chandni chowk metro station, I never got the chance to be there as it doesn't come into my daily commute. But yesterday, after I was done with my car's servicing, I went over this place.
The first thing when you enter it would look very shabby, deemed tubelights, no interior decoration. But as soon as you start with your drinks and the authentic chinese starters, It would bring smile to your face. The best part was the waitor would straight come to your table with the bottle of whiskey or vodka you have ordered for, pour the 60/30 ml in the peg measurer just in front of you so that later on the customer doesn't have the room to quarl. I took one chilli chicken dry and one garlic fish dry - Both the items were really nice. They have got a smoking area beside the kitchen, another good part is that the place is heaven for boozing couples as they have dedicated cabins covered with curtains. So regarding nostalgia, cheap price, authentic chinese food, this is definitely worth spending good time.

A shabby place where people come to booze at cheap rates. It is one of the oldest authentic chinese restaurants in the city. Their food used to be good. But nowadays, their quality has deteriorated a lot. We ordered Roasted Chilli Pork and Dry Chilli Chicken along with Tuborg. The food wasn't that bad, but obviously not worth recommending. This is a old dingy place to booze with your friends. 

P.S: Heard that the Fried Prawn is one their special dishes, but it was finished by the time we ordered it. So another visit will be needed :D

One of the oldest and quite possibly one of the 1st Chinese restaurant in Kolkata is now only a shadow of the old glory. Visited the place last week almost after a decade. As per the ambiance everything is the same..the cabins, the red chairs some of the old staffs are still there. But the place which was primarily known for pork and cheap booze has upped their price significantly. The mixed fried rice earlier had so much generous portions of prawns and pork thats been not the same. Though the overall portion of rice is quite well. The garlic chicken was too bland and though some bits kf garlic was there in the gravy the flavor was not at all garlicky. Thankfully the dry pork manchurian is still a hit. Loved the zesty flavour. The staffs work with a straight face all the time and the waiting time is quite long. Approx 15-20mins. Overall disappointed by their decline.

But the non singing segment is truly good for family ambience.  There are cabins too for to be nostalgic. Drinks price wise worthy though in singing segments its a bit pricy. I would recommend to go and enjoy the food specially the starter items.

The ambience of this place is not exactly hotel worthy. Located in chandni chowk and it is barely recognizable unless you know the place from before. The place is dingy and not well lit. The rooms are small and the hotel staff did not provide us with clean bedsheets. However is livable for 3 4 days. The restuarant is known for its authentic Chinese food and it didnt fail in that aspect. The chicken schewan and the mixed fried rice was sumptuous. The best thing is that the staff listens to you on how much gravy you need and prepare the dish according to that. The mixed fried rice was also equally delicious. It had prawns, chicken and egg in it. The area however wasn't exactly safe. Must try for all Chinese lovers.

This place used to be a pioneer chinese restaurant in kolkata, father, uncles used to visit there in their school, college days, but this has deteriorated so much that its beyond expectation. Today had the opportunity to visit it and it is surely my last visit as well. Ambiance-well there is no ambiance, cabins are dilapidated , non-cabin center tables are like pice hotel table with some cheap tomato & chilly sauce bottles and ordinary glasses kept there. The waiters are callous as well as arrogant, service is pathetic, Serving time was 20 mins. we ordered chung wah special fried rice, chung wah special chilly chicken and seczwan fish. all the items were very very poor, even the footpath stalls prepare better chinese food than those served at this once prestigious restaurant. If special items are so poor then what is the condition of ordinary items who knows. It has become a cheap bar , food become secondary, During our stay saw only lower class people drinking cheap booze in nearby tables.. It is not a place to bring family or to celebrate any occasion, better to avoid it totally, its time is over..

This place has the old Calcutta charm to it and the food is satisfactory, although overpriced. The waiters are very rude and cheat on new customers and the restaurant authorities are the least cooperative about it. Poor maintenance. Had a very bad first experience. Not going for a second time. Not worth the money. And definitely will not recommend this place to anyone, inspite its heritage. This place doesn't even deserve a 1 out of 5. All this explains why it was not even half full during Sunday lunch hours.

Maybe this place does not deserve such a low rating, though I can understand it, given their deterioration over the years. Once considered a hub of Chinese food, it has now become the hangout for cheap booze, with the food becoming secondary.

However... however... if you know what to order, this place still stands the test of time. Their Roast Chili Pork is great, their Prawn Balls are good and their Crispy Fried Prawns are awesome. Also try their Mixed Hakka Noodles  - an old school Chinese prep that is timeless.

I do not like their gravies anymore unlike the days gone by. But a special mention for their Special Chili Chicken. Do order it, you will not regret the choice. It's awesome.

It used to be one of the best restaurants to have Chinese food but over the years it has been overshadowed by the other Chinese restaurants which have mushroomed across the city. But it is also a fact that the quality of the food has deteriorated. The chowmein and the rice do not taste the same. The place needs a makeover and it would be nice of they include Pan Asian cuisine in their menu. Still one could feel the old world charm inside the restaurant and taste good Chinese food at the same time.

Heard big commitments from chung wah loyalists and thought of giving it a visit on some random day.. and really got disappointed on the end product that was served!
ordered a sweet lime soda,  a chicken egg and prawn fried rice, a sezchwan (schezwan) chicken and a mixed chowmein,

* sezchwan chicken seriously lacked flavour. no flavours yet too much oily!
* chicken egg and prawn fried rice was completely bland! tasted better after              some chilli sauce and chilli vinegar thrown into it! 
* the sweet lime soda was extremely sweet. we couldn't dare tell the guys that we       ordered sweet lime soda and not sugar syrup!
* and the star of the table was the mixed chowmein. it was so bad and disturbing to the taste bud that i chose to write about it at the very last. Mixed chowmeins comprise of chicken, egg, prawn and sometimes pork. that is what i've been eating all my life, but here i found something new and disgusting. they had put generous amount of CHICKEN LIVER in the mixed chowmein!!!!! nd trust me, it sucked big-time.. it was so painful gulping all that shit down the throat, silently!
the first three things weren't well prepared but they were edible enough, but the mixed chowmein was horse-shit served on plate and on a weak moment i had really felt like dumping the food down the drain!

* piece of advice to the management: sorry for the harsh words guys, couldn't help myself, but please for heaven-sake, stop putting chicken liver in any of the dishes!  they do not taste good!!! they taste aweful!! try it yourself!!!

and another thing i would like to point out to you guys that your waiters aren't well-behaved. they seemed to be very grumpy and on a real rush!

* would definitely like to come back here and try the famous chilli pork and the cheap priced beer someday soon. 

P.S. no chicken livers, please, i beg you!

Mixed chowmeins comprise of chicken, egg, prawn and sometimes pork. that is what i've been eating all my life, but here i found something new and disgusting. they had put generous amount of CHICKEN LIVER in the mixed chowmein!!!!! nd trust me, it sucked big-time.. it was so painful gulping all that shit down the throat, silently!
the first three things weren't well prepared but they were edible enough, but the mixed chowmein was horse-shit served on plate and on a weak moment i had really felt like dumping the food down the drain!

* piece of advice to the management: sorry for the harsh words guys, couldn't help myself, but please for heaven-sake, stop putting chicken liver in any of the dishes!  they do not taste good!!! they taste aweful!! try it yourself!!!

and another thing i would like to point out to you guys that your waiters aren't well-behaved. they seemed to be very grumpy and on a real rush!

* would definitely like to come back here and try the famous chilli pork and the cheap priced beer someday soon. 

P.S. no chicken livers, please, i beg you!

Today celebrated my father's birthday with food delivered from here since its his fav restaurant. As usual the dishes were tasty. The chilli chicken and schezwan pork were soft and yummy, the mixed fried rice palatable and the prawn pakora was great as well. :)

One of the old cabin restaurants that has lost its charm to the newly themed restaurants. Chung Wah is located near the Chandni Chowk Metro station. The joint is organised and well maintained. Inside is dark with the regular bar smell you get accustomed to. The food here is decent and service satisfactory. One can drop in here with their friends for a couple of drinks and it won't hurt your pocket. Menu is limited (nothing too flashy), so ordering won't be a hassle. Loved my time here and would look forward to visiting again.

It's a place where people go after work for boozing. With no decor and cheap beer, you cannot expect heavenly treatment. What I liked about here is Pork only. Quantity is on higher side than charge. Service is also good. Not a place where you can take a girl with you.

I was going to this place from the age of 6 yrs wd my dad and mom. Now the atmosphere of this place has became poor but not it's taste. Here I get the flavour of real Chinese.  Here's dried chilly chicken, mixed fried rice ,pork chilly is owesome. I visit this place at least a month to get the real taste of Chinese dishes.

One of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. You can still sit in cabins and chill out with your friends here. Couples too can have some privacy here. :p
Chilli pork is the best dish over here. Chilli pork with a bottle of beer. Ahhhh!! Feels heaven. And everything is so reasonable, that's the best part over here.

This joint is my third favourite place in Kolkata to grab some food and drinks at a moderate price. service is good. the waiters are prompt. you can get alcohol at moderately good prices. and their chinese (indo chinese lol) food items are good enough to eat with a peg of vodka or a beer.I dig their dry garlic chicken. the dish is tasty as hell.those little cabins give a little privacy to talk and enjoy the drinks. i like it.Overall, the place is good. :)

You don't come to Chung Wah for a fancy lunch or dinner. You don't go there for the ambience. You just go there to chill, drink and have really crazy pork dishes. The food is pretty basic and you know that it is bloody good. The service people are really nice people and they will also laugh with you if you're a little tipsy. This place will give you an old Calcutta feeling and atmosphere.

It's an old restaurant in kolkata for Chinese foods. They serve alcohol and its cheap. They serve pork too. I like chili pork schezwan and dry chicken schezwan. They use pork in mixed noodles. That's ok. But sometime they uses pork liver too. And that's nasty. So ask before order. Otherwise no decoration only old kolkata cafe ambiance. Small cabins available for family and ladies. Open middle order ordinary tables and chair sitting arrangement. No whisky glass, slow serving time.

Hope for upgrade.

Instaplan to this is an old chinese eatery was a good experience. It has normal sitting arrangement along with private coops for couples. In main dish we had ordered Chung Wah Special Noodles (Hakka) which consisted of chicken, lamb, pork, prawn & vegetables and in side dish Chilly Pork Schezwan was really well cooked with spices and taste was very nice. In drink, we had ordered beer which was chilled. Overall it was good.

Without any experimentation ordered their pork Hakka noodles and roasted chilly pork and both the dishes, quantity and quality wise were delicious!!!! Whoever doesn't know about Chung wah, this is an age old place near chandni chowk metro, and an almost heritage signature huge Chinese restro offering small wooden cabins for privacy and pocket friendly booze and food. The waiters here still live in the eighties and are a bit laid back. Only be there when u have a world of time on your hand and are looking for a laid back evening with heart full of secrets to be shared with a loved one, or meeting a bunch of old friends after a decade!!!

Even their food..the mixed noodles, the spicy pork, the chicken wings and Chinese dishes are tastier than expected. It is a bit crowded and you may need to que up for an evening. But that's just it..and you will have patient smiles from the attenders..and may even get a better cabin if you know them well ;)

Went there after a very hectic electronics shopping throughout the day to have some decent food. The environment is not that friendly, one can say as you get to hear different unpleasant things from the private cells. Overall the experience was very very unpleasant.

Frankly speaking, if you care for only food then you should not even think of this place. But yup, the ambience that it has..is something I like. That typical flavor of old Kolkata. Dim lights. Small and cozy cabins for couples if you would like to have a ride in a time machine. The liquor price of really chip.

Old decor, old staff, old cabin with old furniture, washroom sucks.... Once u enter u will start thinking that u have gone to 1970s...

There is no sign of sofistication but has an amazing ambience of its own which takes u back in time. My favorite is the fried chilly pork, prawn cutlet and mixed gravy chowmein. The indian dishes are a stict no, better to stick to the Chinese dishes.

Chung Wah is a place for old Calcutta. Time runs slow here. On my first visit I feel that. Apart from few starters the foods are just standard. I recommend chilly pork. Drinks are quite cheap. The waiters there are following the old classic way - slow and steady. It's more like a pub where orders are taken care of at slow pace. 

If you have ample time to have a friends get-together it's an awesome place. No music, so keep gossiping til foods are served. Don't ask for good decor, and girls may not find it okay. It has tables as well as cabins - a set up of old Calcuttan classics. The cabins are named as Bengali classic novels - ​Songopone, Bonolata sen, Tivrite, Kichukhon, Sudhu tomar jonyo, Ekanto apon, Chokher bali
 and 
Valobasa, Smriti tuku thak, Prothom prem, Pranadhikeshu, Nesha, Dekha, Hotath nirar jonyo, Sesher kobita.

This place has an old world charm and reminds you of the Kolkata that we see in movies during 60's or before..I loved their isolated booths which gives full privacy to a group of friends or even a couple...Though most of their customers seem to be loyalists who have been visiting this place since forever...

Coming to the food...it was average..not a place you go to for fine dining..but the liquor is ridiculously cheap..I've never understood how they have managed to continue with liquor in their restaurant with that price...

Chung Wah of my youth is a far cry from today's Chung Wah--a dirty, smelly, and absolutely disgusting eatery. All the servers remain totally impervious to the service for those who visit the joint as single customers.  Chung Wah is an obnoxious pig's sty and not a place for culinary satisfaction.  I avoid it like a  garbage dump.

One of the oldest places with a name in the heart of the generation before us, Chung Wah still stands tall among the legendary bars of Kolkata. The ambience itself with the cabins give a retro feel. I was there nearby and had one of my cravings, this time of pork so we decided to go in here.
Well like my times here before , it was the same old ambience which I liked. The best thing about these bars is they have Kingfisher on the menu, which is a non existent item on new places popping up. 
The service was typical and people are not that attentive about the customer, but there was a guy who did actually help out. We ordered the chicken and prawn hakka noodles, chilli pork in schezwan and garlic chicken. The noodles was sufficient for two and really tasty, brings back the memories of old times. The pork was amazing and it had around 20 pieces of meat with the pork fat I love. (Not recommended for the weak hearted). The chicken personally was not that impressive for me but maybe because i had the taste of pork in my mouth. Overall a fruitful venture and a satisfying end to my pork cravings. It costed us around 800 because we had a couple of beers too. One for the old times. 3.5/5.

The food culture of a city is defined by some special places and some unique and authentic cuisines offered by those places which shapes up the cullinary characteristic of a place..Chung Wah used to be one such cornerstone in Kolkata's food map..Though today we are baffled by options when we opt for Chinese food,Chung Wah is definitely on the forerunners serving authentic and quality Chinese spread in our city..You will even find its mention in movies and literature..such has been its influence..It used to be my dad's favourite chinese joint when I was young..In fact many of the items served here at that time were not available in mjor parts of the city..Sadly CHung Wah have lost the plot..It was failed to upgrade itself with time and hasn't bothered to maintain the quality and quantity which earned its fame..Still today if you visit this joint you will surely feel nostalgic..even in this age of global food joints they have kept intact the Cabin culture of the city..In fact each cabin has a different name too..Apart from that nothing much too boast..The place is frequented by some real rowdy and ill-mannered drinkers,a strict no for family..the servers are pathetic and even the food seemed to have fallen apart all over..Don't ever try their Pork dishes..they only serve pork fat..The fish at times smell foul..the chicken served seemed to have died even before we were born..Still for old times sake I opted for a takeaway recently..I ordered Mixed Noodles, Roasted Chilli Pork, Fried Prawn and Garlic Fish..I don't want to detail the items after spending approx Rs.1000/- as except the Prawn all were horrible..Noodles was way too oily, pork has only fat and the fish was way too sweet..Overall you can drop for some cheap booze but head to other places afterwards for food..

A true epitome of old world esplanade eatery where you get some of the best authentic chinese around chandni chowk ! Having left its mark in the literature, music and culinary senses of the city for close to 50 years this stands witness to several addas and reunions and film scriptings, to first dates, and last meetings ! Here today the old mingles with new as the tinker of Carlsberg club glasses and varnished wooden furniture, separate cabins (with red/ green bulbs outside to indicate occupancy, a yesteryears' cabin culture), and hospitable waiters at your beck and call (who also know you by the faces and eating habits, over several visits over the years) meets the din and bustle of busy central avenue traffic ! One of best places in Calcutta to taste roasted chilli pork or maybe to dig into some age old jhaal chilli chicken and chowmein or bengali fave chinese mixed fried rice !! And to end with a spoiler, each of the cabins here are named after popular bangla novels and stories - how about Sesher Kobita or Hothat Neerar Jonyo for one !!

Best place in Kolkata to hangout with best friends. Heaven for guys loving beer and pork. Best thing is the cabin with different names given.  One of the first bars of Kolkata , very old, nice and cheap. It has a bachelor's bar behind, playing live music in the evening. Try schezwan pork and beer. Service is above average.

Great Place to have Chinese food in Kolkata in a very low amount of money to spend...  Location is Superb as it is centrally located just beside one of the entrance of Chandni Chow Metro Station. The Furniture Gives feel of the Retro some sort old East Asian Atmosphere, Lots Of Varieties of Chinese Recipes are there , but many of them are indianised, which is a bad point also one bad point is the presence of a bar, but all these negativity are thrown away by the Delicious food of excellent standard at very low price compared to the food quality and the large quantity they give :-) . Try their Pork Recipes & Szechuan Recipes.. You can surely have the privacy of Cabins with curtains  here.. after all quite a good experience..the service was good to be precise... A 4 From the Combined Experince from me an my sisterCheers

Located just outside Chandni Chowk Metro Station, this authentic Chinese restaurant reminds me of retro Calcutta with presence of reserved cabins with curtains. Other than that there is nothing much to comment about the interior. It's quite average,although the air conditioners are well functioned. The thing worth mentioning is the quality, quantity and absolutely yummy and delicious taste of the authentic chinese food. We took Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken and Shrimp Hakka Chow (the best I've ever had,it's a must try here), Special Chilli Prawn and Dry Chilli Chicken Szechuan. All the items were extremely tasty and delicious, specially the noodles. Service is quite prompt. But the behaviour of the staffs isn't that commendable and that is the reason why i wouldn't rate this place at 4 out of 5.
But,just go there to give your taste buds a wonderful Chinese treat! I promise you'll love it! Thumps Up! ^_^

Please don't go there to eat, please go there to drink as well, its 1000 years old, looks like came out in excavation, they use oil generously, i mean in food. Ah you get pork there, food is cheap, for Rs 500 you can take on a full load. Their beer is too good, i will surely give 5 rating for the beer they serve. Overall its bengnese rather than Chinese.

If you want to have a group eating out where we can get cheap booze and decent food where quantity is the area of focus, Chung Wah is the place, old age cabins with unique names, pub style decor, and the location near Chandi chowk metro. With a number of ups and downs this place can be counted for college street based groups, thumbs down for me is the not so decent liquor range.

This restaurant maybe a little difficult to locate for those people new to Calcutta.
Chung Wah lies in one corner of an alley that is filled with heads in the daytime,and turns dark and lonely at night time.
It is indeed the best place to be if you're an occasional drinker,living lonely in Kolkata and one who gets along well with people.

I have been a regular at this place,at one point of time and the bartenders are good to talk to,and can steer the conversation into various topics.
The restaurant is dimply lit and the ambience gives you a relaxed harem feeling,specially when you're tired after a hard day's work.

For food you can opt for Chinese Chilly Pork chops which is indeed very tasty in this restaurant (not to mention that the Chinese are good cooks when it comes to pork),and a few pegs of whisky.
In the maim course one can opt for the Chinese Chopsuey or the dry chilli garlic chicken.
I was indeed looking for a speciality named Chilli Chicken tossed in soya/oyster sauce which I couldn't manage to find here..
Sweet dishes are not recommend, but if you are simply satisfied with ice-cream you may give it a try.

Overall a very decent and quiet restaurant and the aquarium will always keep you attracted.A typical small Chinese restaurant in the heart of the city is the most appropriate way to describe this place.

Rest I'm sure you can explore  and find out....

Have tried many items last week with my best buddy. Dried chilli chicken, Prawn Tandoori, Chop Sue and fresh lime soda. Chilli chicken was absolutely yummy! But prawn quality should be carefully maintained. Chop sue was upto our expectation. Thanks for your maiden hospitality. Want to visit you again in near future.

If I would have rated this place 10 years ago, it would have been 4/5. But presently its just a bar with alcohol available at cheap rates for regular boozers. The place is no more suitable for female guests & families. Nothing to comment about the food it is worse & the ambience is worst. Its no more a nest for foodies & family gatherings as it used to be during my early childhood. Rather it is turning out to be a very disappointing place.

Chung Wah = Cheap and best Chinese.
Mostly visited by after office guys looking for cheap booze and quality Chinese food. Average crowd are always well over 40s. They have got these private cabins for family but what goes on inside these cabins is still a mystery to me. If you are single or with your buddies looking for cheap booze and tasty spicy Chinese delicacies then this is the place to be. If you are with your girlfriend or on a date, look elsewhere. Ambiance is nothing to talk about, but the food is great. Must try dry chilli pork and dry chilli chicken. Just the right amount of spices with the exotic indo chinese taste to accompany your beer. Cheers.

This is one of my, tummy's favourite place. One of the oldest chinese resturants in kolkata ,although a bit shabby is a place that can't be missed,so here goes my review:
Connectivity : it is just beside the chadni metro station ,behind e mall.
Ambience : for fancy resturant go-ers the ambience can be a turn off because it is a bit shabby and dimly lit,but if you like your drinks in private and quiet it is the place to be.with separate counters no one will be peeping into your food ,drink or fags thus making it comfortable for the shy drinkers .But all these are nothing compared to the food here ..
Food : firstly you will find all your body parts thanking you for having there dry chilly chicken here properly fried with just the right amount of munch and spice. No extra gravy ,no extra cooked feeling.just the right amount of stirred spices for your drink or rice it is a must have here. The best part about chungwa is the rice they serve one is with pork and the other without it. I have tasted the without pork one ,with ample chicken pieces and prons as in every spoon is a mouthfull one. It is one of those places where you actually don't need a side dish with the rice . Nicely fried with spices and just the correct blend of oil in it will take your heart away .other dishes include the kababs chows etc. They are the usual ones to go with your drinks (pocket friendly so it can be tried .)
Ps : if you are desparetly looking for a nice place to eat with friends or have a pocket pleasing beer party or a nice let's eat out this is the place to be cheaper than badshah .. way tastier than kathay (cathy) near esplanade area !! :)
Yes you can bring your family here too you will get a separate cabin and tasty rice ... ;)

Pocket punch : 200 for eating .
                           350 for a proper party.
                            (Per person)

Located conveniently beside Chadni Chowk metro outlet opposite E mall,Chung Wah is one of the older Chinese joints in the city.But it took me till only a couple of days back to try it out.

The shabby dimly lit ambience is the first thing that one would notice about this place.There are a number of cubicles either side of a central common seating arrangement.The cubicles with their rather cheesy names are mostly occupied by couples.The crowd in general is certainly not the best.

Coming to the food,we had a couple of beers,mixed chowmein,chili pork dry and peking pork.The Mixed Chowmein was decent.I liked the use of large chunks of meat in the chowmein.The Roasted Chili pork was very nice and it went well with the beer.The peking pork was downright bad.

I do not know how Chung wah used to be in their hay days but at present the only reason I could figure out as to why people frequent this place is the pretty low pricing.The booze is cheap compared to most places.But the stock is very limited.The food is also cheap but other than the chili pork it was not really up to the mark.

The service is slow.The waiters are quite arrogant.They hardly know much about decency.They would talk loudly amongst themselves and behave as if they are doing you a favour by serving you.As previously mentioned the ambience is shabby.Hygiene and cleanliness is also an issue.

Overall Chung wah is long past its prime and at present it is only a place to booze with some decent chili pork and below average Chinese food when you are substantially low on budget.

Precisely this is the place where people after their office hours come to booze at cheap rates. Its a dingy place with no decor at all. The ambience sucks high time. What I love about this place is the cute cubicles become the lovers' nest. Amazing it is. But family can we accommodated as well.. but you cannot avoid the glares once you enter this. What is amazing is the booze at such cheap rates. You have never ending beer or vodka, its solely affordable. And the food. The roast chilli pork goes too well with the beer. Amazingly good. also in love with the mixed hakka noodles and the chicken in black bean sauce. Please do try if it is available. But definitely not a place I would definitely want to eat and booze regularly.

Had been to this place long time ago with friends. The place is a shabby looking one. It has a few cubicles and normal seats. We chose the cubicle. We had ordered crispy chilly baby corn, chicken noodles, mixed fried rice and some chicken dish. The baby corn was not at all crispy. The main course was okayish. Nothing great. This place is not worth a planned visit according to me.

This is one of the best and among the oldest chinese restaurants of kolkata. Located in chandni chowk just opposite E-mall. The interiors and decor has a Chinese accent and haven't been changed for ages. It provides two types of sitting arrangements both open and cabin system. They serve authentic and succumbing Chinese cuisines in unbelievably reasonable price. The quantity they serve per plate is more than sufficient for one person. They have maintained the quality of their offerings completely unaltered and in compromised for ages now. Their chicken Hakka chowmein , mixed fried rice, dried chilli chicken paired with chilled beer is unmatchable. "Chung Wah" is one of those places which serves perfection with conviction.

Its a restaurant of bliss..... as I always prefer restaurants with bars,this one will come 2nd in my list after olypub in respect of cost.
I went there twice or 3 times. (: only.
Though it won my heart with just a dish..... chilli pork,with those extra fats...ooohhhh....its delicious. I went there with a group of friends who goes out to eat every weekends...it would be a cliche if I tell you this is an awsome place.Though for trivia,its one of the old restaurant of kolkata. There is nothing special about the place but they provides cabins which attracted me #"privy" :o. I judge restaurant with many perspectives,one of which is Services they provide. They can proudly say that they serve well. Btw they have 4 restaurants under one building i guess and one of those is singing bar cum restaurant.
Hakka noodles, fish fingers that we ordered with french fries. You see its all snacks. What a group of people need more when they drink .They also provide the food in a quantity that is sufficient for 1and a half people a plate while one is ordering main course. Well see you soon with some other reviews... (:

I havent had a meal over here for ages. But when I had last visited Chung Wah it was fun to revisit the old joint. The wood cabins, the typical overflowing whiskey glasses, the chop suey and pigeon meat! Yes its still there in their menu and so is Shark Fin Soup!!! If the food quality has gone down as others are saying its really sad!  But if you're visiting Kolkata this a joint you should go to see the old and most prestigious Chinese eatery of the long gone days. I understand today people expect class decor and all but good food and iconic places are never about the decor!

Had chilli chicken , fried rice .
Ambience is not great , service is below average . Now what to say ..............  but I must say that the food price is low , so you never expect great food and a great service from the restaurant. Its all about the clientle . They have some set of clients who gives buisness to the restaurant.

It was time when i was getting bored of China Town and was thinking to stop going to chinese restaurants, when a cousin of mine suggested Chung Wah.We hit that place one sunday evening.
We were given a small cabin.It might not be chick and shiny, with old wooden furniture and ordinary cutlery, but the feeling was very homely.
 The waiters were not good at english but certainly good at heart.
 Be rest assured, the quality of chinese food is no less than any present day suave chinese restaurant. Overall, it was a great eveing for us and our pockets. We made up our minds..no more China Town for next few months..only Chung Wah !!One can enjoy delicious chinese items in the personal space of those cabins. Also the taste of noodles is very nice. The chicken items are also very tasty. Its best items are Manchow soup, mixed noodles, chilli chicken, Drunken Chicken Wings and chicken 65 dry. Indeed all its items are very good. The restaurant has a very good ambience. Its service staff is very co-operative.

Been there many times during college goin days . A favourable location ( just behind chandni chawk metro ) , good food ( according to my the then tongue :P ) , drinks are not pricy at all . This time visited the place 2 wks back almost after 5 years . Everything is unchanged . But this time I was not comfortable in sitting in such a place ( quite messy , dirty , not very hyginic kind of ) , food taste was average ( typical kolkata style of chineese street foods ) , service average . One thing I must mention , the kebin system is still there , those green lights r there ( and the typical middle aged people with their partners going in those kebins  ;) :P Ahem Ahem ....  The same crowd ) .... The only difference in ambience I noticed is this time it is well lit , not that older darker kind of ambience . I dont recommend any one to visit this place for dinner or anything . The only time u can go there ( fir v if u wish ) , u r returning from job after a hectic day , with a few collegues and want to booze a bit ( provided ur routs are over chandni metro ) then only u can stop here for a while to have 2 to 3 pegs  accompanied with some dry chili chiken or fish , chang wa special chow and chicken with bamboo shoots . Other wise its not worthy to visit .

One of the most pocket friendly bar of the city....
Located near chandni chowk metro station.
The vibe there is soothing enough and u can opt for private chambers to hangout with friends
Here you will get some very good dishes including pork

One of the few avg priced bar cum restaurant where u get good Chinese food along with drink at reasonable price.. Although price is rising on regular basis still I like their style. Those traditional red tables, the cabins etc.. Along with drink their chilly chicken dry or chilly pork is a must accompaniment. It really tastes good. Pub lovers of city a must try...

had a quick beer and chkn chow in Chung wah (beside Chandni Chawk Metro Stn) today.Chung wah is an old place for having adda with some some Drinks and Chinese Foods in cheap rate with friends and colleagues in the heart of Kol.Being situated in the Office Para it is always a preferred bar cum restro for those Office People.Chung wah is mentioned in some famous Bengali Novels too.Old Charm like 70's Kolkata,Those Red Suited waiters,Those low lighted Cabin's (very rare nowadays!!)!! what I can expect more from a 20 mins of lunch break?though the place is not recommended for family's and going with your girl frnd.

Used to be a trademark chinese restaurent in old kolkata time, "chung wah" the name was found in lots of books and movies. they still have the cabin system inside, named with fictional characters by famous bengalis like a cabin's name is Bonolata sen. The seating arrangement and interior are very much soso, nothing to write about them. i have tried here schezwan fish, chilly chicken and chicken chowmein. the chowmein was not bad, side dishes were too salty, tough to swallow. now a days people come here to have drinks in cheaper price. drinks collection is fine and price is reasonable. even they will bring the peg measurer in front of you. so, as a whole if anyone whose first priority is liquor in less price with soso sidedish, can try here, but will be disheartened if you come here after reading books like kalbela, byomkesh...

The worst hospitality i've ever faced.. The waiters do not even care for taking the orders.. They remain busy for the tips that they will get.
I'll not say that the crowd is cheap but the ambiance surely is..   There are 15 cabins inside the bar, and i've noticed that no decent peoples are inside when they were coming out of the cabin, specially the girls........ their get up & dress...
You can easily understand for what purpose they were in..  it seemed like i'm sitting in red light area.
I'd not dared to order food after reading the reviews in zomato. I finished my beer as soon as possible and got out of it. 
It was truly my mistake that i tried to experience the so called bar, but i've assured myself that it's my first and last mistake for sure.

We decided to eat lunch at the famous Chung Wah near Chadni Chowk metro station instead of China town. Walking in it brought back memories of my three month internship days at ABP when I used to frequent this place for a quick lunch. The place remains exactly the way it was then....lowly lit, famous coupes with names are like Chokher Bali, Sesher Kobita, Nesha etc. Decided to give Nesha a miss and took a table on the long corridor.

The price of booze is reasonable. My friends ordered whiskey (signature @130 a peg), bacardi white rum (@rs 130 a peg) while I settled for a tuborg strong beer (@rs 150 a bottle). For starters we ordered roast pork chilli (@ rs 140), garlic chicken (@rs 140) and a plate of boneless chilli chicken. The pork was cooked well but there was a lot of fat which we had to avoid. The garlic chicken was quite brilliant with the poison.....small crunchy balls of chicken cooked in garlic sauce. The chilli chicken I thought smelled a bit and the quality has surely gone down. The snacks were served in 15 minutes but it was okay since we had ordered drinks.

For mains, ordered a plate of chicken american chopsuey (Rs 125), a plate of chicken fried rice without egg and garlic fish (rs 145). The american chopsuey was not the greatest in the world - the noodle crumbs and the gravy were served separately and the waiter did not bother to mix it and serve it for us. The rice seemed under cooked and was very hard. The garlic fish was brilliant, cooked very well and the quality of fish was excellent. Ohh and I forgot to order their famous prawn balls though :( Bill came to 1745 inclusive of everything which included the poison for the four of us.

This is place is laid back....the waiters take their own sweet time, in fact, you might sometimes have to reach out to them to order something extra. Won't complain much about the prices and quantity but the quality of Chung Wah has certainly deteriorated.

This once upon a time Legendary Chinese restaurant is situated at Chandni, diagonally opposite to E-Mall hidden behind one of the outlets of Chandni Chowk Metro station. I have heard only positives about the great Chinese cuisine they serve/used to serve. Since Chinese is my favourite cuisine, I went there with huge expectations. 
I visit Chandni atleast every other  week for some work or the other. Recently on a weekend I decided to have lunch and few drinks here with one of my brother who works nearby. 

The ambiance is very basic with some tables and chairs laid out in a big hall. There are few small cabins with curtains for the family crowd which ensures privacy. Outside each cabin there is a small green bulb, signalling whether it is occupied or empty. I noticed that few of the cabins were empty, still the green bulb was on ! The cabin names are quite quirky like "Chokher Bali", "Sesher Kobita", "Nesha" (my favourite :P ), etc. 
We occupied a marble top round table and ordered for drinks and a chili roasted pork. Drinks were served immediately and the pork came in after 10 minutes. The preparation did not look very satisfying as I could see that there was more fat than meat. Around 70% was fat and the meat was not even cooked well dripping with oil. After having a piece we complained but the restaurant manager was least interested and said "aj kal chorbi to asche beshi". That was a very lame excuse, it totally spoilt my mood and I asked them to replace it to which the manager said that they will not be able to do it. None of us could even consume one more piece and we ordered for a schezwan chicken (dry). The chicken was served in 10 minutes and to our shock the preparation contained Shukno Lanka ! :-o 
I was very skeptical of the taste and to our tragedy it tasted more like an Indian chicken preparation. It completely broke my heart as I was expecting authentic chinese from Chung wah and this is what we get ?! 

Somehow we consumed the chicken along with the drinks and ordered a no frills main course. Chicken Fried rice and Chili chicken gravy. Then the waiter saw that the pork is almost untouched and he enquired if anything was wrong. He said that he will replace it. This was very kind of him especially after the ignorance of the manager. The pork was served to us. Though this time the percentage of meat was better but the preparation lacked the finesse. 
Finally the main course arrived and we were almost praying so that it turns out to be tasty. To our dismay the fried rice was inedible. Even a street side chinese corner serves better food than this. We had to mix the gravy of the chili chicken to gulp it down our food pipe. The chili chicken was also a sad story. The gravy was watery and all the chicken pieces were immersed in the gravy. Somehow we finished off the food and drinks and decided not to be back again. 
The food along with 12 large pegs of vodka, 4 thums up was billed at around Rs 1900. 
Not coming back as the food is oily and tasteless nothing close to chinese or even Indianised chinese. Have awarded .5 extra as the drinks are served from the bottle right in front of you and the service is acceptable. If you are in the vicinity and want a drink, I recommend the neighbouring Broadway

I got served a chicken soup instead of pork, and the waiters are like, "you don't know about pork. This is pork soup."
Yeah right, the tastebuds and eyesight of a tea taster failed on the very moment!
Also a very shady place, I suspect some kind of sex ring works there. Women in skimpy cloths (very skimpy cloths for anyone to wear in a bar) often move from one cabin to another with the curtain drawn. I definitely saw a woman doing some "hand work" behind the closed curtain, once. I'd stay away from there.

Chung Wah, located just behind the Chandni Chowk metro exit is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in the city. The nostalgia around Chung Wah is overwhelming, but off late the place has become what may be termed as a bit "shady". Even though the food served there is quite good. Beer and Chilli pork, the combination is perhaps iconic when it comes to Chung Wah, also I firmly believe that Chung Wah serves one of the best Chilli Porks in town! So come here with your friends, grab a beer or two and enjoy the pork. But a word of caution, the general public inside isn't that "great", hence not a very good choice for a date.

This place is a hidden gem. I had the most awesome time here. 8 of us visited Chung Wah on a Friday evening after a beer chugging session at Fairlawn hotel. We wanted more liquor at cheaper rates, hence my journo friend whose office para is the same as Chung wah suggested we visit this place. There are cabins with names like "shedin dujone", " shesher kobita", apparently to add some "Praaai-bhey-seey" (read: privacy) according to the waiters, when asked about the cabin system.  Its such a rare sight in Kolkata restaurants these days. Anyway coming to the food, the chilli fish, Manchurian prawn and chilli paneer are blissful- perfect tit-bits with alcohol. The ambience is, well, there's nothing worth writing about the ambience, but such simple places with good food usually make me happy and Chung Wah did that for sure

Chung wah is a good Chinese restaurant in chandni chowk area Kolkata, if you are in a car and on chittaranjan avenue  your eyes will not fall upon the restaurant gate because it can’t be seen from the road, thanks to the metro railways of Kolkata. In front of the restaurant across the footpath there is the subway gate so only if you are on the footpath you will be able to see this restaurant.
It is a bar cum restaurant.  Some may not acknowledge this system because if you are with minors or with elders of your family you may feel kind of embarrassing.  So choose wisely with whom you are going, because otherwise you will miss the flavour of chung wah.
After entering through the door you will find a long space, a spacious one too… there are 3  to  4 tables in front of you… and beside these tables there is passage on both sides and then comes the coupes. There are 8 coups total in both the sides. Coups are small, I found it claustrophobic. 
I went with 3 people excluding me, we ordered 1chicken fried rice, 1 egg fried rice, 1 garlic fish, 1 pork schezwan, 1 chicken hakka chow, 1 b/l chicken Manchurian.  The bill came at 979 rupees which is in my view cheaper than any other restaurant of the same stature. We also ordered 1kingfisher lite, 1 old monk, 1 white mischief and the bill came at 343 rupees which is not cheaper, to drink one can always go to metro bar in esplanade, 20-25 minutes’ walk from chung wah.
Now about the food, rice and noodles was more than good and quantity was enough for one person, if you compromise, two people can also make their stomachs calm. The side dishes were also great, the chickens, pork and fishes were well cooked, and you can distinguish between the dishes, but they gave the pork fat more in pork schezwan rather than giving the meat, that’s what gives chung wah a negative point from me. Otherwise I liked the pork dish better than the chicken and fish.
The atmosphere and food of chung wah is quite good, the service is good too. So to sum up the experience of chung wah I will say yes for once in a while you can visit chung wah for the food, it is not the authentic Chinese restaurant, with passage of time it became indianised, but yes, it is one of its kind.

This used to be my dad's favourite restaurant . Back in 70's my parents often went there for dating off course. There is famous song "Sweetheart " by Chandrabindu.... which says, " Tar pore class hoto Hedua ye/ kakhono Aminia ba Changhua ye".... lol b ut when ever I proposed to visit this place my friends opposed... the complaints are more or less same... bad ambiance... rude staff... poor service... even stale food. these complaints were even corroborated by few reviews in Zomato itself. 
But my experience is not that bad. The ambiance is not good... in the right hand side there are few coups closed with red curtains... with funny yet romantic names like "Nibhrite", "Ekanta Apon", "Chokher Bali" etc. We sat in a coup and ordered Fish Finger for starter and it was sumptuous... even the mayonnaise(!)  was very tasty. 
In the main course we ordered Mixed Gravy chowmein... which was better than the chowmein we had in many expensive high profile restaurant... the noodles were bit crispy ... which makes it tastier. BTW it contains pork (in case if you have any reservations) ... Somehow I failed to like the dry chilli chicken... not good. We also ordered Chicken with Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoot... it was good. The staffs were good and helpful. Carried out our orders accordingly and swiftly.  The only problem was that the glasses were smelling of liquor.

One of those places u can walk in for a drink for some reason, any reason or no reason. They do make one of the better chinese preparations but are inconsistent. Service is unremarkable.

Chung Wah used to be the best Chinese restaurant in the city a long time back. I have heard it from my parents and elders and have experienced good food there in late 80s and early 90s. But then, the place has degenerated like anything. Everything that used to be good about the place, the food, the quality and service, the decor and ambience.... everything has degenerated. The food is a lump at best, it is either not cooked well or is too spicy to conceal its staleness. The service is pathetic with a capital P.  Only the decor remains the same, the same one I saw 20 years back, unchanged! And the ambience is such that you will not feel like spending much time there. Disappointment with a capital D.

I am disgusted with the experience that I had here.

Dissapointed with the food because it was all flaky and dry. :(
No proper gravy either, the kebabs werent decent too. No chutney either.
Probably the worst meal ever.

The noddles were ok but lacked taste and it seemed too dry for intake. I have nothing to talk about ambience because you do not expect much from restaurants like these which are  marked in the pages of history.

The hype that Chung Wah had has been masaccered and killed solemnly. The food is atrocious and the waiters do not even bother to comply to your requests. They do not even provide suggestions.
The air had odour, so does the disgusting ambience. The cabins yes an old world feel but sorry not going in there for another disastrous meal.

I seriously have no idea why this place has got such a bad rating. I have been visiting Chung Wah since junior school. This is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in the city and I have never heard anyone complaining about the food. The chop suey here is certainly comparable to the other superior ones in the city. I don't know if people are comparing this place with Mainland China but guys the food here is far better than many much hyped and overpriced chinese  restros in the city. There's also a bar attached to it and there's a number of coops of you need privacy. If you love to eat Chinese, you won't be disappointed. And when you go, don't forget to try the mixed gravy noodles.

Went down there with a couple of friends. It was my first visit and surely my last as well. The ambiance was as bad as one can imagine. It was just like a roadside bar where people go just for alcohol. The decor was non-existent and the food was horrible in taste and quite expensive for a restaurant like this.

Avoid it, no matter how hungry you might be.

Yes yes yes, they have deteriorated, very much indeed, but, still the gravy chow mien and fried chilli chicken are tasty. So do the chicken with mushroom and bamboo shoot and fish finger. I sincerely agree with all the reviewers about their horrible service, misbehaviour, very very bad ambience and atmosphere, but, believe me, I am also very nostalgic of my old childhood days, and feel really sorry to see them like they are today, nonetheless, still few of the foods are good, not in comparison to their own food in old days, but, at least in comparison to other foods of similar kind in the town now a days. For every aspect they may get 1/5, but, for food, they at least deserve 3-3.5.

A complete rejevunation on a stressfull day.
The place can be modified by adding some theme into it.

Chung Wah was a favourite haunt which I visited with my parents for years. Their Gravy Chicken Chowmein was undoubtedly one of the best in the city and that coupled with the Chilli Chicken made for a lovely meal. The restaurant was one of those neat and clean places where the focus was on the food and being regulars we could never fault the service we received. A recent visit to Chandini Market prompted me to stop by and relieve the memories. However I honestly wish I had gone somewhere else for lunch. The wonderful gravy chowmein I was salivating over was a soggy, tasteless, mess and the delicious chilli chicken was bland and even worse undercooked. When I requested the waiter to change it I was told that this was how the dish is prepared so it could not be changed ! Quite put off I simply paid the bill and walked out with my meal unfinished. I won't be going back that's for sure !

once upon a time this was definitely a place of class when it came to chinese food lovers. i heard about this place from old and grown up people for the variety of dishes and its taste. so recently we visited the place just to be badly disappointed. the taste the price the ambience everything is total disappointment. oily tasteless  fries on dirty plates gave us a gruesome feeling. but i will suggest if you want to have pork preparations this would be a better option in compared to other street eateries

Once upon a time, Chung Wah was a legend. My father would bring me here for the Chicken Cutlet, the chowmien, and the chicken Manchurian, or, if we would be daring, things with mushrooms in it, a true novelty of Kolkata.

20 years down the line, this place is dilapidated, and serves up overly salty food which has no resemblance to the food that was served up once. A glorified watering hole, the prices are higher than its counterparts around the area, and not worth the price. A true disappointment.

Even though, I cannot truly discard this place. On some days, they truly make good food, and the wait staff is polite, nice to talk to, and make nice suggestions. But those suggestions might not be great on days when the cook decides to mess up everything. So giving this place a 2.5 because I am torn between choosing between good and bad.

Do not look at Chung Wah - No matter how hungry you are!
1 out of 5

It really hurts you when an old favorite starts deteriorating day by day in all respects and becomes a dreadful place for you to visit. Now, as I sit down to write about this place, it is difficult to find the appropriate words, as Chung Wah restaurant in Chadni Chowk was once one of the popular Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, though now it is truly a horrible place to visit! 

The last time I was there nearly three years back, the place was average at best but this time, it was a horrible experience for me. Last Saturday, I went there with a few friends and was so shocked to enter the place. How badly the decor and ambience has deteriorated. There was no one to welcome us, all the waiters were busy gossiping and laughing. 

We seated ourselves and asked for the menu. This time, they showed some activity and handed us a menu quickly. We ordered Chicken Chow (Gravy) and Chicken Chow (Hakka) along with Chilli Chicken and Manchurian Chicken. After placing our order, we had to wait for over 20 minutes to get our orders served on the table despite no real traffic. Chicken Chow (Gravy) from Chung Wah restaurant once used to be a heavenly preparation; so I ordered it thinking that it will bring back some good culinary memories (on my recommendation, one of my friends also did the same), but the gravy chow they served us was a fry cry from the one that Chung Wah used to serve earlier. I was embarrassed in front of my friends a wee bit as I had suggested we go there for lunch. The Hakka chow was barely edible, while the chilli chicken and Manchurian were truly appalling with very little chicken and too much stuffing. To make matters worse, they didn't even taste like Chinese preparations! 

I wonder how a once-reputed Chinese joint like this can prepare such poor Chinese preparations (sorry, I cant even describe them as Chinese preparations!). The staff has absolutely no manners and seriously need to learn some etiquette. The place rubs you on the wrong side in every respect. Its only advantage is perhaps its location which is the only explanation why such a horrible restaurant is still running.

Not quite the old Chung Wah any more, I guess. After I ate hear and remembered about the legacy of it in old bengali novels and even the awestruck regards of my mother. The food is standard,not something to be overwhelmed about though. The service is horrible now-a-days (slower than a slow lorris) and the place.although was always a bar-cum-restaurant, has become more of a cheap bar than a classic chinese restaurant. In overall measures, all that can be said is that places like eau chew, tung fong are better heritage chinese restaurants anyday, only if you can afford them, because one of the few remaining plus points of this place is that the price is very reasonable.

2-2.5 would have been appropriate! It is sheer nostalgia that 3.
used to be the most favourite spot to hang out on weekends. Imagine how painful it is to see such a landmark restaurant derading over time...! Heard about it from parents... then went with them... then with friends and innumerable times we2. Can u imagine Uttamkumar came here to taste their chinese. Satyajit ray? U get the name in Feluda... Byomkesh Bakshi also. in fact trecent films on these twi cult sleuths were shot here!!
The day it started selling chicken tandoori we went very apprehensive and turned out to be true.
Miss u Chung Wah... pls transform urself. 
Still reasonably priced drink and food. Try their chicken vegetable. Still unparallel. most convenient in terms of location.

Decoration and workers were horrible.. bad decoration, disgusting behaviour of waiters will set your mood of. After all these they would come and quarrel for tips for sure even if you surely don't want to.
Food was ok. But service taxes + vat pretty high! After all these if you don't pay and leave as soon as you are done with your food, they will come and ask for it even if the whole restaurant is absolutely empty.

I have visited this restaurant on December 2012 for a Lunch. This restaurant is very conveniently located just adjacent to the Chandni Chowk Metro Station Exit towards Esplannade end. There are two kind or seating arrangement. Cabins and open place. The cost of food and drink is very reasonable. Example: One large peg of Smirnoff vodka is rs 105 taxes extra. Chicken Schezowan is Rs. 135. Fried rice rs 85. The person who took the order was very courtesias. The service was prompt. Yes the decoration inside the restaurant is not that updated. But considering the location, food and drink price, service I would again visit this old restaurant.

people who are looking for a good ambience should stay away from here, this place has an old world charm to it, it is not sofisticated, but it is that way since decades. its a very old place for people working in that area to come and hav some snacks with a drink or two. pretty reasonably priced. food is not awesome, but decent. i hav been goin to this place since the last 3 or 4 years, i hav no grumbles considering the prices they offer. its not a fine dine restaurant.

Though it is cheap but it is better to sit at home than to go and waste your money here. the place is an antonym for the phrase "good ambience" . all the chicken and fish items taste the same. the waiters would stand and gossip in such a way that you would be forced to feel that you are the topic of their conversation. most horrible experience. if you are willing to spend that much for a drink or a dine out with friends, new empire bar or new cathay bar are much more suitable places in the locality.

Yes its an average restaurant. Their food lacks the Chinese essence. Food served not well-decorated, taste average & oily. Ambiance not good enough for kids or family. So guys if you are looking for Chinese food w/o alcohol walk a little towards petrol pump & find Eau Chew restaurant.

Absolutely pathetic place ....  no etiquette of the staff...  least said about the ambience  the better ..  poor food quality drinks prices are exhorbitant ...  chinese  is  below par  overall a total thumbs down from me ..avoid this place if you have any self respect ...  only reason why it is running is because of the locality ...  yes rich traders from chandni chowk comes here for a  quick bite , but if you  don't fall in that category then better save yourself from the humiliation

The Chilly Pork and Reshmi Kebab is exceptional here. It is also the place to go for Chilly Chicken and chow mein in Kolkata.
