Food quality is very good . The only problem is one can't sit and have their food there because it is not actually a restaurant , it's a road side shop. It's best for take away .

One of the best road side restaurant. Located at the middle of Bangur Avenue (Block A) near the main road. This shop is open from 11 am in the morning till 11 pm in the evening. Only bad thing of this restaurant is the ambiance as you have to sit on a plastic chair on the roadside to eat food. Else the food quality & quantity both are good. Price is pocket friendly. Better if your order is a Take Away.

Bangur is slowly becoming congested and one of the posh areas of Kolkata. In this growth, food joints have equally seen a rise in number on the streets. Most of them being vegetarians, this one came as a sudden rescue. Swad is located diagonally opposite the Pashupati Flower Shop i.e. On the opposite side of the annapurna, Chennai express lane. Swad previously had opened near VIP but later shifted here. Every time I cross this place I find it crowded. And the aroma of rolls is sooooo inviting. I have only tried their rolls and I am in love with it. After Hot Pak this one is one of my favorites in this area. Swad serves great food at affordable cheap rate. The quantity is sufficient too. All over....a place one should definitely try out ðŸ˜Š
