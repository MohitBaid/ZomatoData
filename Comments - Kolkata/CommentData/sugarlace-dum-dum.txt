This bakery is located at Dumdum which takes home delivery.

Got the opportunity to taste their Chocolate Truffle cake in one of my friend's birthday. It was simply delicious, soft, fresh , and melted in the mouth instantly. It had perfect sweetness balance .

Delivery is swift.

Price is much lower than the  famous brands.

Recommended.......

দম দম এরকম একটা দোকানের দরকার ছিল । নাম করা ব্র্যান্ড গুলো ছাড়া খেতে চাইলে অবশ্যই আসা যেতে পারে । খুব ভালো মানের বেকারি । স্বাদেও বেশ ভালো , বন্ধুর জন্মদিনের কেক টা নিয়েছিলাম , চকলেট কেক বেশ লেগেছিল ।

Ran into this nice bakery service a few days ago. I thought I'd try out some of their desserts since they sounded pretty good on paper. And they didn't disappoint.

I ordered 2 chocolate mousses and 1 lemon and chocolate souffle each. They were pretty good. The chocolate souffle and mousse both were nice and not overly sweet - something which matters to me. Probably the best of the lot was the lemon souffle - loved the flavor. And the ease of ordering and delivery customized to my preferred time with no hassles whatsoever added to the experience. Add to that the fact that it is pretty light on the pocket and we have a winner. 

I will definitely be looking forward to sample more of their fare. And I recommend this place to anyone with or without a sweet tooth.

The first time Sugarlace cake experience for me was the Butterscotch cake. It had won my vote and heart at the very first go because the cream was so light and had the right amount of sweetness which in the case of other brands is too greasy, then came the sponge which again is very different from the ones in the market. We had ordered it for a colleague's birthday and thus started our office's bond with Sugarlace. Slowly and steadily we tried the chocolates which again are very authentic, then came the snacks and tarts and I hope Sugarlace continues with its innovation to treat our appetites with many more wonderful offerings. Cheers!!

Guys! Believe it or not, I have tasted Sugarlace's cakes and chocolates for a start....they taste beyond amazing! In a short time, Sugarlace has developed a wonderful bakery image of itself, where you get nothing but the best of cakes! Its been many times that I have ordered from here and got awesome reviews from the people whom I gifted chocolates or cakes on any occasion!!!

Too good guys! These cakes are all home made but the way they are designed, looks extremely professional. They taste better than mio amore cakes, kathleen, etc. all the known bakery sources and are reasonable too! Who would like the same old cake from a known shop all year? LOL !!! Go for a change, order now! :)

 A must try for all ! Taste it and you will agree with me! :)

I got to know about this outlet from one of my friends and ordered a Fresh Fruit Gateau for my parent's anniversary and it was absolutely delicious. The cake was freshly baked with all the possible seasonal fruits. Moreover it was delivered on time as promised. The owner herself is a sweet lady. This was one of the best fruit cakes I have ever tasted till now. Thank you for making this day so special. I will certainly recommend this to all.
 Weather it's chocolate truffle, pineapple cake, pistachio or muffins- you can just order anything without a second thought about it. The cake sponge itself is the usp and the innovative way each and every item is prepared is incomparable.  Way to go Sugarlace ! :)
