If anyone is looking for prawn cutlet and in fact, great prawn cutlet, this is the place to be. The cutlet is not bread-crumbed, but is batter fried. A soft cover and fresh prawn, that's Allen kitchen for you. The mutton steak is another revelation. It's basically a mutton patty covered in tangy peeper sauce. Sadly, they don't provide any bread or toast. 

The fish fry and egg devil are good and just good, nothing extraordinary. 

But for these two items, go for it - defiNitwly worth ...

Small joint. Very little seating space. But the food makes up for it.
Service was fast and amiable.
Their prawn cutlet is amazing. The chicken steak was pretty nice too. The only reason I deducted 0.5 is because I do not like steaks with curry, which this place served. But the steak itself was very well prepared.
A must-try in Kolkata at least once.

This place is located close to sovabazar metro station... Interior is quite cozy and clean.We ordered one special prawn cutlet big and one fish kobiraji.
Prawn cutlet: taste was good..crispy coating on outside and soft juicy prawns inside,the prawns were fresh..but felt that it was a bit overpriced.
Fish Kobiraji: this dish was a disappointment as the size of the cutlet was very small as compared to the price.Also there was a hair inside it,they should take more care while preparing food...taste was average..filling was less too..I felt that the place is over-hyped as one can have much better kobiraji at Dilkhusha cabin at college street.

Near Bagbazar, right on central avenue, is a quaint shop that, amongst others, is famous for its prawn cutlets. Allen is a name well acclaimed in north kolkata. You can park your car right infront and order a take away for a price that is easily affordable.

Though the place is very old, seating is not expansive and decor is archaic, this place just rocks if we talk plain and simple Bengali cuisine (read fried snacks). The prawn cutlets, jumbo prawns and kabiraji are just fabulous. Location is also very good. A must visit for foodies.

Easy to locate. Been their more than once. The place is small, around 14 people can eat. Their specialty is that most items are fried in pure ghee. Ordered Special Prawn Cutlet Big, Special Prawn Kabiraji, Fish Kabiraji, Chicken Steak, Special Chicken Breast Cutlet. Items tasted great with respect to price. Will visit again.

This is not a restaurant per se, but more of a rustic takeout joint, with a couple of tables thrown in. But what it lacks in size and grandeur, it makes up in history and tradition. As the sign says, they have been serving Kolkata for over 125 years. It is one of the brightest testimonies to the age-old tradition of deep fried non-veg food items of north Kolkata like cutlets, kabiraji cutlets (cutlets with an egg covered crumbly outer crust), chops (bread crumbs covered batter fried stuffing), Mughlai Parathas (Parathas (Indian fried flat breads) stuffed with mutton keema (hand minced mutton)), etc.

The eatery was opened by a Scotsman named Mr. Allen all years those ago, who later gifted it to his Manager, a Bengali man named Mr. Jiban Krishna Saha, and the Saha family has owned the eatery ever since. Apparently, it was this Mr. Jiban Krishna Saha who invented the famous Special Prawn Cutlet of Allen's Kitchen. It is currently managed by Mr. Gautam Saha, who is himself a talented chef who trained at the Taj in Mumbai, but still sticks to his family's traditional receipes as far as the fare of Allen's Kitchen is concerned.

For me, Allen's Kitchen is synonymous with its speciality the Special Prawn Cutlet. As with all traditional family receipes, the receipe of the Special Prawn Cutlet is a closely guarded secret of Allen's Kitchen. However, I believe that the secret of the amazing taste of Allen's Special Prawn Cutlet lies in its simplicity.

A couple of medium sized prawns are lightly marinated with onion puree (with perhaps just a hint of garlic), vinegar and/or lemon juice and salt and pepper seasoning. After a quick light fry in ghee (an Indian variant of clarified butter), the prawns are covered in a batter of what I believe is a mixture of flour, corn flour, eggs and a bit of baking soda. This is then deep fried in ghee in a wok until the crust is golden-brown and crispy. The resulting taste is simply delicious. The piping hot cutlets have a light and very crispy exterior, and the baking soda and eggs in the batter ensures a fluffy, moist interior. The prawns remain moist and juicy inside, and the light marination and initial light frying ensures that you can taste all the lovely original flavours of the prawn, without the raw seafood smell.

The deep frying in ghee leaves the cutlets a little greasy on the outside, but since, unlike cooking oil or butter, ghee has its own beautiful aroma, the ghee grease outside actually makes the cutlet more tantalizing.

Served with kasundi (Bengali mustard sauce) to spice things up just a little, prawn cutlets, for me, don't get any better than Allen's.

Allen Kitchen gives us the old world charm of the Kolkata's very famous fish-fry,cutlet and kabiraji food culture. 

Their speciality is that their cutlets are fried in pure ghee. The prawn cutlet is simply delicious with soft prawn filling. ‚ù§ The fish roll and fish cutlet are awsome too. Though they serve prawn,fish,chicken and mutton; the prawn and fish items are their speciality.

This is an cafe reminiscent of the colonial Kolkata (the kind that was popular for fries and cutlets) which is holding its own amid various snacking options of today's times.

Quality ingredients and dollops of care is what it offers, not a fancy ambience. Though the distinct change I noticed from my last visit years back was the tiled walls and floors. They co-exist with old world marble-top tables, small wooden chairs and a high-ceiling small dining room where one walks in through the kitchen helmed by an old cook who works at his own slow pace.

I ordered its famous offering- Special Prawn Cutlet (big). The aroma wafting out of the large prawn cutlet was inviting.The first bite of the cover confirmed it was different from others of its kin, primarily because it is batter-fried in ghee, that's exceptional these days. The succulent flattened prawns almost melted in the mouth! The taste was slightly sweeter than average.

The prawn cutlet of this one-hundred-twenty-five-year-old Kolkata cafe is legendary. Its patrons have some other favourites too. Most of the items on its one-page menu are fried in ghee and that's mentioned on it. The other Items are fried in refined oil not vanaspati. Most of the customers seem to be regular and know what to order.

Next, I ordered Fish Kabiraji. A large cutlet with the perfect crumbly outer cover of egg batter and a thin inner cover encasing a succulent fish fillet.

A satisfactory evening which enthused me to come back.

I had high hopes from this place, and I wasn't let down tbh! I went for their acclaimed special prawn cutlet, which turned out to be the best one I have had in ages. Fried to perfection in pure ghee, it was crispy and soft at the same time. The prawn inside was filling, succulent and flavorful. And the pocket pinch of 130bucks was on the lower side too. Definitely worth a try!

We had special prawn cutlet & fish kabiraji. & Loved bith of them. Prawn cutlet was made up of fresh large shreaded prawns, fried in ghee. Kabiraji was also awsome. Both of the dishes was priced Rs 130 each. So total bill was 260. So very pocket friendly also

If you like prawn cutlets....yes there is a god.....and this place hosts him...located near shovabazar metro this old food joint, keeps alive the magic of its prawn cutlet for nearly a 100 years, this place also serves numerous other delicacies like the mutton steak, fish fries etc. But the king prawn cultet can give any 7star a run for their money. The prawn cutlet is golden, served with mustard and onions. Once you take a bit of this...take a pause...your mouth will do the rest. The prawn is shallow fried in aromatic ghee. The ambience and cutlery wont impress you but the food is to die for.

This place is located to the left of the road that leads towards Girish park from Sovabazar Metro Station. Ask any local shopkeeper for its whereabouts, and you will be directed to this tiny place full of the memories of yesteryears. The kitchen is located right next to the entrance, and the wooden chairs and tables are reminiscent of the old world charm of some such 'Bangali cafes' located in college Street, such as Basanta Cabin and Dilkhusha Cabin. The menu here mostly consists of gool ol' cutlets and kobirajis , made of prawn, chicken and mutton. The prawn cutlets here are a must try, made with a prawn filling that has a fluffy egg coating. The chicken roll here is a clone of the more popular fish roll, and is one of the unique items on the menu. It tastes just as good as the cutlets, and is easily manageable with the knife and fork they offer. The amount of oil used in the cutlets and rolls are just perfect , so you don't feel queasy. The mutton chop and  fish chop have a layer of sooo, below which lies the actual stuffing of minced meat/fish, and taste unique. The staff here are extremely courteous, and the service is fairly quick. They don't have the option of payment by cards, so carry all the cash you need. Do pack a few of their fish chops for home, and you're sure to have a wonderful tea time. For all those cutlet crazy Calcuttans , this place is a must visit.

Their interior is very dull no doubt.competiting with the legendary outlet mitra cafe,this place is not left behind.their some item is particularly very special.this outlet signifies the true essence of calcutta street food apart from chop,singara.their prawn ghee cutlet is just out of the world and i bet it is unique.next come to their chicken steak.this is not at all taste or look like british steak. But whatever they make is also innovative. It is peppery,sweet and tangy gravy with a small but solid chicken portion.fish fry is fresh and served perfectly..portion of fish is satisfactory in it.outer base can be more crunchy.thats it.

Try their special prawn cutlet. Fried in ghee, it is heavenly. Prawn kobiraji is also too good. They usually use ghee while deep frying, which tastes awesome. But please take your food away, as the seating arrangement is not at all desirable. Car parking may be an issue, as it is located right on the main arterial road but I have seen that the police usually do not disturb you if you stop for a short duration to pickup your food parcel.

When you come to North Kolkata you can see Chop or Cutlet corner in every lane of it. This is the place where some well known restaurant like Mitra Caf√©, Malancha etc. are ruling the street food with their famous Kobiraji, Cutlet etc. Allen Kitchen is one of the popular name that belongs to that category, that doesn‚Äôt need any intro. So one day my friend and I took a quick tour to this restaurant to try some of their popular dish.

Location ‚Äì It is in between Girish Park and Shovabazar Metro. But Shovabazar metro is the near one. Situated on the Main road, so not a hard thing to find it. If you are coming from Shovabazar metro, you will find the restaurant at the left foot.

Ambiance and management ‚Äì Though most of the person uses the take away facility but they have some arrangement for dine in. When we reached around 7:30 pm, it was empty. 4 tables and 16 chairs are there.. That is its holding capacity. No such decoration, basic chair table sitting arrangement. But it is well maintained and the service is quick.

Food ‚Äì If you come here and don‚Äôt order Kobiraji, then I am quiet sure that you miss the better half there. They fried the kobiraji in Desi Ghee, which is really an noticeable one. We ordered Chicken Kobiraji, Prawn Kobiraji and Chicken Pakora.

Chicken Kobiraji ‚Äì This is one of the hot popular item item there and they made it in that way. Fried in desi ghee, which really enhances the aroma of the Kobiraji. It was perfectly cooked and served with Mustard Sauce and some salad. Highly recommended.

Prawn Kobiraji ‚Äì Unlike the Chicken Kobiraji, it has the distinct aroma of Desi Ghee. Fried in crispy way, well cooked. The flavor of the prawn is permanent, which is really an noticeable one. Try it, if you are a fan of Prawn.

Chicken Pakora ‚Äì When we were almost satisfied with two Kobiraji, the Pakora came at the end and made our dining in experience into a worst one. When it came to table we were confused to see the texture of the pakora that, weather it is a Aloo chop or rather something else. It was the worst Chicken pakora I have ever tested. The outer crust was too much deeply fried and too crunchy in flavour too. The chicken pieces into it was irregular. No such filling was there. Overall an an worst experience.

With all the item mentioned above, it cost around 350INR. No extra vat and taxes added. In conclusion, I say that if you want some good quality kobiraji, go for it. Don't try to do some experiment or to order the other dishes one. May be it will take your expectation level to the ground.

Located near sova bazar metro station, Allen's kitchen is one of the oldest still serving resturant in the city of joy. This place has a rich history of more than 120 years. They are famous for their prawn kobiraji. Decor wasn't fancy but had a nice old rustic feel to it. 


We ordered prawn kobiraji, prawn cutlet and mutton kobiraji. Although nothing was healthy about it, but the taste was amazing, and we enjoyed it very much. Everything was fried in clarified butter (ghee). The prawns were fresh, Seasoned beautifully. Kobiraji was flavoured with garlic ginger onion and parsley.  The mustard sauce (kasundi) was unique, it had a sweet after taste, which i liked very much.

 In conclusion this place is a must visit for every food lover in kolkata.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

I was told that this kitchen is run by family members and that they have fascinating food.

The shop is a small one which once did bustle with people and now has lost much of its glory.

The shop is famous for its cutlets and chops and one may try the prawn cutlet and ptato chops which are interesting.

They shall serve you other delicacies on request and undoubtedly very friendly people. However as a health concious foodie I shall always say that they have too much inclination on deep fried food and so must use green salads as accompaniment to give a fair chance to gastronomy.

The place is small, just four tables. The interiors have¬†undergone a makeover. ¬†Gone are those damp walls (with my nostalgia) which have been freshly painted. ¬†The Prawn Cutlet remains the same. ¬†That taste of pure ghee with soft prawn is still mouthwatering. ¬†I tried the Chicken Steak too. ¬†It is a tad bit filling than the cutlet, which I could eat at least two. For the steak, I stop at one only.

Small place with four tables for four , i was so glad to get myself introduced by my friend to this little gem serving one of the finest cutlets and kabiraji in the city. I tried their fish cutlet served with kasundi and onion salad which was indeed nice. However my recommendation goes for the special prawn cutlet fried in ghee.soft fleshy prawns with a crisp coating makes such a damn combination with the light mustard sauce , making me drool even while writing this . Prices are very affordable owing the quality of their servings. Its a must visit if you are nearby sobhabazar area.

We went for an ashtami evening snack here. It is one of the famous places in kolkata where you can get some traditional mouth watering kabiraji cutlets and fish fries. And with no doubt I will say that this is definitely true,  I was very happy with the quality of food.  However,  the place is too small even for a cabin.

If you are weight watching, stay very clear of this place. This is a Pure Ghee Heaven. All the items are done in pure ghee and are what a bengali' s food dreams comprise of. Knockout kobirajis, to die for cutlets. Their version of Chicken steak might not seem like what every one is used to,  but do try or you would be missing out on something good

Allen Kitchen and its Chicken Kabiraji and Chicken Cutlet is something you wont like to miss out. Their Chicken Kabiraji, roasted in ghee is the best Kabiraji you will find in town.
Try their Prawn Cutlet too. It is also very good item here.
The joint is small but food quality is very good.

The old North Calcutta is the king in terms of evening snacks. The big names like Mitra Cafe, Kalika, Dilkhusi Cabin, Malancha etc. creats the color of this rainbow. But in Zomato the name Allen Kitchen is quite popular in this catagory.

With a ton of expectations we gave this restaurant a try located on the main road of Shova Bazaar. By some research on Zomato we found that their Kabiraji is quite famous, that also fried in pure ghee. Without doing any further we ordered the same.

Talking about the dine, it gives just the old north calcutta feelings. Small, wooden table & chairs, tiles on walls, wooden rows on ceiling, clean & hyginic from every angle. Till then the food came, let's jump in...

Fish Kabiraji : The size of the Kabiraji was pretty average served with some salad & mustard sauce. With very less fish inside & oily outer layer outside, it also tatsed very average. But it was crispy & well fried in ghee. We were expecting way more than this.
 
Prawn Kabiraji : Although I am having allergy of prawn, still I took few bites of this just to check their specialty. Yes it's their specialty & the fragrance of ghee was also present over here. Comparatively it was bigger than the fish one. But inside the quantity of prawn wasn't very denced. Also the thick cover outside felt very oily. However it tasted somewhere between good to average but didn't touchs the heart as expected.

Chicken Pokora : Unfortunately we tried this at last & such disappointment fell on us like thunderstorm. We had never seen a Chicken Pokora like this before. It was less pakora more chop. Inside just a small piece of chicken absolutely tasteless & mostly empty. Outside hard thick oily layer that felt ridiculous. It ruined the tastebugs with its bad taste & the good taste of kabiraji was also gone from our mouth because of this. Just a recommendation, Don't ever order this over here!

Our total bill came over 400 bugs & that seemed quite overpriced to us. Ghee fried snacks costs more but if it doesn't tastes special then whats the meaning of that.

Final words, I didn't liked the place at all. Still preferences differ person to person. You can surely give this a try, but I'm sure there's better options out there.

This is a legendary outlet of Calcutta which has mesmerized the foodies for more than a century . Located at Jatindra Mohan Avenue in northern part of Calcutta they serve various types of cutlet , kabiraji & chop etc. There is no decorating lights , no glamorous  entrance , no well dressed manager to greet you at the entrance . A dimly lit neon signboard announces its presence . One actually enters into the kitchen of Allen Kitchen when he enters into the outlet as the front part is their kitchen . The small sitting area comprising of few wooden chairs & tables is on the back side . One could feel the old Calcutta ambience with smell of freshly cooked cutlet etc. What they lack in providing modern ambience they more than complement it  with their food . I like their Prawn Cutlet most & whenever I visit this place this item remains in my wish list. Today had Fish Rolls also which was quite good too . You can actually get the smell of pure ghee in their items , simply mouthwatering . 
             There was a time when Cutlet etc. were available in only a few selected places in Kolkata & Allen Kitchen was one of them if not the best of them . These items are now readily available all-over Kolkata & there are hundreds of outlets selling them but still Allen retains their flavour . Visit this place not only to enjoy their delicacies but also to get a nostalgic feeling of the days when Kolkata used to be Calcutta .

Purity is the bliss, a true quality & process 'transparent' eatery. Superb place. I mean look at the 'black & white' way of doing things. No stale food, No 'bhejaal' Tel(oil). The moment u enter this place, your lungs would be filled with pure ghee odour. 

There's an old man u will see making the fry, cutlets, kabiraji right in front of u. We ordered a fish kabiraji (Oh, by the way-- ALL types of Kabiraji s are fried in PURE GHEE), Mutton chop, fish fry. Food is great. Yes,dont expect AC, or a high-end waiter. This is a place to go with your near & dear ones-- just dig in & go on Adda in full swing. Really, a must go for all kolkatans

I had expected a hell lot from this place. My friends and i have been planing to try this for a long time. We had prawn cutlet and kabiraji. The kabiraji was good. But the cutlet was not upto the mark. Overall it was an okay-ish experience. I'll really like them to enhance the flavours of prawn and make the batter a little exciting too.

I, like most of the Kolkata's food lover have a penchant of sorting out and visiting these food joints of Kolkata, which exudes nostalgia of our beloved Calcutta!
Started some 100 years ago, this place still stands its ground. I, always wanted to visit Allen kitchen, but again the distance and the lyadh (staple food of bengalis) kept me at bay!!
Anyhow, last Sunday , I braved all the odds (read lyadh) and did visit this place with my Lady. Located few meters away from mitra cafe on the opposite footpath, this renovated place is quaint and easy to miss. 
It was fairly empty, unlike it's noisy neighbor. Seated inside, we ordered, couple of the famous, special prawn cutlet. It arrived in no time. 
Fluffy, crisply fried to golden color, it looked absolutely delicious! The aroma of the ghee filled in the immediate air. I have had prawn cutlets before, but not fried in ghee. That, actually changed the taste of the cutlet and took it new heights, which my taste buds weren't used too. However, the actual prawn was wafer thin; more of the batter and less on the filling, the cutlet was! 
I wanted to try out their chicken steak in ghee. I mean a chicken steak prepared by ghee, ain't something you see everyday and I was thoroughly disappointed. A chicken keema patty fried in ghee and served in a ghee based tangy gravy with sauteed onions on top wasn't what I did expect as a chicken steak! Anyways, whatever it was, it wasn't good to taste, too much soured, too much ghee! 
God only knows, when I'll stop experimenting, with the proven favourite menu of a place!

Overall, it was a mixed bag more on the negative. But, walking down the lanes of sovabazar and dining in a legendary place where the who's who of the elite Calcutta used to come and dine in and chat/discuss/ converse over a plate of cutlet/chop did make up for the lacking in the dish itself. 
As I told my wife, the visit to the place , the feeling of the ambience did make up for what they couldn't serve in the dish.

One of the best fast food centres in kolkata. Good food good taste. Options are pretty cool. Old legendary  outlet at sovabazar. Tried out their special prawn cutlet. Get to know what "kolkata typical snacks" actually is! lovely. Not too oily but an aromatic flavour of ghee.. soft interior of cutlet (flour based). No unnecessary  filling. Soft steamed prawn (tiger prawn ) portion... my review marks are based on only food.. i don't  expect good ambiance at such a cheap rate in north calcutta atleast.

In my opinion, An iconic food place should not be rated.. and there is no place more iconic in Kolkata than Allen Kitchen.. To survive for around 130 years (present location since 1958), in a day and age when we foodies have become fickle and want to taste something new every day, is no mean feat.. Prawn Cutlet cooked in pure ghee.. Does not get better than this.. And the mutton cutlet was amazing too..¬† Trudge along Allan Kitchen.. trudge along.. hope my Grand Children will have the honour of tasting the food here, cooked by your Grand Children..

Allen Kitchen is one of the legendary food joints in the city. 

**Location**
Very near to Shovabazar metro this place is very easy to find.

**Experience**
Well they are famous for their Prawn Cutlet and that's the hot selling item over here. Other than that Kabiraji and Cutlets are also quite decent. They have a sitting area as well where you can sit back and enjoy your favourite items piping hot but better not to visit in hot summer days as no air conditioning is available. Quality was dipped down a little I agree but still serves their special dishes I. Special way.

Rightly featured under Legendary Collections, they simply excel in making Prawn Cutlets. The soft and thin outer coating, the cutlet simply melts in the mouth. Although, one must admit that their quality has gone downhill in these years, they are still good with this. I have tried their Kabiraji once, but to me, I like the ones served at Adi-Maloncho more. The pricing here is a bit steep, but then the quality and the sheer nostalgia kind of makes up for it.

That this eatery has been running for more than a century now is in itself a testimony to its quality.

I have tasted most of the stuff that they have to offer....simply mind blowing is all I can say. The taste that they put on your plate cannot be found at any other place in Kolkata...be it the Prawn Cutlets, Mutton Kabiraji, Chicken Kabiraji, Special Fish Cutlet, Mutton Steak. and the egg chop is a bomb!!

A must for every foodies in the town.
This is located near sobhabajar metro station...3minutes walking distance.

I was quite disappointed with their mutton and chicken cutlets, since I'd heard quite a lot about their legendary brain chops and 'fast food that tempts foodies to lick fingers.' The cutlets not only lacked a good taste - were somehow a little bland - but also were devoid of the zing and tangy spiciness of a good cutlet like the ones from Dilkhusha Cabin. The salad and mustard were okay, the mustard being of a different taste like a hummus and itself a cool sauce. My general impression of Allen is not upto the mark, sort of discouraging to say the least.

Located close to the shovabajar metro stop, this heritage place is famous for its special prawn cutlet(with ghee).

My first ever visit was many years ago, a day of the durga pujo; I was out pandal hopping with my father and he forced me to walk a whole lot just to come to this place to eat. But I can say now, that it was worth it. An old cabin trying it's best to make it still in the new and changing city. It's quite commendable. We had their specialty - prawn cutlet. And sure enough, it was like nothing I'd ever had. Yes, they have a small menu, practically nothing of an ambience, but that cutlet was really something. I went back last year, about the same time. And sure enough, the place is just the same. A small shack bustling with customers buying prawn cutlets n more :)

A heritage "cabin' type restaurant in the heart of north Kolkata. It is especially famous for its famed prawn cutlet. I had one years back and I must say it was the most delicious cutlet I ever had. I need to retaste it sometime soon. Recently I had their chicken cutlet and chicken steak. The cutlet was awful. It was as if I was putting fried bread into my mouth. I couldn't taste the chicken and it lacked seasoning.

The steak was too sweet for my liking and felt like I was eating "french toast" and I am not even sure if it could be called as a steak; it was so thin, breaking apart as I tried to take it out of the box. For me, the steak, was not worth the Rs. 95 price tag

Are you a true bengali foodie? Can you ignore anything & everything to taste great brngali culinary delicasies. Then this is your place. Don't look right or left, go straight & grab a chair & order chingrir cutlet (prawn cutlet) & fish Kabiraji. Don't even look at the menu. I did this mistake once & ended up destroying the great taste of prawn cutlet in my mouth by tasting an egg devil. It is bette that you limit yourself to prawn & fish cutlet & kabirajis. It is tbe true legacy of Allen's kichen.

Prawn cutlets are soft jumbo prawn covered with light & very thin crunchy egg coating. You can almost see the prawn despite of the coating & that is the speciality. Simply melts in your mouth. 

If you are from Kolkata or living in Kolkata, you should taste it al least once
 I bet you would not be able to stop there.

Warning : Don't look at walls. You will end up feeling as if you are having a meal all tile coated bathroom. The rating is totally for food.

This legend on the Central Avenue is a bit difficult to locate owing to the small sign board. However, once found, you can park the car in front of it without any problem and they serve you in the car also. It's a fast food joint with zero ambience. No glass door, no AC, no fancy cutlery. But just taste their Special Prawn Cutlet, Special Fish Cutlet and Prawn Kobiraji! Made with pure desi ghee, these are out of the world. I have driven from exteme south of Kolkata to this outlet many a times just for their food. A must try!

Fresh, soft, well cooked..u actually can feel every bit of it.. chicken kabiraji was good. Did not like the mutton kabiraji though. The reason being they use ghee to deep fry. So u can understand how heavy a the food is..mutton/chicken, egg and then deep fried in ghee. So health conscious people should avoid. But any foodies shouldn't miss it's authentic taste. Bang on!! Next visit soon

Had set my heart on visiting this joint at least once and trying their prawn cutlet. But could not due to two reasons -1) the signboard is so small and indiscreet that I have often driven past it without noticing it,2) there is difficulty in parking. You cannot stand in front of it without having a nagging fear at the back of your mind that your precious car might be being booked by the traffic police. But today fortunately as we passed by, the signboard at last caught our eye and we could even find a place to park the car, hoping that the traffic police would not mind.
I don't want to deal with the history and ambience of the joint as it has been dealt with by other reviewers. I will go straight to the rest.
The staff is indifferent but alert and not impolite. They tried their best to make me feel at ease by offering chair and also by handing over the parcel to me at my car. The food was ready within 10 minutes. Good, very good.
I wanted to order their famous prawn cutlet. The staff suggested special prawn cutlet. I agreed. The price is a bit steep but it is worth it. The prawn came in a whole piece. The covering is very thin so that you get the whole prawn. And the fry just melted in my mouth. Heavenly.
Would love to try their other items next time.

This eatery is simply the stuff of legends. Established more than 130 years ago, the original shop was located at Chitpur. The present one started functioning years later as a branch. Currently the original shop has shut down and this shop is the only one serving the foodies of Kolkata. 
I am no one to judge a legend....an institution that has crossed more than 130 winters, has stood the test of time and is still steaming forward. That this eatery has been running for more than a century now is in itself a testimony to its quality.

On my last visit they had run out of stock of Special Prawn Cutlets.....so it was a bit disappointing for me. Anyways I plan to be back soon and gorge on the Prawn Cutlets and the other delectable items.
Don't expect this place to score high on ambience.....come here, put your head down and just gorge, cause at the end of the day food is all that matters.

Allen's Kitchen was set up as a small family business when Calcutta had horse drawn trams and phaetons and the Babus would come and savour the food of the Sahibs... And the legacy of 137 years lives on in every bite of the fabled Chingree r ( Jumbo Prawns) cutlet here at Allen's Kitchen in the heart of North Calcutta.... 
The place is a small unassuming typical North Calcutta eatery with very little fluff and grandeur but the food speaks volumes for itself.... You may choose cutlets and fries fried in pure ghee (clarified butter)... That may sound a little weird but believe me when I say they are spectacularly delicious!!! 
The Special Prawn Cutlet is out of the world awesome... And the Fish fries oh my God... Melts in the mouth yet crispy and coated in eggs ( none of the oily and lardy aftertaste of a kabirajee, thought it looks like it,  it is infact not a kabirajee... As there is no bread crumbs on the Cutlet just a fluffy coat of eggs) ... Subtle and beautiful 
Now the special mention... The deviled egg... A whole egg.... Cut in half.... Ensconced in a spicy and delicious mince.... And fried to perfection. 
Finally the fish roll... Which I have brought home and savouring as I write this review... This is stupendous... The savoury spicy mince in encompassed in a thin fish fillet and then fried... Yum yum.... 
So dear reader please please please go and eat in this place that has a story to tell... And savour the one of a kind delicacy it has to offer...

Another Hidden Jewel! This is also an old Calcutta Cafe which is famous for its Prawn Cutlet. The place is very small without any decor, the way into the sitting is through the kitchen.¬†
It is a must visit place if you want to taste prawn cutlet. Other items on offer are not that great!

Visited on 27-Dec-15. Small place but neat inside. You have to walk through the kitchen to reach the sitting area. This is unique. We had chicken cutlet, I had a fish fry additionally as my friend does not eat fish. Well the cutlet was quite nice and light. I should have stopped at that or should have ordered one more of the same. Instead I asked for a fish fry which was a mistake. Not that the taste of the fish fry was bad, but somehow I did not enjoy it. I guess, you should stick to one type when you are having these type of food. The taste of one gets disturbed by the other and in the end you feel lost. Recommeded for all.

So finally at a legendary heritage place which most foodies at Kolkata swear by.

The place: it's a shabby old place with a small sitting area and unhygienic open kitchen right after the entry. This isn't to scare folks but adds on to the place. Don't expect ambience.

The history : the chief cook of the eponymous sahib started dishing out the food loved by Allen after his departure from India. The current owners don't seem to have any design to revamp this place. I appreciate their desire to stick on to the old days.

The food : on the side of blasphemy, I really don't understand the hype about their special prawn cutlet. No doubt it's something laced with tradition and lots of ghee but the flavor of prawns remained oblivious to my taste buds.
I have now placed an order for special chicken chop (croquette) which remains another heritage item to be treated apart from the steak. The chicken chop turned out lovely with minced masala chicken stuffed inside a covering of boiled potatoes and eventually covered with bread crumbs. Loved it. 

The verdict : definitely a must visit. But don't set your expectations too high. I mean expectations about the food. Forewarned is forearmed.

In these days of standardization I really love the idea of them still existing. Kudos keep up the good work but it wouldn't hurt if you used some better prawns!

A legendary kolkata eatery and a class of its own.
Run by family and all meat ,seafood and poultry are fresh.
Prawn cutlet is an iconic preparation here and me and my friends all over india swear by it.
Fish cutlet is very good and prepared with a thick slab of bhetki.
Fish roll and kabiraji also worths a mention.
Try out the steak (chicken or mutton),its different actually a concoction of bengali and continental kitchen.

A small yet cozy, Allen Kitchen offers a decent experience of snacking to the regular visitors and those, explorers of classic north Kolkata joints. Unlike the busy and crowded Mitra Caf√© (opposite to Allen's), Allen is a relatively less crowded joint just next to Sovabazar Sutanuti Metro station. The best items to be sorted out from the menu are Special Prawn & Fish cutlets, Chicken/mutton steak and Chicken Coverage (Kobiraji). The special cutlets are not deep fried unlike the regular cutlets and fried in pure ghee. The fish (Calcutta Bekti) of the cutlet is well marinated with a hint of lemon. The steaks are not conceptually usual that one finds at Park streets but taste good. The chicken coverage is also crispy and worth for a try. Though the price is a bit on a higher side compared to other north Kolkata joints, Allen Kitchen remains a mighty place for putting on some calories in an odd day out...! :-)

Mutton chop is not at all crispy. Very oily food as most are pure ghee fried. The chicken pakora tastes more like ordinary, and not crispy. The fish fry is very tasty and as per price the quality is good. The ambiance makes it more a take away counter.

A centenary shop. Legend of prawn cutlet.that's all I heard before going to Allen's.
So,when in a summer evening,I reached at sovabajar. The shop was in full swing. Undoubtedly I ordered prawn cutlet(fried in laxmi ghee).after almst 20 mins.a pancake like thing hit my table. Thin in volume,smell of ghee all around. Cut a piece,tasted; prawns are smashed,minced inside. Not at all very tasty. It took 12-15 min to finish. Sorry Allen,it seems ur time is over in the decade.

One of the oldest fast food junction of kolkata. Recently visited this place after hearing a lot about this place. It is situated at shobhabazar,2 mins walk from shobhabazar metro station. This is mainly famous for their chingri cutlet fried in pure ghee but after having it frankly speaking it did not taste great at all and there was no smell of ghee...it was just average. Ambience is normal. The quality of food has detoriated.

It might be sacrilegious for other reviewers if they see how much have I rated for Allen kitchen but I can't help being honest! :p

Location: Its close to the shobhabazar metro station, on the left footpath.

Ambience: Well, I should have skipped this point altogether! It's a small, shabby old shop which the owner has, I guess, no desire to renovate. We were led to a very small sitting area inside the shop,which to my utter surprise was empty. It was a weekday, early evening so that might be the reason.

Service: The place was empty, and service was pretty fast.

Food: Being prawn allergic, I decided to go for their another popular dish, fish kabiraji. The menu card claims it to be fried in desi ghee. In about 10 mins, came the kabiraji. I have had kabirajis elsewhere and the size here was on the smaller size and it being priced at 95, I expected it to be bigger. Coming to the taste, it was bland :(

Well, if you want to taste tradition, go to Allen. It's a small eatery, serving great cutlet and chops- the trademark of North Calcutta. The owner is a very friendly man and while munching the delights, just take a walk down his memory lane. It might look shabby but go there for the food. Don't strictly judge Allen kitchen by its cover.

Found out this place from the hidden gems section, and visited once I was in the north Calcutta locality for a work. After finding out the location which is few mins from the metro station, I ordered for their famous prawn cutlet and mutton cutlet. I was little disappointed to be honest, as the taste was not so great that I have heard reviews of. The mutton cutlet was good (not extraordinary) and prawn cutlet was also same (less fried and bland). The interiors here are very small with 2-3 closely placed tables and reminds of the old Calcutta restros like das cabin or anadi.

Being a passionate food explorer, and a walkie talkie one too... I walked my way from esplanade one fine Saturday upto Allen's kitchen in Shovabazar, past the famous Mitra Cafe.
Allen's is famous for its prawn cutlet, fish culet and chicken chop.
I decided to give each one a try.
To my dismay I found that this eatery is just a mere history. Once upon a time a cretain Mr. Allen's cook had opened this resto in memory of the sahib who had left the country and started serving the sahib's favourite dishes. Back then these may have been a delight due to the rarity of such dishes cooked in pure ghee. Right now, with the same unchanged interior, dirty kitchen and no intention to open branches or expand, it may surely be a piece of nostalgia as you enter it, but it rarely is a delight in taste compared to the time it stands in at present.
I am fond of holding onto such unchanged nostalgia, but definitely with an evolving recipe and taste and a sense of the rare bengali gene of business.

There are days when I ride all the way to Sobhabazar from Behala just for the Chicken Steak and Prawn Cutlets... I know a lot of ppl might not rate the steak as their favourite out here..but somehow the unique spicy yet tangy taste just stays with you... The cutlets and fries are truly Kolkata mein World famous... You have to enter the eating area through the kitchen actually, manned by an old gentleman who I would like to believe made the same stuff the same way from the days of Uttam Suchitra!! Well that's my fancy!! The place is definately worth a visit!! I firmly believe the South Calcuttans should learn from the Chop Cutlet culture of true North Calcutta!!

Then I cut open the whole cutlet  and found a little sliver of a prawn surrounded by huge batter. Such a rip off !!

Simple and elegant is what I would like to call all the dishes that this place offers. Situated opposite to one of the most famous places of the world, this is a really small `cabin' to attract people. But size literally doesn't matter. You will be able to smell the ghee fired items from about 400 metres away. That's how I was able to find the place. It's not much of a looker specially because the kitchen is at the entrance and the dining area consists of only five tables. But these petty things does not pose any threat to Allen's popularity. I had taken my elder brother for a treat and we had ordered special prawn cutlet, mutton cutlet and fish fry. Their presentation very ordinary but what they present is extraordinary. The prawn cutlet contains a single medium sized tiger prawn (bagda) dipped in batter and then fried in pure ghee. The mutton cutlet personifies the term and made my dream of having an "original mutton cutlet" come true. I am at a loss of words as to how to describe the cutlet. It had the perfect balance of finely chopped onions, garlic, chillies (scarce) and the perfect granular meat. The fish fry was more of a fish batter fry. Nevertheless, it tasted excellent.¬†

I waited a few days to write this review because Fried items can cause serious problems to my stomach. The number of stars I am giving is a testament to how good the quality of the food as well as the cooking media is.

When Late Jiban Krishna Saha became the owner of Mr. Allen‚Äôs restaurant in the late 19th century, had he any idea that more than 130 years later this place would be one of the favorite drooling dens for the food lovers of the city? Well, that we will never know. But we can always visit Allen Kitchen to taste the finest fries which made them what they are today The current address, which started as a branch more than 50 years ago (in the year 1958 to be precise), is now their only outlet serving delicious Prawn, Fish and Chicken items.

Well to talk about Allen Kitchen, undoubtedly one of the brightest chapters in the history of North Kolkata food culture..Located close to sovabazar metro station you may not feel like having food here at the first sight..Its a shabby little place..but all its flaws can be overlooked when it comes down to their speciality: Prawn Cutlet!!Whenever I visit this place the smell of this item barred me from tasting any other of their dish..its such fabulous..They don't use bread crumb in their cutlet..a simply eggy batter and pure ghee for frying..that is their speciality..minimum spice..golden texture..its light and fluffy..Many celebrities over the years including the likes of Uttam Kumar have savoured their fried items..If you have still not visited it u r missing out on something quite unique..One word of caution do visit early cause they prepare only a limited amount every day..Also try their Prawn Kabiraji and Fish Roll..
Only issue is their indifferencetowards hygiene..which should be taken care off..

The prawn cutlette is gheir speciality and is highly recommended. It has real mid sized prawns jnside and a slight creamy taste as the stuff melts in the mouth. The fish fry and mutton cutlette are great too.

Happen to be an irregular, but a steady visitor, in love with the food this eatery offers.Though I stay in South Kolkata, I make it a point to land up here, specially for their prawn cutlet. The place is on C R Avenue, close to Shovabazar Metro. Go for their special Prawn Cutlet (fried in ghee) , Fish Roll, Fish Fry, Deviled Egg...the list is unending. Of late, they have done up the interiors of the restaurant, which now will attract the young crowd as well, but for us, it is nostalgia when the same quality food was offered with worn out cutlery, old small wooden chairs and tables with a crooked wash basin in one corner of the eatery.

This is a true KOLKATA FOOD INSTITUTION, started more than 100 years ago (established date from Unverified but reliable North Kolkata source is around 132 years) and serves the historic Prawn Cutlets. This joint has lived the history of the ‚ÄòCITY OF JOY‚Äô and it‚Äôs really my luck that I could taste the flavor of history. I have always had someone takeaway from this joint but today decided to pay a visit to this Kolkata food institute.

Location: Very Close to Shovabazar Metro. Parking is a tad troublesome on weekdays but it‚Äôs not an issue if you‚Äôre on a Sunday, you can park easily on the main road.

Ambience: This joint is serious business and believe me ambience is there least priority. 

Food: -

Prawn Cutlet: Great! Beautiful crustacean coated with a house secret batter and deep-fried to perfection. Have it with Allen‚Äôs unique kasundi. Melts in your mouth and the taste of ghee is very aromatic. Hands down best prawn cutlets. ¬†

Devilled Egg: One whole egg cut half and sandwiched with a mutton filling then coated and deep-fried to perfection. Believe me there was no oil dripping. Tastes heaven. The filling was a bit sweet and was all just perfect.

Price: Decent priced with INR 120 per piece per prawn cutlet and deviled eggs for INR 35 per piece.

This joint lives up to its reputation!!!

I did not quite know there is an old heritage joint nearby my house. All credits to zomato for helping me rediscover shobhabazar in a better way. Now this one is a brisk walk from shobhabazar metro towards beadon street taking the left footpath. There stands allen kitchen. As it is a very precise little joint, it is difficult to initially get a table. It took me atleast 20 minutes to get one. What people presumably prefer is to get the food parcelled. After the long wait, entered into the restro. The walls looked shabby, not taken care of for a long time. But the rich smell of fish being fried would compensate for the shabby outlook. What I wanted to order was the prawn cutlet, but as ot was late, the prawn cultlets were over. So instead I went in for the fish roll. It tasted amazing. It was crisp, rolled with fish. The crumb outside and the fish inside made me fall in love with fish again. Then I ordered for a chicken steak. It looked awesome. But tasted horrifying. It was ghee based , too sweet. It is better not to spend your hard earned money on an useless item like chicken steak which tastes pathetic. But I will definitely go back to taste the prawn cultets available.

------------------------------------------------------

Thus I got to taste their signature, on my second visit, which nearly compelled me to change my rating, a point higher up. 

I believe Kolkata food is incomplete without tasting the prawn cutlet at allens. It is soft, it is filling, the portion of the prawn inside is generous. The egg coating that surrounds the prawn, amazing. It melts in your mouth, literally. The crisp and the taste prolongs in your taste buds for like forever.

The price is nominal as compared to the amazing food served.

A genuine recommendation for people who love prawns and an appeal to those who hate prawns. Try this and you will not stop eating this.

Allen kitchen claim themselves to be around for some 130 years! My first brush with this legendary North Kolkata eatery came only a few days back.This is located near Shobha bazar metro station on central avenue itself diagonally opposite another heritage old Kolkata eatery,Mitra cafe.

The food is mainly typical Bengali fast food.The Prawn cutlet is their speciality.I tried their special Prawn Cutlet and Kabiraji.The food took quite a while in arriving but it was served fresh and hot.They were made of pure ghee as the menu card said and one could get the aroma of the ghee even before tasting it.Both the preparations were unique and really enjoyable.The batter was really tasty.The amount of prawn inside was rather less I must admit.But overall it was tasty and I enjoyed it nonetheless.The egg devil here is also good and the size is appreciable.

The place is a small one but pretty neat and clean I must say.The wooden chairs and the marble topped tables lend an old world feel to this place.There was a single person looking after the customers and the service was a little slow.The prices are quite reasonable.

Overall this is a small eatery which has a lot of heritage attached to it and it surely offers something unique.I have heard people say Allen is not what it used to be.But whatever it is now,it is pretty decent and is surely worth a try.

Out of many dishes the best one is "Prawn cutlet". Fresh prawns dipped in the fresh egg batter¬† and fried in pure desi ghee, producing the legendary dish. Prawn and desi ghee are key elements. The smell and the taste would make you feel wonder. Forget calories and have some fresh ghee fried cutlets, not only the cutlet try to have their "Fish Roll" two layered different stuffed fish mixture bread crumbs coated magic missiles and "Egg Devils" are really grenade sized. You would love the taste of both.

This place is not well decorated you don't need to cause the foods they serve is sufficient to mesmerize you. Allen then,now and forever....Kolkata's pride of Prawn Cutlet :)

Overall Good, Chicken Steak was Ok but the Prawn Cutlet prepared by Ghee was simply extraordinary. Don't get confused by a similar outlet "New Allen Kitchen beside anouther famous food joint "Mitra Cafe". This is diagonally opposite to Mitra Cafe, you need to walk for aroud 5 mins from Shovabazar metro.

I had heard a lot about this place from my dad and uncle for as long as I can remember until recently some months back I decided to venture out on my own.Finding the place is not much of a deal as it is on the main road. One spoiler alert , they are operational only after 4pm.Now coming to the experience.  A very small joint with 5 tables in totality. Not quite impressive. We ordered the legendary special prawn cutlet in pure ghee and fish cutlet.  When the food arrived I realised why this place was so talked about. It was a delicacy. I dont know how they must have marinated this but it was so soft that it would melt in your mouth the moment you had it. And the prawn was also very fresh which made the dish such a wonder. Fish cutlet was also out of the world. We were so impressed with the overall experience that we took away mutton steak as well for dinner. Simply amazing. Only drawback is that since each of the dishes are made fresh then and there , the stock is limited, so if you're late you might have to return with heavy hearts.

After hearing a lot from my dad and grandfather about this heritage place had decided to pay a visit to this place one evening with a friend of mine which claims to be more than 130 years old. What i had heard about this place was different from what I had actually experienced. Now the place has revolutionized itself by changing a overall decor which now enables customers to sit and gorge on their delicacies. 
We had ordered prawn cutlet, mutton steak and chicken chop. After we had ordered and were excited to have the food right in front of our table the smell of pure ghee rocketed our nostrils and we were blown away by it. Later on actually when I had found out the cutlet was decent with the price they charge. As it was fried in a batter of egg and ghee a yellowish color was visible and thing was very soft. There were considerable amount of prawns in the cutlet compared to the recent soaring of price of fish. My favorite was the mutton steak which was absolute awesome. It was more of an Indian steak as you won't get a large chunk of meat but what actually we got was minced mutton which was given a formidable shape with a light gravy which was equally fiery, sweet and sour which totally made my day. Believe me it was awesome. Next the chicken chop was also good. Minced chicken was all over and was wrapped in a coating of mashed potato and given a shape and fried. I won't say it was great but it was good. 
Such heritage places not only defines good food but the actual culture of the people s reflected. So people should always give their helping hand and the best way we can help is to try and try.

Another Landmark in the history of kolkata food. They claim to have existed for 130 years. All the older poeple say that allen is no longer what it used to be. But what ever they serve is still quite good and it can be diffuclt to get their fare because that make limited portions. 

Located very near Shovabazar metro station, it is quite a hangout of many office goers. The prawn cutlet is the HERo of this place but a personal favorite is the fish roll. The prawn cutlet is more of an eggy batter and is said to have been fried in ghee. This is their all time specialty . My favorite the fish roll is quite phenomenal.. The use a thin flat fillet of fish and the put a spicy stuffing an make a roll of the fish  fillet itself and then crumb fried . Simply sinful 

The inner sitting space has marble top tables similar to those at paramount (sherbet) which is quite a signature of outlets of the pre-Independence era, 

I would not recommend the mutton cutlet its not as great.. but the chicken cutlet is good as is the egg devil.. 

The thing i like most is that the kitchen is first in the entrance and then is the sitting area ... its is reassuring that they keep their operations transparent . 

Definitely worth a shot.. I quite love the old world nostalgia more than anything else ..

They have declined a little, although the prawn cutlet is still The Best in Kolkata and fried in pure ghee, but they were much better previously indeed. Their chop and egg devils are also very tasty. A tough to find out shabby room across shobha bazar metro station. Very rare, very different and very best too. A real heritage.

They have wonderful especially chigri special.. go there and enjoy the indian fast food... don't expect a great ambience or a good place to sit and eat... just buy n eat the kolkata way...based on kolkata style it is a little costly than the usual, not a daily eat out...

Located near the Shovabazar Metro station, beside Axis Bank. Ambience is like a normal hotel with sitting arrangements. I have tried the following :-
Fish Fry @ 35 : Average.
Fish Cutlet and Prawn Cutlet @ 60 : Very good taste. They have an innovative way of preparing the batter with ghee. The combination of the batter with a thin layer of fish fillet give it an awesome taste. One must try these.
Chicken Steak @ 65 : Average, made of egg, chicken keema and gravy.
Egg Devil @ 25 : Good. It contains two slices of a full boiled egg with mutton keema in between.
The service is good and kashondi is provided.

Yes... Finally could make it to this place. Heard about this place a lot form friends & also through news papers. I had to take a long ride of 18 kms fur from Behala to reach out to this Historic place. Started with the Special Prawn Cutlet moved to normal prawn cutlet & then ended up with a chicken & a mutton Kabiraji. Did enjoy the food a lot forgetting the add ons of calorie that happened due to the ghee in which all these were fried. Had to skip my dinner due to this heavy evening snacks. The person sitting at the cash counter explained to me the heritage of the   place.

Heard a lot about " Allen er chingrir cutlet ". Then one fine day dropped in and was stunned to see the place. If you prefer a clean place to eat then this is not one. The cutlet too is overrated. But this place is primarily famous for its age. Probably more than a 100 years old and still in business. And the cutlet had generous amount of "chingri" in it so that too is a + point. :)

The only reason for my enthusiasm to travel 5 km from down south in search of a mere fried snack was the  attachment of heritage with this restaurant which has been in business for over 130 years. It is located on the left side of the road if traveling towards the south from Shovabazaar Metro statio on Central Avenue or Jatindramohan Avenue as is it called at present. It is a tiny shop where ,interestingly, the kitchen is situated at the entrance. My imagination makes me believe that it is a neighbourhood shop from where the peopel of the locality would buy their afternoon tea time snack and in time their name spread throughout the city. In my experience the typical Bengali snacks (which have a mild British influence and in turn is what I call Calcuttanized) is best served in the northern part of the city which was the original Calcutta and even today the typical snacks which are synonymous to the city are available in only the old part of our city . While Allen Kitchen has been famous for its fishy affair I personally ordered the plate of fish pakodas and my friend opted for their famous prawn cutlet. I am unfortunately allergic to all sea food. The place is tiny with marble top tables and solid wooden chairs and the service is slow but I usually like my food served slowly giving me enough time for chit-chatting and socializing. My friend's prawn cutlet at Rs60 seemed to have quite a lot of soft fleshy prawn which had been dipped in the famous batter used for bengali batter fries. My pakodas which were of a memorable size arrived after a long time and frankly even though it had the typical taste of batter and was quite large in size the amount of fish was negligible and at Rs95 I was not very impressed. One must remember that today on a more general basis there is a dearth of fish in the market. The prices of fish has skyrocketed and for a shop which sells snacks providing thick slabs of fish is not an option. The servers had the typical Bengali courtesy of serving with a smile and apologizing about the delay but wanting the customer to accept it. I packed chicken cutlets for my home. I must say that the chicken cutlet was really wonderful with a thin slice of pounded chicken and a thin coating with breadcrumb. The amalgamated taste of garlic, ginger, vinegar and onions gave it a very unique taste. Priced at Rs35 it was the best item I have had from this shop. The menu interestingly mentions the items fried in clarified butter and one can trust their claim because it does not give the usual greasy taste one can associate with dalda. While I personally feel it is not very special for people who have grown up int he Northen area because there are shops selling cutlets on every nook and cranny of North Calcutta it is a delight for people from other parts of the city because this is the taste of heritage which no other neighbourhood can offer. When it comes to Bengali snacks one should head straight to North Calcutta. I was lucky enough to have spent many a childhood days in my maternal grandfather's home in the North and having had the chance to taste this kind of snacks quite frequently now that I am a grown woman in my twenties shuttling between two cities  I can say that the unique taste of snacks made in North Calcutta doesn't even go beyond the threshold of the Northern part of the city and to not taste it is a loss for every Calcuttan. While my frequent snacking in North Calcutta made me feel that the items on offer were most ordinary for someone who hasn't tasted snacks from a typical Bengali locality it might be quite  a treat.  My personal recommendation would be sticking to the items of chicken and perhaps prawns because my friend had quite liked her prawn cutlet. A bite into the chicken cutlet with a cup of tea on a chilly afternoon would be quite a treat.

Allen's prawn cutlets were supposed to be a part of the Kolkatan heritage. However, over the last few years, I have seen a decline which can only be termed alarming according to me. On a recent trip, the fish fry I ate gave me food poisoning. And that is not something that my otherwise cast iron stomach is proud of. Also, the place looks shabby, the people serving the food look disinterested and ill at ease and the overall hygiene quotient is low. So no, not one of the places I will recommend to anyone at present.

Allen's Kitchen was famous for its fish fries. The shop used to signal that it was open by putting up a board, and while the board was up, it sold food. Customers would come from all parts of the city to buy from there.

Today, Allen's survives more on account of its reputation. While there are loyal customers and some new ones who come in search of what they think will be good food, the place remains empty most of the time. This has forced the owners to raise prices, but the corresponding improvement in the quality of the food has not taken place. Allen's Fish Fries are small and often reek excessively, suggesting that fish of poor quality have been used.

The ambience does not help. A coat of paint is needed. The benches and chairs are joined to each other, but the proportions seem to suggest that the average customer will be four feet tall and correspondingly slim. Getting in and out is a trial. The shop itself is very dirty, and once again, the drinking water is suspect. The one basin meant for customers inspires no confidence about the hygiene of the place.

In short, the usual advice to owners of old establishments needs to be doled out: keep it clean, ensure that customers can sit properly, and improve the quality of the ingredients used.

This is a small place on Central Avenue between Sovabazar Metro and Beadon Street. The restaurant is more than 130 years old.

The place is very small with only four tables and is quite shabby. The service is on the slower side. But you will forget all these once you taste the food. Their cutlets are different from what you get elsewhere in Calcutta. Prawn cutlets are delicious and fish cutlets are juicy and tasty. Another dish worth mentioning is the Chicken Steak. All the items are fried using Ghee.

Visited here 2 months ago. It's near grey street petrol pump. A small place. Had prawn cutlet. It was okay. Also had Dim er devil. Very bad. But the most disappointment came when I tasted the "Kasundi". I have never tasted such a bad "Kasundi" (Musterd Sauce) in my life. Please take care of it. Not so clean environment for those who are habituated with CCD, KFC.
