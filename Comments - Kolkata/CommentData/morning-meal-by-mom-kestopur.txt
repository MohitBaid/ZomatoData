Let me begin by saying that they take great care of the food they prepare for the customers. Their food has a great variety and also caters to the health freaks. I‚Äôm a big fan of their salads and would highly recommend trying the Sprout Mix Salad. Their packaging is impressive. They heed the customer feedback very seriously and can go to great lengths to make sure that the customer gets the best breakfast possible. They‚Äôve surely given the bachelor IT professionals of Kestopur and surrounding areas an exciting choice for breakfast.

Received a complimentary meal from Morning Meal by Mom. Team CubeM invited me to try out their food and I was glad to do so. Like my fellow reviewers have pointed out, the packaging was indeed good. Half a point extra for that. Infact the box can be used for future purpose as well. Coming to the food, I had their Signature Chicken Roast Salad.
To start with, they use multigrain bread, which is good. The quantity was superb as well. Came with a lot of veggies- cucumber, tomatoes, carrots, olives, onions and cabbage. Will be a sumptuous breakfast for the health conscious people!
Another very good thing I liked about this place is that they mention the ingredients used for each item in the menu itself, so you know exactly what you're ordering for. Plus they ask you about your preference of Salt level in your food. And thank you Team CubeM for giving me the opportunity to taste your food. :)

We didn't like those potato parathas which were like very poor version paratha made by much negligence and we didn't taste any Aloo. Chicken sandwiches were also not satisfactory. Just to explore more we ordered Brown Rice and Chicken after seeing some reviews and it was on so good side. correct amount of carbs, proteins though we would like to get more veggies in comparison to the price paid. We'll order again in coming days.

FOOD TASTING @ MORNING MEAL BY MOM (AKA CUBE M) - COURTESY ENTREPRENEUR YASHU CHAMAN

Well, another kitchen in the making and another invite for food tasting! An upcoming kitchen based in the Keshtopur region ‚Äì which serves both lunch as well as breakfast at your doorsteps!

I begin my comments rating them 4.5 / 5 for parcel as well as quantity, both are pretty suitable for transportation the food from their kitchen to your dining room as well as satisfying behemoth-sized hunger respectively!

This complimentary parcel of food delivered to my home comprised:-

(i)	1 palate Mixed vegetable salad:- Almost a perfect side dish ‚Äì especially since it constituted a decent variety of raw veggies (cabbage, onions, tomatoes, yellow carrots, cucumber etc dressed with a pinch of honey and lime to perfection ‚Äì this one is quite comparable to the salads served in fine dinings! The lion‚Äôs share of my ratings for this place are based on this particular item!

(ii)	2 pcs Palak paratha (8 slices) ‚Äì Under-cooked from inside and over cooked from outside, tooooo thick for a paratha ‚Äì pretty low on presentation as well as taste. The complimentary ketchup and pickle sachets did no good to it either!

(iii)	2 king sized Chocolate pan-cake ‚Äì Great on presentation, especially the chocolate sauce topping as well as the sweet lime slice decoration, but apart from that there were no take aways from this item. Although delivered luke warm, tis had become chewy and soggy ‚Äì unlike the high quality pancakes served by other kitchens!

Overall, an experience way below expectations ‚Äì but since they are pretty much a newbie in business, they do deserve a 2nd chance.

Service is a high-five and pocket pinch is pretty reasonable ‚Äì as the menu card suggests! I did share my feedback with the captain Yashu Chaman and he has definitely taken it pretty seriously and hope they work on their development areas to change a new leaf!

P.S.:- A big thank you for sending over food for tasting!

Tried their "Palak Paratha with Curd", "Chicken Sandwich" and "Banana Pancake". Taste of foods were average to me. The curd supplied with the paratha was Amul Dahi, taste of which did not matched with the paratha. Rather, I expected homemade curd, flavoured with masala. The sandwich contained many small pieces of chicken bone. I found a long hair and one fish-scale like thing on the pancake. They claim thay they serve healthy food, but this was the actual picture....

Very substandard chicken sandwich..even the bread sides were not taken out!! And this seemed to be the most ordered dish from here. The vegeis were next to nothing.This seems like a place that has degraded very much lately.
Zomato delivery was fast hence the 2 starts else it's was 1.5 worthy. Definitely not ordering from here again. Not worth more than 80rs.

I ordered one potato sandwich and one choco banana cheese sandwich. personally, i felt the banana sandwich was little too dry but that might differ for other people.packaging - 10/10each sandwich was wrapped individually in saran wraps, for ease of carrying .the food was fresh and piping hot. fillings inside the sandwich were oozing out and were delicious.taste wise- it could be better¬†
delivery- before allotted time¬†
overall - nice option for healthy breakfast as well as lunch.

Just perfect. 
The paneer parantha are just mouthwatering and delicious. I didn't knew that the restaurants here could make such delicious food. It was just amazing with the pickle and curd. 
What follows next is the chocolate pancake, I seriously never dreamt that any outlet would ever be able to make them. 
At last was the chicken wrap, it was good but i couldn't make a long lasting impression. 
Overall its amazing and one of the best delivery choice...

A lot of mixed reviews for this place but it was a let down atleast for me. We don't have a lot of healthy breakfast options and MMM was what I thought came to the rescue after reading the reviews. Ordered chicken club sandwich and mashed potatoes. The potatoes lacked taste and the sandwich wasn't grilled even though we ordered for grilled sandwiches. The owner did call to inform the same as their sandwich maker wasn't working and then there was no electricity next time, however as this happened twice while ordering so I became a bit skeptical of ordering again. Coming to the sandwich, nothing out of the blue, I have a love for sandwich and have tried sandwiches from the best places in Kolkata. I believe the restaurant can do a lot better in terms of taste and presentation. Pocket pinch is on the higher side and I felt it wasn't worth it. Hope they improve in future.

My order was stuff idly , mix uttapam and cookies.

Packing- It was the only thing which was good. You get a good paper bag and proper spoon however the idly and uttapam was served in foil container.

Food- idly was extremely hard stuffed with potatoes. Uttapam was decent but the coconut chutney was extremely disappointed I guess they don't use fresh coconut. Now the best part was cookies they served Good Day biskits instead of cookies. You can't fool around people like this.

Verdict- Complete waste of money. Going by the name also no body's mom cook like this. Save yourself from bad Morning breakfast.

Gods bless this restaurant. It really makes living in this city alone (as a student) without my actual Mom that much easier. The offerings that I have tried (the Fajita box & the Brown Rice Meal) had modern as well as homely qualities; less focus on carbohydrates and a very generous use of vegetables that was really refreshing. The flavors that they use are also unique compared to other restaurants, they are somewhat Mediterranean in their bearings and they do it just right, not too strong and not too light. The serving sizes are adequate and packaging/delivery timings are also okay.¬†

I recommend ordering from here especially for vegetarians and health-conscious folks. They aren't exclusively vegetarian, but they do a better job than many other vegetarian restaurants in our area by not overdoing their flavours and by actually using a good variety of vegetables... Seriously, just try it!! I feel happy and hopeful about the future of the world eating this food! :)

Morning Meal by Mom is a home delivery enterprise. They offered to deliver food to our doorstep, to review their breakfast menu!

The package consisted the following:

- Chicken Roast Salad with Multi-grain Bread: Roasted chunks of chicken mixed with diced vegetables dressed together. The dressing was a little to overpoweringly tangy for our taste but otherwise very wholesome. Served with two squared toasted brown bread.

- Aloo Paratha: A huge aloo paratha with lots of stuffing greeted us. It was divided into bit sized portions. Served with an achar sachet.¬†

- Spinach Corn Omelette: This one's a fairly new omelette, for us. Nice green textured omelette. It was light and fluffy. Re-heating was not an option, since oil would have oozed out unnecessarily. Portion size was more than enough for a single person.¬†

- Chicken Sandwich: Grilled sandwiches, with ample chicken stuffing. The stuffing was a mix of mayo and chicken and seasoning. Tasted okay, have tasted better sandwiches.¬†

- Chocolate Pancakes with Lemon Dressing: The name got me highly interested, tight, light pancakes. Rich, chocolatey in flavor. Drizzled with the lemon dressing. Every mouthful was a burst of flavors.¬†

It was a good and hearty meal for the two of us. Thank you for sending it across :)

The food is authentic and the main difference which I found between this one and other outlets is the timely service and the quality of food.

I ordered one potato sandwich and one choco banana cheese sandwich. personally, i felt the banana sandwich was little too dry but that might differ for other people.packaging - 10/10each sandwich was wrapped individually in saran wraps, for ease of carrying .the food was fresh and piping hot. fillings inside the sandwich were oozing out and were delicious.taste wise- it could be better¬†
delivery- before allotted time¬†
overall - nice option for healthy breakfast as well as lunch.

Just perfect. 
The paneer parantha are just mouthwatering and delicious. I didn't knew that the restaurants here could make such delicious food. It was just amazing with the pickle and curd. 
What follows next is the chocolate pancake, I seriously never dreamt that any outlet would ever be able to make them. 
At last was the chicken wrap, it was good but i couldn't make a long lasting impression. 
Overall its amazing and one of the best delivery choice...

Finally, found a place which serves affordable, good quality sandwiches.had the egg club amd chicken club sandwiches alongwith choco banana cheese sandwich.also had palak paratha n paneer paratha.the food was fresh, neatly packed and although delivery was a tad late(due to excessive rain), the food arrived piping hot! The egg n chicken club sandwiches were superb.the sweet one needs improvement.maybe, a caramel sauce or a side of whipped cream. Now, the parathas although big in portion, needs to be softer.also a choice of breads would be really helpful, atleast a brown n multi grain option.overall, a good experience, pocket friendly n definitely worthy of repeat orders

Ordered choco banana cheese grilled sandwiches ,egg club sandwiches,chicken club sandwiches , palak parathas, paneer parathas . You should add an option of whipped cream or caramel sauce with banana sandwich , parathas should be more softer but stuffing was very good. Packing was excellent ¬†and delivery was delayed by 5 mints which is understandable in this raining. Overall prices is justified for the quality and services that your team offers.

We ordered Poha, Omelette and Pav Bhaji at 8 am sunday for two person breakfast and had no clue that 'Morning Meal By Mom' would deliver in 30 minutes such healthy home made 'less oily' food. We wanted tea too, which MMBM does not deliver but they arranged tea too. Price is justified by the quality and service. Keep up the good work.

Ordered Poha and Upma today. Delivery was on time. As I requested to chef , they prepared less spicy food for me. It was delivered hot and the delivery person was on time.¬†Poha:- It was nicely prepared with the correct balance of beaten rice and veggies.
Upma:- I had Upma at many South¬†Indian restaurants in Kolkata and it was at par with them.

The delivery person briefed me about weekly and monthly subscription plans and I will give it a thought.Keep up the good work team.

I had to catch an early flight, and since it was my last day in the country, I decided why not give this Indian breakfast a chance, and that was probably one of the better decision of the day. We asked for a breakfast at 7am in the morning, and at sharp 7 the food arrived at my door. (Not this isn't something I was expecting with food deliveries so early in the morning in India).¬†We ordered a combination of sandwich and idlies, both were amazing in taste, properly cooked, looked very fresh.¬†
My parents were so impressed, that they would often order food from there, so far what my parents told me, everything they served were amazing.¬†Great job team!
