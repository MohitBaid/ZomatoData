A street food shop basically.. We wanted to try rolls at somewhere we have never tried before,so went there. Had rolls,fried rice and one chicken item. The place is so small,so they don't have any sitting arrangements but the food was real tasty. And so cheap that can be afforded by everyone. :)

A street food outlet near new market area. After shopping we are too much hungry and then found this small outlet beside the road. We ordered veg fried rice and chilly chicken. The price rate was very cheap. The food was okay. In these price rate we can't expect much higher quality. Our bill came out for three just 125.

Its a fast fast centre situated near New Market area, Here you can get rolls,chowmein,soups,starter etc etc...

The rolls and chowmein are good which satisfy your taste buds and hunger..

They don't have the capacity of seating arrangement that's why they provide chair which is outside the roll centre,But who cares if you get good kind of rolls and chowmein at most reasonable prices..

This is not a proper place for hangout but you'll still enjoy the outdoor view of road side and good quality food..

If you are a street food lover,then this place is correct for you...
