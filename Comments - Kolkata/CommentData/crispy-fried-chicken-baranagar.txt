** Location = Rai Mohan Banerjee Road, just beside the Anandam Cinema Hall near Bonhoogly Lake.

** Brief = Thanks to Zomato Mods for adding this place. This outlet has been inaugurated recently and I have already been there many times and savored their dishes.

** Ambiance = Preferably takeaway, but seating is available. Small counter, but the service is quick.

** Things tried = Chicken Burger(Rs.50), Chicken Pakora(Rs.15), Chicken Strips(Rs.45 for 3), Chicken Popcorn(Medium Rs.70), Egg Burger(Rs.30), French Fries(Medium Rs. 30).
Except for the french fries rest all of the items are delicious and served piping hot. In terms of french fries little bit of improvement can be made.
The chicken double patty burger(Rs.60) is too good. The strips, popcorn and pakora are all great.

** Purse Check = Very very pocket friendly and the above prices are All Inclusive. Rs.200/- is more than enough for 2 people to enjoy some lipsmacking burgers.

**Overall = Definitely a great start and the locality needed a burger joint like this. Cheers, keep it up :)
