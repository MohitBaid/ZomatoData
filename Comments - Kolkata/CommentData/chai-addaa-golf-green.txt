Located just a couple of minutes from my place, this is a place where I go when I feel like having earl grey along with chili cheese french fries. 
Their pasta is also decent. 
Overall a decent place with reasonable pricing. 
They have both indoor and outdoor(smoking) seating arrangements.

So, we went there on Monday.
This is a nice place to chitchat with your friends and have really good food.
We had ordered Cafe Mocha, Makaibari Tea, Grilled Chicken Burger, Poached Egg Burger, Chicken Ceaser Salad.
And after all these things, the bill was really minimal.
And the food was amazing, undoubtedly.
Amazing Food and really reasonable place to be.

The ratings are as follows:
Food- 4.5/5
Ambience- 4/5
Hospitality- 4/5

Went there on a rainy evening with friends. When we reached the place was empty. The place is located near the bijoygarh college and hence is quite easy to locate. The interiors are neat and have been kept simple. We ordered a chicken mayo sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich and one chocolate shake. They did not take much time to give us the food. The sandwich was good in size and was served with tomato ketchup and chips. It tasted good and the chicken was soft. The shake was also very tasty. The prices were also reasonable. I liked this place.

This cafe is located in the Golf Green area. The inside is not too big but enough to fit a few small groups of people. The ambience is good and the staffs are competent too, so no complaints there.

But the quality of the food can be a lot better. I ordered a Grilled Chicken sandwich and while it tasted alright, it wasn't grilled enough like it should've been.

The Spaghetti Chicken Pasta was a bit too hot for my liking, but that aside it tasted good. 
But there are definitely room for improvements here since there are a lot of better options around the place as well.

But if you just wanna hang out somewhere and grab a light meal this is an alright place.

Chai Addaa serves as an important adda zone for many college/school goers, romantic evenings or even small meetups with friends. And food being one of the key aspect, it delivers well on that. The interior is very well decorated and most tables can accommodate four people easily. Air conditioned with decent music playing, the ambience is pretty good. Now coming to the food, the momos were a disaster. Steamed chicken Momo was terrible. Small, probably half of the size of what you get with Wow! Momo and the stuffing wasn't cooked properly. But on the positive side, the chicken sandwiches were a delight. At that price, and with those chips and the ketchup, it was ❤. Then we had a chicken burger, and it was quite good as well. The buns were soft, and the chicken patty was good, above average. Not something you'd be naming of days after having it. 
Overall, Chai Addaa is a good place to hangout with your friends and family, food isn't the best, but still, is pretty good for what you're paying.

Cool and soothing atmosphere. Perfect place to hang out and relive old memories and be nostalgic. Sitting arrangement is almost six to seven tables with relaxed chairs and sofas. Food was quite unexpected delicious. My expectations got a satisfying high when served with pipping hot chai, banana and caramel shake, strawberry drink, chicken club sandwich, chicken steak with butter rice, eggs and veggies, French fries, fish fries and chicken mozzarella spaghetti. Yummy food with yumm company. Long live love and friendship.

Ordered online through swiggy.Delivery and packaging was bang on.The strawberry shake and and the chicken cheese club sandwich was really really good.The french fries disappointed me as it was not warm at all and was really tasteless.
There are rooms for improvement.The overall experience was okay.

First of all we ultimately find our "adda place" near my place, thanks Chai Addaa..
Now, location: it's too nearer to my home,it's exactly opposite to Bijoygarh Thakurbari (for those who are aware of these place),thats why 5 out of 5!!
Ambience: I like it. On the very first day when I entered here, my recent international playlist was being played,which impressed me!!..family people,friends, couple all type of people can go here.
Food: I went here 3-4times in this puja ceremony as I like to spend puja time wid my close frnds and relatives. Total 5-6menu I tasted,it's yummy,nicely presented..
Actually a story of my life began here which make this place memorable to me..whenever we have some plans for adda,designation is "chai addaa"...
Thank you.

If you have some serious budget constraint but  wish to chill out with your friends then this is the place for you. Quite cheap and good food. Well behaved staff. I tried chicken mayo sandwich which was pretty decent given the price. The tea and coffee was good enough. Would want them to come up with better food items. The AC didn't function properly.

I could have given them 5 out of 5 but haven't because of 3 reason
1. There is only one ac so when the restaurant seats are all full then it's hot over there
2. Menu card pictures don't tally with food. I ordered food thinking of something but got a different food becoz of that confusion
3. Sweet corn in one item was rotten

Now coming to food: hot coffee was excellent. Can be compared with big cafes. Mango shake is good in taste. Cold coffee was lovely. Fish finger was fresh and soft. In Chicken anorf Chicken gravy tasted lovely, Butter rice was good but sweet corn was rotten

Absolutely amazing. Visited this place today for the first time. Food is wow. Superbly decorated and garnished. Ambience is top notch and its so pocket friendly. Much better than top hiked places like whatsup cafe and cafe mezzuna and others which will charge you a bomb just for the ambience. Go and try this place. 
Totally satisfied.
Dishes ordered : Chicken pasta in white sauce , mashed & poached egg chicken burger and oreo frappe.

Went in for a quick chai and breakfast..

Ordered Cheese and Corn Sandwich , Kadak Chai and Chicken Cheese Envelope ,

The Outlet is decent , 
Staffs are decent ,
Now coming to the Chai and Food ,

Kadak Chai - 2/5 , The Chai Didnt Have That Strong Aroma And Over All Balance That A Chai Requires , it needs much improvement..  it seemed the chai patti was over boiled so it turned some what Bitter in taste .

Chicken Envelope - 3.5 / 5 , it was decent .

Corn And Cheese Sandwich - 3/5 , the bread used tasted dry with very little cheese / mayo used , it would have tasted better with a butter spread over bread and then grilled it to perfection.. needs improvement.

As it being close to my place i would definitely give it another try hoping for some better chai the next time.

Visited this place twice. It's located to the opposite of bijoygarh Thakurbari, in between bijoygarh bazaar and pallishree auto stand.  Ordered grilled chicken tikka sandwich the first time I went. It consisted of two big triangles served with Lays' American style chips and sauce. It had adequate chicken and cheese and was enough for 1 person. The taste was awesome and fresh too and price was reasonable at ₹75. 
Next time I had ordered chicken burger which didn't give me enough satisfaction. The patty was thin  and not that tasty, though it was crispy. It had generous amounts of cheese but too much salad (cucumber,onion and tomato) interfered. Lettuce could have been added and the patty could have been better. The price of the burger wasn't reasonable at ₹100. Mio Amore burgers taste better, trust me!
Ambience was great. It was air conditioned with Bollywood music on. Service was okay. Had to wait not more than 15 mins. Yet to try the cold coffee. I might return here for the sandwich again but never going to try burger again.
PS- Menu pics aren't given so I'm adding them.

Newly opened cafe in Golf Green area. Located bang opposite to Bijoygarh Thakurbari. Ambience is spacious and decor is decent. Tried out two things - 
Chicken Momo - Six served in a portion with a spicy sauce. Tasted very average. 
Chicken Pasta in White Sauce - Tasted decent, portion was okayish. 
We had also ordered one Yuzu and Elderflower. They didn't serve it till the end of the meal for which we had to cancel it. Service is pathetic. Cutlery is very basic, this is of the kind which is not even used in the households these days. 
Not at all recommended to visit. That's it. Happy Dining! :)
