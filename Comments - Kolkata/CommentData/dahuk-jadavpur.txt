This is a very cosy place near Jadavpur. The quantity served and the quality as well as the behaviour of staff is very good. Â The portions are generous and filling. On a shoesring budget one can hope to have a good meal.

this is a small food joint near palbazar,jadavpur,infront of zaika. we had ordered egg chicken fried rice,chicken manchurian and chicken tikka butter masala. the delivery was a very delayed one. it is very small ( smaller than you think!). the food quantity was enough. but in cases of the chicken dishes the size of the pieces were smaller than you find in other restaurents!

Visited this place when it was just opened.
Situated just opposit the lane of Zaika beside the park near jadavpur railway station.

Had tried their noodles and kashmiri chicken.. quantity was enough for two at that time.. Staffs were nothing special to mention..

Pocket pinch is friendly..

Food is good and pocket friendly. I often visit this place with friends. I love all the starters and fried rice, polao and indian dishes specially afghani chicken.

Not too shabby. Food is so-so. Small place. Service is adequate. Seasoning needs to be looked into. All-over a decent place. Pocket friendly.

The place is famous for thai soup nd smoked chicken.  Ambience is good nd they serve the tasty foods in a very reasonable price.  If one is looking for casual lunch or dining. Its the best place to feed yourself within budget.

I have been there when it's just open... Located just on the opposite lane of Zika, beside the park... it's a verandah converted into dining space... we have the Kashmiri polau and Kashmiri chicken kasa... both tasted different a bit in the sweeter side... nothing to mention about staffs, service and deco... they all are very ordinary... pocket pinch was friendly...
