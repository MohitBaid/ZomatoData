I had ordered Chicken Burnt garlic fried rice and they delivered me with a vegetable one!
The quality of chowmein was bad as well. 
Hot garlic chicken was perfect. However, Teriyaki chicken was over-salty and filled with extra spices.
Very disappointed with the entire platter. 
Not much of insight on the interiors as never visited.

Ordered foods on Diwali night being extremely hungry
Already prepaid
Was supposed to get order by 11
After not getting by time called up n they said due to rains it is taking lil longer but be assured it is on its way

So obviously was waiting for the foods as we were hungrt

So after waiting till 11.40 night got text from tomato saying order can't be delivered because of some problem by Qzin

So at 11.40 midnight!! (and it was Diwali also!) I had to make dinner!! Imagine!

I cannot comment how the food is as this was me first time ordering from here and never went to the place either


No matter how good tastes

Service is no 1 factor

And their service is poor

One of the biggest mistakes in my life ordering from this shitty place. I gave it a rating one because there was no option for negative rating! I had ordered from this place on a Monday night and had some guests over. I was left red faced due to their sheer incompetence in handling orders. The restaurant could not give me the number of the delivery guy and the managing staff said he was new. Talk about professionalism! The delivery guy could not locate my place even though I am situated bang on the EM Bypass Main road a few mins from Acropolis mall. He turned up at the wrong address and finally I had to go out on the main road to get my order. I was left embarrassed at the presence of my guests who had to wait to get their dinner.
I am never again in my life ordering from this place
The food was average also
I request Zomato not to keep listings of such third class places who have no sense of time

Chicken chowmein had good subtle flavours but was nearly bland. Also, less oil is recommended.

I am generally quite skeptical while ordering from a new place.So, was confused what to order to satisfy my light hunger.So, randomly ordered veg chopsuey.Once I put the first bite on my mouth, I knew I was proven wrong.The noodles were ultra crisp to perfection, and the  gravy was mildly ketchupy which I liked very much.Eagerly looking forward to order and gorge on to the other items from their menu.

Yesterday my roommate and I placed an order here for  steamed veg momos and steamed chicken momos. They were pretty quick in fetching our order. The momos were good. They also provide clear soup with it. Well packaged. Though the prices are tad high for the quantity and quality I feel.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE...
Wanted to give a BIG ZERO if there was an option.
The order was NEVER DELIVERED to me and the restaurant kept on telling lies to me as well as Zomato authority for that.
Never seen a more IRRESPONSIBLE RESTAURANT before.

Full marks to the food but I rated 3.5 mainly because of the behaviour of the staff. Once I ordered some items as guests had come. They took the order and it was paid on Zomato via paytm. After around 45 ~ 50 minutes they called me up and said that they won't be able to deliver the food to my place as they are running short on staff. I kept my calm and said that I'm willing to take the food from the outlet myself. Then they said that they are falling short on food items also.

The best thing about this place was that the food was delivered on time, so far as food was concerned, I wish I could feel the same!! I ordered a Matar Paneer combo with paratha, a Chilly Paneer combo with Veg chowmein and one Chicken starter recipe. 
Matar paneer was decent in taste, nearly balanced in its flavor but I literally drained the excess oil floating over it before I could serve the dish! Even the paratha was very oily, but taste wise OK. Next, the paneer chilly was nothing great, it fell just more than average to my taste bud... And the Chowmein was soaked in oil, again taste wise average! The Chicken starter was quantity wise very good, and balanced in oil n flavourful, although a bit more sweet! 
Overall, more than average food, decent pinch to your pocket, and an apt home delivery!

Chinese cuisine is one of my favorite cuisine .The colour,smell,taste are the three traditional aspects to describe Chinese food.Looking for one of the best Chinese corner at affordable price this place is ideal.Few days back I and my fellow foodie friends went to this joint for take away. This outlet is located in Jadavpur,kolkata.

Their kitchen is a "live kitchen" which is a plus point, you can see your food is getting prepared from outside only and it is very neat and hygienically maintained kitchen.

Here comes the menu.

Soups:

Lemon Coriander Soup-Vegetable stock,lemon juice and chopped coriander leaves a refreshing combination along with nutritious vegetables and chopped omelets.This soup is very healthy as well as tasty.It was very thick and nutritious.

Starters:

Takrai Chicken-One of the delicious dish that I ever tasted.Chicken pieces have the aroma of lemon grass cooked to the perfection and garnished with kaffer lime leaves.It looks amazing and mouth watering and tastes just great.

Fish Yue Lat Chee: if You are a fish lover then its a must must must try item.. its like biscuits with the crunchy feeling tossed in soya sauce and bell peppers.. Fabulous one...

Drums of Heaven-I've waited so long to taste this dish as i have heard a lot about their this dish.Chicken wings are marinated very well.Later on it was added with sauteed ginger,garlic,bell paper,onions,chillies. Tossed and pan fried with sweet chilli sauce and added sesame seeds as topping .It was perfectly fried,spices are coated very well. Chicken Wings pieces are very soft and chewing. A must try dish to have before start eating heavy meal.

Crunchy Paneer Fingers-One of the favorite dish of mine.Marinated paneer pieces are beautifully coated with dry flour and cornflakes.It was deep fried in oil and served with tartar sauce.Coming to taste superb crunchy from outside and soft layered cottage cheese portion in inside.Tastes really good,highly recommended.

Honey fish-Cube sized pieces are perfectly coated with honey,soy sauce,vinegar,garlic and brown sugar.Served with coated extra bit of thick honey layer with sprinkled sesame seeds.The taste was incredible,,very soft and no fishy smell.Very tasty as well it got fully melted once you put it.

Main Course:We had rice,noodles and various side dishes.

Burnt Garlic Coriander Rice-Very Unique one to taste.Rice that has been stir friend in a wok,mixed with burnt garlic and coriander with butter in it. the aroma of burnt garlic + Coriander is simply mindblowing difficult to express unless you give a try.Popularly eaten either as an accompaniment with other dish or as a complete dish course by itself.Coming to taste it was dry,,cooked perfectly both the rice and the other ingredients

Chicken Panfried Crispy Noodles- This is again their signature dish. I have never ever found this item in any other restaurant. Its the noodles that is fried which will give you the taste of crispiness.Stir fried veggies and mixed with egg and chicken.The flavor was excellent,little bit spicy.Both the noodles and chicken are perfectly cooked and very tasty. its a must try one again.

Hunan Fish-Tender and juicy fish fillets are cooked perfectly with the bell peeper,chopped spring onions and lots of garlic and chilly flakes in a buttery mixture.Coming to taste fish pieces are very soft,cooked perfectly.

Mandarin Chicken-Traditional Chinese recipe diced shaped chicken pieces marinated with chicken broth and rice wine together to create a deep taste,cooked along with mushrooms,vegetables like bell pepper,spring onions and spices.The taste was simply mouth watering.Â 

All the main course item contain 8 pieces.

Overall I was really impressed,you can try their food for lunch or dinner as per choice.The dishes we ordered are mouth watering and each item is unique than the other.
Starters are excellent in taste as well as one plate is sufficient for two people,price is quite reasonable.Another point which I want to mention is their service is very quick,easily they can manage a huge crowed.Wish all the very very best entire team of "Qzin".

Go and enjoy delicious food and enjoy your food.Happy eating, hope to visit you agin #Qzin.

This place is located near jheel road, Jadavpur. It is a recently opened food joint and running successfully. I ordered:
1. Salt and pepper fish- as the name suggests it was Chatpata! julien cut long succulent pieces of fish in a hot sauce. Loved it.
2. Mixed fried rice- this fried rice is one of my favourites! the quality of the rice they used was really commendable. White rice with some veggies, with chicken, prawn and eggs. Aaaaaaahhh!! Heaven!!
3. chicken manchurian- soft, tender, slightly battered chicken pieces in a delicious gravy. Loved it as well.Â 
They really make amazing foods and serve them in a big quantity. The quality and the quantitty of food absolutely justifying the price factor. They serve promptly. Highly recommended.

Me and my friend were searching for a pocket friendly place to takeaway some food when we came across this joint. we were too tired to let the place pass and hopped right in. The menu was quite extensive.

The Special Chicken Biryani seemed to be a fancy choice and so we decided to go for it. My friend decided to go for their Chinese cuisines too as she was a little skeptical about their biryani. So from their Chinese section we ordered Chilly Fish with gravy, Chilly Chicken dry, Mixed Meifoon and Mixed Fried Rice.

Upon reaching home, everyone pounced on the food and was quite happy to find that the quantity was good enough.

My personal favourites among all the items were the Special Chicken Biryani which was cooked in ghee and came accompanied with an egg, a potato and two juicy big pieces of chicken. Coming to the chinese cuisine If you are bored of the same old traditional noodles, then do NOT skip this item, as their meifoon was too good with plenty of chicken and prawns in it. The Chilly Fish was also great. The pieces were extremely soft and succulent. Definitely a win!

Overall this place turned out to be a perfect example of the famous saying "never judge a book by its cover". Looking forward to order again.

Not so far from my residence, I placed order for the first time a few.days back... Though the estimated time of delivery was one hour, the food got delivered within 40 minutes. The price is very reasonable. At the same time, quality was not compromised... The Kadhai Chicken was also very nicely prepared. The Lachcha Paratha were a bit heavy though and I could manage only one. Overall, quite a good experience. I would definitely try here in future and recommend my friends too :-)

For trial, tried one of the Chinese combos - hot garlic chicken and noodles. It was indeed quite tasty, and the quantity was good for 95 rupees. It was packed well too. The flavours were pretty good too. Shall try other things here soon.

Was out of station for a long time and busy with some unavoidable work and routine. Missed you all. Restarting my page with a recent story of a Start â up food delivery joint, located at Garfa near Jadavpur. A message over facebook. Nothing can be better when a Foodie receives an invitation for a complimentary meal from a newly opened food joint.

Not so far from my residence, I placed order for the first time a few.days back... Though the estimated time of delivery was one hour, the food got delivered within 40 minutes. The price is very reasonable. At the same time, quality was not compromised... The Kadhai Chicken was also very nicely prepared. The Lachcha Paratha were a bit heavy though and I could manage only one. Overall, quite a good experience. I would definitely try here in future and recommend my friends too :-)

For trial, tried one of the Chinese combos - hot garlic chicken and noodles. It was indeed quite tasty, and the quantity was good for 95 rupees. It was packed well too. The flavours were pretty good too. Shall try other things here soon.

Was out of station for a long time and busy with some unavoidable work and routine. Missed you all. Restarting my page with a recent story of a Start â up food delivery joint, located at Garfa near Jadavpur. A message over facebook.

I was offered a complimentary meal by them and was really impressed by their variety along with their prompt response.
They serve an array of Indian and Chinese dishes and I had ordered in some of both.
For starters,we had the dry chilli chicken and Shanghai chicken,both of which tasted good.However,it was difficult to distinguish between them as they had almost the same composition of condiments.
For mains,we took chilli garlic noodles(mixed),mixed Hakka noodles..I loved the chilli garlic noodles more as it was not as spicy as intended.The mixed noodles also had quite an amount of shrimp which was actually clean(unlike what most budget restaurants serve).Being a fan of fried rice, I had ordered both chilli garlic fried rice and prawn fried rice.I am a bit partial towards seafood so loved the prawn fried rice more than the chilli garlic one.It was freshly prepared with proper ingredients which enhanced the taste overall.Their American chopsuey was a bit too sweet for my liking as it was loaded with too much tomatoes.
Amongst the side dishes,I loved the kung pao chicken the most among Manchurian,Garlic and Kung Pao chicken.It was sweet and spicy,just as per my liking.I was really glad to find solid pieces of cashew in the kung pao chicken,which most restaurants miss.
Amongst their Indian dishes,we ordered their lachcha paratha,tandoori roti, chicken bharta and bhuna chicken.The paratha was nicely and conveniently cut up in 4 pieces and was soft and tender.It went supremely well with the bhuna chicken,which I feel is a must try dish for all.
The chicken in thick gravy was on the spicy side,but tasted delicious.Chicken bharta was loaded with properly shredded chicken pieces with a cut up egg,it too was not exceptional but good.
Overall,this pocket friendly place is a boon for us since we rely a lot on home deliveries for parties.I was pleasantly surprised to see their price list as it was quite reasonable considering the quantity and taste.

Qzin - Excellent Delivery Service with near perfect packaging.
=====
Location & Intro:

Qzin is located somewhere near Jadavpur (Garfa). I did not personally visit the outlet but just got complimentary food delivered from here from Sandeep, part of Qzin.Â 

I was quite interested to know the concept of Qzin. It's more of a indo-chinese and indian take away/home delivery joint whereby everything is cooked fresh by using fresh ingredients as informed to me. The chicken and fish aren't refrigerated for very long so that it tastes fresh. The packaging is done by using special insulated delivery bags in order to maintain food hot and avoid spillage or leakage of any kind. Nevertheless, after hearing all this and getting excited, i gave my order as per my choice.Â 
=====
What I ordered:

â Hunan Paneer - The paneer was good. It was full of gravy and filled with vegetables and garlic. I loved it. Â #musttry

â Threaded Chicken - The Threaded chicken was not to my liking. It was not good and the fried chowmien was not going hand in hand with the minced chicken balls. Â 

â Hot Garlic Chicken with Fried Rice - I loved this combo. The chicken was succulent and tasty. However, the gravy could have been less oily. The rice was fine. Â #musttry

â Chicken Butter Masala with plain rice - The chicken butter masala tasted excellent with rice. However, again the oil content was high. Â #musttry
===== 
Meal for two: 300-700 approximate. Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.Â 
===== 
Pros:
â Good packaging.
â Good quantity.
â Pocket Friendly.
=====
Summary:

Food Presentation 3.6/5

Food Quality 3.6/5

Food Quantity 3.7/5

Taste 3.5/5

Hospitality 3.7/5

Hygiene 3.7/5

Value for money 3.5/5
=====
Special Mentions:

â Thank you Sandeep and Qzin team for delivering the food to me.Â 
=====

Expert Suggestions:
â Work on the oil content.
â Work on the food quality.
=====
Conclusion: 

I think they can improvise a lot and as they have this concept of changing menu regularly, i would suggest them to stick on this huge menu first and work on it properly. I had a decent experience here.Â 
=====
Unbiased review based on my eating experience.

Yesterday night ordered in a complimentary meal from this new place and even before ordering I was impressed by the variety in their menu. I had ordered Salt and Pepper Chicken, Chicken American Chopsuey and Honey Fish Dry. 
It was a relief to see that the Chopsuey noodles and the gravy were packed separately, thereby keeping the crunchiness intact. The Salt and Pepper Chicken was thin slices of the protein lightly tossed with small dices of coloured pepper and onions and was a good start to the meal. The chopsuey was thankfully not over sweet and was quite good, though the amount of chicken could have been a little more. And my favorite was the Honey Fish. The fish pieces were chunky and well coated. 

In all it was a good meal. The prices here are very moderate and are inclusive of packing and delivery charges. So this is a very good option for people who offer in food regularly. They also have Indian and Chinese set meals for people looking for a meal for one person.

We have ordered online combos : Hot Garlic Chicken + Veg Fried Rice, Butter Chicken + Jeera Rice

Pros:Â 

Jeera Rice was good cooked well

Veg Fried Rice cooked well with all vegetables cooked properly

Packing was really good

Quantity was decent

Pocket Friendly

Cons:

Both the chickens were under cookedÂ 
Hot Garlic Chicken was neither Hot nor had garlic flavor. All I get was some raw garlic pieces.

Too much gravy in hot garlic chicken. I was like Chicken Jhol. Taste was blunt

I didn't find butter in gravy of Butter chicken, it was too thick and spices was raw thats why tasted bitter

We ordered food Approx at 12:50 we got our food at 2:15 pm Approx.  your joint opens at 12:30 pm. But online order opened after few time so I guess those buffer time 20 mints (approx) for preparation. After prep I don't think it takes 1 hour to make these dishes.If so, then when people ask you how much time will take to deliver you should say it is in preparation and give estimated time to deliver. Not you say it will be out for delivery in 15-20 mints & hung up.2nd time we called then also we heard the same thing. 

Suggestions:

At least  when you know it will take time, its your responsibility to inform your customers about the delay. 

It was lunch time & we were hungry expecting a good food. But then food was not we expected. When you are taking time deliver the quality worth of that time!!!

I understand you cook after getting the order. That's fine with me. But you need to work on your timings & quality as well. I guess this happens because we order as soon as you opened. In that case you can take more prep time, take order little later. Many ways that can be done. You need to figure out that. You can also contact you customers over phone. I assure you people like us won't miss a call from any food joints/restaurants.Â 

Hope you serve better Â next time for hungry people.

Yesterday, ordered a chicken roll and fish fingers from this takeaway joint via swiggy. I was not totally impressed with the food. The packaging was not all good. The mustard sauce(kasundi) packet that they provided was spilled all over the foil. The fingers were ok not great but the roll was quite big and was good in taste. They also need to lower the prices of the items in order to remain in the business. Sorry for not posting any photos as my fingers were full of kasundi at that time..

This take away food joint is located at Garfa,  Jadavpur. They give home delivery too.

Service is prompt.

Tried Chicken steam momo & Chicken Mughlai paratha. Both were nice and well made though nothing to rave about but can be tried because pocket pinch is reasonable along with good quantity to satiate hunger pangs.

Come to know about it through a online food delivery service. Order some basic combo that contains jeera rice and chicken butter masala. Its all good but those chicken are little fibrous which need to cook well. The best thing is that the offer affordable prices. So this is a basic review , will visit you guys soon for proper experience.

QZIN is opened not while ago at Palbazar area of jadavpur, I ordered Jeera Rice  with Chicken butter masala combo and Chicken moghlai paratha... 
Paratha were excellent and everything was good on it. Jeera rice was also nice. On the other hand chicken had some fibre but tasted well.

Excellent place for value food at cheap price. I tried out their chicken mughlai parantha and fish fry. This came in just 100 rupees. The fish fry was crisp with soft succulent fillets. Coming to mughlai parantha, the quantity is huge. They give out 5 pieces along with also dum. Such is their fullness that 2-3pieces are enough to tame your hunger pangs. The dish is enough and tastes fabulous

Come to know about it through a online food delivery service. Order some basic combo that contains jeera rice and chicken butter masala. Its all good but those chicken are little fibrous which need to cook well. The best thing is that the offer affordable prices. So this is a basic review , will visit you guys soon for proper experience.

Very poor experience.. ordered through swiggy two mughalai paratha double egg. paratha is ok but it didn't look like double egg. anyway the side alu bhaji given for one paratha and even for one paratha its looking less.. very very poor quantity.. there is no salad.. i dont know who want to eat mughlai paratha without salad.. very very embarrassing. i think swiggy must revoke this time of places for there own quality. thanks swiggy but shame on you Qzin!!

order once under little app offer in QZIN, they don't have any sitting arrangement so you have to take away or they will give delivery. Â  in rs. 250Â  they have delivered 1 plate chicken rice, 1 plate chicken chilly & 5 chicken momos. quality was good (chilly chicken is very spicy), & quantity is huge. so thumbs up. will probably order again.

We ordered home delivery from this place. They took around 45 minutes to get to us.

The Chicken Schezwan Rice was way way way too spicy. Other Chinese places don't make it so spicy. The Chicken Hakka Noodles was great. The Schezwan Gravy Chicken was well done. The chicken pieces were well cooked and the gravy wasn't as spicy as the rice. We also got a free Crispy Chilli Potato. The potatoes were properly cooked but the dish was cold and the crispness was completely gone.

This is a good place. Value for money.

Day 2: We ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken Gravy, and Chicken Chowmein. I have no complaints against the food, but they took over 1 hour to deliver it to our place. Qzin should look into this and reduce the delivery time.

Day 3: Their delivery time is increasing everyday. If you complain, they say they cook everything afresh so they need time. If I order food and I have to wait 1 hour 35 minutes for it, what's the point?Â 

                    Day 4: We ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Sweet and Sour Gravy. The rice was fine. The chicken was not. It was horrible. Plain horrible. The chicken had a really really bad taste. I think I'm done with this place.

Great to see my local eatery listed here (me being the one listing it here). Qzin is the new player in the food game, and it truly knows how to play the game. I have taken takeaway from here about 3 times in the last 20 days, and I am thoroughly satisfied by what they serve. They started off with a 40% discount innaugaration offer, which was mind blowing when I opened the containers and saw the quantity of food. The paratha, the noodles, the jeera rice, the chicken lababdar, garlic chicken - all were simply fantastic in taste. I also ordered garlic chicken during the pujas and chicken manchurian a few days back. The quality and the quantity, and the added advantage of made to order, makes Qzin my favorite place now. They currently have a Chinese menu running, and when asked, management confirmed that the Indian items would be back soon enough. All in all, if you are in the Jheel road area, give it a try once - you will not regret it in any way.

PS - all the food you see in the pictures cost me Rs. 150 as a part of their special offer. The recent prices have been changed to Rs. 100 for garlic chicken, chili chicken, chicken manchurian, with 8 boneless pieces and gravy, which is quite a lot. THere are other items as well. So check them out. You won't regret it.
