Onam Sadhya Thali With 21 Items @ Hotel Swagath, Kolkata ☺

Availability of Thali: 1 Sep - 4 Sep 2017

Items Served: Vasant Neer, Banana, Banana chips, Vadu mango pickle, Eriserry, Vendakkai pachadi, Theeyal, Kalan, Thoran, Aviyal, Rice, Ghee, Dal, Rasam, Sambar, Appam, Stew, Ada pradhaman, Coconut ice cream, Paan and Water

With it's origin in Kerala, India, Onam is the annual Hindu Festival that commemorates the Mahabali, Vamana, Kashyapa and Parashurama related mythologies of Hinduism. It is the New Year Day for Malayali Hindus. It also marks the summer harvest and is celebrated with numerous festivities that last for 10 days. This year's Onam's date span is from 28 Aug to 6 Sep 2017.

Sadhya in Malayalam means banquet. It is a vegetarian feast, consisting of a variety of dishes, traditionally served on a banana leaf.

Being a vegetarian food enthusiast, experiencing a sumptuous Onam Sadhya has been in my to-eat-list, ever since I got to know about it's existence, which was around a couple of years back.

Since then, I observed that, though Kolkata based South Indian restaurants have been holding one or the other food festivals and/or serving South Indian thalis during Onam, they were not actually serving the traditional Onam Sadhya. 

Last year, by the time I found about Hotel Swagath's Onam Sadhya, it's duration was over!

So, this year when it was again in motion, I visited the place with one of my equally enthusiastic foodie friends.

We were glad to get parking inside the hotel premises and taken aback by the courtesy and welcome displayed by the entire hotel staff, at the - entry gate, reception and restaurant.

The ground floor based restaurant was running full house. As it was evident from the banana leaf spread on their tables, most of the diners were there to enjoy the Sadhya meal and numerous staff were in motion with assorted trays and curry holders, so as to, serve the present diners.

Our Onam Sadhya experience -

Big, fresh and clean banana leaves were spread on our tables. They did not require any further cleaning. Spoons were provided upon askance.

Basant Neer was served as the welcome drink. It was coconut water infused with honey and mint. It was served at room temperature. But, it tasted very much like the warm detox drink that comprises of water, honey and lime, that many of us consume empty stomach, during morning hours.

It was followed by the servings of - Banana, Banana Chips, Pickles, assorted Curries/Subzis, Dal, Rice, Rasam, Sambar and Ada Pradhaman - the kheer or payesh like dessert. The last three items were served in clay bowls.

A total of two pickles were served. One was made of small sized but whole kairis or raw mangoes (no slicing at all!) and the other was made of pineapple chunks. The former was too tangy for my taste, but I loved the latter one. It was more of a relish which can be easily paired with assorted snacks.

Curries or subzi preparations comprised of lady finger, yam, brinjal, raw banana, coconut etc. Each of the aforesaid preparation was tasty and quite distinct in taste. It was a revelation to come across such a varied and tasty vegetarian meal prepared sans onion and garlic. Rasam, Sambar and Rice-Dal were also very nice. In fact, the Rasam was perhaps the best that I have ever had till date.

To make the Sadhya meal comfortable and interesting for the urban diners, the restaurant has intelligently included the not-so-usually-available but popular dishes like Appam with Stew and Coconut Ice Cream. 

The traditional Sadhya meal was followed by these aforesaid delicacies. Both tasted very nice. Appams were soft and spongy, Stew was infusion of some vegetables in soothing coconut milk. 

Generously infused with malai or fresh cream like  tender coconut chunks, the Coconut Ice Cream was fresh and tasted excellent. Upon enquiry, the serving staff informed that they arrange for a specially prepared batch of Coconut Ice Cream, to serve for Onam Sadhya.

The last serving comprised of Paan. I did not try it.

All in all, Onam Sadhya Thali at Hotel Swagath was a fantastic new meal for us. The serving was fast. The food was fresh, authentically prepared and tasty. The staff were courteous and efficient. 

Happy Onam to ALL ☺

Price Per Thali: Rs. 400/- plus taxes

Note: It was a paid meal. We arrived their incognito.

We ordered 'Chinese Idli' which comes in as a fusion of Chinese and South Indian, which is absolutely lip smacking. This dish will make you go for another plate even when your stomach is full! I absolutely loved this place and hoping to visit this place soon to try it's 'Cocktail vada' and it's famous thalis!

Used to be a good place for family dinner, but today's experience made it the worst restaurant experience i ever had! Fron getting rubber bands in masala dosa to having uncooked rice, it seemed they were not in a mood to serve! Even ac's were not working and when complained about the same, the response was 'sorry sir, we cant do anything about it'! 

Certainly never going to this place again! Go only if you feel you are lucky to get good service/food here!

Place / Ambience : The place is less ample as per a restaurant. Ambience is Quite and Nice.
Food. : High and Rice Quality dealing in South Indian Food. Like this is one of the fine places for south indian food with various varieties of dosa's as well as Idli.
Apart from South Indian,
They deal in North Indian and Chinese which i find not up to the mark.

Came here once while waiting for my doctor at a nearby clinic. A purely vegetarian restaurant specialising in South Indian delicacies, my father had taken the filter coffee and I went for a Masala Uttapam. The coffee was strong, really good as he likes it. The uttapam was average. Filling wasn't really great. Good for trying once and it ends there.

Not to miss out on Cheese Chilli Toast and Thalis

Located on the bustling Hazra Road, Swagath offers a fantastic South Indian experience at minimum prices. The Cheese Dosa served here is simply mouth-watering and I recommend the Vadas and Idlis , which were superb to say the least. This place has absolutely no frills or add-ons , but come here if you crave an authentic South Indian meal. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly , service is prompt and they genuinely make you feel welcome. A great place for comfort food :)

Ordered from here few days back. After going through Zomato, decided to give it a try. The food was more than good but not excellent, it might be due to the fact as I am ordering and not getting the food as hot as it should be. Anyways, ordered:
Dhania Masala Dosa- Best one, must try...👌
Mixed Uttapam- It was good, but it was cold, could have been better..
Idli- OK
Sambar- Little bit on the sweeter side, not to my liking..
Chutney- Nice
Planning to give a visit to experience the real taste while being the food served hot.

An ordinary unpretentious restaurant in  this hotel on Hazra-Lansdowne crossing. Decor wise quite ordinary( though there are touches of brilliance like the nataraj statue). Food here is quite good( I've had here a few times and they've always delivered) This time we went in the evening and had pakoras and coffee. The onion and panir pakora both were good. On earlier occasions I've had their dosas and other South Indian and liked all. Their north Indian thali too is good. The service was somewhat slow but served with a smile.

This was my first visit to kolkata, so before heading out, wanted to have a safe start with a South Indian Meal. We as a group ordered a Mysore Masala Dosa, Mixed uthapam and a north Indian Thali. The place was well lit and we were the only customers at 12 pm. Later came to know that bengali's have their lunch very late. 

Masala dosa was soft and lacked the crispiness required from it. Taste wise, it was good. Masala, sambar and chutney all tasted pretty good. Uthapam had a good dose of veggies and tasted good too. The north Indian thali was decent. Rotis were soft and hot, chole masala was excellent and dal was good too. 

Service was quick and efficient. Prices are reasonable. Overall, a safe bet for those craving for South Indian food in Kolkata.

Delivery was fast, food reached home within 40 mins and all the items were hot & fresh and we really liked them, though nothing extraordinary but still very good. Pricing was also pocket friendly.

Most of the times I prefer having a protein as part of my meal. But this place is one of the few that can turn that around. Very good south Indian food, especially the Mysore masala dosa. This place is a favourite of me and my mom. Excellent staff and cozy environment in the restaurant. This is not your standard restaurant but part of the hotel where outside guests are welcome. Have a lassi to go with your dosa.

I stayed in Kolkata for 3 years and whenever my parents came to visit me, our only destination for food, day and night, was Hotel Swagath!!
A very calm, affordable and beautiful family restaurant with great ambience, food quality, taste and service. We were regular customers so always received smiles from the staff..
My personal favourites were all types of Dosas, Idli, Wada, Dahi Wada, Veg Pulao and Naan.. Please do try for an excellent family experience..

Swagath is absolute love. Their idli's are one of the best in town. Affordable, clean and fast. That is what swagath is all about. Their rava onion dosa is also good but i would prefer the idli.

Good wholesome food. The idli, vada and paper dosa were spot on. The person attending to us was fast and courteous. Don't look for any ambience. This place is a place to go to just have your meal, though it is air conditioned.

Talk about good food, good ambience and good service, hotel Swagath offers all under one roof. A brilliant multi cuisine restaurant offering an extensive menu to choose from. My personal favourite is their South Indian food; Mysore masala dosa being at the top on the list for me. Truly recommend the place to all the foodies.

A family restaurant with a decent ambience, good service and finger licking food. Starting from starters to the main course and breads, all were delicious with a oroper north indian taste to get in a city like Kolkata where it is difficult to find pure north indian taste.
Ambience just sufficient to make your experience average but doesn't add any addon to the overall experience.

Went it for a south Indian breakfast. We ordered for idli, vada, butter masala dosa and a dhaniya masala dosa. Well, the food was just above average. Nothing among we ordered was exceptional or great. Decent food at decent prices. The ambiance was ok. Courteous staff. 
Overall, satisfactory but not impressed!

It's a very nice homely restaurant. We had south Indian breakfast here - idly, vada, dosa and uttapam. They also have north Indian fare, choke bhature, sandwiches, pizzas and a couple of bake dish as well. The south Indian that we ordered was very good. Uttapam was not that good though. Sambhar and chutney were also pretty good. It's a little costlier as compared to many other south Indian restaurants around. But overall a very nice place to have breakfast/ lunch/ dinner. The north Indian is relatively cheaper. Nice place for a simple dinner outside once in a while.

Went on gandhi jayanti..we tried out the plain dosa, the butter paper plain dosa, cheese dosa and mixed uttapam. The food was freshly made, tasteful and authentic. Must mention the chutneys...they were just amazing. The filter coffee at the end brought a satisfying conclusion to a great meal. Will go back here...

Reheated sambar in burnt mustard tempering making it  bitter enough to single handedly slaughter my beloved sambar-dip-vada experience forever was hotel swagath's gift to me today for breakfast. The vada, prepared a few hours before, was clearly not fresh but wasn't stale as well. Anyways, it doesn't matter because the sambar that soaked it reminded me of being force fed kal-meg pata juice as a child. And then there was the onion rava dosa which wasn't crisp or dosa like, somewhere between a botched uttapam and a piyazi. My mother who hates dosa liked it, because it wasn't a dosa ! 

I survived with the masala cola,  and the saunf with sugar cubes ( which I had in spoonsful), before I left, with the lingering bitter after taste on my tongue. 

My 1.5 is for the nice smiley servers who were prompt and nice (given that it was my mother and I only in the entire restraurant), but then okay - at least service was good.

Was scrolling through Zomato at 9am to try a new South Indian Joint for breakfast. A phenomena that happens atleast twice weekly. Thats my love for food. 
Found this place nestled in Hazra. Near Ritchie Road crossing.
When i entered through the main gate,decorations were at full swing with fresh smelling flowers all around. The interiors are nice and cozy. Ordered Cheese Masala Dosa ,a plate of Idly and Mysore Sada Dosa. Greatly satisfied with the Quality , Preparation, Taste of these and Freshness of the Chutney and Sambhar. Mysore Dosa was good but I'm still not satisfied with the kind of taste,masala that they use in Mysore Dosa in Kolkata. Had them in Mumbai and I crave for them every time I'm hungry. Anyway,optimally priced and yes opens as early as 7 am. Kudos on that! 

Overall a good experience. Would rate it a 3.7/5.
Good work;)

You might at first wonder why I've given this place full marks. Many reasons and they are listed below. 

First, this happens to be a minutes walk from where I grew up in Kolkata. I can say, without a doubt, that this is the restaurant I have visited nose number of times in my life, to date. Nostalgia runs like crazy! Oh! This probably is also the first restaurant I remember having visited!

Second, this is where I was introduced to South Indian food as a kid.  My family would frequent this restaurant quite a lot considering its close proximity to my home and also the amazing food they offer. 

Third, their service, quality of food has, in my honest opinion, not gone down even a bit in the last twenty years or so. Their ambiance has become much more new-age.

Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good vegetarian restaurant right in the heart of South Calcutta.

Situated inside a hotel, you expect the interiors of the restaurant to be of a certain standard. But sadly this place disappoints in terms of visual appeal. The furniture looks old  and the table cloth is dirty. The room has a peculiar smell. Once you get past these and tell the server to spray room freshner, one can enjoy the food. We ordered for two plates of idli and vada, one paper sada dosa, one plain rava dosa and a glass of rasam. I didn't taste the idli or the vada but since my parents didn't complain, I'm assuming it was good. The dosas taste good. I particularly liked the rasam and the sambhar. The rasam is tangy and sour, exactly how I liked it and so I enjoyed it thoroughly. The paper plain dosa is big in size and sufficient enough for two. Prices are quite reasonable. Service is decent.

Had breakfast here after doing USG from Quadra. Was looking for healthy breakfast options around but culdn't find one.
The first thing that strikes are the champagne bottles with drinking water. Regular drinking water is mixed with pudina leaves.
Ordered Rava Masala Dosa. It was quite good. The sambar and coconut chutney was exceptionally good.
Sambar vada was also good. The food here is very fresh and hygienic.

I usually host all my company meetings and programs at the Banquet at Hotel Swagath, what I have realized after a few meetings is that the staffs in my company are always looking forward for the monthly meeting. It is surely because of the superb buffet lunch that they provide. Be it south india or rajasthani, it’s just awesome. I personally really love the appam and stew also the rasam-vada in the south indian menu and everything in the rajasthani buffet as its not easily available in cal, atleast at this price. I'm sure that the restaurant will be even better.

I went there cause my friend had literally begged me to go cause he had heard a lot about this place.. The location is very easy to find.. We had ordered for chinese idli, south indian thali and buttermilk. 
Chinese idli was a very nice change to the normal idli that we have.. It was idli saute with bellpeppers, onions and other various types of veggies and tasted really nice with sambhar and chutney..
We ordered special red chutney and the flavours in that was amazing as it had a very nice consistency and the chutney was really upto its colour really spicy..
The south indian thali was a disappointment cause the only good thing was sambhar and the mix vegetable sabzi.. Rasam lacked consistency and flavour and the aloo sabzi wasn't that good...
The buttermilk was mostly water and not even cold with no flavour.. 
To be true was not that happy and if they need customers they need to improve their food..

Okay so I had been thinking of visiting this place for a long time as I had heard a lot about their south indian ..So since I like to try out new dishes, we ordered chinese Idli with special red chutney ,one "safe" dish --   South Indian Thali and butter milk.

Now the Chinese Idli is a nice amalgamation of South Indian and chinese cuisine.Basically the idli is sautèd with onions red bell pepper capsicums and other vegetables like they saute noodles and it tasted pretty good with sambhar.

Coming to the special red Chutney though it had truck loads of spices,I loved its flavours and also the consistency,very nice.

Now with regards to the thali,I was a bit disappointed.Though the sambar and the sabzi dish was good,I was primarily disappointed with the Rasam which should have more intense flavours and the potato dish which just did not have any flavour.The yellow daal was just average.

Also the butter milk was literally 80% water, and it did not retain any flavours.

Whatever rating points I am giving here is because of the Chinese Idli,Sambhar,Sabzi and the Red Chutney.The rest need improvement.

I went there on a Tuesday evening with a few friends since it was a vegetarian day for us and we all had South Indian food cravings. We heard about this place from a couple of other more people. And I must say we were pretty happy at the end of our meals . We had something called " Chinese style Idli " which was spicy but amazing. The RAVA dosa was to die for and unlike other places their sambhar actually tasted like the South Indian sambhar ,,, completely authentic . Great service and great food

When a hard core non-vegetarian foodie like me rates a vegetarian place so highly its time to drop in for a bite. Simple , homely and unpretentious in terms of decor but serving up absolutely delicious food. 
I visited for brunch with two friends and we ordered up Masala Thumbs Up , Cola Float , Cheese Toast , Onion Rava Dosa , Cheese Masala Dosa , Vada and were absolutely delighted with every single item. The Masala Thums Up and Float were great and the Cheese Toast was nice but the South Indian stole the show. The softest Vada's I have had in absolutely the longest time , the Cheese Masala Dosa was wonderful and the absolute star of the show was the Onion Rava Dosa .... the best I have had in the city. Service is warm and with a smile and prices are pocket friendly. A special shout out to the accompanying chutneys. Highly recommended !

Sorry, but this isn't the Hotel Swagath that we grew up in the early 2000s! After all, not all transformations work out well.
I could sense there was something not appearing right as we stepped in and so decided to stick to the knitting and order a Masala Dosa, without being too adventurous! But sorry, sirs! The dosa was thick and leathery... it obviously wasn't absolutely tawa-fresh, as even the masala inside wasn't nice and hot! As for the sambhar, it was just about tepid - and not piping-hot!
Net, net... Unlikely that I will go back again! I might as well revel in the memories of the once-upon-a-time happening Hotel Swagath!

Hotel Swagath which is located in Hazra is one of the nicest breakfast places, with a wide variety and food I personally like...I have been here quite a few time and the place has never disappointed me!!
 
The things you must try are the rava dosa,the onion dosa ,the masala vada ,the idly (which was surprisingly very soft) served along with the perfectly blended chuntey and gun powder. However the sambar could use some improving to make things better. The chola bhatura is another item on the list I really like...The different juices freshly served and the mocktail are a definite,although the butter milk was a little bitter than usual, but over all I love the place and I'd surely go there again!!

Lastly, the place has a very simple elegant decor with a highly hospitable and polite staff which makes the experience of eating all the more pleasant!! Good job guys and keep it up!!

Okay so I absolutely LOVE this place. 
I came here recently for a food meet up .. And everything just was on point to melt my heart. I love food , and of course anything which tastes good makes me happy. 
This place left no complains. I'll keep this review short and simple 
MUST EATS : 
Chinese idly 
Dosa (any) LOTS of lassan chutney ! Oh lord I'm still drooling !! 
Coconut rice MUST MUST eat ! It was absolutely amazing 
Try the cocktail vada too. 
The dry veggie was good too, I hoped for more spice but it's okay. 
And yes ! An absolute eat would be payasam. Make sure you have that !

I am not at all a fan of South Indian food,but,Hotel Swagath is one of those rare places where I have visited multiple times since my childhood and never really been let down.Last week I had visited this place after quite a while and ended up having a good experience yet again.

We were part of a large group and were offered a set meal.We started off with cocktail vada,plain idly,chinese idly with an assortment of chutneys.The cocktail vada was served hot and it was really tasty.The idlies were nice fluffy and airy.The chinese idly I particularly liked.It contained an assortment of vegetables on top which added an extra dimension and texture to the dish without affecting the flavours.The chutneys were all wonderful and I enjoyed the creamy thick coconut chutney the most.The gunpowder chutney I did not like much though.It was grainy in texture and tasted weird.

For main course,We sampled the rawa onion dosa,cheese dosa,mixed uttapam,coconut rice,lemon rice and appam.I am not at all a fan of dosas but the rawa onion dosa was wonderful.The texture the taste and everything was spot on.The lemon rice was a tad too lemony and sour for my liking.The coconut rice though was brilliantly done.The appam with avial and dry jackfruit fry was decent.I really liked the jackfruit but not the avial.The mixed uttapam was quite nice too.

We ended the massive meal with payassam and filter coffee.The payassam was nice and light and a bit different from the ones we are used to.The lightness of the payassam felt all the more good after such a heavy meal.The filter coffee was strong and a perfect way to finally call it a day on a sumptuous meal.

The staff here are always polite and friendly.The prices are moderate.The ambiance though decent does not provide the feel of a south Indian restaurant which most others do.This I have always felt is one drawback of this place.Anyway they do a good job at the most important thing,which is obviously the food.

Overall Hotel Swagath has been serving up good quality for a long while and I feel it is a wee bit underrated.If you are a fan of South Indian food or not this place is surely worth a try.

I use to go to this place as a kid specially for the thali they use to have,  years later now don't expect the same tasteful yummlious thali but did expect a quality Wich however did not get,  the sabzi (vegetable dish) was just full of masala no flavor,  the dal was nice  it's sad such a legendary restaurant has lost its charm of yummlious thali but hoping I still get sumthin that will make me go there again

When a place looks and smells clean, you tend to already be put at ease. Hotel Swagath is just that. Add to that the staff are polite and helpful as well, its one of those joints I am sure you will revisit.  

 We had the cocktail vadas, the chinese idlis, plain idlis and an assortment of chatnis to start with. The idlis were fresh and very airy. I will have to say they are the lightest and fluffiest idlis I have tasted in recent times. The chinese version was tasty, didn't remind me of anything chinese I have had, but I suppose the name comes because of the stir fried greens in the dish rather than its flavor. Every chatni tasted nice and most importantly fresh. Having never tasted the gunpowder chatni, I was excited to try. The texture is an acquired taste but you acquire it very fast if you have grown up eating churan.   
 Then we were offered dosas, I opted for the plain onion rava variety, which hands down is the best rava dosa I have ever had, period! Coconut rice and yellow rice followed along with appams and avial. By this time I was too full to move. 
 Thankfully we ended with the filter coffee, and called it a night. 
The biggest compliment I can give a food establishment is that, I will be back.

This place is old and quite nice. The food is really good - I particularly liked the Chinese idli which was quite tasty with a jumble of capsicum and carrots. The cocktail vadas were served piping hot and the sambar accompanying it was wonderful. But I somehow preferred the creamy coconut chutney. The cold coffee was bittersweet, with a heavy dose of filter coffee. Yum! 

Tried the onion Rawa dosa, lemon rice, appams and coconut rice...with avial and a raw jackfruit bhaaji which was very nice. I was particularly attracted towards the lemon rice, which hits you with a sour tang, and is perfect for those who love lemon rice, for example me. Filter coffee was strong but it was served in a china cup and not in the traditional steel bowl and cup which takes the fun out of the pouring.

OK! So if you are a fan of South Indian cuisine, this is one place you cannot miss. My foodie friends and I were treated to well pretty much everything on their menu for dinner. 
We started off with fresh lime soda, cocktail vada, chinese idlis, plain idlis and vadas. Loved the crisp vadas. The Chinese idlis were nice as well. Then came the dosas! The cheese dosa was nice and cheesy, the onion rava is the best rava I have ever tasted and the paper dosa is the largest dosa I have ever seen! 
The coconut rice and lemon rice followed. The coconut rice for me was the best dish of the evening. It was beautifully cooked and was oozing of coconut flavours. The lemon rice though tasty was a bit too strong. The appam and uttapam followed. The uttapam was very well made but I felt the appam was a bit strechy and didn't quite like it. 
We had the most wonderful payasam for dessert followed by a great cup of filter coffee. A fitting end to a great meal.
There is not much to write about the decor of this place. The service is excellent and warm. 
Must visit for a good south Indian meal in the city. Cheers!

One of the most under rated places I have ever. Swagath is an age old hotel in hazra that I have been to a million times as a kid but not so in the recent days.

I have always thought that people don't give it due credit and praise . Me and a group of foodie friends paid a visit and were totally floored by the fare. 

They have three softest idli and we were suggested something called Chinese idli , which was tossed / stir fried with vegetables and spices. Even the cocktail Wada as super soft . 

This was just the beginning. I had the rava onion dosa which was non greasy and served with thigh beautiful Sambhar. The avail and the appam were great as was the Jack fruit porial. We also tasted the lemon rice and the coconut rice . Both were really fragrant and cooked to perfection. 

The grand finale of the meal was the psyasam. Truly blissful. Overall I recommend this outlet. Its simple and honest and bang on when it comes to value for money.

Cheers!!!

Superb south indian food! Awesome dhosa and the magnam size of the dhosa. Hospitality at its height!! Though it is a south indian restaurant, it servers awesome chilli baby corn. A good place for family dinner or lunch

Please don't come here. The service is very slow and people very rude. The food is okayish.
We ordered Chineese vada, plain idly and cheese grilled sandwich.
The Chinese vada was good worth its price.
The plain idly was not upto the mark. The idli was not properly made.
The grilled sandwich was really not worth its price. 
If you have a lot of time to wait you can come here for. But the food is not good at all.

the south indian food at Swagath reminds me of the food at my boarding school. Get Nostalgic every time with the 'rasam' here. Would highly recommend this restaurant for good food in a clean and hygienic place in Kolkata.

Last month my elder didi's sasural wale had come to kolkata to attend my cousin's wedding & they had boarded hotel swagath for their accommodation!! So they had arrived early morning at howrah station & my dada and I had gone there to pick them up!! So once we reached the hotel to drop them we were dead hungry & decided to have breakfast at their restro!!

The restro is fully veg & no non-veg is served here. The restro is very classy from inside giving a good feel of south india. So moving on,my elder bro ordered normal masala dosa for himself whereas I ordered an onion masala dosa for myself. The order arrived very quickly & we tucked in as fast as we could. The dosa was nicely made & the masaledar sabji accompanied it very well. The sambar & coconut chutney was also of the great quality & fresh. 

I've tasted many dosas in the past but had tasted nothing like this to be very honest. The quality is way notches higher than some well reputed places. A very under rated place but I would to recommend to the new viewers to try this place out to taste their awesome south indian food. A must try

Today was yet another day when I had not brought ma-home-cooked meal,and thus my mischievous mind planned for a Chinese meal.Partners in crime,my colleague nids,decided to have Hakka veg Chowmein n crispy chilly baby corn (its boring,but I luv).
She told me about Swagath and asked me to try it.So,the food came and to my delight,the chowmein was really good,having the proper balance of taste.Though I found the noodles to be a bit thin variety.What I really liked was the babycorn.It was tender,rightly spiced and melt-in-the mouth variety.
Wud like to try their south indian dishes...:)

Had the combo meal. The restaurant was quite empty for a Sunday afternoon. I was served with a smile and the food was piping hot. The coconut chutney was perfect - fluffy, fresh and with real coconut. I was a little uneasy with the table linen - it looked kind of "weary." I will certainly visit again

Have always loved hotel swagath for its amazing south indian food, but the only thing i feel it lacks is that crazy particular smell of sambhar and other south indian delicacies, while you enter other such joints.

The restaurant is located on hazra road and is very noticeable. The restaurant might seem small to a person but actually it could host a lot of people. The decor is basic and the place pretty comfortable. The service is not as quick but passable.

The place serves south indian as well as north indian food but i have never had their north indian food. As for the south indian food, it is superb especially the thalis. The idlis are soft, vadas are very crisp, dosas are well made. Chutney, sambhar are pretty good. The thali is highly recommended and definitely one of the best in city beside rasam and komala vilas. Its  very elaborate and every item well made. However they are very rigid with the items included therein and i would request them some flexibility in this context.  Special tea/ coffee are pretty good for the end.

What I also like is that the food is very reasonable and very hygienic. Love coming here with my friends. We end up paying 200 bucks per person, that's it.

Great place.

We got the menu card instantly and called for a butter onion rava masala dosa and cocktail vada along with cold coffee with ice cream! The vada was amazing .... Perfectly crisp and they serve 5 PCs Small vadas which us filling! The cosa was good to crispy and nice.... I don't like the masala much :( we finally had our cold coffee which was fantastic.... I loved it! The place is clean and well lit..  Would visit again for more :(

Hotel Swagath - A decent Restaurant with simplistic decor's serving South and North Indian under one roof!
==================
Location + Introduction:

As i had got an invitation from the owner Mr. Pranav to come and try their restaurant which had been running since years and was not much on Zomato previously, i gave it a try. I had heard already from my Dad that this place is an old south indian eatery but to my knowledge, much of the young crowd is not aware of it as of now. It is situated near the Hazra Ritchie Petrol Pump after crossing few buildings in the Hazra road after petrol pump, you discover Hotel Swagath. This is a hotel having restaurant on the ground floor. 

As i entered the restaurant, they had instrumental music playing in the background and very simplistic decor. They could do better with their decor specially the ceiling and the main gate. 

Important Notification:
The best part about this restaurant is that it has started delivering South Indian Food hot from "6:30 am" at your doorstep. So whenever you hungry, give them a call for a home delivery. 
==================
Food ordered: 

As i sat beside him, i started off with my food orders. I ordered:

1) Masala Rava Dosa - This was probably one of the best Rava's i have ever had. It was not too greasy. Plus, on request, they even serve the masalas separately which in turn does not make the dosa somewhat soggy. The Sambhar was fine and so was the chutney. #must try 

2) Cocktail Vada - The Vada was very crisp. It were those small pieces of Vada. #must try

3) Rasam Vada - Usually whenever i eat at South Indian places, i always eat sambhar vada. For the first time, i gave a try to Rasam Vada. The Vada got a bit cold and rasam got a bit sour. Nevertheless, on demanding for hot rasam and spreaded in on top of the vada that made it taste much better and the sourness vanished. So, eat this when hot!

4) Special Paneer - This was an off the menu item which he ordered. It tasted average to me. 

5) Chinese Idly - The idly was cut into pieces and had all sorts of vegetables sprinkled on top. Good preparation. 

6) Butter Milk - It was somewhat different. I liked it. #must try 

7) Tutty Fruity Ice Cream - You cannot miss this. Need two persons to finish this. It had strawberry vanilla ice cream topped with strawberry syrup and real natural fruits. I loved this. The presentation was a win win. #must try - for two. 
==================
Pros:

1) Served both south indian and north indian.
2) Pure Veg Restaurant.
3) Serving since 15-20 years. 
4) Courteous staffs.
5) Food served hot.
6) Ambience is simplistic and minimal music. 
7) Family place as well as a good place to have quick meal with friends.
8) Quality of Food is nice. Didn't upset my stomach at all.  
9) Have a lot of varieties specially in south indian like chinese idli, cocktail vada so on and so forth. 

Cons:
1) Need more beverages on the menu.
2) Need more ice creams/sundaes on the menu. 
3) The ambience needs a bit of improvement. 
==================
Meal for two: 700 max. 
==================
Suggestions:

1) Work on getting more items on the menu.
2) Ambience needs much more improvement. 
==================
Summary:

Food quality 3.9/5
Food quantity 3.7/5
Hospitality 3.5/5
Value for money 3.5/5
Taste 3.8/5
Hygiene 3.6/5
Ambience 3.4/5
==================
Conclusion:

I would love to visit again and try out the North Indian dishes. It's a good place for family dine. I would thank Mr. Pranav for inviting me here and making me try out not just the usual south indian stuffs but stuffs like cocktail vada and Chinese idly which are not the usual menu items. 
==================
Note: unbiased review based on my dining experience.

Usually visit this place with my family, my son loves the pizzas over here..Italian thin crust and so reasonable compared to domino's , don giovanies etc. I'm stuck stuck with the south indian here idlis and vada. I tried the Chinese idlly over here which blew my mind away and made me write a review. This was something very unique. Have never tried this in any other place. A must visit, service is very quick other than the weekends.

Last night i slept like a horse. I was feeling so sleepy that i forgot about dinner. So naturally when i woke up around 6 Am, I was hungry as hell. And as you know there aren't many options when it comes to early morning.

So logged in Zomato and set the filter to open now. And voila there came a list of options.
After changing my mind a few hundred times, I declared today as Happy South Indian Day and got in the car and straight to Swagath.

After reaching there i saw a notice on the gate saying we are undergoing renovations, I had a surge of a few bad feelings, but then i went in anyways and asked the guy on the front desk, "Are you guys open ?"

"Yes Sir" he promptly replied. Oh i was so happy, went in and ordered a plate of Idli's and a Masala Dosa... Ya right. Old School. The Idly was so fresh and so were the chutney and the sambhar. Gulped them down in a minute and now it was the turn for the Dosa. It was good. Not Awesome but was good.

Tummy was full, and paid the bill and came back happy.

They Open from 6:30, Way sooner than Banana Leaf.....

My office is a few lanes away from Swagath, so I end up eating here atleast 4 times a week. I usually call for take away, but when I get time I try to go there and eat as south indian is best served hot. I love the red chutney which they serve or request only. Its just doubles up the taste for me. Have never had better south Indian in Cal.

An old favorite that has maintained standards despite changes in ownership and unionized staff. Reportedly (unconfirmed) starting off as a place  to stay for South Indians posted to Kolkata where then owner 'paati maa' wud get tenants to grind the batter in exchange for meals, Swagat has come a long way. 



The menu spanning South and North Indian dishes apart from sandwiches is uniformly good. While the food is not spectacular, the south Indian thali is better than average. Some years ago they had a south Indian food fest when they turned out excellent range of south Indian snacks but I got the feeling the Union (even during the fest the waiter wud discourage u from ordering anything that required the kitchen crew to stretch a little) somehow nixed the attempt to introduce any of the items into the regular menu. A pity the place is content to be good when it can be great…..



The new management is clearly  business-like and  I have a feeling will sooner than later replace troublesome staff that wud include the older kitchen hands and the authenticity of the south will go with this- a story that is repeated with dismal regularity across older restaurants in Kolkata……..



The restaurant itself is spacious and comfortable with good air-conditioning and a clean washroom. Good place to go to with a crowd that has a variety of demands including Jain food

In the buzzing street of Hazra lies Hotel Swagath. As the name suggest each and every guest is warm heartedly welcomed.

The food here is just amazing, mainly i speak about the South Indian food which is very popular here. The Idly are soft and vadas are fresh and crisp.
They have such awesome variety in their dosas and each and every one of them is worth trying. The Cheese Dosa being my personal favourite.
I quite relish their North Indian food too. The service is fast and prompt.

All in all, the place has been there for a long time and serves pretty amazing food at decent prices.
 
Hotel Swagath draws huge crowds and this place is gaining ground with food lovers.
I would definitely recommend this place as answer to authentic South Indian Food.

By far the best South Indian Cuisine in Kolkata.

Hotel Swagath is a delight which welcomes both vacationers and the local townies. It is one of the good old Hotels in South Kolkata which has lived up to its remarkable standards. I am not just talking from my own side but also from an old and experienced person like my father himself. This place has always been my favourite for both accommodation and food as they entertain a big bunch with good care.
Talking mainly about food, I have always enjoyed my visits here and was quite pleased with the quality and taste.The south indian cuisine which is their forte, is quite a talk among the localite. In india, South Indian food is made in variety of ways and it is difficult to impress both the north and the south in that matter. Here I find the food to be such that it will cater to both. Idli and vada are both a must when I am having this cuisine; idli is soft in the adequate amount and vada is crispy as needed. The coconut chutney and the garlic chutney are also really good, not to forget the sambhar which has the right amount of spices and veggies which is usually hard to find. Dosas are quite crispy here and still maintain the right balance of the oil which is quite an important thing to take care of. Onion Masala Rava Dosa is my favourite here.
If you are lucky enough, you might even get to try the sabji kachori in the mornings which is quite amazingly prepared here, as it is only available on some special Sundays. Looking forward to making many more memorable memories here.

I'm a morning person and go for my morning walk at 6am everyday to Maddox square. Hotel Swagath is just near it. What else could you ask for if you get the best idly and uttapam for breakfast right after the walk at 7am. This place is really good. I end up taking parcels once a week after my walk for my family members. MUST GO if you still haven't tried this restaurant.

I Visit this place quite often and that's when I get a craving for authentic south Indian food.right from the dosa to the different varieties of chutneys,every bite of the delicacies offered here is amazing.
The Masala vada and the signature cocktail vada  is truly  rich in taste and not to forget the tooty fruity which tastes much better than it even looks on the menu and will surely make you come back again.
Ambience and hospitality add to the over all experience,it's very homely and the staff are very courteous.
The location is very convenient and accessible with its proximity to ballygunge and further south to alipore.
Over all I don't think twice before coming here following my quest for amazing south Indian and continental.youl surely come out with a smile and it won't be surprising if that's your last meal of the day!! 
Try today..

My mom and her friends usually go to this place for kitty parties, so everytime she goes she gets me a packing of a south indian dish. All I can say is that I SIMPLY LOVE IT. Be it the sambhar or the rava dosas or the cocktails vadas or the idlis. I guess its a very under rated restaurant, But a must go for all. Thanks to my mom I get my delivery always at home!

I'm a regular at Swagath hotel. The South Indian at it's restaurant is undoubtedly one of the most unbeaten points of the restaurant. 
The ambience adds to the the appetite  I feel. It's very well lighted and creates a  lively mood. 

The dishes here are absolutely mouth watering and irresistible. There is a great range of choices and I feel the chef's at work at this place are really clever in making dishes out of the ordinary and I would definitely say it is one of the most under-rated restaurants that doesn't really come into one's radar.

I really enjoy eating here and I'd say as far as South Indian food is concerned it's must visit place.

Swagath offers delicious dosas and idlis. I haven't tried the North Indian stuff but am sure it will be great as well... The place has a simple and nice ambience but the highlight of the place is the food..

One of the best South Indian food in Kolkata. They serve authentic South Indian food and it's a must for any foodie. The quality of the food is good and they provide excellent service & helpful staffs.Their location is good along with the parking facilities and nice ambience.
I also tried their North Indian delicacies which was equally good.
It's a must go to place especially for the ones who love South Indian food.

Location:  On the road from Hazra Crossing to Ballygunge Crossing.

The happiness of the Happy Street came to an end with today (March 29, 2015) being the last! A healthy morning couldn't be healthier with a lighter food as compared to the usual Marwari Sunday Breakfast.
A group of three (one with a small appetite and the rest with medium ones) headed towards this place for breakfast after a fun-filled morning with different outdoor sports at the Happy Street.
The group was warmly greeted by the watch guard and showed the way inside. As the group entered the restaurant at 8:30 hours, were greeted with a smile and showed the seats.
The restaurant had a serene ambiance with a seating arrangements for an approximate of thirty heads.

The fare on offer was wide including North Indian, South Indian and Fast Food cuisines. The group after a few minutes of discussion, primarily stuck to the South Indian Cuisine and kept provision of wondering into the fast food section of the tummies allowed post-south indian meal. The order line-up was as follows:

- Idli [2 pieces]
Soft and melt-in-the-mouth type. 

- Cocktail Vada [4 pieces]
Wasn't as great as it was heard of. Similar to the usual mini Vadas but, had vegetables (onion, carrot etc.) in the batter. The taste wasn't anything exceptional, but good.

- Onion Rawa Plain Dosa
Aah! It was a complete delicacy! Crisp and nicely made. 
Recommended.

- Cheese Masala Dosa
With a request of Masala as a side and not inside the Dosa.
The Dosa was nicely prepared with a generous amount of grated cheese.
The masala was just average, flavors felt flat plus, the potatoes weren't boiled to perfection. Has scope of improvement.

- Cold Coffee
As it arrived, it was noted that the coffee wasn't cold as it's expected, but tasted decent. On complaint, was changed. The change was a complete disaster as the consistency had changed from the usual to watery (as if water was added to chill it or ice was allowed to melt in order to serve it chilled). With that said, yes, it was served chilled, but, was tasteless.

- Special Chutney (Red)
Onion, tomato & garlic flavored chutney. Tasted great.
Recommended.

- Coconut Chutney
Was average to taste. Could be imrpoved.

- Sambhar
Visually didn't appeal me much but, was flavorful. Tasted good.

The polite staff treated the group with utmost warmth but, served them at a slow speed. The service needs to boost up.
Prices were found to be pocket-friendly, but the quality needs to be improved else might feel a pinch. The breakfast left the group's wallet lighter by INR 392.

Overall was a decent experience. 
- Could be much better.

Location: On the road from Hazra Crossing to Ballygunge Crossing. 

This restaurant was discovered when I had come to meet one of my friends who had come down to Kolkata for a wedding and was accommodated here along with his family. 
Due to certain circumstances, me and my friend planned out a luncheon here itself instead of going out somewhere else. Coming to the order, it comprised of:  

- Idli and Vada (A plate each) 
The Idlis were soft and the Vadas were crisp but, slightly oily. 

- Onion Masala Dosa 
Mashed potatoes sautéd and put in the dosa with onion. 
Good to taste. 

- Rava Plain Dosa 
Was crisp and tasted good. 

The staff was quick to process our order. 
And prices are pocket friendly. 

Overall an above average experience.

If you are looking for Jain food, is really nice place. 
South Indian food is very inconsistent. They also serve North Indian and some Chinese dishes too.
North  Indian food is really good. Lemon rice, Paneer Masala, Dal Makhani, Paneer tikka are really good dishes.
Normally its too crowded on Sunday evening, management is unable to handle crowd on Sundays. 
On sundays you can end up getting bad food or service if it is post 8.30pm.

Not quite a Banana Leaf but serves the purpose, does this place. One may sit and dine as well but I prefer to do takeaways. The dosas are pretty good and so are the idlis and vadas. I am not too impressed with the uttapams, upma and the sambar that they serve here. I really love the red chutney which they provide only on request. So don't give that a miss. I think the Tamilians do like this place as they have accomodation arrangements on the floors above and they always seem to be occupied by Tamils, so that's a good endorsement. The service is quick but it would be better if the prices were lower given the quality if food they serve. Otherwise, not much too complain about this place. 3.5 is because of ambiance, which is not great and because of relatively poor value for money.

Am a regular  cause I love the food here . just awesome ! 
The idlis are awesome  and the sambar is too good . They serve it piping hot  and refill it after u have finished it :)
Fried rice and chilly babycorn are awesome !  The augratin is great and filling . All veg  sabzis ( special mention to - mushroom matar makhani and navratna korma ) are delicious and  quantity is good for 2- 3 . 

The best thing on the menu are the north indian thalis :) served piping hot  with 2 -3 sabzis  , rotis or naan , dal , jeera rice/pulao  , superr delicious and very cold raita  , pickle and onions . . . . yumm yummm !!!!

South Indian Food Is lip-smacking . The North Indian menu is pretty good as well. Overall a nice place for regular dinners.

Went there for South Indian food. I left the place super confused. The idlis were awesome but the sambhar was not. The onion uttapam was one of the best I have had but the coconut chutney had no taste. The dosa was pretty good but the masala was just not up to the mark. The rava dosa was disappointing too. So I really don't know. The main elements of the food were great, service was excellent, ambience was good, but the essential condiments were very disappointing, and without them an Idli-Dosa meal is really incomplete...probably won't be going back anytime soon.

I usually come to this place whenever I am hungry like hell and want to have a wholesome meal due to its proximity to my dwelling.

The ambiance is like any routine mid-level restaurant. The tables are clean more often than not and service is pretty fast! You would mostly spot families inside having a peaceful dinner. Once inside, the network reception on your cell phone would drop to zero, which is annoying. Comfortable parking space is available.

North Indian food is just OK. South Indian food is commendable, specially the idli-vadas. The onion rava dosa is great and sufficient to quench the hunger of an individual. Oil is balanced (difficult to find at most restaurants in Kolkata). Ending your meal with a filter coffee is recommended. 

If you are just hungry, don't have great plans to chill out at dinner and specifically pining for some quality South Indian food, this is a place to be. For Chinese and North Indian, there are plenty of better options within a kilometer of Maddox square (Red Hot Chilli Pepper, Mainland China and some lesser known joints on Hazra Road for Chinese, The Dhaba for North Indian)

I am a dosa lover and I can say for sure without any doubt that swagath is the best dosa i have had as far as i can remember. The chutney especially is mind blowing. I always have the paper plain dosa which is pretty huge :)
I have also had dhaniye dosa and it was good.

This restaurant brought me to love South Indian food! That's the highest form of accreditation I can give to a South Indian restaurant!

The menu, which offers delight and variety is a balanced mix of classic south Indian preparations with new-age twists including cocktail medu vadas which are just so cute! And this happens to be one of the few places where the pictures you see on the menu actually match up with what is brought to you at your table.

You haven't had south Indian food till you've had it at Swagath.

Came in for breakfast. 

We each ordered the idli vada plate. The idli came out first and was hot and fluffy. I really liked the coconut chutney as well. The sambar was ok. We liked it so much that we ordered another idli each. 

The vadas came out a little later, hot from the fryer. They were super light and really tasty. I really liked them. 

We finished up with a filter coffee, which was good, if a bit over sweetened.

The ambience? What's that? Hahaha. I guess it's a bit better than most idli shops.

A very classy ambience with a quick service is assured in this vegetarian restaurant! I have been here twice,and i preferred to order thalis on both the occasions. The south Indian thali comprises rice, puri, alu, sabji, olan, dal, rasam, sambar, curd, pickle and papram. A sumptuous meal indeed! The north Indian thali has fried rice, kulcha, paneer buter masala,mixed vegetables, kofta, etc. I must say the food here is very good. Prices are moderate. It's a blessing for the vegetarians.

it's a decent place to have good south Indian food. the thali is quite good and the dahi vadas are too sure for.
but one needs to sample the dosas... which are delicious and crispy. the rasam could be better but still a great place to eat.

Hot, steaming idlis or crispy mysore masala dosas, Swagath has been the one of the city's favourite south indian food joints for generations now. Parents and grand parents have stories to tell of the times they would stop by at the restaurant for a bite and 'adda' after their morning walks at victoria.
Swagath now has evolved and retained what its been best at. The south indian fare reminds you why it's been popular for generations now and the new range of chinese and indian food do not fail to match its standards! 
The hotel also has renovated and modern rooms available for travellers. With extremely tariffs and good service, Swagath really welcomes its guests- to the restaurant or the hotel- with all its heart! 
Also a great place to host small get togethers or even weddings, the management helps take care of all your party needs. Absolute value for money and a promise of an enjoyable time.
