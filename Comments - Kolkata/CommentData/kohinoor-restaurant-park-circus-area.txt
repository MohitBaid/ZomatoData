Well, to start with, the place was referred by a very special person who know the inside out of park circus. I was heading back from science city with family when we wanted to have some evening snacks. And I was told that there's this kohinoor restaurant which serves good chicken rolls. I ordered it and it so yumm. The whole things was so crispy and the chicken was a whole lot tasty.
A must visit for people nearby pc for evening snacks.
Alhamdulillah

The young guy who make rolls is very rude and ill mannered person. He doesn't talk properly with the customers who come for the rolls. Management should look into this matter. Very disappointing.

Located just opposite to alibaba .Went their on a weekday. Food is not at all costly but is very tasty. Had double egg roll which is cheaper than the ones available in street side hubs in howrah. The roll was awesome. It was big and filling. Will definitely visit this resturant again

Decent small street-side eatery, we took mutton biriyani with egg, had no potatoe in it. It tasted decent and I liked it, quantity was more than sufficient, on the menu the price of it was 130 bucks. They don't offer bills, just pay the cash and get the change, also the waiter expects tips.... but he was polite and cooperating.

It is nice  restaurant in park circus area, serves mainly north indian food. 
The mughlai preparation are delicious. We tried mutton biryani and kebabs.  Biryani was good, meat was nicely cooked, soft. Kebabs were very tasty. Service was fast and prices were very much pocket friendly.

This is a roll eaters paradise!!  The mutton tikia roll is so amazing that i use to hog 2 of them straight during  my college days. My friend was a big fan of the maghaz (brain) roll. The pricing is reasonable and the service is fast. Good place for snacking on rolls.

On the crossing of Syed Amir Ali Avenue and Congress Exhibition Road, just from where the auto momentarily stops to pick customers, this small eatery is located, just overlooking Zeeshan. It is a tiny place with a even tinier seating place.

Even after being located at busy place, it hasn't been that popular. The reason might range from its size, cleanliness, staffs' monotonous behaviour or presence of other famous joints nearby.

I have had tried roll from this place just to have a break from my usual routine. They taste just fine, nothing great nor inedible.

This place doesn't have that X factor which keeps you attracting. You would rather give a second though on visiting this place.

With a zeeshan and other set traditional eateries here, this place is not even in the competition. It is a new shop, hardly ten years in service but they have to still go a long way to improve quality. The mutton used in the dishes is surprisingly of a good quality and that is because the owner also has a mutton shop in Dhangar Bazaar, having the same name - Kohinoor. The shop sells good quality mutton, fresh and cheaper than the other shops in the same area.

I tried this restaurant about 8 months back and unfortunately, it forced me to give a low review. 
The Biryani here is too dry and lack the essence of the Kolkata Biryani. The prices are at par with most Biryani chains in the city, so they should try to improve on their quality. However, one good item that I've really enjoyed, is the roll. Their chicken roll is delicious and the pieces are tender and soft. 
Hopefully, this restaurant would grow as it is surrounded by competitors such as Zeeshan and Afza.

Kohinoor is located at one of the corners opposite Zeeshan. This outlet remains a favourite for Tikia rolls, biryani and chicken chap. Mostly used as a take away option, they do have an air conditioned seating area upstairs. Pricing is reasonable and is a great option for a quick bite around the area. The chicken reshmi kebab at Kohinoor is quite tasty and succulent.

Kohinoor is a small eatery which serves north Indian food. It is situated just opposite to Zeeshan, near Park Circus Seven Point Crossing. Have tried their chicken roll which was quite good. Interior decor is nominal and needs a lot of improvement. Pricing is reasonable.

Located opposite to Zeeshan, this outlet remains quite popular owing to the wonderful Mughlai dishes they serve. Although the ambiance and atmosphere here is quite congested, the food here is delightful. Their Biryani - Chaap combination is one of my favorites. Sufficient amount of rice with a soft boiling potato and then with a juicy Chicken or succulent Mutton, the Biryani alone can fill your tummy. If you are less hungry, you can try one of their Rolls as well.

located just opposite the famous *zeeshan* @ park circus, this small outlet serving biryaniz..chaps...rolls and stuffs, is a delight to evryone who wants to try biryani other than the typical zeeshan ones. yes, its not zeeshan, its kohinoor, & acording to my taste and choice, I really love their biryaniz to the core. they give sumptous amount of rice, big chunk of a chicken piece & a big juicy potato at a very reasonable rate which obviously fits into ones pocket :-)

The way they prepare the rolls - somewhat like 'lachha roti' - it's an absolute delight. Also the chicken preparations are tasty, notably the mutton chap and chicken chap.
Try out this awesome restaurant opposite of Zeeshan joint in park circus area.

It was a day when I was a little low on money. So I was unable to go to Zeeshan just opposite to this restaurant. The food is very oily. The taste is good. But the place is very unhygienic, looks very dirty. I've heard people say they found hairs in their food. My experience wasn't that horrifying but it wasn't very good either. I wouldn't suggest this place at all. 

Honestly speaking, you would do better to just cross the road and go to Zeeshan on the opposite foot.

This was a brave act on my part, sometimes foodie's do take a risk. This was one of those which I took while choosing working lunch options. I ventured out with a colleague and we were in the Mughlai food mood, none of us had ever tried this place. I ordered a plate of Chicken Bharta and decided to get it parcelled. While standing and waiting for the food, i could see the chicken being shred to be put into the Bharta gravy and also being made, sometimes it is a bane to have an open kitchen concept and this was one of those. I wish I did not actually see chicken being made and cooked in such an unhygienic manner.

Having said all that and with the bunch of rumali roti's I headed back to office with my colleague. the gravy portion size was miserly and not worth the price at all. The worst part was not the taste but there was a hair free with the chicken and that made the whole experience rather disgusting. I wish I had not eaten or ordered and won't venture out again.

Kohinoor has been a popular biryani joint in the Park Circus area for years now. It serves decent food .... used to parcel food from here regularly when I stayed in Ballygunge but don't frequent it as much as I used to earlier as I find that the food is oilier. Taste wise it still is preety good and serves up decent biryani and chaap. However I suggest that you stick to the take-away option as there is no ambiance to speak of and the place is not ideal for family and female diners

Right opposite Zeeshan at Park Circus lies a gem of a place perfect for takeaway, and I have been guilty of taking for a considerable amount of time. I am a major fan of their mutton tikia roll, as well as the mutton tikias themselves, not to mention the Lachha parathas and chicken chaap. They make a great Biryani, and for under 100/- in this day, they serve a very good piece of biryani meat (unless you are really, really unlucky), egg and potato with a huddle of fragrant rice,  much larger in quantity than the rivals. I absolutely love the chicken chaap as well. Its dry, fried to perfection and the masala is great. Do try their mutton liver as well. They make it good! No ambiance though. The place is tiny and best if you stand outside and take away.

Kohinoor is located right opposite Zeeshan and a stones throw form Arsalan. This might be why it suffers from low customers, which might explain its dingy like ambience. 

It is your standard Mughlai outlet, with VERY few seating space. Much of it also looks dirty and ill maintained. The biriyani is nothing great, although is priced lower than its competitors. The Mutton Chaap could be recomended. They actually make it good. Also the rolls. But, honestly I'd rather walk towards the opposite side for Zeeshan.

However, this place is quite affordable for students. What I have observed is that a large chunk of their orders are meant for parcel. They also cater to the needs of the customers of the booze shop located right next to it. 

That's about it. Not at all a family place.
