I have never been to this place but have ordered from here several times. I usually order their thalis and combos. I ordered their non-veg thali and chinese combo meal (chicken and fish). I must say, food was really good and the quantity was more than enough for me. However, i had to struggle with their packaging. It always takes me a good 15 minutes to open the plastic covering attached to the thalis.
Will i be ordering from here in the future?. I will say "definitely!"

Order + Review date: 9.8.17
Initial Story: Confidently, this is the first review on Zomato which I am posting just minutes after having lunch (delivered from Haut Fuddz). I was finding new express office-lunch delivery services in Sector 5 and I found this outlet after much browsing, although it had a rating of 3.1 and 2 reviews but still seeing the (name+menu designs+plans+rates) I took the next step and ordered.
The delivery: Post acceptance of the order the store just took 15 mins to deliver the lunch (real location of the outlet not known and they delivered to Godrej Waterside, Sec V). I would say super fast delivery. The person who came as the delivery boy was also courteous.
The Food Pricing: The order was a Double egg Thali. The price is Rs 155. Add GST(6% CGST+6% SGST) (Remember for takeaway orders the GST is 12% from a NON AC / Only delivery food outlet. The detailed price break-up was Rs 155 (Price on 9.8.17) + Rs 14.88 (GST) + Rs 15 (Delivery Charge) = Rs 154 (As the outlet offered 20% discount on ordering through Zomato. Thanks Zomato too :).Â  Packaging: The packaging was excellent and absolutely airtight. The packaging was high on food safety as the tissue and plastic spoon were packed in a separately.
The Content/Taste/Freshness: The lunch had sufficient quantity of Veg Biriyani, Pickle, One Big Laddu, Salad(One big piece of cucumber+1 small piece of lemon cut+1 green chilli), 1 Brinjal Fry(depends on the fry of the day), Daal, Green Sabji (Sabji of the day which was Pointed Gourd (Parwal/Patol)+Potato Mixed Veg+ Two Boiled Eggs in curry. The taste of all the items was fresh, hot and some items were a bit (semi spicy) but the lunch was easy on stomach. The taste of each and every item was fabulous and I will order everytime I fail to bring lunch from my home.
Suggestion of a different kind: I am a reviewer who is very strict about reviews and you have really achieved appreciation. It seemed that you people are new and following this try to maintain the quantity and quality as well the way you have made it today and as yet. My experience says that many office delivery outlets stop the business or they see tough times very soon and as a result a number of services came and vanished. I wish a lot of success to you people and try to be a leader in this segment along with keeping this business intact with the present values for years to come.

We ordered rahu thali, chicken curry thali and a chicken Manchurian fried rice thali from Swiggy. The quantity was too good, a thali comprising of salad, chutney, sabzi, bhaji, dal and sweet along with your opted side dish. Within that price the quantity was too good but the only cons was its taste , rahu gravy was sweet with the fish size being too small. The Chinese rice had only cabbage with a blunt sweet Manchurian gravy. Since the price was all with okish taste, one can opt for it as an office lunch only!

This might be a surprisingly high rating for a new and tiny takeaway joint in sec v but they surely deserve it. I had ordered for an egg thali a week back through a food delivery app which surprisingly had a technical glitch and failed to update me on my delivery status. I was forced to call up the takeaway directly who very graciously delivered the food directly to my office. They didn't even charge me a thing. I am still trying to paytm the requisite amount.
Coming to the food, it is simple and well presented home style cooking . The chutney on the side was delicious as was the egg curry. The portion is generous enough for one to share. Definitely better quality food than the thali services doing the rounds in sec v. All the best.
