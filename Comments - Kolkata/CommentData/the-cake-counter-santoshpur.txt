Cake Counter! Suchantika! I canâ€™t express my happiness in having found this gem of a home-made/custom cake shoppe in Santoshpur. I was always disappointed with the cake scene in Santoshpur until Suchantika came to the rescue with her â€˜Cake Counterâ€™. Ordering a custom cake is as easy as it gets. You call her (or use whatsapp), give your specifications and voila, delicious cake gets delivered at your doorstep. While there are other bakeries which make amazing cakes, what differentiates Suchantikaâ€™s cake counter is the customer experience that she provides. She is extremely patient and she treats her customers like humans and is committed to their happiness. She is one of the rare few who are more focused on their craft rather than the monetary value it fetches. I could say this because she insisted that I pay after I receive my cake. She even delivered the cake to the birthday boy(my dad!) herself :) Oh and about the cake! Though I wasnâ€™t there to taste it myself, my mum and dad loved it and they want me to order from her again :) In short, I had a great experience and I would recommend her to any cake lover. Cheers!

Ordered one pound rainbow cake in a very short time. Wasn't even sure whether the lady would agree to take the order. There was only a time of an afternoon. Anyhow, it was really sweet of her that she not only took the order but exactly prepared as i wanted. The cake was really creamy, beautiful colors just like rainbow and mild sweetness was there. Also she had added almond praline which have enhanced the flavours. 
Here goes the picture of the cake, it is only only beautiful from outside but way more beautiful from inside ðŸ’˜

I am just amazed with their service. All I had to do was call them up, place the order over WhatsApp after choosing my preferences, and voila, there's my cake delivered after 2 days, looking as pretty as a picture!!!! It was for my mom's birthday, and it goes without saying that she was beyond delighted. The 2 pound rainbow cake with the cream cheese filling was as amazing in taste as it looked. Will definitely order again from here. Nothing's more convenient than this, I swear. And when the cake is a visual as well as a gastronomic masterpiece, who needs to go anywhere else?

I had ordered a set of 6 truffle cupcakes from Cake Counter and they turned out to be every bit awesome as they looked. I placed the order a day in advance on Whatsapp and my cupcakes were ready on time as promised. They looked great and taste good too. Decent sized cupcakes at reasonable prices made them a good gift. Definitely recommended.

I ordered a birthday cake and it was super awesome in both taste and design! As it is a home bakery, Please do call instead of reaching to the given location, the cake selections can be done via WhatsApp also. 
The owner is very polite. And it was done in a very short notice of 1 day, so you can trust them in any kind of urgency too. ðŸ˜Š

The cake counter - a new bee in the list of home bakers in town is making quite a noise in the city. Owner & chef in charge Miss Suchantika's brainchild has come up with this lovely venture which is growing pretty nice in these days.

I was really surprised to see quite a long list of their offerings and some rare items added in their menu as well.

USP:
-> Fresh ingredients used in products as it is prepared depending on order
-> Eye catching Presentation
-> Home delivery option

##Location:
Located at Santoshpur near the Jora Bridge area. ( Landmark : Ashirbaad Sweets)

##Experience:
On a Sunday afternoon I was there on an invitation by the owner here and dropped in there to taste some of their desserts. Tried some of the products mentioned

My dessert saga started with some fresh Mango chesse cake. It looked very lucrative on the black plate and the soft cheesy cake tasted quite nice too.

Next Was the Irish Cake which looked absolutely stunning and was made for the first time. It has been added in the menu recently and boy o boy it tasted marvellous.

Then moved to brownies and Lemon tart. The brownies were a bunch of good looking slices which was little less on the sweetness quotient and the tart tasted nice though the cup got a little soggy due to the rainy weather.

Moving on to the other products was the Ferraro Rocher Cake which certainly gives a craving for chocolates. With it's beautiful looks I liked the cake as well.

As I m not a big chocolate lover I was eagerly waiting for the Velvet cake which was snow white from outside , red and bright from inside. Though the red part was a bit too much but that didn't effect the taste.
Lastly the Oreo Nutella Mousse cake arrived and again mesmerized me with the presentation and ingredients used in was very nice. Tasted yummy and one of the best among their stock. Kids will love this for sure.

All in all quite a lovely experience over their desserts I had thanks to Miss Suchantika the lady on the roll. I am rating them with some stars because of the enthusiastic approach and having a vision to serve the best to the customers. Also purely at a home setup this kind of product preparation is quite a remarkable job. Much appreciated!!
With all this I wish the team very good luck for future endeavors may you grow and serve at your best.

The Cake Counter was a pleasant experience on a gloomy Sunday afternoon, sometime back. Thanks to the courteous invitation by Miss. Suchantika DeyÂ  on behalf of the Cake Counter, the afternoon could not have turned out better. Who does not get elated at the sight of a table laden with baked goodness, especially when it's desserts. All the cakes and bakes looked immensely lucrative, so full marks on the presentation. The all new home baker, labored hard to prepare for us- a mango cheese cake, a red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting, an Irish mocha cake with Irish sauce and tempered chocolate to accompany, an oreo-nutella mousse cake, Ferraro Rocher Truffle cake, dark chocolate brownies and finally lemon tarts.

I had to literally take a break between all the tasting. Completely in love with the Oreo Nutella mousse cake and the Irish Mocha cake with the Irish sauce. Not only were they beautifully presented and attractively decorated, they tasted immensely satisfying, making me go back for seconds and thirds. The lemon curd in the lemon tart, needed just another spoonful of sugar and it would have lighted up the already existing flavors, and same goes for the brownies.

Here's wishing all the best to Suchantika and her home baking venture. Hopefully those lovely cakes keep coming and we get to see more new stuff on the table.

Cakes are the food stuff we all need everyday for all our different needs. Someone has a birthday, someone has their anniversary and someone is celebrating their success with it. We got loads of renowned and big cake makers around the city. Baking cakes and selling Â from home is the new trend now a days, and its been highly successful in the process.
It was a rainy Sunday afternoon went there with friends on a invitation from the maker herself Ms. Suchantika (A simple and calm lady with a bit nervousness on the face but still managing to smile.). She had some good number of cakes ready for us with which we are all familiar with.
It goes like this : Mango Cheese Cake, Red Velvet, Irish, Oreo, Lemon Tart and Brownie, Ferrero Rocher Truffle Cake.

Picked up my plate and started with one of my favorite choice the Mango cheese cake. The look and smell was quite soothing from the first hand and when i cut the cake it said it all for me. Softness the most required part i felt and it contained perfect balance of sweetness in it. The blend of mango and sweetness of the cake made the first impression very perfect to try the next ones.

Red Velvet caked looked appealing and it lifted my expectations really high with it. But at the end of the day it turned me down a bit. Few general mistakes in the making but i hope and believe it was a day it didn't turned out well but heard a lot about the previous red velvet cake which was a winner.

Irish Oreo was the second best of the afternoon. Presentation was very eye catchy and looked very good. The eggless cake was very chocolaty and i personally a fan of chocolate so i was very critical on it. Â Soft, creamy and the Oreo biscuits for decor was yet another good idea.

Lemon Tart : I am not too fond of having tarts but had a try because she had made it for the first time. It didn't disappointed me but still lots of improvement is needed.

Walnut Brownie: They were looking good on the plate with dark chocolate in color and walnut can be seen spreaded all over the brownie. It was quite soft but a little bitter in taste. Thou i wont say it was bad but some work on this will make it perfect for sure.

Ferrero Rocher Truffle Cake : I seriously loved the presentation and the looks. Being the ferro rocher on the above the whole chocolaty cake just was making me impatient to have a try of it. With the dark truffle sauce in it and made up with dark cocolate it was satisfactory but again bitter in taste.

So overall we all had a mixed feeling on all the items we had. Still i believe its early days for her and she is doing very well with the cakes and presentation. I wish Suchantika all the very best for her future and hope she does extremely well ahead. Cheers!

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Kolkata is slowly become the eden for people with sweet tooth thus it will not be wrong to say that 'mishti' is the word we bengalis frequently use. The concept of home baking is something new to Kolkata. Previously cakes always meant flury's, nahoom's but now home bakeries are mushrooming in many parts of Kolkata. The Cake Counter is such a home baking unit whuch is very new in the town. I got the opportunity to taste some of their baked items.
I started with the mango cheese cake which was a total revelation!! I loved the well balanced sweetness, the soft texture of the cake and the delightful blend of mango and cheese cream. This is highly recommended for anyone ordering from this place.
The lemon tart also satisfied my tastebuds though the filling seemed to be less dense and the tart a bit to soft but somehow the tanginess and the lack of artificial flavours appealed to me. 
The Irish cake was an absolute delight, be the cream, be the flavour , be softness.. everything juxtaposed perfectly to creat a cake that is absolutely delightful.
Thus if you prefect you cake to be fresh and free of artificial preservatives then this is the bakery you are looking for.

A plethoara of Home Bakers have come up in Kolkata in the last couple of years. Recently opened Suchantika Deyâ€™sÂ Cake Counter is fighting the battle of â€˜dessertsâ€™ in Kolkataâ€™s Bakery Battle. Suchantika left her job and took up home baking as a profession in the last few months. With one eye on the horizon and one on her oven she is galloping forward.
                                                                ...

With so many new home bakers coming up in Kolkata with a variety of options one has to have some kind of edge to be in the lead. 

One a rainy Sunday afternoon a bunch of crazy dessert loving foodies were invited to the cake counter by Suchantika. Located in Santoshpur. Her place is not very hard to find. She has recently joined the home bakers bandwagon. 
Cakes have to be ordered 24 hours prior and she delivers them to the clients address.

Firstly her presentation is really neat and clean. She gives a lot of effort in making them.
Following are the items that we tasted:- 
Mango Cheese Cake:- I don't eat mango at all,
( I can feel the judgy eyes rolling )  I can't bear the smell. But this cheesecake made me take second and third spoonfuls. A chocolate base with mango cheesecake baked to perfection with a mango gel on top. 

Walnut Brownies:- The brownies were made without egg. So for vegetarians, who want their desserts to be free of eggs, don't worry your wishes get true here. 
Although the brownies were a tad bit bitter, adding some more sugar to it should get it to the right path.

Ferrero Rocher Truffle Cake:- The cake looks heavenly. It is topped with ferrero rocher and has a dark truffle sauce inside. This was once again bitter so those of you who really breathe and eat dark chocolate this one is for you.

Oreo nutella mousse cake:- This was another delicious dessert. A chocolate cake base with oreo and nutella mousse on top. This is completely eggless. Decorated with a lot of oreos, this is another dish that should be tried.

Lemon tart:- the tart was something she made for the first time. The lemon curd filling was done really well and the pie/tart shell was really thing. A bit of tweaking and a winner is one it's way.

Red Velvet Cheesecake:- The cheesecake has creamcheese frosting. Some icing sugar needs to be added while making the frosting cut out the sour taste of cream cheese. The taste of the  cake was lost because of the frosting.

Irish cake:- This was the last item that we had tasted. The cake was made with Irish whiskey and the sauce on top was with Irish whiskey and cream. With round chocolate discs on side this was another pretty cake with perfect taste of whiskey.

I wish Suchantika all the very best. May her business flourish really well.

Tasted quite a few of the cakes made by this newly minted home-baker today. Of them, I was enthralled by their mango cheesecake the most. Though i am not the biggest lover of the much famed king of fruits, this dessert struck a chord with me for sure. The dark crumb base and the fresh mango gel on top were both of the perfect texture. 

The Irish Cake with tempered chocolate discs around it was a great one too, very unique and had the right hit of liquor. What I liked about the desserts were that they weren't too sweet. In fact, I quite liked their Red Velvet Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting too, though some may find it not sweet enough.

I was searching for a different type of cake on my husband's birthday and when the 'Big' cake bakers turned me down saying that 1 lb is too small to show their Magic, Cake Counter came to my rescue. I had a discussion with the owner and she suggested me a few options. From that I selected Red Velvet Cheesecake which is one of my favourites. She was really warm and humble. Being a wife herself she understood my thought if surprising my husband and delivered the cake right on time.
The cake was delicious to say the least and made to perfection along with its decoration. She had send me pictures before she started preparing it and the end product looked exactly ditto of what she has offered. I was a little sceptical about the taste, but when at 12 o'clock we cut the cake and had it... oh my God.. we just loved it. My husband loved it a lot and we ate almost half of it right there.
The taste of the cheesy cream was really mouth watering. I so wish I had ordered 2 lbs. I will suggest this place to all my friends and I am sure gonna order again.

It was moms birthday, and I needed a cheesecake for her. Zomato showed me the cake counter was the nearest option. I called them up and the lady on the other was side was extremely warm, I got my delivery as promised right on time. The cheesecake was yummy, tasted perfect with the right amount of sweet. The only drawback was the mango on top turned black on delivery. Way to go the cake counter :)

Being a tough customer to please, with high exacting standards and a very sweet tooth, I get extremely judgmental when it comes to cakes. 
The Cake Counter took in an order for a custom cake to be made at 11am for a party to start at 7pm. And once the cake had appeared  and was cut, everyone was bowled over. Wonderful taste, beautifully designed, expert communication. 

I highly recommend The Cake Counter to everyone. It's exactly what you would expect from a proper, professional, expert cake shop.

Taste of the cake is awesome and nice decoration. The quality and freshness can be well felt from its taste. Good value for money. I would definitely prefer it over other cake shops.

This was my first interaction with a home-baker and the experience was really great. 
Ordered a red velvet truffle cake for my sister's birthday.
Presentation: 4/5.
The cake was pretty decently decorated and looked appealing. However this could have been slightly better. 
Freshness: 5/5
It was really fresh as she baked it the morning the order was received. 
Taste: 4.5/5 
Great taste. Really soft and chocolatey. Everyone loved it! 
Overall, I'm pretty satisfied. Will re-order and recommend to friends and family!

The cakes were fresh baked, moderately priced & customized as I demanded. Loved the taste. Santoshpur area must have more customizable bakery outlet.

Full marks to The Cake Counter. Cup cakes, tarts & tiramisu were very tasty. I was tired of usual cake stores, but I kind of loved what I ordered.Â 
I came to know that cake counter will arrange classes soon. My wife will be super excited to join. Â Cheers to Cake Counter!!

As recommended by my friend, I ordered Red Velvet for my 15th marriage anniversary. The cake was beautiful, tasty & a value for every penny. The only problem is they don't have an outlet, else could have given a run to other competitors.Â 
I will surly recommend your cakes to my office, family & friends. Thank you.

Definitely one of the best cup cakes served in Kolkata. Their USP according to me is the bread which automatically dissolves when you take that bite. Additionally, if you wish to customise your order do let them know..they will justify your money's worth.

The cheese cake which they offer in the menu is to die for! Really good, rich in flavour, light and simple. They have other varieties of cakes as well which I would prefer in my next order. Overall the service is also efficient and attentive.

My friend brought this cake from where he stays. In Garfa, we don't have many options apart from the usual bakery outlets, which are found in & around the city.
We had Black forest, tasted very good. It was fresh & dedicatedly made, which marked the difference from other cake shops. I will surly explore more surprises in their kitty.

I ordered a birthday cake for my son who is 9 years old. The cake was the best thing that happened on that day. The rainbow cake was delicious & the presentation was fantastic. I finally found an expert in Santoshpur who would satisfy your sweet-tooth. Thank you madam.
