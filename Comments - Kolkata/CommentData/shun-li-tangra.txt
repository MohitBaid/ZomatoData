Visited the place sometime back. I didn't like much of the interior or the sitting arrangements. We ordered for sweet corn soup and crispy chili baby corn as starters. The food came up quick but the staff was lethargic to serve it. We helped ourselves. We ordered for mixed fired rice and Shanghai chicken. The chicken disappointed me. It had too many nuts and they weren't cooked well. The rice was good. The staff were not well behaved. The food quality can be improved and the staff should be directed to behave properly with people.

The food is a bit overprint but the ambience and decor are upto the mark. Specially their big and round tables are unique and wonderful. Went there with a big group and enjoyed a lot. Perfect for friends group parties but they don't accept card payments

Location is in the interiors of the Chinese colony of topsia,tangra.
Went there on a tuesday afternoon.
A lady guided us to the restaurant on the ground floor.Not much spacious.Did not visited upstairs as it was not ready at that time.
Well,quality of food is average.Not extraordinary.
But definitely pocket friendly.
Good place to hangout with groups of boys.
As drinks are economical here.I mean Pocket friendly.
Service is not good though.
May not be a safe place for ladies.This is my sole feeling as i did faced some unhealthy people in the locality.that too at 2pm noon on a hot n humid day.
Thats the thing which is making this area a backward one.

Me and my friend went last night as I saw good reviews for this restaurant on Zomato..But our experience was extremely disastrous..The sitting arrangements was disappointing as the drinkers and the families was sitting in same place..A small kid was eating with his parents n there the whole gang of drinkers was also there drinking and eating....They should make  separate arrangements for the men and the families. we ordered dry chili chicken but that chili chicken was tasteless and too oily...

A family run place where the manager just goes wild.
Even if you go alone there he will entertain you by way of his service.

For food chilli garlic pepper chicken was a good pic.
The masala peanuts was bad.
The Shanghai chicken too was very average.

Service too needs to improve as sometimes the chicken comes before the peanuts and the next time the chicken comes after all drinks are over.

Well...to be very honest what comes in your plate is very tasty. What comes in your glass is also quite cheap. Ambience is very good with warm lighting and with the owner always at your arm's length you will never have to worry about anything. Also, at this very moment, you will not find any other joint cheaper than this in the vicinity. 

P.S: Try out their dry chilli chicken.

Amazing little place in china town. Their signature and best dish by far according to me is the chilli garlic pepper chicken. The soft tenderness and the impeccable marinating gives the chicken a very authentic taste and the fine seasoning makes it an amazing dish. Their hot  sour soup is also very good. Relatively cheap booze and separate family seating sections makes this place a must visit.

The reason I'm giving this rating is cuz of the amazingly warm staff and yes ofcourse the food. 
A couple of drunk men sat across the table, making us uncomfortable with their stares. 
Upon wanting to leave the place cuz of it the woman (presumably the owner) chided them and the server comforted us and assured us we are safe. 
The quantities are huge (a medium soup is large enough for a group of 4-5 easily-- I wonder how much will the large bowl will serve) and prices unbelievably affordable. 

Went in their cuz the neighborhood restaurant kafulok was closed, and thank god it was!

The little kid trying to steal the thumps up from the fridge was a heartstealer too, adding to the amazingly warm experience. 
Cannot wait to return :)

Shun Li is a 32 year old family run restaurant located near the Chinese Kali mandir in Tangra Chinatown. It is in the same lane as Kim Fa. As you enter, the owner, Matthew, who looks like Laughing Buddha ðŸ˜ƒ (it's a compliment), greets you himself. It's a nice affordable place which serves great food and drinks (both soft and hard). The food is great and authentic Chinese as it's prepared by a Chinese family like all of Tangra, I suppose. Not spicy I might add and different than what you would get elsewhere in India. They also have a variety of dishes available for the vegetarians. The portions are big and if you are alone, you should order medium or small and even that will be too much. The prices are lower than the posh Chinese restaurants as the layout is very basic. But the food was very  good and that's all that a foodie wants. The place serves both families and bachelors, together and separately. A big plus point is a big parking space in front of the restaurant. Only negative points were that the AC wasn't very effective and the delivery time is slow because the place is understaffed. But overall  good value for money. My recommendation. - Akash, New Delhi

After having lived away from Kolkata for a decade, Tangra was on the top of the priority list when I arrived in CCU. 

Drifted in to Shun Li, after being rejected by Kim Fa, only to be greeted by the smiling, jolly owner who immediately hooked us up with a table and the menu. I went there with my parents and aunt and uncle and we had already reached the point of "Hangryness". 

The warm greeting by the owner, the spic and span ambience, followed by quick service and piping hot Chinese food was a great experience. The Garlic Prawns was delicious. The Manchurian and Mei Foon could be better. And I'm sure it will be. The Jolly Fellow is bound to look into it. 

Will I visit again? Yes! It's very rare that the restaurant owner familiarises himself with you and pays attention to your gastronomic experience. And the food, overall, was pretty darn good.

We were in seek of cheap places in china town this evening and with the help of zomato, we stopped the car at Shun Li...the place is located at very interior of china town crossing big boss, flora, evergreen. At first look, it would give you a feel good factor as the space is huge with car parking. Mostly run by chinese family, the place is segregated into two parts - family and general. We were given a seat in the family as the general section was full. We ordered for one beer (kingfisher ultra) and one chicken with vegetables. And after this tge most irritating part started. Almost after 15 minutes the beer was not served, upon asking the china old man responded that the beer has been just put inside the fridge....Dude! Seriously??
The food also took quite a long time to be served and the taste was not mention worthy. Overall my experience wasn't that good. Few good points for boozers -
1. Bottles allowed
2. Smoking allowed in the general section
3. Price is cheap compared to other china town restaurants.

China Town the very name envisions an array of Chinese restaurants comprising a neighbourhood..and choosing from that array could be really difficult..

Been to a lot of Restaurants before in China Town,Tangra and somehow dint pay much heed to this one before..

One Hot afternoon we landed up in this old restaurant and it was closed...The moment we arrived we were greeted by a wonderful cheery lady who opened the restaurant for us and we felt at home at oncee...

The ambiance is very average and nothing noteworthy..

What won my heart was the food and the behaviour of the people serving was..

The food is amazing and so is the quantity..

Their Prawn dishes are the best...its too good...

Pricing is great as well...

We tried noodles ,rice ,prawn chicken...many variants..and was not disappointed by any..

Will definitely be back sometime else..

Horrible ambiance !!! Â but surprisingly Â Good Â food !! ,Â 

is how Â shun li should be summed up Â .

In fact , Â if you go by looks Â alone , then probably even a roadside dhaba has better ambiance . ( Check out yourself if you don't believe me !! )
Â Â 
Coming to food , quantity Â is good Â but Â so is the price ( on the higher side )

Alcohol prices however are moderate & that Â deceives many into believing that Shun li is affordable ( In fact it is NOT Â )

Noodles costs rs 160 upwards Â & any filling Â non veg side dish ( HALF PLATE EVEN ) will set you back by 200 bucks !!!! . Â Even if i consider that HALF PLATE Â will have 6-8 pieces , the size of the pieces , will make one forget the word Â " Affordable ".

Coming to Â my Â experience Â , i went there , with Â a colleague of mine Â , this sunday Â for lunch . Â given it's high reputation , the ambiance disappointed us . However the taste of the food Â is the only reason i gave shunli a 3 / 5 .Â 

we ordered Â HALF PLATE fried prawn ( SMALL Â ) Â  & Â HALF PLATE Â fried Â  Button Mushroom Â in starters .

the Â Fried Â prawn Â had Â 9-12 pieces Â ( so small That i would call them shrimps Â ) . Â It tasted good , But Â nothing Â like the golden Fried Â prawns we are used Â to .Â 
The fried mushroom Â was Â a total letdown Â , as it was way too salty Â & overfried Â .

we Â had also ordered Â  2 & 1/2 Â pegs Â of Â Old Monk Rum along with Â 3 thums up Â , to go along with the starters Â .

half way into our drinks , we opted Â for another Â dish Â . Â It was Â a Â HALF PLATE , pepper Â fried Â fish . Taste wise it was not bad ( good to be honest ) but had only 10 small Â dices , pricey when Â i consider Â that Â  Â i am paying 230 bucks + tax Â for Â it Â .

No complaints Â on the taste Â front , but the Â Price to ambiance ratio Â , ensured Â that we Â didn't go for the main course .

Coming to the Â bill Â it Â came rs Â 932 Â ( without main Course Mind Â you !! ) . The cost break up Â is given below . Â Don't know about Â others Â , But I Â am not going back Â .Â 

Thanks !!Â 

Here's the bill Summary ( food First )

HALF PLATE fried Prawn ( small ) Â  Â  Â  Rs 225Â 
HALF PLATE fried button Mushroom Â Rs 145
HALF PLAte Fried Â pepper fish Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Rs 230
3 thumbs up ( 24 X 3 ) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Rs 72Â 
----------------------------------------------------------
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Rs 672 + 14.5% VAT + 5.6% Â S. Tax
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  =Rs 807 + Rs 125 ( 2 & half peg Old Monk )Â 
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  = Rs 932 Â ( Rounded off )Â 

Decide for yourself Â !!! All the best !!

Well Suan Li.. Its my first visit to this not so well known restaurant in China Town. The ambience is below average and I found only one person serving all the customers. Coming to food, its quite good to taste. We tried Pepper Chicken, Chicken with Vegetables(boneless), Rice Noodles, Garlic Chicken. Everything seemed well until a gang of people(seemed to be a family of their community) who were sitting next to us started banging the table like they will break the table in a moment nd started shouting at the top of the voice. Suddenly they came to our table bangged on the table nd threw the glass off on our table abused us nd they claimed that our "so called loud voices are irritating them". I have visited quite a large number of restaurants from 7 star, 5 star to no star but never ever xperienced such a disturbing disgusting situation.. They behaved liked illiterate hooligans nd the Restaurant owner remained quite during the whole scene.. Every customer present felt really disgusted. Btw I visited with my frndz nd family. This is the reason I wont recommend this restaurant. A big NO fr me. Rate: 1

Shun Li is located next to Kim Fa often overshadowed by popularity of later. The ambiance is very basic of an eating house. Ground floor is for family with 4-5 tables while first floor larger in size for stags. We opted for take away though.

In starters we had Chili Chicken Boneless and Pepper Fish. Both were at par to Tangra cooking style but I prefer fish as chicken was a bit fibrous. Half portion has 10 pieces while full portion has 18 pieces.

In main course we had Philippine Chicken Boneless with Chicken Prawn Fried Rice. The chicken side dish a bit tangy, sour, chili made a mysterious combination. Fried Rice was the winner for the day. It was loaded with large prawns and large shavings of chicken.

They accept card here. Total bill was around INR 800 inclusive all. Ignore ambiance I will recommend the same if you find Kim Fa is full.

The staff were extremely friendly and courteous, the owner/manager especially so. A small but homely atmoshphere with very reasonable rates for liquor. The main objective was to have a couple of drinks and hang out, so didnt order too much food, but to be absolutely honest, the Chili Chicken we ordered was slightly underwhelming.
However, overall it was a pretty nice evening spent hanging out with friends.

with some benches..food quality is very good...try chilly chicken with bone or chilly garlic pepper chicken with bone..those are the best...you can try some rice noodle..and thy soup is the must..and i would say best in kolkata

Shun Li is located next to Kim Fa often overshadowed by popularity of later. The ambiance is very basic of an eating house. Ground floor is for family with 4-5 tables while first floor larger in size for stags. We opted for take away though.

In starters we had Chili Chicken Boneless and Pepper Fish. Both were at par to Tangra cooking style but I prefer fish as chicken was a bit fibrous. Half portion has 10 pieces while full portion has 18 pieces.

In main course we had Philippine Chicken Boneless with Chicken Prawn Fried Rice. The chicken side dish a bit tangy, sour, chili made a mysterious combination. Fried Rice was the winner for the day. It was loaded with large prawns and large shavings of chicken.

They accept card here. Total bill was around INR 800 inclusive all. Ignore ambiance I will recommend the same if you find Kim Fa is full.

The staff were extremely friendly and courteous, the owner/manager especially so. A small but homely atmoshphere with very reasonable rates for liquor. The main objective was to have a couple of drinks and hang out, so didnt order too much food, but to be absolutely honest, the Chili Chicken we ordered was slightly underwhelming.
However, overall it was a pretty nice evening spent hanging out with friends.

The best place in tyangra undoubtedly. I have been visiting tyangra which many people call china town for the restaurants and i tried every restaurant and I had to zero in on Shun Li. The food is simply awesome from the Shun Li Special Chow to Chilli Crab to Honey chicken. It is simply awesome and authentic Chinese. If you are looking for very spicy Bengali Chinese stuff then this is not the place but if u really love food then this is for you. Too bad they dont keep pork but the owner Mathew is my friend so he makes it sometimes for me. Just love it and I make sure I visit it atleast twice a month.

Be careful when you visit SHUN LI. The super-smart waiter can take you for a ride.
On yesterday afternoon I visited this joint with my wife and son after reading reviews in Zomato. My experience was as follows :
1. The price was at least 50-60% more than the price mentioned in menu depicted by Zomato.
2. Quality of food is average , but no "HUGE" ness in quantity was noticed , as mentioned by one of the reviewers. Price vs Quantity - makes the price costlier than similar joints elsewhere .
3. Biggest disappointment was OVER-BILLING
4. We were only three - initially ordered one mixed gravy noodle, one hakka noodle amongst other items. Later ordered one mixed fried rice (.... now you can easily draw conclusion on " HUGE" ness in quantity per portion ...). After coming home , I discovered that two portion of mixed gravy noodle was invoiced in place of one. We were the only customers . So this kind of mistake should not happen. The funniest part is , invoice charged additional Rs 10 for "gravy" of mixed gravy noodles.
5. Immediately I tried to contact the given telephone numbers : 40049547 / 23282638...both the numbers are non-existent. 
6. Over-billing penalized me approx Rs 200 ( bill no. 000074 dated 16.10.2014)- in the process I felt cheated.
7. Overall my rating is 2.0/5.0. My decision - No SHUN LI in future.

Food is ok good but the worst service and the fat owners behavior is really bad. The waiters gave me whiskey glasses to drink beer and the fat owner doesn't know how to talk properly. Ambiance is bad to go with family. The crowd is not good. There are other places in Tangra who serve equally good food at same price with a better service.

At first i was not sure about the place and when we arrived there on a Sunday afternoon initially there was no one to attend. But later on a waiter came to take our orders. Really liked the Philippines chicken, half of a side dish was about enough for two persons. Although the looks of the place don't impress on first sight, the food is really good, and the place is worth visiting just for that.

Okay, the biggest reason for me to give Shun Li 4.5/5 is probably because I love the lady who I meet every time I come here, a gracious soul who constantly updates me about what is fresh, what will taste great, and what will be perfectly season-friendly. Every time I took her advice, I ended up eating something nice. I was sort of upset when on a recent visit I did not see her. However, between the five of us, we demolished the following - 

1. Prawn Chips - light, not oily, tasty, disappeared within seconds. 
2. Pepper Fish - amazing. 
3. Chilli Chicken Boneless (dry) - Gone in 60 seconds 
4. Mixed Noodles - HUGE QUANTITY. had to pack some home because between the five of us we could not finish two plates. 
5. Garlic Chicken - great paired with the noodles. Finished this very thoroughly.

Our bill... along with a good bit of booze, for 5 people, came to under 2500/- ... well, lets just say we will be back, Shun Li.
