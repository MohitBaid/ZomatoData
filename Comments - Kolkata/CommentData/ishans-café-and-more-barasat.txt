Ordered a mixed noodles, a Thai chicken and a Hongkong chicken. Quantity was enough. The taste also turned out to be pretty good. The noodles had ample amount of prawn, chicken and mushrooms. The Hongkong chicken was also very well cooked with mushrooms garnished on a very attractive way. Thai chicken was the starter and helped us cleans the palate in a good way. Located in the lane beside Kalikrishna school, this cafe did make us happy with the low price and good food with ample quantity and that too so far from Kolkata.
Will definitely visit again if in the area.

My best friend and I want to this Cafe to have our lunch after watching movie at Jaya.

Location: near Barasat municipality.

Decorations: Place is well decorated but space is littile much short. We ordered as a main dish chicken Biriyani, Mixed Friedrice, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala.

Chicken Biryani- It was a really very good and have a different taste.. This Ishan's cafe spcl biriyani will always have a special place in my heart..

Mixed Friedrice- It was also a testy dish.

Chicken Tikka Butter Masala- Really we were confused which we ordered as a side dish for this previous oredered dish.. But finally oredered this dish and I thought it will be a normal dish one just like that but reallyyy it was a bliss. Little much chilli type of dish.. But each bites sent all smile of stimuli to cerebrum.
Btw it is one of my old restaurants but Ishans cafe get never old.

Service: Through the stuffs were very gently and helpful.

Overall I was satisfied with the main dishes and service also and I would love to recommend this place to my others friends.
