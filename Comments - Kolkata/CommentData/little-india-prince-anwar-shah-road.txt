A small neat & clean restaurant located right at Lords more. 5 of us went there for Sunday dinner as it located quite close to my place.
Nothing much to talk about the ambiance.
Well mannered staff, though service is a bit slow.
What we ordered-
Palak paneer
Chicken bharta
Chilli chicken
Tandoori roti
Butter naan
Food was good.. except for the tandoori roti which was too dry & hard. Quantity for each plate is okayish for 2 people. Good part is they still don't charge tax!
Overall, a good experience!
Happy eating üôÇ

It was one of those sudden plans when we decided to try out this restaurant. Rated at 3.1 we were initially a bit apprehensive. It is a small place. To our surprise the food was quite good. My mom wanted to have kebabs so we ordered chicken hariyali kebab for starters. The kebabs were very well cooked and everything was perfect about it. My parents had chicken biriyani and later said that it was quite good. The rest of us went for chinese. We ordered chicken fried rice and a side dish of schezwan chicken. The rice was so simple yet it was very tasty. The shezwan chicken was not bad as well. So It was quite good an experience. The management should see this review. One small suggestion is that work on the fresh lime soda. Anyway cheers to the team.

Ordered Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani, Mutton Hyderabadi Biryani & Machhi Makhmali from swiggy and wasted our dinner. Coming to food -¬†

1. Machhi Makhmali - Under cooked Fish chunks covered with burnt Omelet. ¬†None of them can be eaten simply.¬†

2. Hyderabadi Biryani : They should know by adding chili & mint Kolkata Biryani will never convert into Hyderabadi Biryani. They should visit #Aminia once. Chicken & Mutton pieces are hard to chew. Even small shops at Lords more will serve you better pieces of Chicken & Mutton with Biryani within Rs.100/-.

Totally waste of Dinner & money. Will never order from here for sure.

Yesterday we (me & my g.f) went to this restaurant, which is located close to her house, so for the first time we opt out for this restro with expectation, and were pretty happy after having meal their. We ordered sweet & sour chicken, and mixed chilli garlic noodles, they took merely 15 minutes to serve the food, which made us happy as we didn't had much time, and coming the food, it was lovely, the taste of the chicken item was auspicious. But i found the restro authority much irrespnsible as they didin't inform us about the events that are going on, that's why i have deducted 1&half marks.¬†
FOOD QUALITY- 4
FOOD QUANTITY-5
INFORMATIVE-1
STAFF BEHAVIOUR-3

That's all, i would like to share that opt out for the restaurant for the tasty food they serve, worth your money.

Been here sometime back but didn't give review at that time. Today got a home delivery from here and hence the review. Situated in lords more, lake garden this little shop is rightly named. They serve the exact comfort food for indians that is Indian Chinese. I had a chilli garlic noodles and pepper chicken. The quantity they cater is huge and is more than enough for 2 people. The chilli garlic noodles was okay as I was expecting little more spices. The real surprise was the pepper chicken - delicious tender chicken pieces packed with flavours and spices. All this comes at a nominal price. So yep good place to tame your immediate hunger.

This is a small joint at Lords, Lake gardens. Visited today & took 2 packs of mutton biriyani home for dinner. 
              
The interior is simple. Staffs are helpful & friendly. The Hyderabadi mutton biriyani tasted average to me. But the quantity was more than enough. So, an average rating: 3/5

I love the food from here. I ¬†have tried both indian and chinese.It is yummy.
As it is very near to my house ¬†i order regularly from here.Quantity and quality both are good and it is pocket friendly too. Most of the times we have ordered chinese so was a little skeptical on ordering indian gravies last week.But the paneer butter masala and the chicken bharta both were very tasty. My friends came over for lunch and with plain rice it tasted awesome. Am planning to order something again tonight :)

On an Ashtami eve when you are famished, this place was a welcoming relief coz we got seats immediately. Not very high on decor,but pretty much neat & clean. We had ordered kebabs, tandoori chicken & biriyani, and amazing part, we were served our food pretty fast. The mutton was juicy,something which you don't get often. The quality & quantity both were quite good. Although,the biriyani rice could have been a little warmer but given the fact that there was huge rush yesterday, it was negligible. Extremely pocket friendly place and you can definitely give your budday treat to your friends without fear of being broke!

The Little India. It's located near Lords More which is near Prince Anwer Shah Road and also near South City Mall. The shop is in the first and the second floor. The third floor is mainly a banquet hall.  
Me and some of my friend went to this shop for our lunch and ordered Biryani and other two chicken starter. The quality of the food was not much extra ordinary. The price is relevant to the quality. But I think at this price many restaurants serves better food.

The sweet n sour chicken was too sweet to my liking, so there is room for improvement there. The Chicken fried rice was satisfactory. In all honesty I would have to say that it was a 3 on 5 experience for me. Half points more for quick delivery. Thank you for your service.

A long hiatus! Unlike my previous reviews, this won't be long. Little India, little review. Although in past I ordered for home delivery from this small restaurant in my locality, but last Thursday we decided to go there and have a look. Experience from home delivery was nice hence thought no disappointment. Very small restaurant. No special mention about interior. Rectangle shaped. We ordered two types of chicken kebabs. Murg Parda kebab & Murg Lasuni Kebab. Both are good. They took almost half n hour to serve first dish. That was pretty irritating. Anyways, in main course four types of Indian bread (Butter Naan, Garlic Naan, Masala Kulcha & Keema Naan). All are good. Two chicken main course-chicken Reshmi butter masala & chicken bharta are delicious. As far as food taste is concerned you won't be disappointed keeping in view of price tag. But better order the food from home. One obvious pocket friendly surprise at the end in dining in! Won't reveal here. Explore yourself!

I went for home delivery for myself.  Ordered one chicken tikka butter masala, laccha paratha and a keema naan.

The chicken butter masala was very good..they gave 6 pieces of chicken and the gravy was tasted very good. Quantity was too much for one person. I could finish 4 chicken pieces, keema nan and bit of laccha paratha. The paratha was a disappointment as the layers of laccha paratha were not properly folded. The dough was also that of nan. they gave a piece of onion ad some achar with it.. service was quick.. Its a real value for money at Rs280/- infact the food is enough for two.. I will keep exploring this restaurant for more categories.

Dropped in here today afternoon. The restaurant was empty. We were the only people throughout. The restaurant has got a nice ambience. Cozy chairs, Hindi soft music in the background. :D
Now, the food. We had drums of heaven for starters. Nothing extraordinary. Have had better. Next was the 'mixed' Singapore rice.
I couldn't understand what they meant by mixed. It had mushrooms, baby corn, bell peppers and egg in it. The only dish that was really tasty was the fish in hot garlic sauce. 8 succulent big chunks of fish in a very tasty gravy. Nevertheless, the staff were really nice and served really well.

We frequently order food from this joint and never had been disappointed. The best quality about this place is the quality of their raw items which are top grade. Cooking is also very good with a dedicated and clean kitchen on a separate floor. The staff is cordial and helping. Delivery is always prompt.¬†
Visit this place if you are in the vicinity of Lords bakery crossing or order from home if you live in the area. You will never regret that.

Went there thinking it to be a decent restaurant. Ordered chicken lung fung soup which was served with a mixture of chopped prawns and chicken. When showed they changed the order but it was not expected for a restaurant to mix chicken with finely chopped prawns and serve a soup that that tasted awefully bad. Henceforth didn't order anything else and decided to leave. When I asked for the bill, they provided me with a white paper handwritten bill that had no mention of the restaurant anywhere, and to my surprise had charged VAT on such a bill copy. I asked the waiter to change the bill and provide e with an auto generated invoice that can legally charge VAT. The owner however said that they charge VAT on such bills and I need to pay it. When I questioned him back logically he got agitated and said that you pay the amount excluding VAT and I hope that I don't visit the restaurant anymore. Is this how you run a restaurant wherein you ask your customers not to visit them when they enquire about wrongfully charged taxes? Wow! It's simply awesome on how people fool customers on a daily basis and do business out of it. I would recommend not to visit such a restaurant that does not have any sort of respect for their customers and that does illegal transactions openly. Disgusting! in one word both the owner and its restaurant.

Went to this place with a group of 7 friends. We had tried mixed biryani. It had 1 egg & 2 chicken pieces. There was raita along with it. The food quality was nice. The raita was superb as well. Ambience is so-so. But the thing which disappointed us was the late service. We waited for at least an hour till we almost lost our appetite and fortunately enough we were served within that day. The happy hours offer is quite nice. I would like to visit this place again only if i have enough time at hand. I would be really grateful if the service improves.

Ordered Hyderabadi biriyani via foodpanda from here.. Biriyani was too spicy & full of unnecessary amount of chillies.. 3diff types of chillies including black pepper.. Were you guys out of your mind while preparing d food? If u even talk about hyderabadi biriyani.. It doesn't provide potato as well which u did.. Which Hyderabad you signified here I am totally unsure abt that.. No spoons provided & delivery boy ends up saying that foodpanda should provide option for adding spoons wjcih means an additional cost.. How ridiculous is that?? Good food prepared in a horribly wrong way..

Never knew there was such an awesome restaurant at Lords More. Recently visited this place on Christmas Eve. First things first, the staff is really praiseworthy, they are not only cooperative but also very polite and courteous. Ambience is quite cosy and a good place either for friends hangout or an ideal date. The menu offers quite a lot of varieties but I opted for Chinese dishes. I ordered Manchow soup,Cantonese noodles(gravy) and pan fried chicken. For dessert they recommended their Christmas special chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and I can't deny the fact that they really helped us made the right choices.
Taste,quantity, quality and garnishing 'Little India' excels in all aspects.
I would love to advice all my foodie friends to check out this awesome place!

Little India is truly very LITTLE! :) Satisfactory, if not perfect, the casual dining restaurant isn't too expensive and neither is it too fansy. Working on the lines of 'Simplicity is a Blessing', the food joint will do what its made for-simply give you food, and thats it. I went with a group of friends and ordered quite a bit, and naturally we knew that our order would take time, but 45 minutes is a little TOO much (enough to make youngsters hungrier and angrier!) However once the food was served, it lifted our mood a bit. There was no Chinese available, so we ordered Indian, it wasnt a problem, but maybe we expected the Dishes and the food not to be SO LITTLE in amount! The Dal Makhni was good, and so was the Paneer. The Chicken Biriyani, was ordered thrice, so I guess it was good. The yellow dal was cooked in a lovely Bengali manner, with small onion bits and smelled JUST the way it should! The Masala Kulcha and the Laccha Paratha were quite good and soft, but the Garlic Naan didnt appeal to my taste buds at all. Moreover, i wish the food was served HOT,instead of being placed on a nearby table. i really wish the service was faster and the waiters more friendly. The music of the place was very interesting though, at one point Udit Narayan and the next Beyonce! :D 
Little India is a nice place, with a HUGE scope of improvement! and maybe they should change 'Darshan' into Darsaan for avoiding comic moments- or maybe not? :D

The food was nice.. But their services are not proper.. The restaurant is more or less simple and air conditioned. I would only prefer this restaurant to people having a budget less than ‚Çπ250

So after a long tiring puja hopping i could manage to get a place in my pockets. A pretty average place. Well I visited the this place during puja so I was not  served with full menu course. Tasted the dal makhani, chicken reshmi tikka masala. Well truely the gravy of the chicken masala was not upto the mark. Masala kulcha was good.  There after the ambience was so so. If the budget is too low on pockets & you are in prince anwar shah road. Visit that place.

Little India is bang opposite my house, and I have been there several times.
The food here is good and value for money. The portion size and quantity is excellent.

Now, taste wise the food here is great, but a few dishes stand out like - Crispy Chili Babycorn, Crispy Fish in Lemon Coriander Sauce, Assorted Kebab Platter, Machhi Makmali, Fish Lahori.
The mixed Fried Rice and Noodles have generous amount of egg, chicken and shrimps. The Biriyani is a bit on the oily side. Gulab Jamun which they claim to make in-house is served hot and is quite nice. Also the Caramel Pudding is good.
The ambience is homely and clean with the windows giving a nice view of the road below. The service is good and the waiters are well groomed.
I have ordered home delivery from Little India a couple of times and was rather satisfied with the experience.
Summing up, it's a good option if you are looking for a budget friendly restaurant.

Nice 'little' place indeed. Though the drab lights and lackluster decorations impart a tiresome feeling. We received a cordial welcome from the stuffs. We were asked to order some kebabs as it is their speciality and it turned out to be quite palatable. Taking everything in account i would like to say i had a good visit and will visit again.

Little india is a new restaurant in the Lake gardens area with so much competition around. I have ordered take away from here so have nothing to say about the ambience. But the food is really good. The murg pardah kebab is outstanding. The chicken bharta and mix veg are good too. Prices are really cheap. They serve chinese too.

Went to this place yesterday for having dinner....amibience is quite good and the place is very brightly lighted up...though the space is not adequate for the no.of tables they have put in...The quality of the food was decent enough especially the pan fried chicken, which was the pick of the items. However, the place is very costly considering the overall quality of the restaurant like food quality,space,etc..i would say that this place is extremely over priced and the value for money is not that satisfactory...the money they charge would be good enough for having a dinner/lunch at a much better place..but for a one time visit the place is good enough.

Its beside the auto rickshaw stand nd aside the rickshaw stand at lords more, from where the bazar starts.
The ground floor has some ladies tailoring unit. The restaurant is on the 1st floor nd 2nd floor. They have nice arrangements. Well my favourite in the 1st floor is the sofa at the furthest. The view is awesome through the glass wall when it rains. The service men r very nice nd helpful. They take no service tax at all! The price range is also pocket friendly. Soon they r going to start happy hours system from 1st July. From 3pm to 7pm. As they told me through a call from their side.
My favourites here are Pepper fish, Pepper chicken and Mandarin fish. The fish was previously bhetki but now its Basa. But the taste is awesome! U will also love the smooth taste of the kawabs nd tandoori over here. They make perfect noodles! It's like perfect blend of the spices nd veggies! I love the mixd chow hakka. Mixed fried rice is also good. Their Chinese dishes r somehow beta than the Indian ones. But Indian dishes aren't bad at all! They make all sorts of dishes nice overall..
Apparently there isn't any cons as such.

This is a relatively new restaurant in the Lord's More which already is filled with multiple food joints. So, to excel in this region you have to be really good which Little India can proudly say they are. 
So when I first visited this place I was not expecting much to be honest but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food they serve. 
I have tried their both the Indian and Chinese delicacies, though both of them were pretty good, I would still say the Indian dishes slightly edge past the Chinese counterparts. 
Simply loved their kebabs and chicken peshawari (which was included in the menu as a special occasion item, not sure if they serve it or not). 
If any one from the management is reading, then I would ask them to include that chicken peshawari in their menu if not added. 
Recommended.

A pretty average looking place, good food, good staff. The interiors did not impress me, the papers, napkins, dish and everything that was there looked old! However, the staff is sweet and tried their best to serve perfectly :)

We ordered fresh lime soda, lung fung soup, crispy fish in lemon coriander sauce and mixed noodles cantonese style.
The fresh lime was average. I loved the soup though. Although everything looks a little shabby here, the food is good. The noodles were crisp and perfect! Had enough prawns and chicken and I had no complains. The fish was not too bad as well.

Could be tried :)

We ordered a veg kolhapuri, which was a far cry from the authentic kolhapuri cuisine. The soup was okay, the kadhai chicken was awesome. The pricing is okayish.  Overall experience was good.

and if i add up my previous experiences-- plz try their kebabs guys... really delicious kebabs ( i mostly tried the chicken ones), Chinese dishes are also nice....

what's ironic about little india is that it serves delectable chinese fare... and although i haven't tried the indian dishes here, i did catch a glimpse and a whiff of the biryani being served to the couple next to us, and it seemed quite commonplace.

the dish to have here is the tempura prawn... the batter is light and fluffy and doesn't take anything away from the freshness of the prawn, which remains the hero of the dish... the singapore fried rice looks beautiful but is ever so slightly insipid, but extremely aromatic, and still quite a mouthful given the delicious mix of toppings. for  my side i had the hunan chicken, which had a delicate balance of flavours and lingered on the palate very subtly long after the meal was over... 

the atmosphere is homely and the service is extremely courteous... the only flaw i found was that they served us warm pepsi after we were done with the meal, which left a bad aftertaste... the unavailability of cold drinks should be brought to the guests' notice as soon as they order it, or at the very least, before the drinks are served... but on the balance of things, this error is pardonable...

another point in their favour is that the portions served are huge! one plate of rice might actually be sufficient for three people if you're stuffing up equally on starters and sides... great value for money.

overall, a job well done by the proprietors, who have introduced another contender in a locality where there's plenty of inter-restaurant competition.

This place is very near to my resident. So I tried out prawn tampura , humpty dumpty, chicken chowmein. they all taste really awesome. But the service is too late. It took around 25 mins to prepare the  items. 

Prawn tampura is something new and I loved it.

Another day I tried Tandoor Chicken, Kebab Platter, Chicken Biriyani, Tandoor Orit, Chicken Bharta
