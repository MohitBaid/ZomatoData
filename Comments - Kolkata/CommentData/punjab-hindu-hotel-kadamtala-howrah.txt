Tadka is famous. Rumali rotis and haath rotis are sold at the adjacent shop. Whenever you are there, you will find great smells lingering around you.

Well, to start off, this place coming up on Zomato makes me feel immensely proud since I've been a frequent customer here for the past 5 years or so. 
That long stretch succors me to provide insight into the fact that - even though the place's tawdry, the food here is delectable; and that has been on every single occasion of the 5 year period. 
Safe to say that this is the best place in Howrah if you are looking for biryani with less oil, but extremely tasty at the same time, unstinting quantity, and a very generous pocket-pinch.

The moment you enter the restaurant, you will hate it, considering the location and the ambiance, until you bite through the juicy and tender pieces of meat in the reshmi chicken butter masala or the chicken tikka butter masala. Believe me everyone should try it. I'll suggest you to get a parcel rather than sitting and eating. And the biriyani is another delicacy here. Not to mention the pocket pinch is very much moderate, these guys serve quality with quantity and has been successful in maintaining their signature taste.

It's really great to see this in Zomato! :)
Well, I'd give a duck judging on the decor and atmosphere! But I'd give a 9 out of 10 on the taste!! They really compensate on the taste! The value for money is also good!

Though the infrastructure isnt up to the mark,the food is way too cheap and also pretty good.
The ambience,similar to a dhaba and the crowd is mainly labourers..but a lot of people take food away too.
