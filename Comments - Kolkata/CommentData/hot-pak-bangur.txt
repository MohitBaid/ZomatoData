It was really late and I wanted to pack some food for my family. I found this place open. This is a small restaurant run by a family in the ground floor of their residence. Ordered mix noodles with garlic chicken starters, chilli chicken gravy and a sweet corn chicken soup for myself. I would say this was my first visit and I'm totally pleased. the quantity was perfect according to the price. This place luckily doesn't take any tax. Much pocket friendly place with good food
 Not recommended for dine in as the place is too small and stuffy, but perfect for take away.

This is a very cheap Chinese joint. Provides generous servings. Value for money. But sometimes their standard falls. Which maybe attributed to changes in cooks. Overall a good place for a tight budget.

I visited this place today after almost 4years. Previously the food was quite good at the given price point but all my hopes were shattered today.
I ordered for Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chowmein and Chilli Chicken for dine-in.
The food arrived quite quickly and the quantity at the given price point is commendable. But alas, these are the only plus points I can think of.
The food tasted horribly bitter. The chicken dish was also distasteful.
The food served was also stale most probably as it gave me a sick stomach on returning home.
NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.

Local food joint in Bangur Avenue. However, it's quite old. Do not expect anything fancy. But it can definitely save your day when other options aren't available. Food is okay. Good for take away. Seating option isn't that great. Dimly lit, small area.

I guess this is the Cheapest dine in restaurant in Kolkata but don't ever think to dine in cause it's a restaurant run by a  family and has very less space once it used to be the finest and the only resturant in bangur Avenue but now with loads of other options ppl give this a miss... But is not so great but at such a low price u might find it a good place to hang out with friends. The soup is the specialty here

Except for the noodles and fried rice offered here, nothing is good. The side dishes and gravy dishes are not up to the mark . The chicken portions are 1/4th of their actual size mostly coveted with thick  layers of dough. The flavors and  taste are disastrous. The ambience is to stuffy. The place just wouldn't suit you for having your food there. Better to opt for parcel.

I do not know how have I not noticed this restaurant all this while? But it definitely is a stress reliever of all the non veggies of bangur. Phew! I love chinese and there is this non veg joint in bangur. Cutting it short. Its a very basic joint where food is the priority. Dim lights signify chinese restaurants. Agreed! But I do not know hoe on earth are book shelves finding place. A bit of chinese lanterns would make all the difference to the decor. Well I order for a half plate mixed gravy chowmein and chilli fish. The chilli fish was not available.  So it had to be chilli chicken dry. The gravy chowmein tasted good. However it was not as great as it was supposed to be. But the chilli chicken needs to be really worked out. The smell of the iron wok was missing. Its got this sole homely taste. So cannot call this an authentic chinese food joint. Bt non vegetarians in bangur. You are saved, thank you to food pak.

This place has a lot of childhood memories. Run as a small family this place can win your heart if you love simple and quiet.  The food is quite good and one plate is enough for two people if you are a normal eater. Most importantly this joint is very cheap.

This is an orthodox family owned joint. The home delivery services aren't quite upto the mark but one can have a good meal at a 150-200 rupees budget. The boneless dry chilli chicken has been a ideal part of my weekly meals as a starter since it is right between my home and office location in the locality
