Truth be told, ambience is not great! Very decent actually! Biryani dishes are fabulous! Rolls are terrific as well. I'd advise to never order from here! most of times, the delivered food tastes way worst than what can you have in the restaurant. They have variety though. Even late at night, you can have decent dishes to choose from! The waiters are courteous as well! Sometimes too friendly, but ignoring that won't hurt!

I will not say that this place is great in terms of food or ambiance, but this place is a decent one. An average ambiance with decent food quality. It is one of the oldest food joints in the Lake Town area. You can try Chana Masala, Chicken Roll, and Rumali Roti. And to have a better experience, you might love to call "Mota-Da" for having your order.

I have ordered Chicken Butter Masala (4 pcs) from here via Swiggy. This was my most worst food having experience. Food quality is very poor, very oily, and smells bad. Also as per the price the quantity is very very small. You can see it in the picture as well, the chicken for Rs.150.

Located in lake town, it's one of the oldest fast food joints here. The decor is nothing special with simple sitting arrangement. Though they have an AC yet it never works. We tried fried rice and chilli chicken. The rice was poured with oil, and the taste was average. The chilli chicken tasted as if it was stale and the chicken was extremely dry. The staff is friendly but the food far below average. The prices are high compared to the food quality and quantity.

This is one of the oldest fast food joints in Lake Town Area. Although the management has done some good job with the outlook of the restaurant, but the quality and quantity of food served for the same dishes, have gone considerably south.

I had ordered several times with this restaurant, and here is a summary of my experience:

29-July 2017: Chicken Roll (mostly skin part of the chicken given), Lachcha Paratha (Good), Chicken Bharta (again, chicken skin filled, without some real fibrous chicken pieces in bharta), Chicken Lollipop Full (Perhaps they poured in all the remaining oil into this).

22-July-2017: Rumali Roti (ultra soft, lovely), Chicken butter masala (smelly chicken pieces), Chcken Kabab (Okay).

11-July-2017: Chicken Roll (made with leftover bread), Chicken Butter Masala (Smelly chicken pieces), Aloo Paratha (Awesome! Ohh. It was Aloo Paratha???? Where was the Aloo??? Rs 80 for plain paratha without aloo... hmmm)

20-Jun-2017: Rumali Roti (great as usual), Chicken Bharta (Well prepared), Egg Chcken Roll (smelly chicken pieces)

7-Jun-2017: Veg Fried Rice (Bad quality rice), Dal Fry (One of the best I ever had), Chicken Pakora Boneless (No boneless, I found a lot of tiny bones in there. Be very careful while eating this dish from Mahalaya), Chicken Roll (Again smelly chicken pieces, and mostly chicken skin pieces only, that are boiled, not even fried).

11-May-2017: Chicken Roll (chicken skin pieces, wonder why they put skin pieces in chicken roll that you can't even tear off with your teeth), Dal Fry (very good), Mixed Fried Rice (everything was good except the rice quality).

Being a food critic and enthusiast, living in Lake Town Area, I had seen this restaurant go from strength to strength over the time, standing tall. But, today I can say that this restaurant is surviving ONLY because of its location.

Dropped in for lunch today. They sure no how to feed hungry souls. The rice is of very nice quality and sufficient for 1 person. The basic thali has rice, dal, aloo bhaja, and a sabzi. We took aloo posto and badha kopi with fish head. And along with this we ordered pomfret curry which has 2 pieces in it. 
Loved the taste. Homely flavours and not overly spicy. Hot and delicious. Cost for 2 was 220.

This is a snacks corner located adjacent to the Manasha Mandir bus stop. Recently it has expanded by providing indoor accomodation. So we thought of dropping by. We ordered Rumali roti, Paneer Butter Masala and Tarka fry. The rotis were huge in size. It covered my entire plate(provided a photo below). The paneer butter masala didn't taste good. I felt the paneer to be stale. The tarka was good, but I have tasted better tarkas before. The price is very cheap. That is the only good point. If you can spend a bit more for your meal, its better to avoid this restaurant.

The rolls they serve are never properly fried. The outside of the roll , i have found is always a little under fried.  I have their roti and chana masala from time to time. The chana masala has detoriated a little over the eyes. And the rumali Roti's arent as soft as before. But if you are low on money and high on hunger you can give them a try.

Mahalaya Snacks Corner basking in the self glory of being the oldest in lake town has over the years increased their prices and decreased their standards.¬†
Their snacks and rolls are overpriced and the rest is pocket friendly.
The interior is shabby and mismanaged. They keep their supplies near the 1st table and often disturb the diners to access them. Most of the time they just run out of food, not because they are full to the brim but just because management is crap.
their snacks are tasty and even the lunch menu is decent, rest is bad oily mess.

The staff is friendly and fast.
I would recommend this place for lunch only and probably snacks.

It's an old joint serving evening snacks..located near Jaya cinema hall in lake town. I have tried a number of items here on different occasions. These include Kabiraji, cutlet, mughlai paratha, etc. All the snacks are okayish. This place also serves biryani which never impressed me. Overall, it is good place for evening snacks only.

UPDATE (22/12/17)
Well, for the first time tried 'Chinese' in this place. Chicken noodles and lollipop. Noodles was like the one you find at road side stalls. Lollipop wasn't lollipop at all. Rather it was chicken pakora. Service is also slow. Not at all value for money.

Your choice of restaurants always keep on following a sinusoidal curve based on the money you own. So quite obviously this kind of places will always be in the top in the list of college or school students rather than office people. A very low budget place, not too hygienic, a bit shabby too, service is not that smooth and so is the courtesy of the staffs. However the mixed hakka noodles can be tried without any 2nd thought with any chicken chinese preparation of ur choice.
Location wise this place is very popular as its very near to jaya cinema so ppl can watch movie and drop in here for lunch dinner snacks with a very small hole in pocket..

This place is a landmark in Laketown. It is a very old food joint of I guess 20 years. (?) Earlier it was exclusively the typical para fast food centre with rolls, cutlets, etc. Now they have upgraded it to a restaurant selling main course items and airconditioned. The food is no frills typical Bengali street food. I particularly like their Chicken cutlet and Egg devil. The chicken fillet is very thick and the frying is crisp. Mouthwatering evening snack perfect with coffee. However I once tried their Biriyani and it was anything but biriyani. It was like plain rice with yellow colour and a chicken. I really didn't like the way they cooked it.

Prices are very reasonable and food quality is really great at the same time. Service is quite fast. So, if you wanna give adda with your friends while having good food, but you don't have much cash, drop in at Mahalaya. You'll get variety of food, from Mughlai to Chinese, from snacks to complete bangali bhaat daal.

Mahalaya is nostalgic for any bengali who have resided in this part of Kolkata. It is one of the oldest eating joint in Lake Town area and has been serving us for last few decades. They used to serve chicken and mutton in clay conatiners called Bhaar which gave an earthen flavour to the entire thing. Also their roti & egg tadka were saviours for so many bengalis over the years. They have changed the interiors now and has improved the seating arrangements as well. Overall a good old place to try out some typical dishes available in this part of town.

Mahalaya Snacks Corner is one of the oldest food joints and I have lost count of the number of times I have paid a visit there.Early it was just plain eating restaurant which recently upgraded itself with new decor, air-conditioning (which runs sometimes) and a all new sign board. 

The biggest selling point here is that the price is reasonable (I would not say cheap, at least not now that they raised there prices a bit after the upgradation). The only reason I can think of going there is that they provide you with dishes of all kinds of cuisine - bengali, chinese, moghlai etc in one single restaurant. Otherwise, the quality of food is........ummm.........not upto the mark. Some of the items are good (primarily snacks type items) like cutlet and noodles. Problem is, whether the taste is good or not depends on luck. It has happened  that the same order was really good someday and not at all upto the mark some other day. If you ask me about main course dishes and main stream lunch/dinner, I would avoid having it here. Overall, if you ask me, Laketown now has multiple other options to choose from.
