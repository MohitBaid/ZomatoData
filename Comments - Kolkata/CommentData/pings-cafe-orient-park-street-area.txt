A new place in the city, Ping's has become very popular. We entered and fell in love with the ambience. The cheese mushroom dumplings are to die for and will melt in the mouth. Overall, the food does not disappoint. The service and drinks however are another story altogether. Out of three drinks, two were below average. The service seemed fine till the very end, where an incident ruined our mood and is the reason behind the three star rating. We were in the middle of our meal, with the food and drinks only half finished, when a waiter came to us and asked us to vacate the table as fast as possible as they had reservations. And after this, they decided to charge a 10% service charge. Needless to say, this didn't go down well with us. Service needs Improvement. It is not acceptable to walk up to a customer who is eating and ask them to finish fast. Also, after this,another waiter kept hovering around our table asking us after every five minutes if we needed anything or we were done with the meal.

Nice chirpy ambience, fast and courteous service, starters and dimsums portion size quite small...
The spinach gomai salad was very tasty, edamame was good too...
Really loved the silken tofu and water chestnuts Veg, 
The fresh spinach and mushroom fried rice was sticky rice and was little on the sweeter side....

A bit on the expensive side but the food more than makes up for it. 

With a wonderfully curated menu, this cozy nook has good music to accompany.

Try the stir fried chinese greens and pork skewers. Banoffee pie here was to die for.

Definitely worth a visit.

The place is small but very well done. The menu is vast with good amount of options of vegetarians and non vegetarians. The server's are attentive and the food delicious. The proportions of mains are quite decent.
We had the thai lemongrass cooler, which was the most refreshing drink. 
For starters we had the Philadelphia cream cheese dim sums which is definitely a MUST HAVE, the crystal dim sums which was also pretty good. The raw mango and papaya salad was average. The corn fritters were as you'd expect it light and crunchy.
The mains -lalsa and the khao suey were pretty impressive. Proportions were good too.
The dessert the sticky banan pidding didn't quite watch the expectations after having such a good meal. None the less it was decent.
Overall a must visit joint.

A small place but Insane food and experience. A different ambience, decorated using alcohol bottles and main kitchen utensils. The Philadelphia cream cheese Dumpings are a must try, an innovative dish and a treat to the taste buds. We ordered the water chestnut green veg and garlic rice, chilli noodles, a potato starter, khao Sui and the curries were very good and filling. The desserts are dissapointing and a waste the all the main course and starters are pretty much very good!

So far I would say, this one is the best eating hub in Park Street amidst all the conventional restaurants since it has a cafe vibe along with a healthy food joint.  It's classy and it has a feel good factor. I fell in love with place more so because it had the petite London Christmas feel of a pub cum restaurant with exotic light food. Since, we had to hop to Hard Rock Cafe, Monkey Bar and The Fatty Bao, here's what we ordered for:
1. Mixed Vegetable Gyoza- had the perfect sweetness and spice in what we wanted as pan fried dimsums!
2. Honkong noodles- till date I've never had such a healthy yet exotic noodles with bean sprouts.
3. Stuffed potato with lemon coriander sauce- indeed a totally different flavour.
4. Chocolate hazelnut mahjong with lemon mousse- I was a surprise package. Though am always trying some different dessert this one was class apart. Am surely, gonna come for more dimsums, mains, desserts( red wine poached pear) and the snow flake vodka mixed drink!!

Dinner at pings an hell yeah I was excited! One of the most recent Asian chick place to dine in :) a small place but done up well. We started our meal with the hyped cream cheese dumplings and it did live upto its hype. The water chestnut we had was amazing :) the crispy potatoes was too good. The vegetable dumplings very sad. Our cocktails the Singapore sling and a whisky cocktail which we called for were decent. The corn fritters tasted fine. Starters being the main attraction, we just called for a green Thai curry which was lovely( the menu had option for different rice which they don't serve). The Laska was just like khowseuy, no difference at all... major disappointment. I'm complaining the server looked at us as if were speaking Greek and all he could say is I will pack it up for you. The staffs need some proper training to recommend dishes and deal with customers well. A mixed experience I would call it :)

The dim sums (that's all we managed to have)  were good but the service was terrible.  The management seemed to be busy with some sort of family party and they made us (my dad-in-law who's quite old was with us)  wait for 30 minutes at the bar before they told us that they didn't have a table for us. The staff is also wanting in courtesy.  We finally settled for good old Bar-B-Q.

Lunch on a lazy Sunday winters turned out to be a fantastic affair as we tried this new place near Peter Cat. A well designed and laid out interiors add to the glamor. The food was really awesome, as we were bowled over by the pork skewers for starters and, the minced tenderloin and the sticky rice gave a different succulent taste to it. Also good in taste was the Prawn Fried rice which was nearly identical to the authentic Thai preparations.

The food was really good but the service was horrible. After a friend was seated for almost half an hour the waiter arrived and told her the seat was reserved but somehow they will manage, don't get the point of saying this. It's either reserved or it isn't, and if it is then it should be identified as reserved. A specials menu was placed on the table but when we ordered we were told the specific things are not available on that day but from the next. So on the whole mismanaged and chaotic. But the food was great.

Where Death and Existentialism come to stare at each other and wonder if either would cry first. They say crying can be therapeutic, but not when it leaves a hole in your pocket and your ears. The opening of one such place undoes the good work done by various charity organizations. Trust Kolkata (city of joy) to pander to over hyped places such as Ping's. The service here will take forever, be prepared to spend hours waiting. Quantity of serving is also minimal. The wait for our order was endless. the place was far too loud for my liking. The bill amount was ridiculous. (going through their fb page, noticed rave reviews by family member's of co-owner. While anyone is free to post reviews, kind of speaks volumes about the objectivity and confidence the place draws).

A new feather in d Park Street eateries cap, Pings cafe orient, was not completely an exhilarating experience.. we went there on a Sunday so had to wait for 45 mins for a table.. it was too noisy and the ambience was not too appealing. We sat on d mezzanine floor and it was too clamped up. The service was also disappointing. The staff seemed too bewildered and confused. 
Our entire meal came together! They dint know the difference between d courses. By the time we finished the starters, d main course lost its zest, waiting on d table.  

What we ordered- 
•Sweet corn soup- a normal nice sweet corn soup. 
•corn fritters- bite sized fritters.. crispy and tasty.. the accompanying sauces were really nice. 
•crispy potatoes- will give it a thumbs up 👍
•khowswey- it had the right flavours but could not be relished since it wasn't piping hot! 
•Hakka noodles- this kept our meal going. It was good :) 
•pokchoy and waterchestnut stirfry- very bland. This was recommended by a friend but it was tasteless. 

The food was not bad but wouldn't wanna waste calories over it again. Overall, d experience was not too pleasing. Can give it a miss. 

Thank you :)

Kolkata may have been witness to the rise of Indo Chinese cuisine but now it’s the dawn of multi cuisine restaurants serving dishes from all over Asia. In light of this, New Delhi’s iconic Ping’s Orient opened its doors to Kolkata recently.

Ping's Café Orient is a healthy and wholesome urban Asian Brasserie in Park Street. Bringing freshness and originality to South east Asian street food, Pings Café Orient offers diners an eclectic menu of authentic south East Asian delights, served in the way street food was originally prepared: using farm fresh ingredients, & freshly grounded spices and herbs that bring out the robust flavours of the cuisine. With delicacies from various Asian cuisines, the menu has low-calorie, vegan and gluten-free options, while preserving the authentic goodness of each dish.

The restro does display some quirky décor. From mismatched chairs and hanging lights to lots of mirrors – the place surely exudes a fun and positive vibe.
The highlight of the café is its extensive range of cocktails. We tried the Ping’s Fashioned, Vietnamese Iced Coffee, Hot Toddy and The Jaffa. Honestly if you are looking for some spellbinding cocktails, this is the place to be. Since they don’t use IMFL brands, quality in your drinks is ensured and say goodbye to hangovers!

Having been blown over by the drinks, we never thought food would be able to match the exact same standards. But it came as a pleasant surprise for our taste buds. Unmatched in quality, the dishes here are extremely flavourful and authentic. Some of the starters we had were, Spinach Gomai Salad which is blanched spinach dressed in a savoury nutty sesame sauce, this Japanese Spinach Salad with Sesame Dressing is a healthy veggie side dish that goes well with everything.

Highway Style Water Chest Nuts were juicy and fresh. The coating was similar to that of chilli babycorns, just milder in spice levels.
Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dim Sums are the signature dish of this place and they deserve to be that. I have never had such sumptuous dim sums ever in my life. Filled with cream cheese, these are surely value for money, an epitome of delight. Definitely recommended.
Silken Tofu Bao were absolutely vegan with freshly minced vegetables and tofu. The tofu here though is the best you’ll come across in Kolkata. It literally melts as soon as it enters your mouth. Definitely a high point for me.

For the main course, we had the Penang Curry with Spinach & Mushroom Fried Rice. While the curry was decent, the use sticky rice was impressive. I really like sticky rice and it was cooked nicely, maintaining its texture and numbness.

Time for some desserts, and again Ping’s didn’t fail to impress us. We had Chocolate Mozan, Banoffee Pie and Beetroot & Lemongrass Panna Cotta. I would definitely recommend the later, where they have given a healthy twist to the dessert department.

From my experience, the restaurant not only scores high on ambience and drinks but also provides the best vegetarian oriental dishes you are gonna get in this city. So, if you are in a mood for a healthy and wholesome food experience? Bookmark this place, or even better, just book a table!

So folks that was about it from Ping’s Café Orient.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

With so many eateries opening around Kolkata, there are a very few that manage to leave a mark on your memory. And ehen I say memories, I only mean the good ones. 

When I recently dropped into the Ping's Cafe Orient, all I did was make memories of delicious flavours, bombarding aromas and unusually beautiful food. 

On the table that night were: Chicken yakitori skewers, Fried calamari, Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dim Sums (the star of the show), Spicy chicken dim sum, Veg Penang curry, Mushroom and spinach sticky rice, Lamb with sauce, Chocolate mozan, Banoffee pie, and the very delicious Beetroot and Lemon Grass Panacotta (yes you read that right).

Every dish is carefully put together. Bringing the right ingredients and the perfect amount of the same to the forefront, amalgamating them to make beautiful food that can be set into a posh as well as a fun environment. The food and the ambience reminds you that you do not need to sit on a table where only cutlery is making sound in order to enjoy food this delectable.  You can enjoy food this good sitting down with your friends, moaning at the flavours playing around in your mouth and not feel ashamed about it.

Located near Loreto College, this place in Park Street serves one of the best asian food. Super chill ambiance with amazing music, this place is definitely worth a visit.
We had the following :
*Spinach Gomai Salad 
Highway Style Water Chestnut
Chicken Yakitori Skewers
Fried Calamari
*Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dim Sums 
Broccoli and Almond Dim Sum 
*Spicy Chicken Dim Sum 
Red Snapper Dim Dum 

*Veg Tofu Bao
Pakchoi and Bamboo Shoot 
*Veg Penang Curry 
*Mushroom and Spinach Sticky Rice 
*Betki Biryani 

*Chocolate Mozan 
*Banoffee Pie
*Beetroot Lemongrass Panna Cotta

* denotes my personal favourites

Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dim Sums are a must try here. 
The Veg Tofu Bao was out of the world for me. It could beat any non-veg bao.
Also the Betki Sticky Rice Biryani should be given a try.
Desserts were top notch. Perfect amalgamation of flavours and the balance of sweetness. Each of them was exceptional.

The Oriental and Asian cuisine people should definitely give this place a visit!

Went to this all new Cafe in parkstreet. An awesome place with awesome and Courteous staff would make your heat say to your brain -"It's like my home all again." The place Was full by 8 pm and had to be oweing to the awesome service and foods they served. The owners went around and talked to everyone and kept recommending what one should be ordering. The ambience of the place was awesome and The playlist they played in the background was fabulous. In food section, we ordered a number of things and believe me, we were left awestruck after trying each of them. We ordered:

Mushroom and spinach sticky rice - 5/5
Lamb with sauce - 5/5 (I'd have given it 10/5 had there been any option)

To sum it up.. Ping's cafe orient..is totally satisfying and with such a warm atmosphere it promises to bring in more and more people..

Best place for relish over Oriental Cuisine at Park Street Area... It opened at the place where Bistro by the Park used to be... Ambience is just rocking... Decor is colourful and perfect for hangout with friends or spending quality time with a glass of Cocktail... Please reserve your seats... Otherwise you need to be in queue for earning one... We tried some of the dishes and cocktails... And I believe me all were extremely good... 

#Cocktails#
❤❤❤ Hot Toddy~ This is one of the best cocktail I ever had in life... One of my friend is suffering from cold... She accidentally ordered this as she want something in hot...

Located near Loreto College, this place in Park Street serves one of the best asian food. Super chill ambiance with amazing music, this place is definitely worth a visit.
We had the following :

Broccoli and Almond Dim Sum 
*Spicy Chicken Dim Sum 
Red Snapper Dim Dum

Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dim Sums are a must try here. 
The Veg Tofu Bao was out of the world for me. It could beat any non-veg bao.
Also the Betki Sticky Rice Biryani should be given a try.
Desserts were top notch. Perfect amalgamation of flavours and the balance of sweetness. Each of them was exceptional.

The Oriental and Asian cuisine people should definitely give this place a visit!

The place Was full by 8 pm and had to be oweing to the awesome service and foods they served. The owners went around and talked to everyone and kept recommending what one should be ordering. The ambience of the place was awesome and The playlist they played in the background was fabulous. In food section, we ordered a number of things and believe me, we were left awestruck after trying each of them. We ordered:

Best place for relish over Oriental Cuisine at Park Street Area... It opened at the place where Bistro by the Park used to be... Ambience is just rocking... Decor is colourful and perfect for hangout with friends or spending quality time with a glass of Cocktail... Please reserve your seats... Otherwise you need to be in queue for earning one... We tried some of the dishes and cocktails... And I believe me all were extremely good... 

#Cocktails#
❤❤❤ Hot Toddy~ This is one of the best cocktail I ever had in life... One of my friend is suffering from cold... She accidentally ordered this as she want something in hot...

We spend the week dreaming about the weekend but PING'S had cooked up a plan to make weekdays fun too!
Special thanks to the host for being a wonderful guide.
December diary would be incomplete without a chapter in Park Street so I decided to visit this brand new place with my friends last night. It was worth it trust me!!
How to locate✔ Walk straight towards Myx n take the right foot. It's just two mins.walking distance from Myx/KFC.
What✔
🍸Drinks:
Vietnamese iced coffee turned out to be an excellent mocktail. We could get a hint of coconut milk and cinnamon powder in the cooler. Refreshing for sure!
Thai lemongrass cooler was fresh making it a tangy start to the dinner.

🍵Soup: Shrimp Tom yum is perfect for this kinda weather. As the winter mood sets in, we all just love to get served with hot and yummy soup bowls. It gets plus one for the yummy shrimps with the tomato flavour in it.

🍟Starters: Spinach gomai salad. This vegan starter tasted so good! A thick portion wrapped beautifully with spinach looked so neat on the white plate. Mothers everywhere would be so proud to see such prep and we enjoying it thoroughly!

Highway style water chestnut was crispy and yummy. Starter that goes with monsoons/winter and even summer!👌

🍙Dimsums(4pieces): Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dim Sums is SO adorable. Such pretty dimsums deserve to be reserved.😉
Spicy chicken dim sum tasted equally good. Tasted awesome with the red dip. Loved it!
🍛Mains: Mushroom and spinach sticky rice is one of the best Oriental dishes that I've had off late. It went well with the delicious Lamb. Soft and well sauteed the preparation was.👍
Betki biryani was unique I must say. It has the constant fragrance of cinnamon btw.
Do not compare with the usual Mughal stuff as this is completely different. It's delicious 👌
🍮Desserts: Chocolate Mozan is my personal favourite now. Being a choco-addict I loved it thoroughly. Mmmmm...an excellent amalgamation of vanilla and chocolate I would say.
Beetroot and lemongrass panna cotta tops the list. Why? It has more than one reason actually.
We were skeptical too, but their sugar content and gorgeous color made for a stunning dessert item.

📶Popular for their blissful Baos(2pieces). They've a huge range of Bao collection starting from the veg to pork, chicken, to Jumbo Prawns. They are launching the duck baos soon!
So what are you waiting for ❓Grab them ASAP!

☺Happy with the experience on a whole. Such a colourful ambiance they have. They have kitchen backdrop on one side and then on the other side is French inspired decor.
Also you cannot miss the beautiful white stairs that leads you to another bright scene with false windows and beautiful wall arts.
It's amazing.👍
P.S. They'll launch their Christmas menu soon. Stay tuned folks!

Ping's has opened up where Bistro By the Park used to be. I visited the place yesterday evening and what I saw mesmerized me. 50 covers and all were full at 8 pm on a Tuesday night. And it should be. Courteous staff and super friendly owners who go around table to table giving their suggestions and recommendations. The playlist is a killer combination. There was not a single song that I didn't like throughout my stay. I started of with a cocktail called sinner man which was a mix of old monk ,  cinnamon and sugar syrup. The prawn Tom yum soup was flavourful and light and perfectly balanced.
Highway style water chestnut is something you have never tried. Deep fried water chestnuts tossed in a sticky sauce. The Chicken yakitori skewers were not to my liking though. But the Fried calamaris were crispy and the dip accompanying it made me have way more than I should have.
The signature dish is Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dim Sums and it lives up to the hype and goes beyond that. An absolute must try when you drop in to ping's. The Spicy chicken dim sum too is a nice option. The Char Sui pork bao was another stellar offering. Super soft bao ,  good chunky pork piece in between with finely sliced vegetables. The only thing I would want is a bit more of the sauce on top and it's set.
The Mushroom and spinach sticky rice topped with fried garlic was the perfect combo to be had with lamb slices stir fried with sauces. After a long time I had such soft melt in your mouth lamb.the betki biryani is a bit over powered by coconut oil. Since I am not a fan of that I won't recommended it. But for people who like to try offbeat items then it should be tried.
For dessert we had beetroot pudding. Yes you read it correct. Beetroot. Well this was sort of a palette cleanser for me. Because post that I jumped into the Chocolate mozan. One word for it would be delicious.
Overall a great experience and a brilliant new place. May it achieve all the success. All the very best to everyone. 
P.S. I would suggest reserving your table beforehand to be on the safe side as there was a queue outside around 9:10 pm when I was leaving.

Just about a month old, this restaurant is in the lane of Peter Cat yet it manages to steal the thunder away! Brimming with people on a weekday afternoon - spoke zillions about the popularity, ALREADY!!!

The cuisine they serve is Asian - Oriental mix - and we'll tell you what should you order!

Must haves - Juicy Minced Chicken Salad - This is such a welcome change from the usual salad. It has a lovely cheese flavour to it- ample chicken mixed with a dressing and onion! Yum!

Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dumplings:  melts in your mouth! A pop of explosion, and cream cheese fills your mouth. Served with a dash of in-house chilli sauce.

Prawn Sui Mai and Crystal Scallop Dim Sum: Just the perfect softness! Ample stuffing and soft coating. Steamed to perfection. 

Chicken Nasi Goreng which is served with Prawn Crackers, Chicken Satay - The satay blew me away! So so goood!! The crackers are stink less yet you get the prawn flavours!

Air Fried Pomfret in Chilli Basil Sauce (a Kolkata speciality) - An entire fish greets you. Air fried hence zero oil tossed in sauce! It is a complete dish in itself!

The baos are to die for - there is sooo much meat in them! The baos are made using lotus flour hence the pure whiteness and such soft baos!!

Hot Chocolate Foam with Rum and their house special cocktails! The prices are quite reasonable for a place like this. Ample vegetarian options! They use premium alcohols and hence "zero hangover" assurance - yayyy!!

You can be assured about the freshness of the ingredients being used because fresh food is happy food! Please go visit, guys!

P.S. The experience is based on trying the mentioned items during a tasting session!

This is the newest cafe in park Street area close to KFC situated opposite to MYX. As the tagline suggest, they specialise in oriental cuisine and at the same time their effort is to serve healthy food. The cafe also serves cocktails which are made with premium liquor.
Among the numerous starters tried these dishes:
Japchae noodle salad- A refreshing salad with a hint of kafhir lime , this is healthy and light
Juicy minced chicken salad : Again a healthy salad, tangy with a dash of lime. This is a great way to start a meal.
The star  however was the ' Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dumplings', this is an absolute must, if u visit Ping's. The dumplings totally melt in your mouth, and is a revelation.
The ' Prawn Sui mai' is a blend of look and taste.
For the main course tried
Veg Ramen - Nice and complete dish, enriched with flavours.
Chicken Nasi Goreng - If u are a nasi Goreng fan, u will love this dish  and the meat served with it.
The 'Air Fried Pomfret' is speciality where the whole pomfret is served seasoned flavoured and the air fried technique add to the crisp and also it guarantees less usage of oil.
But for me the absolute are there baos. The pork bao with tenderised chunks of pork and the boa made using lotus flower makes them super soft. If u don't like pork try the teriyaki chicken baos.
Desserts served here are unique to say the least. The ' Thai sago and coconut pudding ' reminded me of the sago payesh I had as a child.
The 'beetroot and lemongrass panbacotta' is a healthy dessert with balanced sweetness and the addition of caramel sauce augments the taste.
Then again among the desserts I loved the ' Hot chocolate foam with rum', innovative and absolutely tasty.
P.N : I was invited for a  tasting session

It was difficult to find a table at 7.15 pm surely says the restaurant is jam packed with prior reservations. I was lucky to get one table without prior reservation, by the way. The cafe is decorated in street style with just lights playing the key role. It offers healthy and glutenfree food and boasts responsible cooking, which is impressive. We ordered

Sweet corn soup: a soup to start on a breezy evening. It was sweet, simple and delicious.
Snow pea and asparagus salad: The sweet and mild spicy kick with crunchy snowpeas and nuts was amazing.
Philadelphia cream, wild mushroom, water chestnut and truffle oil dimsum: I went gaga over this one. The perfect bite sized dimsum bursting with flavours. Soft, silky and delicate. Perfect.
Singapore sling: a fruity cocktail with mild spice and bitterness to gulp down such amazing food was heaven.

I liked the food a lot but somethings were just awkward. The table we had to take (that was the only one left) had no light source near by, so half of the time we were eating or reading under shadows. And being on the mezzanine floor the place becomes congested automatically. The problem persisted with the restaurant before this one, too. The menu is a bit mixed up to decipher easily and also veg options are very limited. No proper bar menu, and two thing we asked for weren't also available. The dimsum were served without chopsticks, I didn't even ask for it later though, hence can't complain. Otherwise the service was prompt and courteous (hence was okay with the extra service charge.) Again, I found the prices a tad bit on the higher side as per the portions served. But, otherwise the food experience totally compensates for it.

All hype average to poor service and food. Chili potatoes were almost cold. Very few items are below 700. The ambience is like being in a shady district of bangkok, which i dont see as a good thing). The food took so long to arive, I thought it was actually coming from Thailand, but when I tasted it, it was dissapointing to say the least. Not coming back here again, everything was sad, except for the prices, which were very high.

Finally got a table here after trying to book for almost 7-9 days. But the place was not that packed that day surprisingly. The interiors are well done. they have tried to give of Thailand Street Cafe.... which is very different from other places.

for Starters we tried  Veg Summer rolls which was one of the best i have had. Philadelphia Cream Cheese which was their speciality was average, and Chilli Baby potatoes were average.

For mains we Ordered a Pan fired noodles which was excellent.

For tries we tried Thai Lemongrass Coolers which was average, but the best part of the meal was the Vietnamese Iced Coffee. It was excellent

Its a must try place...

Pings is one of the most hyped places in Kolkata these days! And the food and drinks definitely live up to the hype. However I was disappointed on two fronts - firstly the vegetarian food options are quite limited with a lot of emphasis on just dim sums. Secondly the place is definitely over priced!

PS - a must try are the Philadelphia cheese dumplings! And the drinks are amazing too.

However, the management should definitely look into the menu options and the pricing. After all the hype will not last forever!

New addition to the Park Street F&B scene. Not a huge place like the newer places in town but really liked the vibe. Pretty much like a Hong Kong bistro. Good music only adds to it. Had Crystal Dumplings which were average. Silken Tofu Bao was quite good ( the bao was pretty soft unlike many other places ). The standout dish was the Beetroot lemongrass panacotta - very refreshing flavour for a dessert ( A must, hands down ! ). Coming from the same people who own the famed PCO, ATM in NCR, I am pretty sure the cocktails would be the highlight of this place ( did not get to try any today ). Regarding the loud ambience, this is not a fine dine so you should not expect very muted conversations. It's meant to be cheerful, it's exactly that. Looking forward to my next visit.

This place is gonna BLOW your mind away if you're someone who understands authentic orient flavours. The philadelphia cheese and wild mushroom dimsums were so smooth and amazing, the silken tofu baos will just melt in your mouth! The service was great, ambience is fun and location is perfect. It's one big add to the good orient food places that Kolkata lacks. I mean i was WOWed by the menu variety, i was so excited to see a poached pear dessert! Must visit, big thumbs up! :D

park street just got pinged.

amidst places with colonial hangovers like mocambo and peter cat, ping’s makes a bold statement. its inviting, lively and refreshing. designed around thai market place, the interior ensembles are quirky and groovy. another far cry which is unmistakeable is the break from the hoity toity management staff, the guys here are total fun! 

i ordered hainanese rice, no complains there, the menu seemed elaborate and includes most of the asian goodies


to the management - my compliments!, you have already made the right noise!! just keep it pinging!!!

Great little Asian joint in the lanes of Park street , The deco is a mix of modern and street style food stall. The place feels a little crowded and the tables feels clumped together.

The service is a little slow and lacking , which can be improved upon , we had to constantly remind the waiter for food.
 
As for the food which was good and well made, we ordered the Pakchoi, bamboo shoots & Water Chestnut which was yummy, even the tom yum soup was good too. The Steamed Spicy Wild mushroom Dim sum was good, Phily Cream cheese, wild mushroom water chestnut & truffle oil dim sum was a must try and.
Also the silken tofu bao was good to taste and the dry chicken with pepper & soy was yummy.
Also the black pepper pork bao was brilliant.

And for the mains we ordered the Laksa which was good, Red curry with sticky rice was also good and the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken bowl was good and a must try.

Lastly for the dessert the chocolate foam was good and yummy.

All over the food was good but the only let down was the service.

We sat up in the mezzanine where the ceiling beams are a little to low. Headbanging is inevitable. Settled down to a shredded pork bao, chicken sui mai and philly cheese dumplings all of which were delicious.(the cheese dumplings were too predictable i felt ) Must try the stir fried asparagus and string beans ; bursting with flavour. Ordered an old fashioned (cocktail) which was the best i have had in by furlongs. For mains, we had sticky rice with a chicken dish which was satisfying.  
Would have to say that the general prices especially for cocktails are steep. There is stiff competition from all sides in park street with primeval and new chic joints all around. 
Nevertheless, pings was a great experience and would highly recommend it to others.

The same place my favourite Bistro by the Park used to be , we dropped down at Ping's cafe Orient last week for a late dinner. Thankfully the place remains open till midnight and takes down their last order at 11:30 pm. The space though not a huge one , had ample seating at ground and a L shaped mezzaine floor , bit cramped but the decor thematically matches well with bangkok street styling.

what we had:

~PHILADELPHIA CREAM CHEESE DIMSUM - four single bite sized dimsum , a must try dish. (5/5)

~CHARCOAL ROAST PORK SKEWER - three skewers each with 4-5 cubes of meat , another must try dish (5/5)

~CHICKEN LAKSA - well made , we had better versions elsewhere (3.5/5)

~CHICKEN PENANG CURRY WITH STICKY RICE - lovely coconut based texture of the curry (4/5)

~CHICKEN PAN FRIED NOODLES - one of most aweful versions . (2/5)

two desserts :

~POACHED PEAR : had it first time , looked interesting but taste wise pretty avoidable unless one is a pear fanatic (2.5/5)

~HOT CHOCOLATE FOAM - the chocolate part was just divine but the aftertaste of rum used layering the glass was equally a potent spoiler. (3.5/5)

cocktails :

~PEACH AND HONEY SANGRIA : a beautiful concoction , presentation can be improved. (4/5)

~DARK and STORMY : based on dark rum , too strong to my liking (3/5)

~LONG ISLAND ICED TEA : this wasn't in their menu but made on request , we took three of them , each differing from the other in terms of dilution , presented in normal glasses and not the tall ones usually used. Honestly very unappealing (2/5)

Service part had no flaws , very courteous staff , helpful and food was served almost in no time.

The menu had only food and cocktails enlisted together , Beer was not available , though they serve premium liquor , there wasn't any liquer menu. the server named a few imported brands those were available but wasn't sure of the pricing. Not done from a restaurant of this class charging premium rates for food and alcohol.
Food was mostly average to taste , except the ones i recommended and remarkably less portioned when compared to that served at asian restaurants of similar pricing like mamagoto etc .

A lot of hype , nothing to show for. I'm always surprised with how frivolously people rate restaurant's.... This place is definitely not worth the time or money being charged. Plus it's extremely extremely loud. Food is honestly nothing great, half the things are not even present which are reflecting in menu.

Busy on Sunday afternoons. Book ahead if you want a seat  on arrival. The teriyaki chicken bao was tasty. The chicken itself was delicious but pricey for what you get. Philly cheese and truffle oil dumplings were a real triumph. Two ingredients not traditionally found in dim sum but worked really well together and I would reorder again. I would suggest to not add the chilli on top of the dim sum. Prawn fried rice was also good. Overall, the restaurant has a great atmosphere and decor. Fun music from the 90s was playing. For a Sunday afternoon, lower volume would be appreciated so we don't have to shout to be heard in conversation. Price is expensive, but for park st it is understandable.

Atrocious service. Average food. Very high price. Be prepared to carry your company papers with you , as you may end up selling it to pay the bill of this place. Average waiting time for a waiter to grace customers is 20 to 30 minutes. Ambience is nothing great at all. I honestly don't mind if a restaurant is charging high prices & provides appropriate services & food, but this place falls way below expectations. The atmosphere is very chaotic and not even once did I feel.like I'm sitting in a decent restaurant. Unless you're an anarchist who wants to see money burn , i would suggest skip this one.

Located at the heart of Parkstreet and walking distance from Loreto College this place is already stealing the show with it's amazing and lit ambience and the Oriental food they are serving .Some of the dishes that deserve a special mention are the Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dimsum, Charcoal Pork Roasted Skewers , Spicy Fried Calamari , Cheesy Lumpia Rolls ,Spicy Chicken Korean Wings and the amazing range of desserts . The Pork Skewers and the Calamari are to die for and the perhaps the best I have ever tasted.
So head on to this amazing place and give your taste buds a relish :D

Slow service. Over hyped establishment. Staff is extremely rude. Food is far better in other places. i find the initial reviews here very surprising. Maybe the city is used to new places opening frequently and feeling it can do great just based on hype.  Wish the place was more spaced out, everything felt very congested.

I came to know about this place from a Friend of mine living in park street. This place is in park street, you will be able to spot this place if you are walking from Myx to Loreto House.

I went to this place probably as their first customer on 25th Oct around 12pm, it showed as opened in Zomato, I even called to cross check the same. Though on reaching I found that it was not open to the public. However on stating that I called in advance they allowed me in.

On entering the place you will find fairly decorated bar counter, and a sitting arrangment from 16-20 people in the first floor. We climbed up to the 1st floor which had a sitting arrangment for around 12-15 people.

We were presented with a menu which seemed to be a Bhaidooj special menu ( though bhai dooj was long gone). Judging by the menu, the options seems to be very limited. We asked the staff who was serving us with a smile about the recommendation. And we ordered dry chicken and spinach mushroom rice based on the recommendation of the server. Some how i felt that the server was not knowledgeable enough as the combination wasnt the best.

It took a long time for them to prepare our order. And I felt that they were underprepared. The chicken could have been cleaned further to get rid of the red of the chicken and the quantity of the mushroom was not in the best ratio with the chicken. Taste wise I felt that dry chicken was edible. The place is on a pricey side.

Wish to give another shot soon when they come up with the whole menu.

Ping’s, the oriental restaurant located in Park street , is bound to leave you speechless , not only with their food , but also ambience. 
The interiors are very cozy and quirky. There is paper art and modern art in the walls. They have seating both upstairs and downstairs. The restaurant also boasts of a bar. However , at our table , there wasn’t much light. There should have been enough light to take a picture of , or to see what you’re actually eating. 
Thai iced tea - the drink had a unique taste in the sense that it had crushed cardamom , cloves and the natural spices , mixed with tea , and used condensed milk as a sweetener. It’s a drink that not many would like. 
Thai lemongrass cooler - the drink had a thin slice of cucumber and shards of lemongrass in it , was very refreshing. 
Philadelphia cream cheese and truffle oil dim sums - this was the highlight of the day. The plate served four of the dim sums , with cheese bursting out like a pop when you eat it. The truffle oil gave a bitterness to the dim sum, which surprisingly went well. 
Chicken Sui mai - this dish looked pretty and tasted delicious. Pink dough covered the chicken filling , and it was light and soft. 
The dim sums were served with crushed red chillis  in oil , spring onions and garlic in oil , soy sauce and a red chilli sauce. 
Tom yum soup - as the name suggests , it was sour and spicy at the same time. It consisted of shitake mushrooms , lemongrass , shrimp , edamame and spinach .The soup dominated of lemongrass and felt like a warm blanket on a cold day. It provided a warmth inside you which was very comforting. 
Spicy beef salad - this was really good because the beef had been pickled earlier. It was served with onions , mint , basil and arugula leaves. It was a hearty salad. 
For main course , we had the chicken ramen bowl. The broth of the ramen bowl was warm and bland , which seemed good. The ramen was less in amount , but there were vegetables and chicken in abundance. It was served with chilli sauce and fried onions. 
Lastly , for dessert we had the hot chocolate foam. This was the second highlight of the day. What was absolutely breathtaking about this dish was that it was hot and cold at the same time. Ice cold rum was served in a glass with a steamed dark chocolate pudding floating atop. The entire dish went very well together. It was truly a different experience altogether. 
The staff is friendly and looks after you well. The service is impressively fast. It can be classified as a semi high end restaurant because the prices are steep. But it’s an experience to be felt.

Decor: clever, swanky, but my table was right in front of the door so that particular spot was bad. 

Food: I give 5/10 for authenticity and 7/10 for innovation. It’s still Indian Chinese so Yautcha remains my number 1 choice for Chinese and Bbq/Flavours for Indian Chinese. A comment I had for the Fillet of Red Snapper we ate; there was so much sauce and aromatics in the dish you lose the flavour of the snapper. So for a dish like that I think a betki would have been a better choice. 

We also had tried the Spicy Chicken Dumpling, Prawn Siu Mai, Egg Fried Rice and Stir Fry Exotic Vegetables. Dim Sums are tasty but again, Yautcha is my preferred. 

Price: I won’t lie...it’s expensive. For this price level I’d prefer a Sonargaon or La Cucina. 

Drinks: Expensive x2. I had the Elderflower Spritzer which was a very easy and pleasant cocktail. Still comparing it in my head with Yautcha. 

In conclusion, good concept but hope they up their game.

They've got a really good PR team who've done an amazing job to create a hype about Ping's. 
However it they would've done half a good job with their service the place would surely ace it. 
I feel they're doing complete injustice to the food they serve with their service. 
They are massively understaffed with relatively untrained servers. 
From wrong dishes to waiting for more than an hour for food I think we saw it all. 
Kudos to their manager who was evidently trying very hard but was unfortunately let down by his team. 
Must try this place out but after a couple of weeks when they're done with their teething problems.

Kolkata has come up with yet another place to deliciously plunge ourselves into. Defining themselves as a modern freestyle café, they have brought a new paradigm shift to the world of food. Not just the concept, the whole ambience and decor is tantalising. Located just beside Frollz Ice cream parlour and a two minute walk from Loreto College, this place is easy to locate and upon visiting will leave significant impacts on your minds.

I've already visited many cafés, but it seemed like my wait ended with this visit to Ping's itself. Not just the food they offer, but even their services and hospitality is beyond compare. We were assisted by Goutam, our server for the day who made sure we went home without a single complaint. Yes, Ping's succeeded in converting it to an experience, indeed. The restaurant has a casual vibe with seating arrangements in two floors. The ground floor has the bar counter and has the maximum number of seats while the floor on top is basically to incorporate a family strength of 10. With dim lights and a wonderful atmosphere, Ping's Café gives an unique feel to it's visitors.

We got our hands on the a-la-carte menu making us confused on what to order due to their enormous variety of dishes ( both signature and others ). The drinks menu as well gave us a tough time to decide on wgat cocktails and mocktails we should go for as the names had already started impressing us. Our order was placed to Goutam who within 15 minutes served us with the order.
Our meal started with :

• Juicy Chicken Minced Salad : With fresh mint, fresh chilli, paprika and roasted rice, this delicacy is a wonderful item to go for at the beginning of your meal. The salad was so well made with the chicken perfectly minced and the taste on point, a salad lover should definitely go it.

• Japchae : An innovative kind of salad, I ever tried. Loaded with vegetables and cold sweet potato noodles, it had an amazing taste. This item has it's source from myeongdong's market.

We were off to a fresh start and with each bite, you would be reminded of how great the meal ahead was going to be. Next, we were served with three varieties of dimsums.

• Vegetable and Silken Tofu Dimsum : It was loaded with Broccoli almond and truffle oil. It tasted okayish with the taste of the almond messing up the demands as expected from dimsums. But then, taste varies from person to person. So, you never know.

• Philadelphia Cream and Cheese Dimsum : This is something one would definitely crave for after having one. It was stuffed with wild mushroom, water chestnut and truffle oil. Filled with excess cheese and the spices blending perfectly, the dimsums turned out to be one of my favourites here. Light and soothing, it invoked the best of the flavours.

• Scallop Crystal Dumplings : This variety of dimsums will definitely attract a sea-food lover due to it's fantastic taste and is absolutely drool - worthy. The presentation is an added advantage of the dish giving it a 10/10.

As we headed to try out some signature dishes of this place, every item on the menu we ordered turned out to be an absolute gem. We went for the highway style and imperial style appetizers.

• Cheese Lumpia Rolls : This dish is a perfect snack to bite on with cheese fillings enhancing the taste. Basically, it is a different kind of spring roll, though a bit smaller in size. Loved them.

• Spicy Fried Calamari : Served in chosun style, this dish is perfection in itself. It is basically squid fried in salt and pepper. The duo of the fried calamari and the sauce wrnt hand in hand. With it's luscious taste, one will easily be a fan of this delicacy. For sea-food lovers, this dish is an absolute delight.

• Charcoal Roast Pork Skewers : Well, this dish turned out to be my favourite at Ping's Cafe Orient! The Pork was well cooked and was soft on the other hand as well. The authenticity of the roasted flavour and the spices blending perfectly with one another gave it a wonderful taste. The sauce served along with it was a deadly combination and filled our bellies to the brim. One should definitely go for this item at their visit to Ping's. I can ensure this would not disappoint you.

As we were in the middle of our meal, we were asked to try out two of their sea food items. We went for it.

• Tomato Spiced Meekong Bassa wrapped in Banana Leaf : It was definitely a delightful pick. Tasted a bit towards the tangy side, this delicacy will give a tough competition to the well known 'Paturi' of Kolkata. The taste of the tomato and the other spices was well infused inside the Bassa fillet. Loved it.

• Red Snapper / Bhetki Biryani : Ping's Cafe Orient has come up with items which are exclusively available in their Kolkata outlet making those their signature dishes. One such dish is this one! Served with short grain sticky rice, the Biryani was somewhat different from the regular Biryani of Kolkata.
The taste of this item completely depends from person to person.

Moving on to the main course, we were assisted in picking three items which turned out to be amazing as well!

• Sticky Rice : The rice was delicate, aromatic and fluffy. We were also told about it's importance as well that the moist lowers the risk of heart diseases, protects the tissues and keeps them strong. The uniqueness of this item was that it was gluten free. The rice turned out to be really good with the side dish we ordered along with it.

• Hakka Noodles : They did not try to change the elegance of this Chinese item. It tasted like usual noodles and went well with the Chicken Side dish that we ordered.

• Chicken Red Curry : It was served with the Sticky Rice making it an irresistible combination. Loved the duo.

• Stir fried Exotic Vegetables : The texture of this dish was perfect. It was cooked with hot basil sauce and the taste came out to be good too. Definitely recommended for a vegetarian.

As we headed towards the end of the meal, I must mention the cocktails and mocktails we had ordered for with our scrumptious meal.

Cocktails :
• Miso Mary : A twist on the Bloody Mary using miso paste.

• Singapore Sling : Being one of their signature cocktails, they kept it straight and simple. Gin, grenadine, cherry herring, fresh lime, benedictine and angostura are it's ingredients.

• Japanese Cocktail : Their twist is that it is made with gin, amaretto, lemon peel and a cherry. The taste turned out to be really great.

• Peach and Honey Sangria : We all know how sangria tastes like. But then they have a different twist to it. As the name suggests, it's made up of peach halves, honey, lime juice and white wine.

The alchohol was well balanced in all the cocktails and every cocktail was refreshing and soulful.

Mocktails :
• Thai Lemongrass Cooler : The taste of the lemongrass was evident. This drink tasted like Fresh lime soda, to be honest.

• Apple and Ginger Collins : This drink had a wow factor in it. Loved it.

Our meal ended with two types of desserts. Goutam wanted us to go for :

• Poached Pear : The name already depicts the elegance of this dessert. It was served with caramelized walnut and vanilla icecream. With every scoop we had, the taste got better. The presentation is also noteworthy. Full marks on that as well.
The vanilla icecream and the pear went comprehended each other nicely.

• Hot Chocolate Foam with Rum : My favorite dessert over here! This is a speciality indeed. I just loved the hot chocolate and once you're done with it, you get to have rum which lies beneath it. Our meal ended on a really nice note with this delicacy.

The food quality is top notch and the quality suffices too. The service is great too.
At the end of the day, the place is grand with it's strong vibe. The experience was speechless and the whole menu shows not only the variety but the delight too. Though, the price is on the higher side, the delicacies are worth every penny. Head over to this place with friends and family to explore their enormous menu and to indulge away into the foods of the modern day!

Absolutely recommended.

Ping's Cafe is a new addition to the ever growing Oriental cuisine in Calcutta. Serving up the perfect ambience in the perfect location with salivating food is something Ping's Cafe can easily boast of.
One can easily miss out the place with it's rustic exterior, tucked in between Frollz and Amber Restaurant, a few steps from Peter Cat, once you enter, it's a different world altogether within Park Street. With decoration ranging from recycled products to classic South Asian market place ambience, it is a completely new experience and ambience which the city has not witnessed before.

The menu is fairly elaborate and at times it might end up confusing you. It has South Asian fares ranging from the quintessentially​ famous dim sum and bao to the less popular dishes in the city such as ramen or khao suey.

The Philadelphia Cream Cheese dimsums bring emotions in 3 different waves. Initially, we completely loved it. It was silky smooth, cheesy and the right amount of savoury. Howver, just after a while, you feel that the taste of the cream cheese is too overpowering although it's not bad. But, when you come back home,you would want to go back for one more of those. 

If you are a seafood fan, try out the Scallop and Shrimp dimsums and the Spicy Fried Calamari. The dimsums are smooth with some bold seafood taste and works as a great appetizer. The Calamari on the other side is probably one of the best of its kind we have tasted. It's perfectly crunchy and not at all rubbery. The dip along with it goes perfectly as a side. 

The winner for us from the menu would be the Charcoal Roast Pork Skewers. Skewers can either be extremely great (as in the case here) or horribly wrong. The pork skewers here were a winner, with succulent pork with a thin layer of fat, correct amount if seasoning and great portion size, this is something that will take back everyone time and again. 

We also tried the Tomato Spiced Meekong Bassa wrapped in Banana Leaf with Fresh Spinach and Mushroom Fried Rice. The go beautifully together. Although the bassa might look unappetizing at first when paired with plain steamed rice or sticky rice, they go beautifully together.

The Ping Fashioned, Elderflower Spritzer and Singapore Sling were a cocktail lovers ideal match. 

The Hot Chocolate foam was pretty nice too. After you finish it, you get to drink the rum at the bottom. It felt like a Rum Granita with the pieces of ice and strong Rum flavor although not very sure. 

Slightly expensive than what we have witnessed in Calcutta, it is definitely worth a shot. It will definitely make you want to go back for whatever it has to offer.

Read about this place on LBB . I was surprised that this place was completely full for a weekday lunch , even when it is barely 4 days old! 
Thoroughly impressed with the decor. As soon as I entered I could see the Asian inspired theme. The Japanese wall art attracted me the most. The stacked up bottles above the bar. The pretty red staircase with a street lamp over it.  
They are here to provide healthy Asian food. They have these specially curated No- Hangover cocktails which seems inviting. But I must say that the prices were on the higher side for all cocktails and drinks. 
We ordered the Laksa ( delicious! ) And Penang curry. The Penang curry surprised me the most - Its a brinjal based Thai curry , which initially didn't sound so appetizing , but I'm glad I tried it out. 
We ordered Thai Lemongrass cooler and Lemongrass Iced tea. Both drinks were average in taste and very expensive. Definitely not worth it. I couldn't try a lot of their signature dishes. But I am definitely going to go back to try more. 
Although, I would like to comment that Mamagoto offers the same style of Asian cuisine with more variety and more flavours for the  same price.

I went to Ping's for dinner on opening night. I hadn't made a reservation & all the tables were already booked, so they asked if I'd mind sitting at the bar, which was fine by me. That little hitch aside, the experience was worth the visit & I will be going back for another meal soon. Next time I'll make a reservation.

Ambiance: When you visit, expect quirky decor, cozy low lighting that's still bright enough to read the menu comfortably, peppy music & a fun casual vibe.

Beverage: With a full bar, offering a range of imported spirits & a wide variety of innovative cocktails, drinking should definitely be on your agenda. The peach sangria is like a delightful spa treatment for your tastebuds.

Food: A cursory glance at the food menu will show you how much effort has gone into picking popular local delicacies from various cities across South East Asia & innovating on them. (For a menu like this, short descriptions of what each dish contains would have been helpful)
Appetizer portions are relatively small, so you can try a wider variety without getting too full. I'd definitely recommend the cream cheese dumplings which absolutely melt in your mouth! 
Main course dishes are generously portioned and suitable for sharing. If you're dining alone & looking for a simple wholesome dish, I'd recommend the Chicken Yakitori.

Service: Overall, the staff were very courteous & helpful. Considering that it was only their first day, the service staff wasn't yet thorough with what each dish on the menu contained. This was forgivable though, because they did make the effort of checking with the chef instead of giving customers wrong information. 

Value For Money: While the base price of each dish is slightly higher than average, it's the 10% service charge & 18% GST that really inflate your bill. Expect an expensive meal.

The new trending place located in the party street of Kolkata- Park Street, just diagonally opposite Myx, is a must visit ! The trendy and cool decor matched with scrumptious food is the perfect combination. The staff is really helpful and knows their menu throughout. Coming to the food, the Pork is a must try ! To point out single dishes would be a shame as everything I put in my mouth was to die for ! Can’t wait to Ping again soon.

Ping's is the new kid in town and already creating a buzz with it's amazing bangkok street style decor and the lip smacking oriental cuisine. Looking around one would notice how they've used recycled products to decorate the place because as mentioned in the coasters,they at ping's believe in Environment conservative.A big shoutout goes to them for this initiative. 
Coming to Food and service.
We were a big group so got to taste a lot of their signature dishes and drinks.
The Philadelphia cream cheese dimsums were great,as was the roasted pork shewers and the spring rolls to the hot chocolate with rum dessert.
All the items were made to perfection and the distinctive flavours of each and every item confuses the taste buds. 
Mr.Gautam had been serving us and he did his job perfectly and we are quite satisfied with the service.
Ping's is something very fresh and new in the city of joy and it sure will attract a lot of attention. Looking forward to many more visits to this amazing restaurant.

This cafe is creating some buzz around the city. It is newly opened and serves some mouth watering dishes. The vibe is amazing and also the decor. This cafe is just beside frollz, park street. We had lots of food and drinks at this place. The best was roasted pork skewers, philadelphia creme cheese dumplings, spring onions, red snapper biryani etc. Mr. Gautam was serving us yesterday and he was really humble. Overall a great place to hangout and have good food. I will be going back to this place again.

In the little time this restaurant has been open I've already visited it twice simply because the menu is so vast and I highly recommend trying something new every time. Both the times the food has been excellent and the owners have taken a real initiative to take my feedback and work on it, noticed it the second time I went. For me more than the food I appreciated the personal touch which made it special. Great job guys! 

Food to recommend - Hainanese Chicken and Rice, Roti Kanai, Malaysia red snapper biryani
