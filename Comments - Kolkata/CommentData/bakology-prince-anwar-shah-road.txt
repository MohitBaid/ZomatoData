A very creative and passionate baker, comes up with very innovative flavours and ideas and does not shy away from experimenting! A refreshing change from the same old flavours that we get in regular bakeries. I've tasted her mango, orange chocolate, pineapple, chocolate truffle, fruit cakes and most recently the lovely Rosomalai cake and awesome is the only word for all of them! I've also ordered custom bday cakes and anniversary cakes from her, and the designs were exactly the way I wanted and taste was super yum. I highly recommend Bakology for any need to satisfy the sweet tooth! :-)

Taste & Quality at affordable prices are never in sync as per Economics, but Bakology is here to prove the same myth wrong with all under the same banner. Add to it they deserve a feather in the crown with their prompt service/delivery and customization. They have all the flavors and customization to soothe your taste buds and make you fall in love for cakes & desserts. If you are thinking of trying this new venture be sure that you are putting your money for one of the upcoming startup who will challenge many a stalwarts of bakery.

Bakology is one of the rare bakeries in Kolkata which excels in beautiful theme based cakes. The creativity of the owner is splendid. For special occasions her cakes are bound to earn compliments for their creative look and great taste. Requested to share your price and offers on collection of cupcakes.  It will be great for gifting purposes.
