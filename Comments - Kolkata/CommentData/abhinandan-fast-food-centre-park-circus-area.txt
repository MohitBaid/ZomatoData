The only problem is there is no proper arrangements. You need to stand and eat near the counter. It a shop providing some fast food. They are good at cooking South Indian. It's easy to locate as it is on the main road near don Bosco school. If you are in that area you can try.

The only problem with this place is that there is no proper place to eat. We need to stand at the counter and eat our food. The dosa are good while the chanas was not so very fresh. I have been twice or thrice ajd its an average place. If you very hungry and if you are near that place having no other option the you can tru the south Indian of Abhinanadan

Abhinandan: If you have been to M.G. Road and have not been here, you have surely missed something.
============ 
Intro:
I don't think that this outlet is near Entally. It is located in the heart of M.g. road Small Lane. Zomato Management you need to correct it and discover location properly.  Ask anyone there and they know about it. Famous for it's kachori's, paneer roll(unique one), naan and other subjis, this fast food corner runs like anything. It is located on the street and it runs like crazy. Its a pure vegetarian delight. 
============ 
Food ordered: 

I have ordered here:

1) Kachori's - They were excellent. Served piping hot with smoke fumes coming when you tear off the bloated kachoris. 
2) Paneer Roll - Don't miss on this. Very unique and amazing in taste. Paneer perfectly marinated in masalas with onion.  #must try
3) Naan with Daal - The naan is enjoyable when eaten hot. So, eat it hot when out of the tandoor. Daal was good too.  #must try
4) Aloo Dum Subji - It's my favorite here. #must try
5) Paneer - Had tasted it quite long ago. It is fine to taste. 
============ 
Pros:

1) Located in the market area so automatically catches crowd.
2) Tasty food.
3) Pocket friendly prices.
4) Served piping hot.
5) Prompt service.
6) A lot of vegetarian varieties here. 

Cons: 
1) No place to stand. You will see moving traffic all the time.
2) If you are looking for hygiene, back off from this place. Food is hygienic but the place and ambience is too crowdy and unhygienic. Nothing like any a.c. n all. 
3) Can improve their services much more. 
============ 
Summary:

Food quality 3.6/5
Taste 4.3/5
Hospitality 3.7/5 
Value for money 4.7/5
Food quantity 3.7/5
============ 
Suggestion: 
1) Get more special items on the menu. 
============ 
Meal for two: 200 max. 
============ 
Conclusion:

I will not stop visiting here as it's a food delight. It's a pure vegetarian fast food corner and i am sure all the people roaming in M.G. must have stepped in here.

Note: Unbiased review based on my dining experience.
