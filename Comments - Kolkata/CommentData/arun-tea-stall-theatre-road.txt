You can‚Äôt get better local breakfast & evening snacks like Arun Tea Stall or fondly known at ATS. The Kesar chai is to die for. Jalebi is really good when it‚Äôs hot. Small kachori with aloo subzi- most sundays you will have to que up.

Saffron tea at it's best. The size of the outlet is really small, but the crowd it attracts in the morning itself is a proof of the magical happiness served in small kulhads. To accompany tea, they have a few variants of snacks. Perfect place for breakfast..

You go to Arun Tea Stall if you want to have a cup of chai with your friends and leave satisfied. 
I have been to this tea joint many a times, and it's never empty. Have had their club kachori as well. 
The sabzi is finger licking. 
Way to go!

Kesar Tea for ‚Çπ40 (Big) but worth every sip. Try the club kachoris too. Not exactly awesome but worth the price you pay for it. Overall this place is a well known chai ki tapri for us locals!

A very popular place for Kachouri , samosa lovers near Theatre Road . It's popularity can be judged by number of cars , bikes lining up in front of the joint & also by the number of people munching the delicacies throughout the day . Their Club Kachouri is simply mouthwatering . Six beautifully fried Kachouris with sabji containing aloo , chana , mattar & small pieces of paneer is truly heavenly. Tea in a earthen cup is perhaps their most popular item . Jalebi & samosa are equally good too . Nothing to talk about ambiance but if you are looking for snack items at a reasonable price then this is the place to be.

This place needs not introduction. I have been to this place multiple times. You can find a high end cars, bikes etc near this shop. People just live this place for tea and other snack items. 

I have tried almost all the items at this place. Samosa, Gulab Jamun, khasta kachori everything is good but if you happen to visit this place, no matter what you have to have the tea. It serves you one of the best tea in Kolkata. They serve regular and kesar tea. Prices of the snacks are normal. A must visit place for tea lovers üòÅ

Close to my college this is our every evening adda place after the classes. Their kesar Tea is definitely a must try. And to talk about the basics, their regular Chai served in the quintessential earthen pot is always steaming hot with the right amount of sugar and a beautiful aroma that brings you back to this place. The club kachories, samosas and chilli pakoras are guaranteed to bring you taste and comfort.

Probably the most popular and crowded stalls in and around South Central Kolkata which covers Camac street and theater road region. Its speciality is the club kachori and the jalebi. I myself am very health conscious and have a habit of worrying about too much oil in such type of stalls but the food here won't cause much harm to our appetite.
A very good option for quick snacks be it in the form of breakfast or brunch or evening snacks.

While passing by this place, I have often seen people sipping their hot cups of chai. Sorry it's not a cup, but earthen clay pots. You won't get the charm of drinking tea in such clay cups unless you're a Calcuttan. One rainy evening, in the middle of a summer coolers walk, we had come to Arun Tea Stall to fix our palates with some savouries. 
Although not a fan of tea, I had my share from this much famed tea stall from a friend's cup and had this love for samosa. It was big filled with generous amount of aloo and mutter. The samosa was even more magical with the tangy thick only chutney. The jalebis from here are also very good. If you're somewhere near Theatre Road and looking for some cheap snacking options, then this is the place for you. Happy Dining! :)

Early morning kachori with aloo sabji was out of the world... and this place had loads of people all around the road side with stools laid down to sit and enjoy the delicacies. 
Whilst gulab jamun could have been given a miss, the 'kesar' chai was out of the world - the first time I had it and have tried getting this done at home too... something different and unique. 
You enjoy this old city charm and the feeing of steet food even in the humid weather of Calcutta. 

Must try place for foodies.

Service is good.

Tried Kesari Tea served in Kulhar along with samosa and mirch pakora. Tea was very nice & refreshing. A must try. Samosa and pakora were also very tasty.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

It is famously said that "big things come in small sizes" & well Arun Tea Stall or ATS for many justifies this small phrase aptly.

Located at end of the lane opposite of xaviers back gate which attracts every college students,office goers or any passerby. They offer varieties of snacks like mirchi pakora, samosa, kochuris & most importantly jaw dropping teas. I visited this place mostly to try their teas.

I directly opted for kesar tea since i simply love the hint of kesar over strong tea. I took a big bhar of kesar chai & upon taking the first sip i simply fell in love with the robust smell of the tea. Such perfect mixture of milk,tea leaves with the taste of kesar oozing through every. Loved it so much that ended up with another big bhar of it.

Will be visiting again to try their other options

For "Chai Sutta" purposes, this tea fairs as one of the very best in the city. Just went there today. It was on our bucketlist so had to check it out. Felt kind of awkward stepping down from the taxi that we took, just to cross this off our list. Oh the things we do for food! Now, to the review:

People obviously go there for the tea, and its supreme. Certainly one of the best teas available across the city. It has a great cinnamon-ey flavour and at every sip refreshes you. My friend took the regular large cup while I went for the Kesar Tea (because I always have to have kesar tea. ALWAYS). ¬†The man serving up the cups was generous with the amount of kesar, and it was a rather large cup for the price I was paying. ¬†The kesar tea in particular was amazing.

Kesar tea has a property to taste bittersweet, but this tea wasn't bitter at all. It was just to my liking. ¬†Among the other things we took a plate of Club Kachori, and the "Sabzi" that came with it blew my mind, for it was creating a nice combination as I went back and forth from the plate into the tea. ¬†We also had gulab jamun and jalebi. The Gulab Jamun was soft and was lightly fried which made it disappear real quick, and the Jalebi was so-so at the first bite. It was just too sweet for me.¬†

Overall, a nice experience. Would have cherished it more had it been a damp day. Would go there again.

This place resides in the hearts of every Xaverian. Commonly called ATS, this place might be just an ordinary Tea Stall but the place it has in Xaverian hearts is something more than special. Early morning Chai with Samosa or hot Kachori Sabzi with best buddies, all add up to college memories. Even the rich eat stuff from this Stall without any hesitation, such is the emotional association of people with it. Don't forget to try the Kesaria Chai.

Nothing extraordinary, but an iconic stall to get your morning chai over a samosa, never ever order coffee there, its overly priced as per the stall standards and not well made, most of the times burnt.

Early in the morning when I visited for the first time I was astonished to see the gathering in front of the tiny shop. It was difficult to reach up to the counter to ask for the required food. There were minimum 40 students of Xaviers .Orders were continuously pouring in. The staffs were handling it with great efficiency by swiftly serving them all without giving any scope to complain. They are basically handling such volume every single day.

The strategic location is no doubt a boost for the business. But still it requires lot of skill to grow the business to this volume with an establishment which is not bigger than a pan shop. Moreover they are serving items that are available in every nook and corner of the city. Inspite of that there are customers who are visiting almost every day to this same place just for the quality of the food and beverages

I have tried their kachoris, jalebis and tea. The freshly prepared fluffy kachoris are served with little spicy alu curry (unlike the sweet version served in the Bengali sweet shops) along with sweet cutney and pickled green chillies. Club kachoris are also available and served with same accompaniments. Juicy jalebis are big in size and gives a soothing feeling after having the hot Kachoris. The tea is potent enough to make you avoid most of the tea shops in future. It is made of only milk without any water. Breakfast from ATS will help you kick start an otherwise wise monotonous day on a pleasant note.

Well for me , this place offers the best samosas in Kolkata. The crispy covering with steaming spicy potatoes inside. It's truly wonderful. The chutney the serve it with is light and sweet and makes you wanting for more. Coming to the other things , they serve mirchi vada which I didn't like very much , and kachori aloo which is also good though I've had better. The chai is served in an earthen cup and tastes really good. I would suggest to go here only for samosas and jalebi , which is also very succulent and juicy and nothing else.

'Arun Tea Stall'  is the canteen of office-goers and the hub of college-goers for pocket-friendly sweet and savoury items and beverages. I have been hearing a lot of good things regarding 'Arun Tea Stall', so I wanted to visit it for a long time. Finally, I got the chance yesterday when I was in the Maidan area. It was a long walk but it was worth it. The stall is located in Shakespeare Sarani. There was a little crowd in front of the stall which proved the popularity of the shop. I ordered club kachori at first. It took some time as they were frying the kachoris. The kachoris came after ten minutes and the dish was delectable. I was having kachoris after four months and it felt like heaven. Next, I ordered a medium kesariya tea. The tea came within two minutes. It was delicious and refreshing. The taste was a bit like the kesariya tea that I had in Srinagar. The staff was well-behaved. I will definitely visit again.

Deep inside the theater road or what basically you say in the Shakespeare sarani you have such a hidden gem in form of ATS. Just 30 secs from my office opposite foot of the cafe The Next Level, i was quite surprised to find it in zomato, but later found them equally famous.
In the morning and in the tiffin hours its stays gathered with students as well as office employees like us for their refreshment and taste buds. Its basically a street side food joint with all those Hing kachori tea as well as quite lot varieties.
Two visits at this place for some food tasting and afternoon snacks. Tried first their Club Kachori which were really good in numbers of 6 pieces, hot and fresh. Sabzi was also tasty and spicy enough to go well with the kachoris. And my all time favorite gulab jamun, but very much disappointed with the way they kept it open in the main road where all the dust are falling in it while a car or bike passes by.
Again went their and tried their hing kachori which were ¬†4 in number and tasty with the sabzi as well. I am not a Singhara lover to be honest, but tried it too which was satisfactory enough to me with the mithi chatni. Heard lot of their Tea which is still pending. The 0.5 deduction is for their unhygienic part.¬†
They have also got a branch in Russel street.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Literally a wall in the hole, this place is mightily frequented by students and office goers alike. Value for money like nothing else, the tea here is really good as are the gulab jamuns and syrupy jalebis. The club kachoris may fail to fill you up if you have quite an appetite, but it's cheap enough that you'll order more. Keep in mind that it's a street shop and avoid prudishness- you'll be fine here. 

Try the gulab jamun, it is really good.

Arun tea stall.. Or ATS to all xaverians.. This place is a landmark and has rightly cemented it's place as one of the legendary places in Kolkata.Loads of college time memories associated with this place that makes me nostalgic . A steaming cup of arun das special kesariya chai (tea) gave us the energy to survive those 6 am classes. And the kachori sabzi and samosa with jalebi would satiate our hunger pangs during break time or after college.. Visited recently and the bhaiya/bhaiyas manning the counter are as friendly as ever and the food.. Even more delicious...

Visited on last Sunday. Located at theatre road, opposite annaras. I was famished, so thought to visit. Too much crowded. A very small shop. Had ordered for club kachori with Aloo Ka sabji. Kachori was oily, oil was literally filled up in the kachori, it was leaking. Aloo Ka sabji too was not properly cut, some had the potatoes peel too. Was highly disappointed. Staffs were good. Think of your health and then visit.

Today morning only went to this road side tea stall. Well though it is a tea stall but at 9 this place was so crowded that there was no place to stand also. We ordered club kachori, tea and singhara. And the club kachori was really superb. I dint like the singara though and tea was decent too. Do try the club kachori guys..

If somebody has studied in st. Xaviers college.. It's impossible for that student to have never tasted the tea and samosa here.. !  It's awesome and it makes you come back to have tea again n again n again.. 
The only negative is for the parking problem here.. Otherwise .. It's awesome !!

Had seen and heard about this joint a lot, so thought to give it a try as was passing by!
The first word that i can think for it is OVERHYPED!
The chai is pretty average, better than a local roadside shop but no whr close to the famous dhabas chai of the city!
Priced pretty high for the quality and thr quantity as well!

Every Xaverian has had the privilege to have breakfast at 'ATS' as we fondly remember this food joint. The Kachori & Club Kachori is legendary along with the tea and¬†jalebi. The service is something you cannot expect from these small food joints but the ambience is made up with the students of SXC who gather at this very popular food joint.

You will always see students and guys wearing ties and uncles haggling among themselves on chairs around this place because its appeal is universal.

Do not judge by the size of the shop but the food quality is healthy and hygienic enough which is not expected from street stalls like this.  I love this place.  And my favourites are it's 'chai' and 'Gulab jamun'. 
Thankyou,

Xaverians are in love with ATS.. though we get a break of 30 mins and it would take around 8 mins to walk up to it from the back gate and might have to run on our way back to be on time but still we do not mind taking the trip to grab the kachori sabzi or tea or gulab jamun or jalebi or anything on sale here.. Its like the adda place not only for the students but also for the teachers or the office goers with their workplace around.. And the quick bites would make my day if am having a bad college day.. :*

Do give it a try if you are in and around the Xaviers back gate.

Ratings of 3.5 mainly for its tea. 
Arun Tea Stall or ATS, as we Xaverians used to call it, has a nostalgic attachment. We have frequented this place during college days be it summers or rainy day or a chill winter morning. It's quality of tea & quick snacks at reasonable prices and our college-going meagre pocket money had a strong connect. 
I still go there sometimes after my morning walk,  mainly for tea. They serve 'kadak chai' in earthen cups,  the aroma of which is awesome. Their club kachori is also an item to definitely indulge into.
I have always seen this place with people all around. The locational advantage gets it students, office goers, morning walkers, shoppers, adda makers, etc. Plus the quality which they have kept intact over the years. Places like these make the street food of Kolkata so yummy & vibrant and put Kolkata on the gastronomical map of India

Second review : finally gave it a visit this week.. had the mind - blowing tea, mini kachoris, gulab jamun nd the jalebi after a year!! Nd trust me, the taste hasn't changed even a tiny bit! The same old mouth-watering taste swayed me completely! The mini kachoris mainly got me on my knees this time.. the taste nd smell of the hing is so lingering!
Do check out this chai tapri, people.. nd must give it a visit foodies nd all masala chai lovers!

First review: Lip-smacking tea, hot gulab jamuns, mini hing kachori with spicy aloo ki sabzi, crunchy jalebis! Love them all!
I was so regular there even one year back, but couldn't give it a visit for the last one year as i was deported somewhere for some stupid degree course! :( The location is quite tricky..it's situated straight from the back gate of st. Xavier's college..
But as now i am back in town, i would like to give it a visit, real soon! M so dying to dip my lips nd quench my 'tea' thirst in ATS!

I don't drink tea. So, it is very unusual for me to review this tea-junction. But my husband is a tea-addict and always criticize tea if not good. He can feel slightest miss or hit in a tea. And he loves their tea.

We had to literally fight to get a cup of tea here, because this place is always very crowded, whenever you come you have to be in the queue and wait for your turn. Large cars used to stop beside this little stall and enjoy the spirit of kolkata.

This place also sells singara and kachuri in the evening, singara was quite good, crispy, flavoured and hot. And one thing is assured that whatever you buy here is the most fresh item, because when they prepares any thing (tea or snacks whatever) people jumps on it and it is finished in no time.

So, a must visit for tea lovers.. three cheers !

This was one of my first experiences of having tea and I definitely don't regret it. I am a newbie to the tea world but I can easily assure this is one of the best tea served in the area. Didn't order any snack so can't say much about it except the mathri which was at par with the standards.

Some may complain about the hygiene of the store and that can certainly be an issue for them. But given the crowd mostly being college students this doesn't count much. For a student like me what matters is the taste and a small place to sit and talk with my friends. The parking opposite to the store must serve the purpose.

Overall nice experience. The tea is worth tasting once.

This tea and snack outlet located at the theatre road and st xaviers college back gate crossing is a huge hit for the people in the area. I personally find it just about ok. The outlet serves tea, samosa, khasta kachori, aloo vada, mirchi vada and club kachori. The sabzi for the club kachori is extremely spicy nd oily, the other snack items taste fine- samosa being the best of the lot. The gulab jamuns are great but are kept in the open so people mite have doubts over the hygiene!! Tea is good nd is the best seller for the store.

I did not quite imagine that a tea stall would actually feature on zomato. It is one of my super favourite place. An usual place of hangout. After college hours, the only antidote to bad headaches after a hectic day at college , is arun tea stall. This is situated at the crossing if you are walking from st.xaviers backgate towards minto park via hungerford street. It is just bear bean it up. The amazing illachi masala chai is the show stealer. I could not imagine how an ordinary could taste so great. And then lines up the kachori. Ita hot crispy and superbly made. However the jalebis are amazig as well . Crunchy and munchy and the right amount of sweetness. I would rather say I am addicted to arun tea stall,  till I am in xaviers this will be my pick and one can expect to find me out there quite frquently.

I am a sucker for the tea in calcutta. It's so good and refreshing. We went to ATS for breakfast. 
ATS is just a small shop serving tea and other snacks. It doesn't have any seating arrangement and lacks hygiene as well.
However, I love the tea here.  We had also ordered samosas and kachori sabzi, both of which were good. And after fighting the urge and failing to do so, we had the jalebi as well. It was nice too. 
ATS is one of those places you can just go if you want to hang around and need good chai. It doesn't even pinch your pocket so much.

NOTE: ZOMATO Please correct your HIGHLIGHTS. It is not a place which serves "NON VEG"
Arun Tea Stall - A very 'famous' Tea Stall serving hot tea's!
======
Location and Intro: It is located very near to the crossing which comes after crossing Birla High School and walking towards Bean it Up and Kafe Bindass. To be more precise, just in the lane opposite the Next level. It is nothing extraordinary but a mere small stall which serves really good tea at decorous price.¬†

Due to it's great location, a lot of office goers and college students like to sip a cup of tea with a samosa/kachori here and have great conversations. It is not like a place where you can sit or something like that. It is on the road side and hygiene isn't really well...
======
What i tried:¬†

I just tried normal tea here. The tea was served to me hot. It had appropriate amount of sugar and did give you an instant energy boost. ¬†
======
Pros:
1) Location.
2) Price.
3) Serving speed.
4) Pure veg.

Cons:
1) Hygiene i felt can be improved.¬†
======
Snacks for two: 50-120 max.
======
Suggestions
1) Should get more food items and more types of tea's.¬†
======
Conclusion:

I would suggest people to visit this only when they are in that area. A good stall though.¬†
======1) Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

Location: In the lane opposite to Annaras or The Next Level.

Arun Tea Stall or ATS as its known among the people of Kolkata is a hole in the wall where students to seniors visit to enjoy the hot tea along with the delicious samosas, jalebis and kachori Sabji that's served here.
The Jalebis are mildly sweet and have that crunch whereas the Kachoris are soft and non-greasy which are served along with a flavorful potato curry (Aloo Sabji) & tempered green chillies. The samosas have a flavorful filling inside, absolutely delicious.
The tea is served in kulhars/bhands (earthen clay pot) which simply smells heavenly as well as tastes great. A sip by sip process enjoying the flavors is the best one can do!
‚ÄòSlurp‚Äô Mode on!

The servers are quick to serve you and do so with a smile on the face.
Prices wouldn't feel a pinch at all. 

Has always been a good experience.

I don't have tea but this is like a regular adda for my gang. We go there almost everyday after college.  And while they can't stop nagging about how good the cuppa tea is, I have samosas, jalebis or the mirchi bhajiyaas. They are great! Besides these, the poori sabzi too is a quick grab if you're hungry.

Best place to hang out after college or a hard day at work. Even though the place looks shabby and you are served on leaf plates, the food is good.
Watch out for the tea which is a speciality. It is a little expensive for a roadside tea stall at Rs. 10 a cup but its totally worth your money.

My canteen throughout my college life. Every xaverian knows ATS more than the college canteen. Their Chai is my favourite.

Being very near to xavier's, this place is quite popular among all the xaverians. I frequently visit this place.
Two info that zomoto got wrong about this place :
1) it is open from 7, not 10
2) this is a pure veg stall
The best time to go to Arun Tea Stall or ATS as xaverians call it, is in the morning before 10 when the place is teamed with students and joggers. Everything is fresh and hot in the morning. If u r going for the first time, u should try the small kachori with a big tea. Yeah, that is the best thing u can have in Park Street. The tea is made with spices and has a distinct flavour in it. The kachoris are hot and crispy, well u could just call it perfect.
WARNING : Never go this place during off-times. Either go b4 11 or go after 6 but b4 8. Morning time is always preferred.

Honestly I was itching to give this place a 5 but stopped short because this is a whole in the wall eatery...  Not a restaurant so the entire ambiance aspect is missing...  

A shirt intro for my friends who don't hail from Calcutta...  Almost every part of the city has these tea cum breakfast stalls that plate up a gastronomical breakfast.  Typically comprising of club kachori,  samosa, Chai and jalebi... This is a every morning affair,  these places are easy to identify,  you would see an unusually high no of cars and people gather around such eateries with service boys running around with their trays..  

This specific place is not very old but has caught a pretty decent crowd over the last few years,  the popular ones being Sharma, gurudwara , maharani and Annapurna. 

The reason this place stands out is they have the lowest soda content in their kachoris as compared to competition.  Club kachori is a plate of 6 bite sized kachoris or baby kachoris with a bowl of also sabji...  Arun tea stall does and excellent job of adding paneer to its also sabji that brings it an edge...  

The Chai is served in large earthen cup which gives it an amazing taste...  I would call this back to basics...  

As for the samosa definitely better than competition a typical North Indian samosa moderately spiced and an amazing finish to the breakfast. 


Overall the best Calcutta breakfast money can buy...

have been a frequent visitor to this place but never got the chance to write a review.. This place is always crowded be it any time of the day.. The basic tea is amazing.. I usually freak out on kachori sabzi and jalebi specially when they are served hot in the morning just out of the frying pan.. Not a great fan of the samosas here as I find it slightly heavy on the spices and garam masala.. Again Do no miss the gulab jamuns here try to catch it fresh n hot ..

Being a Xavierian i could simply have not missed this place now would i. Serving amazing chai (tastes as good as it smells),samosas and kachori sabzi. 

Was a good option for us alongside delights and yummie . 
My only complain is that its always crowded :| you would get  your order really late and hence  get a good scolding from your proffs back in class for extending your 30mins break to 40 :/ 

Nonetheless, i like this place especially for their tea :)

Whether you're a Xaverian or not, you cannot help but love ATS. It is the quintessential chai stall that dishes up amazing snacks. Their samosas and kachoris are out of this world. When I'm here I throw calorie-counting cares to the wind and just enjoy myself. 
No matter how unhygienic the surroundings may be, DO NOT miss this!

ATs is meant for the masala tea, jalebis and singaras. One samosa is enough to fill your stomach if you are not a big foodie. whenever i go there, i always have the tea because its so good. Also, sometimes they fry pakoras and chilli fries occassionally, and its really good and served hot.

Arun and Jagdamba tea stalls were the ones that used to be the favorite destination for our gang during the college days, even above the sharmas or russell dhaba for the consistently amazing tea made by these two places. These people take every care that the tea is made to your liking if you are fussy about it otherwise, they generally do not go wrong with their tea. They do offer samosas, kachori subzi and various sweets to go alongside but i went for the samosas generally which was their best offering yet very ok if i should be honest. But a samosa with tea of theirs in the morning could be a real treat.

One of the best places to have Chai in the area its great to go especially in the cooler months. This place is frequented by morning walkers, office goers and students and that itself illustrates its popularity. The Kachori Subzi , Nimkin, SInghara  and Jalebi all pair well with their excellent tea. If you like your Chai drop by for a taste.

ATS is a very significant chunk of nostalgia associated with college life for every early morning Xaverian. The 8am breaks and the outflow of a hoarde of students of BCom morning towards ATS through the back gate of the college, speaks volumes about the tiny establishment 10 minutes walk from the college. The tea is slurpilicious. The samosas and kachoris are good. The kachori sabzi is also very good in taste. However, the hygiene factor is next to nil. So, I personally choose to avoid ATS snacks. However, just for the sake of nostalgia, the steaming tea and happy memories with friends, this chai shop scores a notch!

From college back gate to ATS... Catching up with friends over a cup of tea... From ATS to college. All in 20mins. And you have a recipe for a perfect college break during winters.

Arun Tea Stall is a treat for all Xaverians. Its the place which has the largest crowd gathered for the tea that they serve. There are many people working and they serve you quite fast. Personalised tees given to all the people working show their growth. They have mouth watering samosas, jalebis etc etc. There's nothing at Arun Tea Stall which you wont like. They just need to think more about their pricing and try keeping the place clean. Otherwise, its the best!
