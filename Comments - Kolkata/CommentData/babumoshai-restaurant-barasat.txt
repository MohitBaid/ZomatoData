So ordered a home delivery - pure bengali food.
Rice, dal, begun bhaja, phoolkopi, bhetki jhal and khasir mangsho.
It was really nice in the sense its like home cooked food - taste is very balanced - will easily cater to a large bengali audience.
So from this perspective, i was very happy. The dal, begun bhaja, phoolkopi were all nicely done. Rates also are nominal. The bhetki jhal was the only surprise, we expected a cut from a large fish, but it turned out to be small bhetki whole - so even though that was a big surprise but it was well prepared. The mutton curry was also well done. Rice was slightly on the lesser side for me - as i eat quite a bit of rice for dinner - but should be enough for most people.
So if you want pure home style bengali food - this is definitely an option worth trying.

This rating is for the behavior of the staffs out there. They r so rude!! My parents and I went to this place couple of months before..... The taste of the food is pretty good. Nothing extra ordinary. But the behavior that I got from the waiter was very much astonishing. Our bill was around 900 and I have given a 2k rupees note and he behaved in such a way like it was my blunder in doing so. I will never recommend anyone to go there. Very much disappointed

Food is ok type and price is too high according to the taste, but apart from this I want to share a very bad experience. Before some days I went here with my mother for lunch. There one guy who was there for serving food and for taking the order, he was continuously staring at us and we were feeling very unwell for this. Then at the end he gave me the feedback page, I filled it up with some of my personal and contact information. After leaving the restaurant I started getting unusual missed call several times. True caller showing his name. I thought that it can be some other person, but before some days I saw a profile on fb of the same name and it was that guy who was there in the restaurant. I can remember his face. Then when he called me again I told him that I got his name and number. After that he stopped annoying me. But my point is this is their hospitality to collect girl's number for their personal use as the name of feedback. This is bullshit. How can u guys do this? It's very cheap thing.

Have been here a couple of times a while back. The biggest obstacle is travelling all the way up to the 2nd or 3rd floor to eat which itself is a feat.
The ambiance is cozy and nice. The attendants are quiet and not very loud.
Overall food is good. Nothing very special, and yet nothing very poor. It'll be much like a very normal dine out for anyone.
This is a local favourite of many. So it does get packed at the times of festivals and occasions.

Babumoshai restaurant is a good restaurant but not the best it is located in Jessore Road near Madhyamgram. This restaurant is very much suitable for those who come along with their families and friends.Â 

Waiters here are friendly but not properly trained, but if you explain them in casual tone, they will surely help  you out. But, they simply do not understand the professional tune of the customers.Â 

The food quality and quantity is well enough according to its price. They have a decent ambience and services but it made me down with there presentation.

I would recommend be their once with your family if you are looking for a nice decorated place to have lunch or dinner in this area.

Please don't go to this restaurant. Day by day the food quality is degrading here , We have ordered Chicken Sweet Corn Soup in the starter which was so must disgusting in taste also very much sweet , also In the main course we have ordered Mutton Biryani with Chicken Chap and we get a plate of super Oily Biryani and Â very oily Chicken Kosha instead of Chap. Also the behaviors of waiters are so much bad , They will force you to take Mineral Water Â with a cost of Rs.30/- . Also at the time of payment they are refusing to accept card and telling that to check the door entry before entering to the restaurant. This is the present condition of a once well known Restaurant in Madhyamgram . Better to go "Sukno_Lanka" Â by walking a few mile from the restaurant towards Doltala. You will have a better menu , better ambiance also better quality of food with a Suitable price.

Been here several times on several occasions, and what I have found is that this restaurant is one of the best in Madhyamgram, their food is good and the quantity is not to bad either, though the price for the location seems a bit high, but one wouldn't mind paying that extra amoung for sitting is well maintained dining area. What can be improved is the time taken for an order to arrive.

P.S. They have also introduced a "bangali ghor" or something alike, where they serve you in brass utensils.

This restaurant is just on the Madhyamgram Chowmatha Jessore road. I have visited this place a couple of time. Ambiance is not on the excellent level however it's good. Staff behavior is always good & all of them are always happy to help. Now coming to the food part; the menu is compact & it includes Chinese & North Indian dishes. You might not find so much of variety on the menu however most of the well known dishes are available. Ice Creme is available in the menu but not available at the kitchen. Apart from Egg, Chicken, Mutton & Pron; they do not serve anything else hence please do not expect. :) Â 

My best pick for this restaurant would be Full Chicken Tandoori. They are expert on this.

First of all,the only condition you come here is that Bhajohari Ranna is overcrowded and unable to offer you a seat.And why would you come?
Food quality is not brilliant,prices are a bit higher.
Service is poor,to be precise.They won't give you spoons,won't visit your table for a second time until you call them.The disgusting part is that one or two houseflies seem to enjoy the food with you(happened with us),and they don't give a shit.
Lastly,unlike Bhajohari, you have to pay 20% tax which is not always a decent amount.

They have a special menu for puja which doesn't have Chinese starter's. Most of the item's were omitted from the list so we were left with very few options.went with school friend's and had to wait, which is usual during this time of year. As soon as we went in there was a lot of ruckus, a waiter behaved badly regarding a seat placement with customer. Anyways we orderd Indian starter's, butter tandoori roti and a chicken biryani. The biryani didn't had "aloo" , the waiter later brought a spare piece. The tandoori roti were good, but the second round of order took almost 20 mins to get delivered at table. Chicken reshmi reshmi butter masala was the best dish we had alongwith chicken tikka kebab and chicken reshmi kebab. The green chutney was too thin and non viscous as if a lot of water has been added to increase the amount. The waiter after much hullabaloo provided with more forks and spoon. We were 7 but were provided with 5 set of spoon n forks. This was my first visit to this outlet, was a letdown.

Located in Madhyamgram Chowmatha, it is near barasat but not in Barasat. Location is good, but day by day the quality is degrading, ambiance is too good, even in rush times they arrange waiting rooms.....however food is not upto the mark now, it has the location advantage, else it was goo earlier but not now. In last durgapuja times, we ordered garlic chicken but we got almost boiled water type dish, also ordered Sezwan Rice, but what we got ? Red chilli powder scattered over the yellow rice. Not liking this restaurant these days.

The restaurant, Babumoshai, has recently emerged as one of the finest in the locality. It has a wide variety of cuisines ranging from pure Bengali cuisines to the steamed, fried Chinese cuisines... The ambience and the cooperative nature of its staffs have created a different impact. A few of the dishes like Daal Makhhani, Chicken Reshmi Kebab etc. are worth trying.

Nonetheless one may try out the naan and the other side dishes there.

I have given some bad reviews but when I thought of writing about this place I began to wonder what shall I write Cz bad would be good for them as they should be marked worst. 
Located just a walk from Madhyamgram bus stop,  I have been there twice and both time the experience have been realy awful. 
They serve water in plastic glasses which are not clean and the plates are also not cleaned properly.
The people serving the dishes Wil make you feel that they are doing an favour on you by giving you food that you r paying for. 
Now coming to the quantity of food..
 Aaaaaaaaa what to say... Even the road side street food of madhyamgram taste better than the dishes served here.
Starting of tandoori chicken to sizzlers one is as bad as the other.. Sizzler served are a complete mess... Even any other item you order it's as bad as it gets... So if you realy want to spoil you dinner or lunch dn make sure you vist this place.... Said all this Nw I wounder hw did I give even 1 rating to them... Zomato you guys should think about introducing negative rating... ;)

It is really hard to write a review for this place because they are always changing. The ambiance is sometimes good and sometimes not so much. They keep changing the arrangements.

The same is true with food quality. Some days the food is alright, but then there are times when it's not well cooked and tastes awful.

The service isn't up to the mark as they take too much time to deliver you your order. And what is most frustrating is that many of the dishes, which are listed in the menu, aren't available for order. 

Overall, if you live nearby, have a thin purse, and you  are feeling lucky on a particular day then you may eat here. Otherwise, it may not worth your money.

In the whole of madhyamgram-barasat area, this is the second best family restaurant that comes after Bhojohori Manna. Service is polite. Food quality is good so is quantity.

This place is just awful. They always tried go make the interior look good but when they are doing that they forget to give attention towards the food. Food quality is 2.5 out 5 (max) ambiance 3 service 2. Quantity of food is not enough for even 1 person per plate. If u order dishes which isn't common like Biriyani or Fried rice you will get only one answer "Not Available" time doesn't matter. I know this place from the beginning I suggest you don't go over there unless you don't have any option.

Horrible experience. I went Yesterday (25th Nov'16) with my sister. We ordered food. Then I asked for water. They offered Bottled Water, I asked for regular water. They said , They don't have it. Strange right, How came a restaurant does not have water. After insisting, The waiter replied, If you can't afford it, don't drink. ( SERIOUS DOES ANYONE EXPECT SUCH RESPONSE )

Then, comes to food, Ordered Mixed Noodles, received Chicken noodle. I asked him, why we were not informed. They said, there is no ingredient available. 

The noodle was extremely oily and extra soggy. I can cook better then them.

Finally asked for bill, Then provided it after 5 min. ( Normal ). I said i will be paying it via card, The waiter said we don't accept card. I know they do accept card as before i paid via card many times. 

My personal recommendation : DON'T VISIT THEM. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.

Babumoshai is one of the worst restaurant i have ever come across..Taste and Quality of Food is pretty mediocre and price is sky high. Middle class family can't afford to have food in here. The Only good thing about this restaurant is its ambiance. Don't waste your Money. Avoid this place.  From Barasat to Airport there is only one good restaurant called Mayur (Doltala). You will get full value for your money over there.

This place is seriously........... 
I donot have to describe this place. I have never been to a third grade place like this.The food was not evenly cooked,too salty and tasteless.Very bad customer service as well.Waited for an hour get the horrible food.They also request you to make a membership card as they are going to give you discount if you visit next time.I am never going to repeat my mistake...Please avoid this place....

In Babumosai restaurant a bunch of THUGS are doing a business of ROBBERY in a legal way. Never think of visiting this third grade restaurant. Quality of food is mere average and price is sky touching. These people are cheating their customers in two ways.

Way #1: Exorbitant price.
Way#2: Inadiquate quantity.

I think local administration should immediately take action against this dishonest restaurant owner.

I went there yesterday night to have dinner with my family and so i have to wait there to get a chance for seating arrangement as it happens usually during durga puja but alas our wait for dinner goes in vain as the food were terrible. There was no any taste in garlic fish and the vegetable fried rice was also non-eatable.And the service was worst but the cost of the price of all items were very high in comparison of their standard of food they are serving to the customers by making fool out of them.I have decided that I will never visit BABUMOSHAI again to give it a next chance as before also it has provided me worst food and service. But I thought to give it a next chance but alas it haven`t improve either.

I went here 1 month back. This is only a good restro at madhyamgram. i went there with my friends for one my friend's birthday treat. Its a big restro with 2 division. Well decorated. Atmosphere is. Ambiance is good. Staffs and service is good. U can find both Chinese and indian foods here. i ate chicken Biriyani and chicken do piyaja. I must say u should try chicken do piyaja. Prices are very low compared to its foods. so there will be no pressure at ur money bag and u will be satisfied. I will sure go there again and again.
