Close to the New Alipore petrol pump, perhaps this is the only place in the neighborhood that serves alcohol and cocktails. We have tried everything here from Biryani to Kebabs to Chinese. Everything tastes more decent than you expect out of a neighborhood eatery.

I really like this place .
It is situated a little away from the New Alipore Petrol pump but it is within walkable distance .
I like the interiors and their food quality .
I had gone here to drink some beers and they have a separate bar too.
You can enjoy your food with a loved one here as it's a perfect place for a date.
I highly recommend you this place .

This place serves good food.I personally find both quanity and quality of food equally good here.At zyka one gets value for money and the taste of the food here is equally good.I'm a vegetarian so i can personally give my review on the vegetarian delicacies served here but my non-vegetarian friends also like the food that is served here.
Private parties in the banquets to fine-dining zyka has never failed to serve me well.My personal favorite here is Dry Chilli Mushroom, Paneer Malai Tikka ,Crispy Chilli Babycorn,Veg Chinese Sizzlers(this comes with different sauce & one can cherrypick as per their taste buds),Subz Miloni Saagwala,Paneer Butter Masala etc
The Vegetable Biryani is also good in taste.
Sizzling Brownie from the menu completes your dinner here.

I went to this place during the Durga Puja period.The menu was different from their normal menu.Got a chicken chinese starter it was good.I then ordered a mutton biryani which had price of around 285.It tasted horrible.More expensive than the best biryani spots in Kolkata and not even near what other places serve in terms of taste.That was my last visit for sure.

Went for lunch with my friends and must say was quite pleasantly surprised. The menu has an assortment of chinese and indian delicacies.

We ordered  cheese spinach roles for starters and they were really creamy and soft. We had cheese naan, murgh tikka masala, mixed vegetable curry, schezwan fried rice and chilli chicken for the main course. I was pleasantly surprised that each and every item was well prepared.

The bill was just 916 rupees and that was a bonus!

Will defo go again!

The service was unmatachable......i had a problem with a dish for which immediately the team apologized and  cancelled the item of my bill even when i had ate a bit of the dish. Also the reccomendations were spoton as per our requirement. Completely blown away by their service and politeness standards. Kudos to the team.

Overall food and service level is good except the behaviour from the captain of the restaurant Mr.Das...he is very rude and don't know how to behave with the customer's.I am very often visitors to this restaurant with my friends and close ones .But inspite of vising their with family I don't like to sit at 3rd floor which is for family but we prefer to sit at 4th floor that is bar only only because of him as he is having less interference over there. We like the ambience and food quality very much but now I think need to search for some other option to spend quality time apart from your restaurant.

We had gone their during the Pujas. 
Anyone will love a restaurant like this. The ambience is perfect. 
We had chicken, lamb and fish for starters. 
Lime soda which was perfect. 
And fried rice and hot garlic chicken for main course. 
The ambience and the food both satisfied us immensely. 
They could just include some variety of desserts in their menu that would add up my rating to 5.

Durga puja is all about pandal hopping and dining out.we were completely exhausted and found zyka to be the nearest one.we thought of a queue but to our surprise we didnt have to wait a sec. The restaurant is well decorated wid a classy look..the staffs r humble and i must say they maintained their food quality and quantity even during the puja rush.
We ordered chinese delicacies comprising of mixed friedrice, schezwan fish, chicken manchurian, mixed hakka noodles and mixed cantonese noodles. The food was light and tasty and it cost us 1475... We were 5 and thus i found it to be budget friendly.

Kolkata, known for its culture n larger than life ways of Celebrating any Festivals. Durga Puja being Bengali's One of the Main Festivals,Puja Madness is sure clear here. During such Madness we went Zyka @12:30am after all pandal hopping , but being in this prime location Just Opposite to the New Alipore Puja Pandal,be sure there'll be Chaos in this time. But after a wait of 15 mins when we finally got Seats. Ordered Chicken Noodles, Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken Paneer Nazakat and tandoori Rotis, Food is reasonably good, Staff is prompt, in this cozy Vintage looking Restaurant. A Pocket friendly Restaurant must be in our checklist during this tiring hours. Though the bar section closes pretty soon considering the festive season.

Though I just had the starter and the desert I mentioned above, but I am surely visiting again to try their main course as well.

Located in Block p New Alipore, this restaurant may be a bit tricky to find for non locals like me. But once you reach you are surely going to enjoy their food and mocktails. Zyka specialises in North Indian and Chinese cuisine and I must say a few of the kebabs I had there are surely going to take me back! The Murgh Chandi Kebab and the Mutton Kabarrgah which is a Kashmiri speciality were my personal favorites. They have excellent vegetarian options as well. Their mocktails are again something I totally loved with Red alert being my pick. And the Sizzling Brownie with that generous dollop of icecream was the perfect end to the delicious experience at Zyka. If you are staying in and around Alipore and have yet not tried this place it is time you head there soon with friends and family for a sumptuous meal. Cheers!

"Big Name But Small Attitude" - One liner to explain this place.
 My family bought many nearbuy coupons and came to this place with a lot of excitement and happiness to eat as a family together after spending around 1k. But we were awestruck as when we came here we were very rudely and unprofessionally told that we need to take a prior reservation at this place. I said fine not an issue I will take an appointment with the manager as the restaurant was completely vacant with not even a single table occupied. But this where we were completely disheartened as the manager told us appointment could not be provided and we should leave if we cannot pay for a fresh order. 

Now coming to the things I faced at this restaurant:

1. The head staff was very rude, unapologetic and arrogant at the same time about the services being offered.

2. The manager was everything as explained above but to one more level higher than this guy, as he is supposed to help the customers, not add more misery to their outing.

3. The service is pathetic as you are supposed to wait for 53 mins from the time you order your food.

4. A restaurant of a good repute should always know that turning away a family from a place is not only unprofessional but also inhuman.

P.S - If I had an option of giving a rating of 0 star I would have preferred that.

Sorry for making it very long, but wanted to ensure that the other customers never face such a situation with their family

I wish I could have reviewed Zyka on it's food and ambience as it did look appealing from the 'outside' but its service was horrible, pathetic and extremely dissatisfactory. Asked to leave, 'AFTER' being offered a seat stating their tables were all reserved. This was 'later' after being offered a seat. Management was unapologetic nor were they professional. Extremely rude, refuse to serve me food and a huge waste of time I walked off without eating. Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed.

We bought nearbuy coupons and went there, but they refused to serve us because apparently we needed to prebook a table . When we reached, the staff was very rude to us and directly refused to serve us. Very disrespectful and rude behaviour. The whole restaurant was empty, not a single customer yet they insisted that they could not serve us and their tone was very disrespectful.  Would never go back to this place not would not suggest anyone else to go as well. No matter how good the food is, disrespecting and rude behaviour from the staff and manager is not acceptable.

When we reached, the staff was very rude to us and directly refused to serve us. Very disrespectful and rude behaviour. The whole restaurant was empty, not a single customer yet they insisted that they could not serve us and their tone was very disrespectful.  Would never go back to this place not would not suggest anyone else to go as well. No matter how good the food is, disrespecting and rude behaviour from the staff and manager is not acceptable.

One of the finest dining one could ever visit.
This is situated just opposite to shuruchi sangha .
A place to be pocket friendly according to their food and the waiters were so good üòç

I never knew this place existed like 300 metres away until yesterday night. It's a very good place both for family people and those who want some noise and drinks. I went to the latter one. Ordered half tandoori murgi and Chinese sizzler veg with couple of beers.
Tandoori murgi was really good. Tender, juicy, smoked and little bit spicy. And sizzler was also good, especially the noodles in it. Beer is always good xD
Hidden gem, I guess.

Nice place to hangout, BAR is awesome with loads of options... Only CLASSY bar in and around behala & newalipore... Food is good, specially starters, Lat-me-kai, konjee chicken... Main course food is also good, quantity is sufficient... But biryani section should improve more... Chicken served is raw many times...

We had no clue, that such a nice restaurant we had in our near locality! 

Newest addition for the foodies.. Spacious, prompt services are the main keys!! 

We had Kabab platter, butter tandoori and murg lababdar!! 

Food - 4/5

Services - 3.5/5


Ambience - 4/5

P.s : the only draw back is, it is bit hard to locate!

Horrible  attitude  of Mr.  Uttam... Whoso ever he is.. 

I bought  nearby  voucher  and  called up for  reservation.  I was informed  that they don't  take  booking to which  I  mentioned  i ve nearby  voucher.  Luckily  I  took  the  gentleman  name  Mr.  Hazra.  

On reaching  at 9.15we notice  a long waiting  period. Requesting  for a  table for  3we waited for more than an hour.  At 10. 25i went to  the  manager  and  asked him to atleast  take my voucher  details.  To my shock  he said that  without  reservation  the voucher  cannot be accepted.  

I told him about my conversation  with  Mr.  Hazra and  then another  gentleman  came Mr.  Uttam... (ving an extremely  obnoxious  attitude  for a service  industry) claiming that i must ve called  mr.  Hazra but i did not   bother  to  mention  about  the  voucher.  I reasoned why  I  would  come  if he refused  over the ph.  

Its not about  the  fact that I  couldn't  use the voucher  the disgusting  and irritating  part was the attitude  of Mr. Uttam.  Highly  unprofessional  nd  arrogant  for a hotel  industry.  Esp seeing  that i ve a small  child  with  me... He did not bother  and behaved as if he is doing me a favour.  

I ve visited  zyka quite  often since it is close to my  residence   but this  time  it was a big  put off.  At 10.40i left  the restaurant  without  eating  with a 3old child. 

Bad attitude  and  arrogance  will not  take you  places Mr.  Uttam.  Moreover  if u guys had so much business  that to honour  a nearby voucher is a problem and pain with u all then u  should  not  have  enrolled  ur restaurant in nearby. 

Sorry but extremely  disappointed and disgusted  with  the  attitude.

Ordered nizami murgh tonight, and I am very happy with the taste of the dish.There was no excess oil in the dish and it was perfectly cooked and well served.But I was disappointed with the vinegar dipped onions provided as complimentary which were rotten..Either the onions were rotten or that the onions have been dipped in vinegar for quite a long time which has spoilt the freshness and the taste. I was pretty surprised.When you can charge this much as good as any standard restaurant, why were such rotten onions and lemon wedges served? Couldn't you spend another 2-3 rupees for some fresh onions? It might be that they were two/three days old, but a restaurant like Zyka can definitely afford that much! I take this as ur staff's carelessness/negligence and forgive as I was pretty happy with the taste. Cheers!

Visited the resto on valentines day with friends & family. Really appreciated the prompt table arrangement by the staff even though there was rush, but not like Puja. The ambience was good and retro. ¬†We were there at around 10 pm. sat on the 4th floor. I don't know why at just 10 pm quite a number of menu items were not available. All went well except the Masala Kulcha & Lachha Paratha. I have never seen in my whole life potato being stuffed in Masala Kulcha and any paratha being cooked in tandoor. Lachha paratha is made using Maida on a normal tawa with layers of paratha coming off as u eat. When I asked the guy serving he said " This is the way we make here". Please don't say like this, coz then tomorrow u serve Khichdi with meat pieces and say this is the way make it here. U just can't change the very basic of the food, it's not cooking. U can't make Lachha Paratha in tandoor & stuff aaloo in masala kulcha coz then it would be called aaloo paratha. I am saying this as I am sailor by profession travelling the whole world & am also a chef by hobby and can line up suggestions from many chefs who will tell u the same. Please ask your chef to improvise his cooking style and discuss with some experts. This was a first time experience & I would visit again to check out more. Please keep scope for improvement.

Lovely little place in Block P,  New Alipore with an option of seating and serving on multiple floors. The food is delicious and deserves a 4 rating but the size of each floor is so small that you can hang onto each tables conversation which might suit a cafe but not a fine dine restaurant and hence the 3.5 rating.

They serve a wide variety of Indian and Chinese and since they have a bar attached they are always packed. Lovely kebabs reminding me of the fare in some of the bigger restaurants in the city. Soft instrumental music was the icing on the cake and overall a delightful experience.

Cheers,

If the ambience and service is not a factor, you have hit the jackpot! Very affordable place with excellent tasting food! The only Bar in New Alipore, has excellent Biryani and Dal to begin with. All the Indian Options in the Menu as excellent and worth trying. I suggest a Take Away more than Sit and Eat!

There is nothing over the top about this place, you would get simple and tasty food and it is pocket friendly... The place specializes in north indian and mughlai preparation...

Had gone there a couple of times with my friend and came out with our tummies full and a smile on our faces... 

The quantity of the food is good and the service is also pretty good... Also they have different sitting area for families and for people who wanna drink...

All in all a good place to go for a budget meal with frnds or family..

Pathetic food, Pathetic staff.
Went there during Puja on Navami night and got seats instantly as the restaurant was quite empty before we came.
That day, we asked their staff in morning till when the restaurant will be open and will they be serving alcohol or not to which their staff replied that they are open till 3 AM..
After getting the seat we ordered the bar menu to which they replied that they won't be serving alcohol in a very rude manner. Even the manager didn't had the courtesy to apologise to us.
So as we were already hungry, we ordered two starters which was served in half an hour. It was just 10 minutes since we started having the starter and they came and served the main course without even asking us. It was like we were sitting there as govt. school students and they were serving us mid day meals. Trust me, I never felt so insulted before that with 2-3 waiters standing on our head so that as soon as we finish with a dish, they can serve the next.
BTW the food was awful. Even a street food stall would have served better food than them with much better behaviour.
We were so pissed with their food & service that we just paid the bill and escaped to The Park.
Won't recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for good food and a bit of good behaviour.

We went there on navami night and managed to get a seat instantly. Then came an array of shocks. Though we got in at 11.45pm, we got to know that the bar has been closed and they won't be serving alcohol.We had called them early during the day to confirm about the bar, timings and they had said it's open till 1/2am. The waiter got into an argument and started behaving like he is going to pay our bills üòÇüòÇ I even requested them (Since I could see few sipping drinks) but the manager came and totally denied their confirmation, early this morning.
Anyways? We ordered two starters and two chicken sides with breads.Both the sides tasted alike, haha.And guess what? Whole dinner was over for less than 30 mins. Why?They almost stood on the top of our heads. They kept serving and wanted us to gulp and leave. So that they could make way for new birds üòÇüòÇWe left the place and hopped into The Park! Damn us, for trying this creepy and crap place. Never again!

We found cockroach cooked along with the rice .
It was fried and roasted and i puked right inside the 
Restaurant on the table.
They don't have a proper chef and don't pay them because which their food is cooked by delivery boy and the security guard. We were shocked to see when called the manager that who had cooked this food the delivery boy was brought by the manager ,
as he along with the security guard cook every food.
Earlier its food quality was top notch however now its
Unhygienic, unhealthy and some times even dangerous.

Went there during the Durga puja. This one is right next to Suruchi Sangha. The staffs were very courteous and were very efficient in providing the order on time. The food quantity was good as well. The only thing I disliked was the schezwan chicken which didn't taste pretty good and was also too spicy(I am saying this despite being a lover of spicy foods). Worth going during the pujas as there were no long ques like other places.

Just been here today, we saw reviews on zomato and were unsure about the place but we took the challenge and visited! 
So the place obviously looks good, they have dining at 5th floor and very wonderful people. 
I don't know why there is low rating but the place is lovely. They have well maintained it. 
We have tried Chinese Chopsuey along with Chilly chicken and the food was unexpectedly good! 
I loved the food and they even have drinks, so plus point.. So it was worth taking risk and the place turned out wonderfully well..

I visit zyka almost ¬†every week since months. The tandoori mushroom and paneer chandi tikka is super amazing and to die for, a must try for everyone.
Not to miss the Manchow soup.
Dal Makhani and paneer lababdaar has become my all time favourite.

The building has been decorated pretty well.
Even the interiors is at its minimal , which gives this place a sophisticated look.

The food is super good!
The butter paneer masala that we ordered was so good. Every where else you get it with some colour added. But here we got it just like it should have been. The daal makhani was tasty as well.
The pindi chana was a little dry and was made in too much masala.
The quantity was adequate as well.
Naan and kulchas were served well.

A super filling meal at a great price!

I have liked this place. I have tried crispy chill babycorn, noodles and chinese side dishes here and i have loved each and every dish. Nothing unique but whatever they serve is tasty, fresh and good. Service is good. Ambience is good too. Waiters are very helpful in explaining whatever asked. Have visited this place during Durga Pujas too and though we do not expect perfect food during that rush hour, we have got what we were wishing for. So a good place for lunch and dinner even if its a rush hour.

Been there several times.. food is good. Price is reasonable and quantity served is also good. Although not so spacious nor a theme based restaurant but if you are looking for good north indian food in new alipore area then this is really a good choice. It is suggested that they should open up membership and give it to customers who are frequent visitors.

Zyka has become 'the' go to place for our family whenever there's a special occasion or simply when we are in no mood to eat home cooked food. Located right opposite the upcoming Ideal Exotica housing project, it is one of the closest restaurants to my house (after Kowloon) - however the close proximity is not the only reason why we visit Zyka so frequently. The staff out there are one of the most friendliest bunch I've seen - starting from the guard at the entrance, the lift man, the servers, the manager and till the chefs - each and everyone is extremely polite and they look out for you with extreme care. The decor and the ambience too is worth a mention and it has got quite a cosy feel to it. For the food I would definitely recommend ordering the North Indian dishes (if you really want to eat Chinese you might as well go to Kowloon instead). Both the chicken biriyani and the mutton biriyani is to die for! The kebab platter is also really tasty and therefore worth a try. The chicken and mutton side dishes are swoon worthy - some of my top favorite dishes are Rara Gosht, Murg Lababdar and Murg Nazakat. You get complimentary raita with the biriyani that you order which is like a double win as the raita too is one of the best I've ever had! You can also order pineapple raita or boondi raita - they both are worth a try. For drinks I usually order a sweet lime soda which isn't too sweet or too soda-ish. I tried my first cocktail here - a Bloody Mary that too and it wasn't bad. For desserts I've had Tutty Fruity and Sizzling Brownie with ice cream and I feel both of them must be tried - they're both utterly delicious! If all this doesn't make Zyka a must visit restaurant I don't know what else will! Looking forward to my next visit already!

It's a good place for a family lunch/dinner albeit being a comparatively small place. With a lightly lit ambience and comfortable chairs to sit on, this place makes you feel absolutely at ease. I have been here twice and the staff have been extremely courteous both the times. They don't take a lot of time to serve the food, and the food tastes good too. 
In case you are going there with your family of more than ten people try calling them up and reserve the only 10+ seater table they have. In my case though, they didn't allow pre-booking but that's probably because another family was already there before us. We had to split up into five people in different tables which was a bit annoying. 

They serve both Indian as well as Chinese. Food is served well in time and one doesn't have to wait for long. And the quality of the food as well as the quantity hasn't disappointed me even once. 

One thing that I really liked about the place were the collection of photographic art lining the staircase upto the restaurant. The restaurant is in the fourth floor and lift is really really small( capable to transporting a maximum of 3 people at a time). Therefore, I took the stairs up, and boy was I intrigued. I loved the photographs that were put up on every wall and I would have taken images of the same to be added here if I wasn't too busy analysing them.

It was saptami. After visiting suruchi we headed to zyka for lunch. It was around 1.30 pm n thankfully we immediately got to sit.  We were taken to the top floor it was empty then. The decor gives a forest look. I have ordered veg noodles n chilli chicken n fresh lime soda. The food was served in no time.  Taste wise good. Service was prompt.  Staffs were good.  By the time we finished our food the room was full and a long queue waiting outside. price is quite cheap.

I ordered dinner for one person from this place which according to menu should have costed me 180 maximum (including taxes), but when I received my order, I had to pay 100 bucks extra and when I asked the delivery boy about difference in rates, he just said new rates are not updated. Although the taste and quality was good, but as a customer you also check the price and in that matter, it was disappointing.

This is happening for the second time. The order that was placed was not what I received. They have been consistently missing one or two items in the order received. I have attached a screenshot of the order placed and a picture of the bill mentioning the items received. They missed one item. Extremely disappointed with Zomato and Zyka both. What's the point of ordering online if it has to be monitored by the customer till it reaches him or her. On the other hand foodpanda as an online platform looks more hassle free in cases like these. Zomato as an online ordering platform isn't the option I'm gonna look for next time I guess!

Located in new alipore, this place is a comfortable little space for a delicious north Indian lunch or dinner. After a long tiring trip, we dropped by here for our lunch and ordered Kadhai murg along with butter tandoori roti. The dish was extra spicy and filing just as we wanted. Pineapple raita deserves a mention too which appeased our burning taste buds after that spicy lunch.

I only had the chinese bit of Zyka, everytime I ate there so my ratings are on the basis of that. Wish they had O2 so that ordering would be a quicker process. Calling them makes it more difficult as there tends to be a lot of commotion coming from the receiver's end and also they take a pretty decent amount of time in telling me how much my bill amount is.
Now for the dishes :
- Dragon's fire - Its pretty good. I quite liked it.
- Konjee crispy chicken- Was crispy but a bit hard and more important was floating in oil. Pretty GROSS actually.
- Kum Pao Chicken (one of my all time favourites when it comes down to chinese cuisine) - Was average at best. Nothing to go gaga about
- Mixed meet non veg rice - Was good . I quite liked it actually.
- American Chop Suey - Was very average. The sauce with the chop suey was wayyyyyyy to sweet.

This place is okay. A one time visit place, it has decent food. We ordered the crackling spinach with mushroom and malai paneer tikka for starters which were good. For main course we ordered subzi kadai, malai kofta and dal. Malai kofta and dal were good, but the subzi was below mediocre. The place was reasonable as well. You can try it once. It's near super snack bar in new alipore. For veggies one of the problems can be the odour. The place stinks non veg. Veggies may find it difficult.

This place is located right opposite to upcoming ideal group project ' exotica ', just a 2 minutes ride from the famous Suruchi Sangha.
Its a huge accommodating restaurant cum bar.
The place has a good ambience with nice interiors and some good music to hear. The staircases are also very well decorated with world's some of great picturesque's.
The restaurant is on the fourth floor preceded by a bar on the fifth floor.
We decided to have a booze so we moved on to the fifth floor. It had a very unique look to it made up with bamboo's all over with a small TV playing music.
Coming to food we ordered chilled beer along which they served peanuts with.
Apart from that we ordered crispy chilli baby corn which was just awesome, a must try.
Also we had lat me kai which was a let down for me, could have been much better.

Being a member gives u 25% off on ur pocket pinch. That makes it a pocket friendly affair.

A nice place to visit with quick service and courteous servers.

Overall a good experience.

In a very secluded part of New Alipore, the restaurant is nestled in. it is a nicely decorated place with a good cover and also party arrangements.

We went there to celebrate my birthday this year. We all started with some beer. The waiters were little on the slower side. The order taking and the delivering was a bit too slow for my liking. The appetizers were nice and warm but.

The main course we went with the Chinese stuff. The food was decent. I would say because of its location, the prices were a little exorbitant. The service could be much better though.

I would say it‚Äôs a nice and cozy place to enjoy a quiet evening.

Upon entry we were greeted by a rather inquisitive security guard who pointed us to an elevator which could hardly fit three at a time ( we were 6). So the restaurant is at the 4th floor preceded by a bar. We chose the former and entered. You'd notice very comfortable seating arrangements and equally splendid table set up. We noticed the tumblers which reminded me of roadside mini glasses for tea.  Menus were given promptly and led us to order a Chinese two course.  Firstly the soup appeared which pleased us. The sweet corn lacked the sweet but made up for it with the quantity. We ordered the baby corn crisps which happens to be a main selling point for this joint.  They happen to provide a ginger garlic sauce which is replenished if desired - amazing. Now this is when everything went downhill. We wanted to have a simple meal of fried rice and chicken. The rice was of inferior quality - big and roundish and the chicken hardly had any zing at all. Perhaps the same sauce to fry is used irrespective of the dish. The server himself was unsure what kind of fish was available in stock. The very limited dezzert menu didn't give me a chance to get hopes high either. Guess when here, one should stick to side dishes.

Best thing no one even apologised. Simply  took it away... After 15 mins gave the rest of the order. Which was just about ok.... think twice... although the decor is nice but the food is lower than average and it might serve you a specially prepared dish with rotten ingredients.

The restaurant is a fraud. After purchasing a deal from little I happen to call them, they said the deals are closed for Puja and will start post 30th Oct. Today I happen to call them and they refused stating the deal is not valid when in fact the deal is still showing active on little (screenshot taken today).

Serving both Indian Mughlai and Chinese, these place a variety of foods to offer, and specially because I stay nearby, gives me a chance to try out some dishes in the weekend.¬†

Their Chicken Broccoli Corn Cream Soup is really good.¬†

Always ordered and had the food parceled so don't want to comment on the ambience in the sitting section.¬†Service is fast.¬†

The only complain I have is the place they cook is not properly cleaned. I have got dirt in my soup once (It was in fact a baby caterpillar). One other time they served me half baked Masala Kulcha, which I had ordered with Murgh Bharta.

Overall an okayish place.

Edit : 12.08.2015

Ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Kum Pao Chicken, Sliced Fish in Chilly Garlic Sauce

The fried rice was nice. The Fish preparation was also quiet good. Comparatively, chicken was not that good. The outer cover of chicken pieces, which was prepared with flour was an absolutely let down. People pay to eat the chicken, not the flour, which looked like a street food that people get in twenty rupees a plate.¬†

I just downgraded my rating from 3.5 to 3. Just because the value for money is not at all good. I have now tried both Mughlai and Chinese food from Zyka and did not like both of them. (Except the Fried Rice, to some extent, which I think was good).

Good place to drop in and satisfy your gastro-internal desires.
Well,recently celebrated a birthday party there and the best part was the courteous service offered.
A few dishes need lil more efforts in making them taste better but on the whole it's worth paying for dining here.

This place has really turned itself around in terms of food and decor. They have indian, as well as chinese food. Their Cantonese chow is very tasty, so is their lemon coriander soup. Mostly, all the Chinese items that we ordered were good. Pan fried chicken, and fried rice were among those that were good. Indian food is good too. :)

But it's not much if a place for large parties..
Located in newalipore may be one of the best in this location..

I won't say that Zyka has bad food . It has OK food but what really hits me in the testes is the sheer genericness of the place . If it was any more generic the WB government would subsidise it . So I'd  give it a 3.25 rating but that option it is.

It's a huge 3 storeyed multi cuisine family restaurant serving Good Chinese Cuisine and Excellent North Indian cuisine, located on New Alipur P Block. It's quite an elite restaurant, by an ex Sonargaon Chef,Taj Bengal. The ambience is commendable and so is the prompt service. They provide home delivery only to the residents of O block and P Block,which is quite fast. They serve quite good Chinese Cuisine but their main attraction is their North Indian Cuisine which is just lass apart! Thumps up. ^_^

So I came here last Monday for a cozy birthday dinner with my family.

Location - Just 2mins drive from New Alipore Petrol Pump. The restaurant is located on the 4th floor.

Interiors & Ambience - Small n cozy place. Moderately but tastefully decorated. Large comfortable sofa seatings.

Food - We had :
Starters - Assorted Chicken Kebab Platter, Lat Me Kai, Chicken Tai Pan.
Main Course - Mutton Biriyani, Chicken in Thai Curry, Goloo Chicken, Egg Wrapped Fried Rice, Singapore Rice Noodles.
Dessert - Sizzling Brownie.

The food overall was very good. We loved it. Assorted Chicken Kebab Platter, Lat Me Kai, Goloo Chicken (Chicken Balls in Plum Sauce) are highly recommended.

Service - Staffs are polite and helpful. Service time is lil slow and could be improved.

Value for Money - Most items are priced right while few others are tad bit expensive.

Do drop in here for a nice cozy meal. I'm coming back soon!

I don't generally write negative reviews for places, but I feel compelled to after the experience I had here.
I went to this place on the 2nd of January with a few of my friends around 3, and most of the restaurant was empty.¬†The ambiance is nice, and the decor very modern and upscale.The problem started when the waiter came to get our order.
We'd ordered a soup and starters, and naturally stated that it comes first.The waiter looked at us with an expression that suggested we'd ask him to get us the moon.
My friend seeing the confusion, just asked for everything to be brought together, with the main course. To which he asked about 3-4 times, after looking bewildered some more, 'Sab kuch ek sath?'
Ten minutes later, they bring us the soup first, anyway.
They don't bring the starters, which they bring with the main course.When they do, the food is good in quantity, and quality.
We start on our food, and enjoy it. As I am halfway through putting my spoon down on the plate, the waiter comes back and whisks it away.¬†I look around. There are four empty tables. They keep clearing plates, removing dishes, and snatch my friend's half empty bowl of soup, without asking.It makes no sense.
We'd been there for half an hour, maximum.Why the haste?

What's ironic is, the man at the table behind us kept waving at and calling for the waiter, but he didn't bother, because he was too busy scooping our food laden dishes up.

We asked for the bill, and waited for five minutes before they brought us a blank envelope with nothing but a feedback form inside.
Naturally, we rated them good in everything but the service.Here is where it gets worse.

The waiter comes back to us, and demands in a tone to know why we marked down for bad service.Not, 'what was the fault in our service.'
Not, 'what did you not like?'
Not, 'what could we improve.'
'How could you give us a bad rating for service?' almost daring us to complaint.
My friend pointed out how hasty they'd been, and he started telling us something about "courses," and almost even shoved the feedback form back to us demanding we change the rating.Two minutes after, a different waiter brought us the bill.As we were leaving, I saw the same waiter, using a whitener and black pen on our feedback form.:)

Food: Quantity is sufficient and quality is very good. They have sum eccentric preparations like "XYZ" in butter garlic sauce, cheese spinach rolls and some fairly common preparations like "XYZ" in hunan sauce or chilli garlic sauce. And they nail it in both the kinds. Noodle and rice items need more improvement. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience:  It's clean and comfortable but the decoration is a bit confusing. They have different lightings in different tables. Some tables have beautiful dim lamps while others have dumb bright lights above them. I think they can do much better. I rate it 3/5.

Service: Very courteous and attentive staff. Speed is good too. I rate it 4/5.

Price: Some dishes are a bit costly while some are affordable.

Overall I give it 3.5/5.

My brother and I had visited the restaurant on 19th October 2014, but to our surprise they forced us to walk out, as the restaurant was available apparently only for serving families which has to include a lady. Inspite of reminding them of our frequent visits we were asked to sit on the bar area at 5th floor or leave. We also happen to be members of the same restaurant.

¬†This is the first time in the last four years that i had to face such a situation that too in a restaurant that has made us a member long back. Deeply shocked to have seen such a weird staff response.

Visited Zyka today was really shocked to be shoowed away. To dine in this resturant either you need to have a female with you or else you need to be drunkard. Visited reading good reviews hoping to discover a good resturant along with a friend but met very unplesant adventure. There bar resturant where they make singles dine is nothing more than a road side desi alcohol outlet. A complete no no. There resturant is strictly for men accompanied with females. Females please be aware as to why such special prefrence in this so so resturant, looks fishy.

Location: New Alipore. 

Located right opposite to the upcoming project 'Exotica' by Ideal Group, serves an above average Fooding experience. 

Coming straight to the fooding, have tried both the cuisines it has on offer (North Indian and Chinese) and being close to my place have tried nearly most of the dishes they have on offer. 
Talking about them in details wouldn't be a good decision, so I'll be summarizing it up for both the cuisines (North Indian followed by Chinese): 

What made our taste buds super happy? 

-Malai Paneer Tikka. 
-Achari Paneer Tikka. 
-Dal Makhani. 
-Kadhai Paneer. 
-Malai Kofta 
-Butter Naan 
-Chilli Onion Kulcha 

-Babycorn Pepper n' Salt. 

What made our taste buds happy? 

-Veg Shammi Kebab. 
-Hara Bhara Kebab. 
-Paneer Butter Masala. 
-Masala Kulcha. 
-Pudina Paratha. 

-Crispy Chilli Babycorn. 
-Veg. Manchurian. 
-Tsing Hoi Potatoes. 
-Schezuan Noodles. 

What made our taste buds sad?
-Broccoli Babycorn Jhaalfarezi. 
-Rumali Roti. 

-Chilli Paneer. 
-Pan Fried Noodles. 

What made us happy? 
Quick service, courteous servers, efficient runners. 
Members entitled to a 25% discount on dine-in. 

What made us sad? 
The runners should have been a bit trained as well. 

A pocket-friendly affair. 

Overall a good experience.

Today we went to ‚ÄòZyka‚Äô for lunch. As starter we had ‚ÄòFish Amritsari‚Äô & ‚ÄòLatmei Kai Chicken‚Äô, both dishes are well cooked and tastes great.  For main course we tried ‚ÄòPremium Non Veg Thali‚Äô as buy 1 get one offer was going on there. The thali consists ‚ÄòDal Makhni‚Äô, ‚ÄòButter Naan‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Butter Masala‚Äô, ‚ÄòMutton Kosha‚Äô, ‚ÄòPulao‚Äô, ‚ÄòMix Fruit Raita‚Äô, ‚ÄòAchhar‚Äô, ‚ÄòSalad‚Äô and ‚ÄòPapad‚Äô. As desserts they serve ‚ÄòIce Cream‚Äô with ‚ÄòHot Gulab Jamun‚Äô. Food was great. Dal Makhni & Mutton Kosha was cooked perfectly with rich flavours while Pulao tasted very average. Ambiance was nice and the staffs were friendly. All total a nice experience with no pocket pinch.

I had tried their Masala kulcha, chicken bharta & chicken tikka masala both times coz i couldnt get enough of them the 1st time. Trust me the food tasted heavenly...it was just so freaking awesome. Dont remember exactly but bill was somewhere around 450. Highly recommended.

Zyka - A huge place accommodating Bar Cum Restaurant. 
===================================================
Intro:

I had been to Zyka today with one of my friend S to enjoy the lovely Bar which i had been hearing a lot about. This place has a good get up and exterior look from outside and is situated right next to my home. Probably, that's why didn't enter it's bar section. However, as my friend wanted to drink some booze, we planned to get inside and try out how it is. The restaurant was not open when we entered inside. 

Well, the Bar is situated in the 5th floor which made us totally tired walking down the stairs. However, i didn't expect this place to be good. I was wrong. This place had a very good ambience inside and was quite unique. The place was decorated with Bamboo's all over and had a small Tv playing music. Well, not bad..
===================================================
Drinks:
As we wanted to continue with our food order, the staff disappointed us by saying that food isn't served on this day. There are specific days when they serve food as well as Drinks in the bar section. However, he said that he can arrange some peanuts and Lay's chips for us. At the end, we wanted to booze and any snacks would do the trick!.

We ordered:-
3 Blender's Pride Large,1 Pepsi and 2 Chips - They had supplied us everything perfectly and to twirl the drink there was a stick. The place was empty and it was just two of us so we were quite enjoying talking about random things. Well, nevertheless, we were a little surprised to see a bill of 711 bucks inclusive of taxes. In the menu, Blender's pride was written 95 bucks but they charged us 190 bucks. I think for the large, they charged us more. However, it wasn't a bad deal. What surprised me was that a simple pepsi glass bottle costed us 45 bucks and chips 25 bucks. Lol. This is really funny. Anyways, we didn't mind paying because we had a good time and didn't realise as a little high. :P
===================================================
Pros:-

1) Decent ambience.
2) Was empty so don't know the crowd. Well, my recommendation is to go on off times. Don't know how the crowd will be though.
3) Courteous staffs.
4) Prompt service. 
5) Reasonably priced.
6) Even have offers for their loyal customers that if they want to booze regularly they can pay 1000 for membership of a year and can enjoy 25 percent off on every bill. (31 percent off on home delivery) How cool is that? 

Cons:-
1) Didn't explain the bill properly.
2) Pepsi price too high!!!!!

Paid a visit here yesterday. Had vouchers of "exotic thali" which I brought from groupon. Didn't have much expectations as I got a 52% discount and  it costed just 298 bucks for 2 (Rs. 149 each). Being a big foodie I just went there to try it out. Must say it's location is not that bad either being just a 5 min walk from Suruchi Sangha, New Alipore. We were served 2 starters first - one being of shredded chicken and another being of fish orly type. Both of them tasted pretty well specially the orly. Then came the surprise. We were served the non-veg thali. On seeing them we were just hawwwwwww??? really??? It had yellow peas pulao, a butter nun, a dal, both chicken and mutton dishes (two pieces each). All of them was really really good considering the price. It was chicken butter masala and mutton curry. Both were cooked well with right proportion of spices and the chicken and mutton pieces were also tasty and soft. The thali contained mixed salad, papad and raita as well. Lastly, came the dessert which had a hot and soft gulab jamun and one scoop of ice-cream. We had all of these at 149 bucks each. On the table there was a discount card with a buy 1 get 1 offer on classic non-veg thali which costs Rs. 280. But i don't know whether it is same as one which I bought from groupon. Premium thali there costs around 399 bucks. The food was fresh, well cooked and served hot. The waiters are polite too though there its nothing special to mention about the ambiance. It was an okay type. Enjoyed the lunch and would certainly recommend this to others.

Today we went to ‚ÄòZyka‚Äô for lunch. As starter we had ‚ÄòFish Amritsari‚Äô & ‚ÄòLatmei Kai Chicken‚Äô, both dishes are well cooked and tastes great.  For main course we tried ‚ÄòPremium Non Veg Thali‚Äô as buy 1 get one offer was going on there. The thali consists ‚ÄòDal Makhni‚Äô, ‚ÄòButter Naan‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Butter Masala‚Äô, ‚ÄòMutton Kosha‚Äô, ‚ÄòPulao‚Äô, ‚ÄòMix Fruit Raita‚Äô, ‚ÄòAchhar‚Äô, ‚ÄòSalad‚Äô and ‚ÄòPapad‚Äô. As desserts they serve ‚ÄòIce Cream‚Äô with ‚ÄòHot Gulab Jamun‚Äô. Food was great. Dal Makhni & Mutton Kosha was cooked perfectly with rich flavours while Pulao tasted very average. Ambiance was nice and the staffs were friendly. All total a nice experience with no pocket pinch.

I had experienced Zyka twice so far and both the times I opted for home delivery. I had tried their Masala kulcha, chicken bharta & chicken tikka masala both times coz i couldnt get enough of them the 1st time. Trust me the food tasted heavenly...it was just so freaking awesome. Dont remember exactly but bill was somewhere around 450. Highly recommended.

Zyka - A huge place accommodating Bar Cum Restaurant. 
===================================================
Intro:

I had been to Zyka today with one of my friend S to enjoy the lovely Bar which i had been hearing a lot about. This place has a good get up and exterior look from outside and is situated right next to my home. Probably, that's why didn't enter it's bar section. However, as my friend wanted to drink some booze, we planned to get inside and try out how it is. The restaurant was not open when we entered inside. 

Well, the Bar is situated in the 5th floor which made us totally tired walking down the stairs. However, i didn't expect this place to be good. I was wrong. This place had a very good ambience inside and was quite unique. The place was decorated with Bamboo's all over and had a small Tv playing music. Well, not bad..
===================================================
Drinks:
As we wanted to continue with our food order, the staff disappointed us by saying that food isn't served on this day. There are specific days when they serve food as well as Drinks in the bar section. However, he said that he can arrange some peanuts and Lay's chips for us. At the end, we wanted to booze and any snacks would do the trick!.

We ordered:-
3 Blender's Pride Large,1 Pepsi and 2 Chips - They had supplied us everything perfectly and to twirl the drink there was a stick. The place was empty and it was just two of us so we were quite enjoying talking about random things. Well, nevertheless, we were a little surprised to see a bill of 711 bucks inclusive of taxes. In the menu, Blender's pride was written 95 bucks but they charged us 190 bucks. I think for the large, they charged us more. However, it wasn't a bad deal. What surprised me was that a simple pepsi glass bottle costed us 45 bucks and chips 25 bucks. Lol. This is really funny. Anyways, we didn't mind paying because we had a good time and didn't realise as a little high. :P
===================================================
Pros:-

1) Decent ambience.
2) Was empty so don't know the crowd. Well, my recommendation is to go on off times. Don't know how the crowd will be though.
3) Courteous staffs.
4) Prompt service. 
5) Reasonably priced.
6) Even have offers for their loyal customers that if they want to booze regularly they can pay 1000 for membership of a year and can enjoy 25 percent off on every bill. (31 percent off on home delivery) How cool is that? 

Cons:-
1) Didn't explain the bill properly.
2) Pepsi price too high!!!!!

Was late from a meeting & called up zyka to find out if they were still open. Reached @ 10.45 and immediately placed orders. Another vegan day, being shivatri, chose from the veggies on offer

crispy garlic baby naan with fresh limes was straight away ordered, before scanning the menu for veggies.

Kadai Paneer, dal makhni & naans were further ordered, while nibbling on the garlic naan.

 No frills - delectable meal. I always come back for more.



----- 20 Aug, 2013 -----

The North Indian food here is exceptional for the price. On asking was informed that the chef is an ex sonargaon chef. Hence!! Highly recommend the tandoori chicken, black dal and kebab platter. Don't forget to ask for a crispy garlic naan as a starter. It's quite a special here.

------ 27 July, 2014 ------------
¬†was at #zyka #newalipore last evening. They have redone the place. loved the refreshing fine dining interiors. Like they say ' the food tastes better in the right ambience. ' A must visit !

Zyka was on my list for a long time. today i ordered chicken fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce at 8.50pm, got home delivery by 9.10pm. i am really impressed by their  super fast delivery. now coming to the food part , chicken fried rice was very good, my child simply loved it. the chicken with oyster sauce was less spicy as requested so that my child can enjoy it. it was good with big pieces of mushrooms but i still have soft corner for the mainland china one. over all good food, fast home delivery and courteous delivery boy. will surely order again.

Visited friends in their New Alipore office and we were dragged out for lunch. The suggested Zyka an dI agreed, having heard about their thalis but never had the chance to visit.

We were ushered into the first floor room. It was a reasonably large sized room with well spaced tables. I think only two were occupied. The steward got us the menu cards. I was looking at the thalis and he mentioned that they have an offer 1 on 1 free. I had known some deal sites charge a little money to get you the same :)

We asked for the special thalis, which are just over Rs 400 each. With the deal they come to a little over Rs 200 each. Very reasonable as it turned out to be.

We had two non veg starters.. a very nicely done pan fried fish which was actually crisp on the outside. and a fairly good chicken reshmi tikka (we got two pieces of each). Made me wish there were more. We were served a fresh lime soda with it (well made too).

The main course was served in a white plastic thali that had multiple compartments. There was a dry potato, very nicely done and not too salty, a dal makhani, boondi raita, chopped salad, a mutton in saag curry and chicken tikka masala. All turned out well (I did get two pieces of bone that I had to get them to change in my mutton). With it was a serving of rice and one tandoori roti / naan. The naan was on the smaller side, and a tad soft. Two of us had requested for an extra naan in lieu of the rice and they complied.

We were full, happily so and had asked for the check, completely forgetting that the desert remained. We were served one hot gulab jamun (nice) and a scoop of vanilla icecream,

My friends say the ala-carte items are pretty decent too.

Well worth a try... I would recommend it for its value for money (buy 1 get 1 free on thalis) and the quality of food served.

The reviews below are overhyped. Not a good place. Ambience is not at all good. Then staff is not professional. They didn't serve drinks properly I had to serve soda myself. Staff suddenly changes TV channel when you are watching something and you are the only customer in the bar. Seating is not at all comfortable. And over the top the chicken we ordered was not smelling right.

Got invited by a friend who lives nearby to the restaurant, we went to their cozy little bar on the top floor... The bar menu was quite elaborate and the service of drinks top notch !! The Chef recommended starters were awesome .. although a little too spicy for my friend's taste... The main course came well recommended, Some mutton preparation with fluffy steamed rice.. later came to know that the owner/chef had himself prepared that dish and was Kashmiri in origin , both the dish and the chef !!! Great going.. with a little advertising this place can go much, much farther ....by the way, the prices were a fraction of any half decent joint in Kolkata !!

Was at this quaint little gem of a place the other day, the food was about the best I've had in a long time in an independent restaurant , with their mutton topping the list... the bar upstairs is quite cozy too ..The Chinese food had a sould so missing in restaurants these days , the brocolli noodle soup was really wonderful... I would definitely rank them above most other higher priced/prized restaurants.

Awesome is the word for Zyka. Firstly, excellent food quality and more than enough quantity. I would say the ambience is not one of the best, but Zyka will not disappoint you. The waiters are good and the service is commendable, they just wait to see your plates empty and they come running to you. The manager himself is very attentive and ever ready to come to your table. The location of Zyka is a bit confusing, but you can always ask for directions. Most importantly, the food is not at all costly.

To sum up, you can visit Zyka with friends and family and it will always meet your expectations.

I had dinner here on 28 October 2013 of INR 1734 and to my surprise, I have been billed more than once for the charge. I have authorised only one of these charges. The merchant has shamelessly claimed both the transactions which were punched with a gap of 2 seconds or even less.

I had a chance to visit this place when me and my friends were pandal hopping during Durga pujas. It is a long restaurant of one floor. We had to walk some way from the entrance to our tables. We had friend rice and chilli chicken. The fried rice tasted quite well and the chilli chicken was very spicy and awesome. The combination was awesome.An old man catered to our needs and the service was quite fast. The prices were  a bit on the higher Side,  compared to what we ordered. we had to pay rs 1200 approximately. But the greatest thing I liked that Zyka stood as an exception.....in every restaurant during the pujas, the food quality comes down. But here it was not so, as my friend, a local, pointed out. I had realized it also from the magnificent taste and aroma as well. Ideal for a medium scale dining out with family. A bit simple type of food here, but still takes you for a joyride of flavours.

One of my favourite restaurants ever visited. Its located at New Alipore. I have been there probably 2 times. Food quality is superb,ambience is great and staffs are informative and courteous. Food quality is good and pricing is moderate. they do not take much time to serve. The chicken Tai Pan and Chicken Drumstick garlic pepper is awesome. Pan fried chilly fish and Garlic pepper fish is very good. The fried rice and noodles are mouthwatering. The soups are also good. I would highly suggest you to taste Dragon's Chicken which was my most favourite. I like their interior decoration. One more thing, vegetarian dishes-like Dry chilly Mushroom was nice. They home deliver i think and both chinese and north indian dishes are super. There is no bar,,cold drinks are available. Again food,,,Chilly prawn,chicken in thai curry is nice also. You should try these food also. Guys,,,you must visit there and i hope you wil be pleased after tasting their scrumptious dishes. i would rate 4.5 for them.

The food was awesome. I am usually for critical of the restaurant food, but food here was great. I really enjoyed it. The staff was nice and helpful. My two infants made a lot of noise which is usu embarrassing and we usu run out of a restaurant as soon as possible. But the staff made us feel relaxed and even played a little with the kids. It wasn't pricey either. I really enjoyed it.. It was hard to find though, had to circle around the block few times to find it
