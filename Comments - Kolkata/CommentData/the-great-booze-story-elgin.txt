Not worth a visit at all. Been here with group of 4 ... most of the options in menu are not available . Fail to understand why they keep such menu....kind 
of a telephone directory when they don't have 70% of the options not available. Food quality & service is equally bad. Located at such a prime place but they are just not able to encash it bcoz of poor management.

This place is love... The dark ambiance with few led lights and a drink with some starters will make u go completely lost... Only 1 thing that is previously when it was SOHO,the smoking zone used to be much nijer, with a red couch and green walls but now there's only on wooden bench... The EDM's which they play is just too damn good for your ears...

It is a great place to hang out with a large group. The ambience is electric and the food is also great. You should keep a better collection of beers, otherwise, great work!! üëçüèº

A good place to hang out. Very good services by staffs even if the place is crowded. The prices of food are reasonable. There is also a smoking zone for the smokers. And the music and entertainments are great. Definitely a good place. Try this out.

The first thing i would like to tell is the "best ambience".The "booze story" a cool and pocket friendly place to hangout with your buddies or with your close ones.
And being a beer lover i love their pitcher,which is very pocket friendly(around 480 including tax) compared to other pubs.
The food is quite descent
Having seperate smoking zone.
  Visit it...

The plot was appealing, the characters were set, but somehow the story felt to create the overall charm.. After basement closed down, the area lacked a proper enough lounge cum dance floor.. GBT promises to fill up that void with all the arrangements but lacks big time in implementation.. First of all, this place may look way too dark and gloomy at times, may be a few more bright lights and decorative props would add to the color.. Secondly, service was pathetic even though we went early around 6.30 and the place was mostly vacant and thirdly almost half of the listed dishes were not available.. The decor has a rustic charm with the high ceilings, the metal lamp shades and the huge couches.. They have a 1:1 offer on select drinks till 7pm.. So the prices won't look way too overwhelming.. Coming to food we tasted:
Fully Loaded Nachos: Absolutely loved it.. The Nachos were topped with not only cheese but slices of boiled eggs which added to the flavor.. A nice company to your drinks..
Chicken Takrai: Boneless Chicken chunks cooked in red chili paste and thai herbs.. It was nice and tangy with a punch..The chicken was crisp and well cooked..
Red Basil Fish: Totally disappointing.. The fish was smelly and even though on complaining they turned a deaf ear, there was absolutely no flavor of basil and this tasted almost similar as the Chicken dish.. Best if avoided..
Alongwith the food, we had 4 small pegs of Blenders Pride and 1 Sprite.. Overall, its good to go there in large groups, maybe then you can have some fun, apart from that the vibes, the music, all look pretty dull and non-appealing.. Our total cheque was Rs.1083/- (all incl.) which is kinda on the lower side given the look of this establishment..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 2.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

The location of this place earns it 2 points straight. Service is a bit slow but friendly. The place is slightly shady with live sports and decent music. Pocket pinch is slightly above par considering the quality of the food. But the contact number given on zomato is invalid, so booking a table or trying to reach out is impossible. Kindly share the correct contact number as i have left an item at your place.

The service is awful. My friend and I saw that this restaurant had a number of cocktails and food items, so decided on it for dinner and drinks. The drinks were way too stout, and the food items we ordered were placed and then "not available". It turns out that 95% of the menu is not available. And each time the waiter came over, he pouted, blamed us, or ignored our queries to go directly to the on floor manager. Terrible customer service. Terrible food of what they did have. Terrible, too strong drinks.

My experience has been the shittiest till date, considering the ambience and the food options,of all pubs or restaurants I visited....this was my first visit to the place,they took a cover charge from my friends who entered first,saying their is some event that would take place after a couple of hour...we entered,and it was empty till the next 2n half hours we were inside...coming to the ambience inside was decent,but the dj was playing the music so loud,that u might get a heart attack anytime,with shit songs and a vacant dance floor or any other audiences....coming to the food options,there was just a single menu,with 8-10 drink options,with all of their rates increased to a value of 400-600-800(even for a small peg of white rum)....the food option was reduced to starters only with 2-3 veg and 3-4 non veg dishes,that's it...nothing else....the cover charge which we paid was redeemable he told first(and the guy who took the money,has his own personal meaning of the term redeemable,that is u have to redeem the money by eating the foods inside),he explained this when we@ asked him why we were not informed of the changed rules for the day before hand.....the same foods that we repeatedly took,as we had nothing else too choose,were decent in taste and amount....overall the experience was too bad,and when we came out we were like gasping for fresh air,from the hell inside,made by the dj!!!!

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. We reached around 10:30 and were told that it's open. 
Post that, when we placed the order, it was informed thy there is no beer available. Then, there's no main course available and we were given a choice of 3 starters to choose from. 
The beer tower ordered was not even filled up properly and the bartender was shamelessly arguing against that. 

Really bad place in all!

Read a lot about this place in zomato and thought of going there. It was a girls day out plan and three of us agreed to go there. The ambience is really sexy but the music was too loud. We had to ask the man to lower the volume to hear each other. The staffs were quite good. Live game was being screened so we grabbed some drinks and lasagna. The lasagna was too good and that gave us high hopes so we ordered a pizza but it was a total flop. The pizza crust has thin and hard. The toppings were falling off and it tasted horrible so we left two slices. Therefore, low rating for the bad pizza otherwise its a great place.

Me and my friends decided to pay this one a visit one sunday afternoon as one of our friends was visiting us from bangalore. The place was almost empty as we entered before 2pm which is generally an odd time to visit a pub. We began ordering many items and started boozing. Most of the items were good but most of them were also unavailable. Also the pizza which we ordered for main course gave a foul smell. However I would like to give a special mention for their Chello Kebab which tasted authentic. The booze is cheap if we consider the general pricing in pubs around that place. The ambience was great with good music playing in the background and a large screen projector showing live sports. So I guess it's a good place to hang out with friends. Stick to the booze and the basic starters and you'll be fine.

Pretty great ambiance with adequately dimmed lights and good music; this may seem like an ideal place to get drunk as you walk in. 

But then comes the disappointment when you find out that most of the booze from the list ain't available and they keep insisting to order this or that. As example, we asked for Jim Beam, they insisted Jack Daniel's; again we asked for Draught beer, they insisted Pints, that too from a very limited collection. 40% of the booze are never in stock. 

Same goes for food, or I would rather say worse. They dint have most of the chicken items n NONE of the fish items, they insisted on having veg.
Service is somewhat slow as well. 

Anyway, the staffs are very nice and somewhat overenthusiastic, may be trying hard to make it up for the disappointing part of your 'BOOZE STORY' , however, doesn't really add up to make it a GREAT one.

Even on weekends this place was dead.

Ambiance: They need to improve it a lot; not at all happening.
Service: Very Slow.
Food: Okay considerable (Half of the items on menu was not available; frustrating).

And to my surprise; even their swipe card machine was also not working.

Thumps down...Sorry Great Booze you guys need to sort out these things.

Visited this place yesterday evening with few friends in tow. The place is huge with dim lights and fabulous music playing. We didn't get draught beer tower as it was finished already.. It was just 6.30pm!!! Anyways, ordered whisky and a chicken starter which the server misguided us about the number of pieces. We ignored that and continued to have a gd tym. A lady in charge came up to us and inquired about the food and also suggested a good spicy chicken starter. We also ordered tequila shots to cap our night off.
But then came to shocker! The bill... The server for once didn't mention that a bar menu was for happy hours and that happy hours are going on or it has ended. We were given the same menu card which he claimed is of happy hours. Only 1round of large whisky was under the happy hours price and the rest of the rounds 4 in total was priced nearly double, and that too without knowing. The server just told us that he is new and didn't know.. I mean common!!!

Went here with a friend on 31st night at about 6.45 pm, on entering I was asked for a cover charge of 1000 rupees and was told that since there was no seat available we'd hv to stand at the bar. Now since we had plans for a house party later on we agreed to it. Inside we saw it wasn't that crowded. We asked to be seated upstairs as a few tables were empty but was told that some private party was going on but we saw later on that there was no party!! At the bar top after asking for the menu atleast 5 times finally it was given to us. We saw the beer prices at 175 and asked for 2 beers. Much to our surprise that menu was promptly taken away and we were given a new curtailed menu. The waiter said that they were hosting some event and that the menu has changed. On looking at the menu to our shock we saw that the same beer is now priced 500 rupees!!!! Within 10 minutes the prices have become triple!!!! Still since we were there we asked for 2 beers and a stir fried chilli fish, upon this the waiter curtly asked to pay up front!! We felt humiliated as if we would run away without paying! The food came after 45 min, taste being ok. We were there till 9pm but didn't see any event taking place. We left the place feeling completely ripped off and humiliated vowing never to return again.

Absolutely not happy. Its a new year eve. I am right now in the pub. They do not have proper customer service. We are not given a table. The upper part booked for some party and we were asked to vacate the place. I will not ever come back to this place ever and I am recommending everyone not to visit the place. They do not have thd proper curtsey to serve the customer and also the behaviour is very bad. Worst place to hang out.

Went to this place twice. I found it a bit costly but considering the fact of the place where it is located the rates are justified. The ambience is very good. It has two stories but they allow you to go to the top floor only if the crowd gets heavy. Friendly staffs. The food tasted good. However one might not get whatever they want from the menu card, only some of the items are available. Tried the vodka and dill mushrooms and chicken kebab. Both were very delicious.

Location: Sarat Bose Road,  near ideal plaza.  
Place / Ambiance : The place is collosal and a great beer up place.  
Ambiance is quite wonderfull and jolly.  
Food : The Food Quality and Quantity is Considerable with the price.  
Again this is a whopping place to drink and knock you out.  
Hookah is way too expensive and unreasonable.  
Overall GBS is a superior place in the area.

I do not really know what exactly does so called "higher class society" means... After watching kaahani 2,i headed on to "THE GREAT BOOZE STORY" to enjoy a couple of drinks with two of my friends... To my surprise, I wasn't allowed to get in because I wasn't wearing a full length trouser...If wearing a full length trouser defines aristocracy then I shit on that aristocracy...the way I was treated was hugely demeaning...dress doesn't define class rather attitude does...I am afraid if wearing a full length trouser defines being high class and acceptable to the society then I am sorry I will always prefer being a low profile human...

Trust me please dont come to this place. The place is not bad but the service is awefull. Firstly we entered with a booking of three people and they blocked us saying they cant allow stags inside but only couples. After insisting they let us enter and to our great surprise there was not even more than 2 couples inside. Then when our third partner came later on they asked for cover charge when his name was already registered for entry three hours back. They forcefully charged us cover charge where as left other couples saying they are members. When we asked that we are interested in membership also they coudnt come out with an answer.they shifted our seats while we were in smoking zone without even asking. Service is awfull. The manager and the gate keeper asked for bribes....awfull place trust me. We dint want to come here only a friend insisted thats why we came and it was a great mistake. Go some where else. Their service are worst and we would never come back.

For me, The Great Booze Story was a start to the next gen pubs in Kolkata. Totally took me back to where I belong (Ambience wise and the Menu Card Design wise).

The decor, lighting, pitch of the music, food, sheesha and the service. All of these were perfect on my first couple of visits.

So I visited the third time. AND BOOM ! Dropped the music quality, food quality, sheesha and the service quality !

-The music was loud enough to successfully mute us all. :)
-The food (Basket of Loaded Fries) wasn't happening at all.
-The sheesha guy had to be called several times to fix the sheesha.
-Service - What can I say, we waited for no less the 15 minutes for somebody to take our order besides calling them several times. Waited for not less than 45 minutes for our sheesha.

Word of Advice - You have a beautiful space. I'm sure you have worked very hard. Just work a little more harder to make the experience better. Plus you can try a different Menu card design since the one you had (or you still have) totally reminds me of Church Street Social's Menu Card (which again, is not a good menu card design due to the experience). No difference at all. I'm sorry.

I would say it's a nice place to let your hair down and enjoy the music. 

Food - 4/5
Service - 2.5/5
Ambience - 4.5/5

We ordered a tower of beer, a tower of Electric LIT, paneer tikka,  baby corn and bruchetta for which the bill was for something around 3.5k.  While we were three in number.. I find the cost pretty decent. 

Service could have been better. However, full marks to the ambience, plus the location is also easily accessible.

The low rating is only for the lousy service. Otherwise I quite like the decor, food and price.

I was there on a Sunday evening and the place was about 30% full. Semi dark Interior ¬†with 2 levels. The wide bar counter, giant screen t.v and spacious seating arrangement added to the charm.¬†

A Cosmopolitan was ordered and I requested to get it in room temperature. However when the drink arrived, it was ice-old. I wonder whether the staff pay attention to the guests at all.

Next we ordered a Bucket of Wings and a Chooza Makhmali. The 1st dish was perfect. Little Crispy, succulent and yummy. It was served with ketchup, would've been better if they served a dip. The 2nd dish was good too. Tasted a lot like Reshmi Kebab, only softer and juicier. Literally melted in the mouth (The 2nd item reached the table at least 20 mins after we placed the order).
Food part gets 4.5/5.

Please note the staff didn't offer to serve the dishes. They just put the plates on the table and left.

Also, we requested one of the staff to put one of our phones in the charger, to which he blankly replied that none of the charging points were available.¬†

Lastly, 2 of us had HDFC Cards while the 3rd friend had cash (old 500 & 1000 notes). Knowing that old notes wouldn't be accepted, we offered our cards for bill payment. However, the card machine was rejecting HDFC bank debit cards. The staff however was least helpful with a rigid "I don't know what to do" attitude. We went to the ATM counters next to the restaurant where again, HDFC cards' transactions were declined. Then we requested the staff to take the old notes of 500 and 1000, to which he firmly said No. Hence we requested him to take our address and other details and promised to pay in some other card next day itself. ¬†Again, the answer was a firm No. ¬†We then asked him to offer us suggestions what we should do, to which he gave us a "How am I supposed to know what you are going to do" look.¬†

Now, even if you are unable to help us, atleast be empathetic if not apologetic! Specially when it was understood that whole country is in a similar crisis & the situation was beyond our control.

Finally, we went to talk to the Manager and he accepted the 500 & 1000 notes and relieved us. We are really thankful to him.

If you can ignore the service part totally, I would recommend you to visit this place for the ambiance and food.

A very late review from side.
Nonetheless I would not visit this place again in future as there are so many better options than TGBS.
Coming to the point, me and my group of friends were curious about this place and checked in on Ashtami night.
Liked the ambience, the crowd was good.
But but but, they had a special puja menu, a lot of drinks options was mentioned but didn't have any beer except Kingfisher lager, I mean seriously wtf.
The portion of food was like feeding a beggar, the hookah is way too costly and the staff there my god.
They simply looted our pockets, but it didn't make a good story, it was a very very bad experience.

A nice cozy place. It's got two levels. The ground level has the main bar and the top level has sofa seating. The starters were vegetable cigar, sheek kebab, paneer tikka and aloo with stuffed paneer were all good but for the cigar. Coming to the main course the Channa masala was very good. The breads also were warm and crisp. Service was as expected.

We were from Bombay and we were treated as outsiders.
It was 23:15 and it was our last day in Calcutta and we were very hungry.
After searching many places and asking a lot of people we were directed to this place. We asked the guard outside and he said that the place would be open till 00:30. We went inside and just as we sat I saw the manager telling the waiter to inform us that the last order is till 11:30 and the waiter obeyed.
We called the manager at our table and very kindly informed him that we were from Bombay and were leaving the next day and this out our last night in Calcutta and we are very hungry and were looking for good food. We also requested him to keep his place open till little after midnight as that would be sufficient for us to eat.
He nodded and left. He returned after 2minutes and told that the last order would be at 11:30 and that was just 7mins away.
Talk bout Customer Service.

I guess, he never heard the saying - There is only one boss: The Customer.

If this situation were in Bombay, nobody would have returned without eating. They would've kept the kitchen open till as long as we wanted. This is how you treat your customers.
This is exactly what happened next door - Mayank the owner of the place next door told us - that we could sit for as long as we wanted.

I would never go here ever again if at all I visit Calcutta again.

The Great S*** Story - 

This place is a let down after tonight.
14 different brands of beer and on a Saturday evening, just two of them in stock, a joke? I think not.
Staff lacks courtesy, lack of staff, semi-cooked food, response time of the staff is maybe 15-20 mins, give or take five. Apart from the live screening, nothing is appealing as it seemed from the outside.

So the great booze story which is located right before the minto park signal if you go from the lansdowne is a ¬†place for party animal. They have good happy hours and all. If you are going just to booze there i think maybe it is fine but food is not at all.¬†
we had ordered for medditerean veg burger and a bucket of wings. Firstly the waiter was not interested much to take our order. and then when we finally took it the order came in after 45 mins that too after repeatedly asking them to give the food.¬†
So for me service and food both were horrible. i would never like to go back there again!

When I visit a pub or a bar i expect some nice cocktails and some nice music!!!
Cocktails are very average and try avoiding the pitcher of any cocktail as they put so much ice in the jug that at the end the last few half glassses turn to H2O...Not to mention the feeling of getting ripped off.
I cannot complain about the food though which is nice.
Now the music !!!! Folks got it all wrong ! Fisrtly you should not have a live gig if your place is cramped up which literally it is...You need to have a conversation going amongst yourselves but goddamn you cannot hear even if an elephant farts inside yes it is that loud when the band was playing.
Bottomline been to better places.

I had a lot of expectations from this place but sadly I was disappointed when I came here. The pub is extremely dark with a live band playing such pathetic songs, a pathetic singer singing songs which have no melody, no music. The place is a bomber just because of the music. Didn't have any food, only had a few drinks and left because staying there with such poor music playing in the background is like torturing yourself.

The ambience is good. Loved the music they played. Selection of EDMs were really nice. Food was good too.

But the washrooms were not clean as you would expect from a place of this standard. Also please be careful about the prices of booze shown in the menu, they are all 30ml and so you would be ordering 60ml pegs and the bill would come in with a figure double of your expectation. Anyways that was still okay, but then we could clearly see some extra pegs added in the bill which we had no way to clarify.

So my recommendation - Do visit the place but stay in senses and keep check of what you are ordering.

I used to like this place previously, and frequented it recently. However yesterday I went there with a friend, and I was stopped at the gate and told I could not enter wearing Kitos, as they have a strict dress code and covered shoes are mandatory for entry. I have been to this place several times and rarely have I worn sneakers, loafers or something remotely similar. I never knew they had a 'dress code' previously. 
I have been extremely disappointed with such a flippant attitude on the side of the management, and I'd think twice before visiting this place again.

This place is not about the food, the service or the ambiance, unless you are in the mood for a lot of noise. You walk into semi darkness and the first thing you notice is a live band belting out old hindi film songs (yes) in a rock (or so they think) style. The vocalist was off tune a lot of the time and dont even get me started on the back up musicians. The worst part is you can't even get away from the noise. Initially we were given a table close to the band and we absolutely could not stand the racket. Later we moved to the back of the room and there were speakers blaring out there too. No one comes to take your order, you have to get off your seat and go seeking out the waiters. Obviously the drinks arrive before the food, but they offer no tid bits to nibble on till the food is served. We ordered the smoked pizza and the non vexican pizza. The crust was crisp and the toppings of both pizzas tasted good. However you would have to eat the crust and the topping separately because they refused to stick to each other. We ordered a kebab platter later, and the chicken was underdone. We went to the place because we always found the name interesting. My curiosity has been satisfied, I am never ever going back there again.

TGBS is where I kicked off my Durga Pujo celebrations yesterday. This place has a wonderful location not very far away from Forum Mall and has the ideal atmosphere to calm your nerves for the night.¬†

Although the place is not huge, it has a very well decorated bar, pretty much synonymous to a classy English bar with a gorgeous display of spirits. Adjacent to it is a huge screen mostly playing sports channels and is an excellent option to catch a game screening. The high wooden chairs pretty much add to the English bar feel and another important feature is their smoking room which is spacious and comfortable.¬†

We didn't indulge in a lot of food since it was supposed to be all booze, so we ordered a couple of draught beer towers and catered to our appetite with Crispy Chilli Babycorn, which was delicious.¬†

My friends were really impressed with my recommendation of the place and we cannot wait to come back here again. I reckon it was a booze story that panned out well for us.

The great booze story provides it's customers with a very happy story. The place is very cosy and comfortable. It has an elite bar counter where the bartenders conjure up some crazy cocktails. They have high wooden chairs ,lounge seating ,as well as normal tables available for seating. There is a light music going on through the entire day and around 8 p o'clock in the night the atmosphere totally changes to a complete party environment with loud music and bass. Their happy hour is a great attraction as the prices are quite cheap at that time. Their menu card is like a newspaper which is quite innovative. They even serve hookah which is a bonus and the food is very tasty as well.Especially the chicken lasagnia is very cheesy and rich in flavours. This place is affordable and a must visit for all the pub goers. :)

Visited this place for a close friend's party. I must say, these people have their stuff sorted. Not much of entry hassles, soft music that soothes, decent service, great food especially the Nachos and Pizza, and well of course superb drinks. Overall a great place to hang out and get drunk with your buddies.

I was denied entry just because I was wearing kitto. There is no formal dress code mentioned anywhere! But I was simply denied entry coz of this bullshit reason. This was really insulting, and surely I'm not going back there ever again.
Certainly wouldn't recommend anyone there!

Today i tried Kolkata chello kabab, wings bucket, fries bucket and pitcher.
All were awesome.
You will love this place.
Loud music.
Food is awesome.
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.
Staffs are welcoming and well behaved.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
It's spread over two floors with live sports projection. 
Hookah available with smoking room. 
Couches on first floor with comfortable seating. 
Enough spacious and crowded. 
High tools seating on the ground with loud music. 
Overall it's an awesome place. 
Feels like we are in  disco. 
Bar area is beautifully designed. 
Will visit this place again.

If you can't allow people to park there cars before 7 change your timing. It was insulting to stand and argue with the watchman for a place to park the car. I have coming in this place since the last 6 years since it was known soho. Never would come again

A decent story overall

As has been said in several preceding reviews- the ambience is awesome. The setting is cosy. The place is well accessible and well connected. The menu is expansive too...
But for a teetotaller like me, it has virtually nothing to savour apart from the plain vanilla of all mocktails- Virgin Mojito. My friends (booze lovers) ordered Vat 69 and tequila. For starters we ordered nachos (nothing great), Chicken Takrai and Chilly Chicken (too sweet) and for main course -Non vexican pizza ,Chicken Alfredo. Chicken Takrai was splendid. The pizza was also great. We hoped the portions to be slightly bigger, given the price.The slow service and the meagre portions of the dishes were the negatives of the place. It is a good place to unwind over booze and finger food. Easily one of the best in the City of Joy!!

Ambience-4.5/5
Taste-4/5
Service-2/5
Value for money-3/5

It's an overhyped place. Visited this place for an after office party. The ambience is not at all great. The food was good though and as well as liked their hookah.
Last, but not the least the music was also good.. credit goes to DJ HAYM

Visited there with a friend of mine to have a relaxed time. We took a seat and we ordered for LIT and a fresh lime soda since my friend doesn't drink. Then we ordered for a Margarita pizza and full loaded nachos. We wanted a hookah menu but they told us they ran out of flavor.  We were really disappointed but they came back again and said they only have double apple and pan rasna in flavor. So we ordered for double apple. It was good. It didn't choke us one bit. Coming back to food and drinks, it was good though it took a bit time. We were not given the WiFi password. The manager told us that the network is not good but it was showing full signal. At the end we wanted to order for Philadelphia cheesecake but they dont have any dessert in the menu. Bummer. But would like to come back here again soon.

This booze story was a good one , if not great . Spread over two floors , high tools on the ground level and couches on the first floor , dim lighting , live sports projection, hookah , smoking room this place has most of the things one looks for a boozing place. The happy hour menu comes with lesser prices which makes the pocket pinch still bearable , after 7 pm the prices go almost double which makes it damn expensive. I had a COSMOPOLITAN , MOJITO , a large peg of absolute and my friends had blenders pride and old monk. The mocktails were well made , but the downside was the time they took to serve food. We ordered a NONVEG PENNE IN MIXED SAUCE and CHICKEN LASAGNA , CHICKEN WINGS to which the staff preinformed us that i will take 45minutes as they take atleast half a hour to serve any maincourse. Hookah is priced at whooping 650 /- plus taxes , so we avoided.

After reading some good reviews of this place, I decided to go here with my gf. But this was the worst experience of my entire life.
I entered this place but there was a shooting going on inside for a movie and that we had to wait outside for 5-10 minutes. They could have closed the place down if it was booked for shooting. But NO. They kept us waiting for 20 minutes instead of 10 and then finally let us enter inside after making us stand in the heat for so long.
Then we enter inside. And there was no place to sit. The waiters and the entire staff was busy looking at the shooting instead of doing their job and not giving a shit about their customers. There was absolutely no person to talk to inside. We were standing for another 10 minutes.
And then the best part!
After waiting for 5 minutes inside, 4 men enter inside destructively wearing terrorist outfits with an ak47 in their hand shouting ALLAHU AKBAR!
It was part of the movie shooting. But trust me, if you were in my place and wanted to go there just to chill and drink with your friends and you experience shit, won't you shit your pants?
Absolutely disgusting.
I would rather go to a funeral than visit this place again.

Went to this place one fine evening with the highest of expectations, the place being the talk of the town. 
The interior is top notch, no two way about that but the music and the ambience was dull. 
But yes, certainly a good place to chit chat and spend some good time with your friends. A different place with subtle music and a decent crowd. So basically chilled beer, tasty nibbles and good conversation is what you can have their. :)

Ask before hand if the happy hour beer is in stock, they gave our first pitcher, then they said we are done. After that we had to purchase pricey cans of beer. Not a huge deal, but if you advertise the happy hour, then you should make sure you have enough.

Its a place with gt8 ambience and environment. It is because of its high ceilings and dim lights. Its a heaven for all the couple's out der. They play gr8 music, but sumhow i feel its way to loud. The only drawback is that the serving amount is small and there is nothin extraordinary abt its taste.

This place had been on my list for quite sometime and finally got to visit it yesterday. The ambiance is great for a cozy night out with friends, dim lighting, good music and ample seating arrangements. Although i do wish they would operate the upper zone, the lighting was beautiful.
We ordered three dishes, "Nachos" and "Moroccan Fries" ¬†which tasted fine but the quantity wasn't enough. I would recommend "Bucket of Fries" if you just want munch onto something. We had green apple hookah which was quite expensive but the ambiance was worth it.¬†
This place is pocket friendly for food and drinks, doesn't loot you with unreasonable tax. You should check it off your list for sure!

The decor is very quaint, like a rustic tavern. The menu for food and drinks looks like a newspaper. All these quirks make the setting rather interesting. 

We went there during happy hours, where all drinks are a little cheaper. Their alcohol stock is pretty good, and we got everything we ordered for. 
We had ordered Malibu, Absynth, Long island ice tea and a beer tower. 

Food was good. We ordered a Bucket of wings, a basket of loaded fries, white sauce penne pasta and, brownie obsession for dessert. Couldn't complain about the quantity or quality of any of the dishes.

The service, however, left something to be desired. 

All in all, a good experience. Will definitely be coming back here. :)

Walked in yesterday evening with colleagues. Is spacious and big. The service is good but the lady serving us was very unfriendly. Had no smile on her face and was a tad bit weird. Anyways the happy hour is from 1 to 7 pm but they have a menu with reduced prices instead of 1:1.
Ordered two 2 litres of draught beer, 1 LIIT,4 small vodkas. Half the drinks we wanted were not available so that was disappointing as well.  No mocktail in the menu, so people who don't drink and are accompanying you they need to be content with orange and pineapple juice or a fresh lime soda. 
They don't serve any snacks on the table and everything needs to be bought. The chips were good but the nachos stole the show.
We ordered a mushroom starter which even a vegetarian with us did not like so you get how it was. Very bland in taste. The tables don't have salt and pepper even to fix the taste.
The chicken cheese kebab tasted more like malai kebab but they were soft and juicy so we were happy. The. Bill came to around 3500.
If the small things are looked into then the place should do well. 
Wishing the management all the very best.

It was my birthday last saturday and i decided to take my friends here. We went during the Happy Hours. The entrance is really cool. It looks like a wine cellar. The entrance door has got pipes as in a wine cellar. The interior is very normal, nothing over the top or expensive but apt. Dark, wooden floor, with sitting arrangements on 2 floors and the bar counter looks great. Beverages we had were Grey Goose, Screwdriver, Absolut, Absolut Flavours, Kingfisher Can, Hookah, Nachos. Everything was perfect and at a great price. Didn't like the music as such. Music is slow. Could have been better i guess. Service was great too. Overall a great experience.

The Great Booze Story as the name suggests unfolds a saga of booze at affordable prices. This stands exactly where Soho was. A giant screen , happy hours and more than value for money nibbles ensures its crowded at all hours.

The News Nibbles come at Rs 50 a pop. The first time I glanced at the newspaper cum menu card, I had to check again to be sure whether I was getting it right.

There are platters, pizzas, pastas and a lot of other food options.

The draught beer comes in
Glass,
Boot
Pitcher and Tower options.

Most beer brands are listed on the menu

We ordered

Nibbles:
Smoked Masala papad ( 2 medium sized roasted roundels topped with minced cucumber, tomatoes, onions and green chilli)

Peanuts ( available in a variety of flavours)

Nachos ( served in a mini pizza pan topped with lots of cheese and tomato salsa)

Piddi papdi ( crispy and thin papdis topped with aloo cubes with imli chutney, a hint of ketchup and topped with coriander leaves and a wee bit of home made mayonnaise/ sour cream)

Appetizers:
Vodka infused mushrooms : well flavoured, sauteed just perfectly but quantity was less.

Garlic bread : freshly baked bread loaded with mozzarella was enjoyed.

Mains:
Don Alfredo special:
Cheese pasta with mushroom was perfectly cheesy , the flavour of mushroom was distinct and pasta was al dente.

The Provencial pizza : the pizza was perfectly thin crust and toppings sufficient. I found the pizza sauce slightly bland.

My friends ordered some fish and chicken dishes . They were happy with the food as well.

The hookah was smooth. We ordered double Apple flavours. The pricing of the hookah was slightly on the higher side.

It was an enjoyable experience. Servers were knowledgeable and prompt.

So the story begins like this, one fine evening  visited this place located near Minto Park crossing in the Ideal Plaza building.
Finding this will be easy as a pie.
Okay, coming to the main attraction of this place which is the ambience, firstly to be noted the place really dark and low light flooring, so clicking pictures should be done with Flash on. Even we need to use the flash to read the menu. High tables, bar counters, big tv screen, DJ in the house, separate smoking area this place offers alot to ur expectations. Thumbs up for the ambience.
Now coming for the hunger and thirst, this place offers a wide range of liquors along with some apetizers. The menu card itself behold its glory as a newspaper revealing the headlines. For the evening we had,
1. Draught Beer: coming straight from the barrel the woody taste of the beer was the convenient way to start and get the taste buds running.
2. Blenders Pride: the premium malted whisky was of no difference, very familiar stuff.
3. Black Dog: (though i didn't have it) according to my friend it was for the sake of variation.
4. Crispy Babycorn: tasted okayish, but need to mention quantity was a bit less.
5. Achari Chicken Kebab: diced chicken marinated in corriander paste and other spices tasted a lil tangy and went well will the whiskey.
Though the appetite stopped here due to some emergencies, still this place has alot to offer. Things like hookah, pizza, games etc will truly not let ur evening ruined.
Pocket punch is a bit on the higher side, in the scorecard value for money will be 3 out of 5. It is recommended to visit the place in between the Happy Hours (1.00 pm - 7.00 pm) to grab the real deal.
The rating is purely for the ambience, a good hangout place for groups. 
P.S. Sports lover will a have a gala time as the big screen is tuned to sports channel only. The DJ was not so good, need to mention as he didn't play some of the requested songs.

A nice place to hang out with your buddies. One can enjoy live streaming of matches. The ambience is a bit darker but I liked it . The menu card in the form of newspaper is also a bit different

We went on a reunion with my friends. Ambience was superb just like a pub with a separate smoking zone. Haven't had the chance to try out the food. It was taking too long to get food items. Customer service could improve. Altogether a decent experience. I would love to go again.

One of the gorgeous happening pub in Kolkata. Great place with great ambiance. Nice place to hang-out with friends. It‚Äôs really dark though. The wall concept and artificial pipes all over the wall is old now. Food quality is so yummy. Happy Boozing....

The ambience of this place is great and the Dj's tunes makes you shake your legs to it. The drinks and hookah are awesome too. But once you order any food you have to wait for that item for about 15-20 mins, by that time we usually drank up all the booze we ordered. And the portion size of the dishes are also small. If you guys can make up on these thing... Well than The Great Booze Story will become my usual hangout place! @

Locating Great Booze Story is easy as pie. Get down at Rabindra Sadan Metro Station and start walking towards Exide. Great Booze Story would be a turn on your right. Another landmark would be Bhawanipur College.

Lively ambience. Normally Crowded. Large screen television. Happy hours. Walls stocked with pipes. They have hookah. And also finger food.

It has a English Pub ambiance. The exterior is attractive and the interior is impressive. It has a huge space insde. Its very good for a big group of friends to hang out, celebrate an occasion. Its even good for few old friends to catch up after a long period, also for Lone Drinkers its a nice place to be. It has different sitting arrangements as per your mood, age and accompanying friends. The prices are even reasonable for the ambiance you enjoy and the liquor you consume. It has separate Smoking zone inside. The Bar Tender is very friendly.

Pubs and theme cafes have taken over the city for quite some time now... And this one is brilliant... Location, ambience, crowd, food and drinks par excellence... The service needs to be slightly more prompt though... Or maybe we were drinking too fast... One cannot have enough of the boots and the pitchers... The pizzas are good too... The hookah is also there for good company... All in all, a fantastic place to chill out with like minded friends... Would definitely like to go back for more...

With a catchy name like that it's bound to attract people looking for a place for a drink or two. It's a fun place, full of life and perfect for a group of 4-5.

Apart from the drinks, don't forget to order their Pizza. Happy Boozing. :)

Situated right where Soho used to be, this place resonates a rusty decor, a la factory feel.Once you open the door,everything is dark and one needs to find empty tables as most of them are occupied which proves that this place has striked a chord with the pub-goers of Kolkata.The music is loud and the service is a bit slow.Albeit, the hospitality is good.Coming to the food, the kebab platter is prepared well although it has room to be better.One can try out the kalmi kebab which I found to be succulent.The last time I have been there, I tried out the chocolate Baileys and the blend was perfect.They need to stock up their draught beer though which was unavailable on one or two occasions.The prices are a bit on the steeper side, thanks to 27% WBST. 3.5 from me for GBS.

At one of the prime locations of the city, this was on my list for a long long time and it did work out pretty smoothly.¬†for me, i am generally not a big fan of dimly lit places, but it was nevertheless manageable. Beers were good in stock , and well the cokctails did taste good. The masala papad is a big hitPocket pinch is well high and quantities needs to buck up, according to me. Good if u want a posh weekend trip from your office or so, and with the euro 2016 around, andif the matches are good, the ambience is really nice. the only 0.5 i am not giving it is the time the staff takes when there is a rush, and they could have added a little more light to it

Nice place to hangout. Mez sitting is cute! Its really dark though. The dingy wall concept and artificial pipes all over the wall is old now,so nothing appealing as to the d√©cor. Can't comment on food taste as had just cocktails and hookah. Hookah was a BIG disappointment! They surely don't know how to make one. Pinch in pocket is lil high, obviously considering the location.

Coming straight to the point the place feels like Soho gave birth to something smaller than itself! The place is the same feel is the same. Minus the dance floor. Food is okay considering the wide variety of options available to have food and alcohol these days! One can give it a try for sheer nostalgia and the want to try a new place. 
One liner: It's the booze story without the greatness :)

The story of the great booze story is actually not that great. The main problem that we had faced was the attitude. We occupied 5seats in the zone which was supposedly non smoking. After some time two ladies came and it seemed that they visit the place frequently. It was kind of vini vici vidi for them. They came, they sat, they lit up cgrts in the no smoking zone.  We checked and asked for permission and we were denied. When asked about them the floor manager never showed up. 
In terms of beer, nothing more than heinekenn. Prices are just on the higher sides. Chicken wings are good but until n unless u enjoy dark ambience with loud music and arrogant people around you, you will feel like, the way we felt. Drinking in a ditch!!

It was a really Rude Booze Story. As far as service is concerned, any thing possible that can go wrong....went wrong.
We were a group of 9 and wanted a table downstairs. The tables were reserved, and that was not an issue. Your staff belittling us, and rudely asking us to head upstairs was really crossing the line.
Next, we were given a table that could seat only 7 comfortably. The rest of the entire floor was literally empty that time, but the waiter said we couldn't seat anywhere since others too were reserved. Blatant lie. The place was half empty the entire evening. We asked for two chairs/stools for us to sit and even to that the waiter rudely said no. We later complained to someone else who then arranged for stools.
When we were placing the first order, just food and a Hookah while we were waiting for few people to join us, we were told by him, and I exactly quote "alcohol order karna necessary hai. Pata nahi aapko yahan jagah mil gayi...bahot crowded hai toh bina alcohol liye Aap nahi baith sakte". Extremely rude. This gentleman needs to be told that this is not how you speak with your Customers. Also, they also played, what looked like a cheap gimmick, by having only imported alcohol to offer for the evening. Anything Indian, and just no! Not cool.
Next, when few friends joined us they didn't let them enter. They were guys, and of course, the pub doesn't want to treat them nicely. I went to let them know that they were with us...and I was asked " are you sitting downstairs? " "are you all stags?" No. We weren't, but I am sure had that been the case we would have been asked to leave, after placing our orders. I understand some places do follow this policy, but in that case you should inform beforehand. And not after seating your guests.
I'd give them a big ZERO on service. They really should treat guests better.

In spite of the recurring I'll treatment, we didn't want to spoil our night so we stayed...

Now coming to the ambiance, try to get a table downstairs. Height of the area upstairs in less, and can be an issue for people taller than six feet. Otherwise, the whole setting is quite nice. Upstairs, the sofas have become old and have torn down too at places...and aren't the most comfortable ones either. They have many TVs also upstairs where EURO 2016 was being broadcast. Overall, the place is really good to setup a nice mood. If only the service was any good.
They had a live band playing downstairs... Which was the saving grace for the evening. They played really well and were the only thing there that I enjoyed.

Alcohol, we didn't like...first we were given flat beers which we had to return. Long Island Ice Tea tasted like stale coke. We ended up having mainly shots and beer only, no cocktails assuming their bartender was on leave for the evening. The Hookah is great but they hardly had any choice for flavors.
Food is moderate, nothing great particularly. Onion Rings were burnt...over fried, so we had to send them back and ask again. Portions are really small, but are priced accordingly. Food took a lot of time to arrive as well. Few of their dishes that were recommended to me were not available. Basket of fries was good.

And to end it, while paying the bill...after a couple times that the machine didn't read my card, the waiter looks at me like he is doing a great favor to me by swiping my card.

Overall, a really bad experience. Not sure if I'd want to go here again ever. The service staff really needs to understand that customers should not be ill-treated. Friday night, and the place was not playing its best game. Your place, I didn't find worth the swagger you were trying to flaunt with your over bookings and pretend elitist class.
My Story here was anything but great. A really disappointing Booze Story.

Nestled around the AJC Bose Rd area, this is a growing sensation in the already notch-up scene of Elgin. The pipings on the entrance lead you right into the Garage styled and Naked themed club. The staff is a breeze to deal with and they ensure you have a great night every single time. The menu is far enough to a level that you won't hesitate to get wasted on a weekend night. The food is a delight and goes off well with any kind of booze you prefer. Presentation isn't much of a talking point here, but that isnt a concern anyways. You can go all Desi to Gourmet, while you go all Draught to Imported. The place rounds it off well with a good Music support for the floor and Live Sports screenings.

It was 14th feb I guess, and we three people on our enfields were nowhere close to getting a girl. So we decided to booze, and this place popped up on Zomato's recommendation.
This Pub-Bar has replaced the once famed 'Soho' and occupies a huge area with two stories. Downstairs you get the english pub type feel, where the bartender mixes drinks and lines them up for you ! On the floor above are tables for groups which were already reserved. So we took seats by the bar. The atmosphere is sure to delight you, which all the dim fancy lights and a good music and an excellent Dj! Nucleya + Enigma :)
Food and Drinks :
High priced, ¬†Quality is good, quantity not so much. We had the Chicken Bbq Wings. Nicely done. We took French fries with a tartar dip and the masala papad to go along with the drinks. We also took a Hookah, strong and good. The menu is designed like a newspaper :) The drinks prices are on the higher side too, but considering a place like this, I don't mind paying!¬†
It's a good place for a booze night out. But there's no dance floor, and it would have been great if they incorporated that !

Cheap Booze and Cheap booze : Pretty much sums up the entire experience. 
A little bit on the shady side is the ambiance, and the Music can be a tad bit better.
Chill with friends over few pints of chilled draft? TGBS it is.

The place is very well designed and is unique in it's own way. Being a non-drinker, I have no idea about drinks here but the food was fine. The things you need to worry about before visiting this place - 1) "chappals" are not allowed inside, you have to wear shoes. 2) There is major network issues in this place (I experienced this problem here). 3) There is no parking space outside the outlet, so if you want to park your car, you have to request the security guard of that building in which this outlet is situated to let you park your car for a while. 4) You cannot enter stag or with a group of guy friends. You need girl(s) for entry. *strange*

I find this place to be pretty average to be honest,  the only thing that led me to put even a 3 star rating here is the surprise free veg platter that they served after we joined their loyalty program on e awards. One thing you should be aware of,  the staffs over there,  they take down your numbers for this loyalty programme service ( female guests),  and later call up and text which is highly unethical and unprofessional, I am not naming anyone but a message to the authority to look into the same

This is one of my favourite pubs in the city. Very easy to locate with a superb ambience. And the best part is their Happy Hour menu "L√© Daily Tipple"...where the prices of the drinks are reduced by more than 50% (it can't get better than this) during 2 to 5 pm everyday!! I have been there 3 or 4 times already and have tried most of their shots..Jagerbomb being my favourite and also I love their cocktails, especially the Long Island Iced tea! I haven't actually tried out much of the food there, but the non vegetarian tandoori platter was quite good as well as the smoked chicken crostini and bucket of wings!! They have quite a spacious smoking room, and a swanky bar counter. The cool music, the awesome crowd, efficient service and the oh-so-affordable drinks flowing in make this pub one to frequent, especially during live sports screenings.

So finally got a chance to visit this place with three of my friends. The ambience inside is quite amazing with sports running on the projector and music to give you a party like feel. The interior is great too. Now, coming to the main part, we had ordered a tower and a pitcher of draught beer. And with it, he had dry chilli chicken and chicken wings. They also provided us with a free veg starter for first time visit. The service was good, the price is quite cheap too. But my only complaint is that, in spite of visiting on a Saturday, most of the items in there menu were unavailable. We were left disappointed when we tried to order burgers or sea foods. Even the chicken wings weren't available at first, but after a little wait, they came up with it. Other than this, I would definitely recommend it to all and will be visiting again personally.

Great Booze Story! Quite a catchy name but frankly this is just your average pub.. 
The few pros include a nice big smoking room, cheap booze and lip smacking starters to die for(crispy chilli babycorn :p). 
Its a decent pub to go and hangout with your friends, have a nice time, share a laugh and a pint of beer. 
The place is spacious enough with two tiers, and the walls are designed with pipelines and sorts, so u might get that Oh wow effect. 
As for the cons, the service just doesn't reach up to the mark. They keep mixing up the orders and sometimes can be late too. The hookah is massively overpriced. And the place is too dimly lit. Taking Selfies will be a pain in the a** :P 
Anyway summing up, if u r weary from work and have no fun place to go, get your friends together and just hop into this place to have a splendid time!

Isn't this a PUB? Which is supposed to mean a Public Bar. Unfortunately, we were denied access here yesterday on the grounds of having no females to accompany us. What if I don't have a girlfriend? What if my female friends aren't free? What if I don't want to get drunk with my sister? What if I wanted to wait for my girlfriend there, till she arrived? No chikas, no booze is a moto I've seen clubs follow, but for a PUB to embrace the tag is kind of weird and disappointing.

All I wanted to do yesterday was to have a good time with my old mates. Until I can convince my girldriend to take up drinking, a solid 1 points.

The name is enticing enough for you to stop and hop in. Great Booze Story is makes you realize that you have entered a Bangalore pub. The interesting pipeline design on the walls, the large wooden door entrance complete the pub look.
The place is divided between two areas ( three if you include the smoking chamber) 
The first floor level has small couple seats while the ground floor area houses the bar and the dance floor. 
This place is always buzzing with people and it completely lifts my spirits to be here.
I have tried their pizza, pasta, stuffed mushrooms and their veg kebab platter. 
The food is good here along with a few beers. 
The service here is a major issue if you ask me. They keep forgetting youe orders and tend to delay a lot.

The bar is good here and I have tried a few mocktail as well. ( forgetting names,sorry)

Prices are decent considering the ambiance and environment, though the alcohol prices sometimes get expensive compared to BSE.

Overall, a nice place for hookah, music and booze.

A new pop up to the trending list The Great Booze Story has reasonable rates on both food and drinks.Even Shisha is available.
Food- tastes quite good but less in quantity.Suffiecient for only one person 
Drink- mostly all the high end brands are available ,Cheaper ones are not available mostly 
Service- Late service,the Serviceman who attended us seemed very dumb.
Ambience - Simply wonderful theres a big seating place on the mazarine floor which was closed.Smoking room available.
Location - Sarat bose road,beside Ozi ,very near to the Ajc bose road flyover.
Since The owner was known to us we availed some special offers.
You can give it a try ones ‚ò∫

I had read the previous reviews of this place n went there to get a feel of the decor and ambience everybody was talking about. Absolutely impressed I must say. The booze, about which the great story should be, is well stocked. The catch is there, invariably. The food. It's actually better to ask the staff what's available rather than ordering from that rather impressive newspaper style menu. Nice place to hang out with a gang, but a disappointment if you are there for the food. Hope n pray it improves.

First of all the ambience is decent,the seating arrangement is also great.The behaviour of the managers are worst,when we entered here,the restaurant was almost packed,we asked the managers how long do we have to wait,they told rudely that either you people can sit on the chairs near the bar or you can leave.So we sat near the bar,after sometime one of the tables became empty,i went to the manager for that table,he told his waiter to tell us that this table is reserved but after arguing with him we got that table.Now coming to ordering of food and alcohol,most of the waiters have no idea how to take a order or how to behave with a customer,after waiting for 30 minutes more the waiter came to our table to take our order,we ordered a pitcher of Lost Island Iced Tea cocktail(whiskey,cranberry juice),Bucket of wings,Non vexican Pizza.The bucket of wings and the pizza came within 20 minutes,the waiter came after sometime and told us that whiskey is not available so they will mix vodka in the cocktail,we agreed,the cocktail came almost 45 minutes after we ordered.The food was very delicious ,especially the pizza and the cocktail was also well mixed.No desserts were available,not even ice cream,so apart from the behaviour of the managers and waiters it was a good place to drink.

I guess the biggest mistake which I did was to come to TGBS..more than 80% items were not there..cocktails weren't there..the staff were clueless as to what is being ordered and what they are serving!! A serious overhauling needs to be done by the management if they want to see this place carve a place for itself!! But for this visit, disappointing would be what best describes our mood...

So after a few visits from my friends planned to drop here. The ambience and the decor is good. Cozy place. Smoking zone should have more exhausts.. Anyway. Its a good place to drink nothing more. The food is mediocre. The portion sizes are very very small. Not sufficient for 1 person. Music is bad..

Must visit for group of ppl who loves beer.
At the end the manager complemented my lay and told tht couple are given more preference there....

A posh bar and restaurant that has a Uber feel in the ambience and the music.. We ordered a kebab platter that just vanished in 5 mins.. The meat just melts in your mouth! Then we ordered pasta.. That tasted great! The long island ice tea was the show stealer.. The strawberry mojhito was a little disappointing but the service of the staff and their quick repercussion subsets the feeling! Over all a must visit!

Great Booze story apparently does not have a great story to tell...Food is good provided u get it when u order. A long list on the menu but 80% will not be available, remaining 20% will take at least 30 minutes. better to go to a local Chinese restaurant n eat at 50% cheaper. They don't even serve water as a compliment forget about munchies...personally if you ask SOHO was better...erstwhile TGBS.

After soho closed down. I went here for a party with high hopes. It's seems great from outside. The decor is really nice. They took an hour to get the Sheesha, saying the delay was coz they had to get it from OZI next door. The food was not good. We did not like any item we ordered, be it vegetarian or non vegetarian. They served masala chips in "steel tiffin box". The music was not very good and hardly audible, the volume being so low.  The staff was not quite helpful and service was very slow. Worst experience.

Located in sarat bose road.. next to Ozi.. this place looks very interesting from the outside . The interest grows as you enter.. the wonderfully made interiors depicting the prohibition age in America with dim lights and pipelines and interesting light fixtures . The menu is in a form of a chronicle which is huge and widespread. The happy hour menu excites you even more and then you rub your hands and call the waiter to order what youve been waiting for so long only to hear that half of the items are unavailable. Disappointment disappointment. Not even the basics. So you get to relish whatever little is available and try to drink in the ambience.

The Great Booze Story is conveniently located near Minto Park and is rather hard to miss. Lots of parking space, interesting decor and a giant monitor with the IPL playing..what more does one need?! Booze and good food! Well booze is moderately priced not cheap for sure but the choices are extensive and as far as food is concerned whatever we wanted to order starting from masala peanuts to masala chips to banana chips nothing - Absolutely nothing was available. Staff is pretty earnest and rather courteous in their approach. Really liked the ambience and the music is pretty cool. Awaiting my next visit! Hopefully this time will get something to munch on!

I have been to this place twice and I was not disappointed by it even once. What stands out is the great ambience (u have the option of choosing from among sofas or bar stools) , the menu card(in the form of newspapers) and the reasonable rates (the bill amounted to only Rs.1612 for 7 beers, 1 breezer and 3 chicken dishes).
We ordered the Wingy Affair, chickem molayam and the chicken teriyaki. The chicken molayam was to die for. One of the best plates of kebab I have ever had.
The only criticism I have about this place is the service. There was a lot of delay in serving the order.
All in all this place is good for hanging out with friends or colleagues without experiencing an alarming pocket pinch!

I liked the concept of this place. The way to describe it is 'industrial' 
It has a good decor, I liked the concept of female waitresses, who are polite and alert to your call. Food is, well, not the best that I had but it was good. I loved the affordable prices of the liquors. However, there are a few improvement this place needs 
This place is the lazy talented child, who has great potential, yet won't work on them. The decor looks incomplete and a bit hasty, music too loud and the place is too dimly lit. If the people really pays a decorator and work on it, this place will turn heads. Giving 4 for it's potential for excellence. This place is not living upto it's mark, they are good, but just good, they can be the best. They need to work on this industrial theme, they need to make the ppl understand their theme and connect with it. I am having a lot of hope for this place.

We ordered usual beers N whiskey and then LIT which couldn't have been bit strong.... Not much varieties in Vegs and we ordered potato wages..... And combination of 3 dish.... In which babycorn noodles and paneer were served and was extremely tasty..... And at top of it..... Every thing was reasonable and will not pinch your pocket.... They even dont charge service charges..... Hookah is also available here..... Very very awsm ambience and it's still new so many don't know about this place still

A fine bar cum restuarant situated in Elgin! The ambience of place is awesum.. The DJ n d big screen r very good..
Live matches r shown if there are any..
Coming to d food, v tasted Chicken Achari kebab which was v good, well cooked, tasty, a bit salty though, but overall a good dish!!
Next was Chicken wings on bucket which was really very good, d sauce was awesum n so were d french fries, its just dat dey can gv a mayonese dip instead of regular tomato sauce..
Coming to d Chinese Platter, d noodles were v good n so ws d dry chilli chickn n d chilli chickn gravy!! Good in taste n quantity overall!.
The dissapointmnt was Classic Chickn steak.. The mash potato wd it ws a bit foul tasting. Mayb the potato ws not good! D sauce which ws serve wd it was also not that good.. The chickn ws a bit hard on d outside.. Overall not a good dish..

A very nyc place and some v good food..
The ambience is really awesum...

I have always preferred pubs of elgin over those of park street. But i never got to check this pub out. Finally, i got the opportunity to go to this place. I need to say, the ambience of this place is great. We ordered a tower of draught beer at first. Then tried a pitcher. Loud music really helped us get high. The staff of the pub was very courteous. Yes, it is a bit expensive place. But, try to visit during the happy hours.

We were travelling to park street from Hindustan park on a rain washed kolkata afternoon and on the road just saw this place and parked cause the name was attractive. 
The inside is huge to say the least and has two floors.. The decor is of old american style with wooden panels and dim lights. 
We took seating on the first floor and the price of drinks were quite affordable during the happy hours. 
We played some game of fusball and enjoyed the drinks the server and floor manager lady was very warm. My friends took the hookah and liked it. 
They informed that they were booked for the ind vs pak match and we had to leave early than we wanted. Would like to return some other day to spend some more time.

Went to "The Great Booze Story" on a Saturday evening with couple of friends. The place is conveniently located at Sarat Bose Road (Exactly where Soho was).
The ambience is perfect for an evening with frienda and the music sets the mood. After a few drinks you feel like grooving with a decent sized floor to dance. The food is strictly average with not too much options available. They have a large variety of available drinks and the preparation Shisha is also commendable. Having said that, it's important to highlight that the place is highly over priced. Overall a definite one time visit but not a place to be made a regular hangout.

Visited the great booze story in happy hour. The tables were empty when we entered though the floor above was full. We were told that all the tables were reserved so we had to sit at bar counter. Gradually the place started to fill up. The music was loud but goes with the ambience . We ordered beer (first 2, later on 2 more) with Cajun spiced mushroom and pizza stracetti next. Foods were good. We were happy to see the bill too , which usually comes as shock in almost all the pubs and restaurants . üòÉ with

The Great Booze Story is an average story of a bar cum restaurant near Minto Park. Decorated in it's own way, the dark room provides a comfort zone to have drinks with friends or partner. The ambience will make you feel like grooving with the songs after a few shots. Won't have to wait till midnight to get into the mood, some pieces of Chicken Teriyake with cocktails like Screwdriver or Caprioska will bring it on even in midday. But the prices are bit high. And though it has it's own decors, the ambience of the dimly lit bar is nothing unusual or different. A rating of 7.5 out of 10 should be justifiable.

Don't feel like writing a review / I was denied an entry just because I am a stag !!! 

Why this is classified as Pub then ???

And why this place should not be regarded as Clubs while they are saying either couple or club members are allowed only !!!! 

And why on earth @ZomatoIN listed this place if they consider themselves as Club ???

Then why can't I find Calcutta Club / Bengal Club / Tolly Club on Zomato !!!

When i read about their prices and menu in zomato, i thought that it was a reasonably priced restaurant and so me and a few of my friends went there to check it out. It was sunday and totally empty. The decor of the place is nice. It was extremely loud and hardy any light. Anyway, we ordered a couple of beers and some steaks. The size of the steak was half the size of my smart phone. When we got the bill we saw that they had charged around 40 something percent tax. One of the worst pubs in Calcutta. Wont recommend it.

A restaurant themed on the prohibition era in America. Walls adorned with the pictures of Mafiosos like Al Capone and Bugsy Malone and menu cards which look like the morning newspaper. Hats off to TGBS for the brilliant concet and interiors. The happy hours is something one must avial, the only problem is availability. Everything was not be available on the menu. The chicken and cheese kebabs are a must try.

An evening with booze.... yeah that should be the theme when you visit this newly opened pub at the very place where once upon a time 'Soho' was situated. The interior is designed in two levels, lower tier with round tables and high chairs exactly like a pub should be, and upper one with cozy sofas. Walls n roofs are decorated in such a way that you'll feel you are sitting in an underground parking lot or workshop type things, which is quite a new approach to the city of joy. Yeah there is DJ at a corner and large screens for sports to woo youngsters (me too :p). We ordered for a tower of Heineken (2 litres) and Non-veg Tandoori Platter, Karwari Fish-n-Chips & Moroccan Cigar Rolls. Food tasted good, but the amount was very very less. Even 3 plates seemed not quite enough for 3 of us :( The hookah was good too, though nothing much to mention about the 'teen paan' flavour. Always a favourite. Overall, a so-so place to chill with friends, nothing extra-ordinary.

The price is extremely reasonable. The food is also great. So i would recommend a visit to the great booze story.
We had a fish as a starter (it was damm good) and a chicken steak. Visited a couple of times, looking forward to go again.

Well placed. Went with a friend. Ordered a huge variety of foreign liquors and a few desi ones (at last). Service was fast. Drinks were well made, jaegerbomb was the only concoction maybe we took, but it's very easy to make, so can't really comment on their bartending skills. Best thing was the happy hour prices till 7 PM, DO make use of it. Smoking room was spacious, a plus point for me. The only negative point worth pointing out is maybe the ultra loud music, and the choice of songs. The DJ did play some cool ones, but most of the times, the songs were very poorly chosen. Went there on Saturday evening, expected more crowd, but was disappointed on that front also. Maybe after 9 crowd starts pouring in, but we left before that. At last, great place guys, keep up the good work! Loved the ambience, staff manner and drinks. Definitely will come back next time I visit Kolkata.

The great booze story is one of the saddest place in kolkata.Their service is extremely poor plus the food is also not that great.One suggestion that i would like to give to the owners of that place is to keep literate people as their staff.The other day when we were leaving booze story ,me and my brother were having a conversation about something, however the bouncers heard us and  thought that we were abusing them.This led to a heated argument, they were extremely rude and abusive .It is not my problem if they cannot understand english.I will never visit that place again and also suggest others to stay away from such hopeless place.

The Ambience is good. That's the only good thing about this place. We had gone during their happy hours, and we were expecting a 1:1 offer or discounted prices. We confirmed the same from the staff, and they agreed we would be given the drinks at discounted prices. But once we got the bill, i saw that the prices had not been discounted, and were same as that mentioned in the menu. We felt cheated. So guys, when you are going their ensure you dont get cheated, like we did.

I've been to this place a couple of times. And the quality of service, food and sometimes even the cocktails is very inconsistent. The fist time we visited the place we were in love with it. The second time was so so. The third time, we ended up walking out of the place and then went somewhere else. Our drinks were not served to us, food wasn't "ready". We waited for around 30 minutes, paid for the drinks and left. Haven't been there since.

They made my birthday special. The ambience, the music, the crowd and the staff members everything is so overwhelming.

Hospitality shown here cannot be explained in words. Service is just too good and yes how do I forget to mention the complimentary discount. Thanks a ton for that :)
Great music. Amazing food. Lovely place to chill out with friends.
I suggest people to keep all their birthday parties here. You sure won't be disappointed.

Thankyou once again :)

My wife is not a pub goer but was impressed with the kind of food and service she got here . The ambience is very nice and would like to come back again to this wonderful place and recommend others as well ......

The Great Booze Story undoes the age old adage of "good things come to those who wait". The service in this place was inept and grossly unsatisfactory.  The service staff spilled food on the guests and took a good 60 minutes to bring food that couldn't have been any less unappealing if tried. 


I've been to places far worse in Delhi and Bangalore and what's common between all these places is that I will NEVER return to it. If you have a free evening, spend it staring at a tyre wheel its far better than visiting this place. The food is chewy and portions are unacceptable for the prices charged.

A great place if you are looking to enjoy some loud music and booze with friends. The food is pretty good with great variety but service can be a little slow. Prices are highly affordable.

Diluted alcohol and pathetic service. It takes years to get your order delivered. The staff seems to keep no track of your orders. And these guys deceive you on alcohol quantity as well. This place is not worth of even a single visit!

Been there twice ..!! Food is nice n drinks are decently priced !! The ambience is not so great but ok kinds !! I had a bad experience 2nd time because of the DJ .. When i requested him to play dance tracks he was very rude, arrogant and was showing too much attitude ! Dude u are a dj n its ur job to know music better but that doesn't mean u insult other people !! I complained to the manager but he did nothing!! I think this attitude is not acceptable on part of that manager also !!

We went to TGBS on a friday evening. To start with the place, the light was too dim for my liking but the music was good. Hukka and booze were fine. The LIITs decent. The only complaint I have is with the food. The pizza was rubbery and almost impossible to eat after it got a bit cold. Pasta was okayish. The kebab platter and Exotic Veg. Fricasse were very good. The service was fine. All in all, nothing special about the place.

No. This place is not what I expected it to be. You enter into this extremely dark ghetto ish space with loud music and then you have to scream the veins off your throat to get a waiter to notice you and take down your order. And then you get refused on half of the items mentioned in the menu coz hey they ain't available. What do u go to a pub for? Get drunk empty stomach and then play hide and seek? No.

Its a sad booze story, at the very outset when you enter, its the dimmed lights that give a dark and dingy look. The finger snacks are pretty standard and the liit is a must try, which is served in a boot shaped glass.

I really wish I could give negative rating to this place. I went for the first time and will never go back. We first had to change two tables because their staff wasn't informed. Then there was no one to take the order. After shouting at them. They took the order but no one was executing on it. After repeated reminder we get half the order. Wasted our time and ruined our mood. Hopeless case.

First of all, the kitchen didn't serve us any food. They were constantly chirping about Nachos to have with our drinks. Dude? Why for the sake of good alcohol I will have corn chips with extra Mayo in them?
Nevertheless, the tequilas and the pitcher were fairly priced. I loved the ambience because the dim lights,loud music and all that space gives you a good high. And sorry to say, the waiters were slow (very!)

The name goes apt with how we are.. Never before have I witnessed such a drastic transformation. A place much hyped, overpriced and ridiculously unfriendly has transformed into a haven for people like us. Amazing ambience, great music, impeccable chardonnay and delectable masala papads and kebabs. This place is probably now the best place if you want to let your hair down. And also kudos to the staff... You drink more, when people who serve you love you more. Keep it up great booze story. Certainly not the last time you will be seeing of me. Cheers! 


Have to reduce the stars.. Allow stags. Not all of us are rapists you know. Truly disgusted.

Went with some friends to tgbf.  It's the renovated soho, I kinda liked it better before, more brighter. The dim lit ghetto interiors with a spacy smoking room large lcd screen n high tables make it a pretty cool place to chill out. The menus r like newspapers kinda like social. Loved there fries. Cuisine is between social n chillis. Masala chips were good not warm though. The staff  is very rude and doesn't care about the guests. Tried Shisha recommend red bull based green apple. Ordered chix wing bucket with fries! Smelt funny, sent back promptly replaced by chicken kebab. Pizzas were nice. Fries thin cut very good. Asian not so good. Stick with indian. the sound is promising setup is such on weekends it will turn to a nightclub. Overall satisfied but nothing wow! Just mix match from some proven concepts. Prices also I the higher side. Food is average with mint chutney being really sad. The waiters were nice except the order taker who was very rude.

Ambience. Spot on. Good in house DJ to exactly make you feel like dancing which isn't made for dancing :P Hookah and a bar what more does one need on a Saturday night. And good food as well. The only thing which i found bad was that there was a loophole in the part of the management. There was no person to entertain anyone who entered the space or helped them get seated at a table. That's a major blow to the mood of the party.
Otherwise it's a cool place to chill on the weekends. :)

I landed up here just to spend some spare time with friends and ordered a hookah. It was very nicely done. That made me go again the very next day and explore more. The 3pan rose shisha was very good. We had a few drinks that was well prepared. We tried Moroccan cigars and masala chips. Cigars were worthy of all the waiting. Service was a bit slow as there were very less men on the floor. Apart from everything, the experience was great. Would surely recommend.

Came to this newly opened place with friends & high hopes...
Went out with memorable stories EVERY TIME :)
The staff here is really friendly and always greet you with a smile.
Yes, they are mostly understocked with beers of different brews but they make it up with multiple varieties (y).
Did not have the food here so can't say anything about that, but the munches were exactly what it was needed for...
and finally their Boot Glass & Tiffin for the munches is a great idea twist..

Went to Great Booze Story on 25-Dec-15.Ambience was very good but the service is pathetic.. We have to wait 40 mins to get our first food. Morever there was no one to listen to.. We complained the manager as we were sitting upstairs and he said he is looking into it but nothing happened. The food took its own sweet time to arrive. It would be great if you improve the service. Thank you. 

Ps. We plan to visit today again. Will share about our experience once again

The Great Booze Story's attempt at being a gastro pub is a major fail. 
The food lacks substance.
We ordered the chicken teriyaki which was chicken with soya sauce
The spaghetti was dry and had too much chilli in it. 
The bartender lacks imagination and does not know how to mix anything but the basics. 
If you do go to the booze story stick to beer basic cocktails and chips and nachos.

Checked out the happy hour price and decided to go here. Except for the price, wasn't satisfied with the drink. Draught beer wasn't anything like it and when asked, did not get a proper or polite response. Food is okay. Need to improve the seats. And, no logic for a separate smoking room when it's door is always open towards the lounge.

So a friend and I decided to catch over a few rounds of drinks.

Since her office is in Elgin road, we were looking for a place nearby. After much deliberation, we decided to visit The Great Booze Story since we had heard a lot about the place and wanted to give it a try.

We entered about 10mins prior to 7. The place was blaring with loud music and buzzing with crowd.

The waiters gave us a menu which was more like a news paper. Great first impression.

We ordered our first round of drinks within the happy hours time(1-7pm). 4 rounds of Old Monk, a plate of loaded nachos and masala chips. A few mins later, we had a staff member prodding us to order something more and avail of the happy hour rates. Since we had already placed our order, we didn't bother(huge mistake). The chakhna was good enough. We didn't bother with food. Would love to come back for the food.

This place is insane given its happy hour rates. The rates post happy hours is almost 3x. (The 4 rounds we ordered post the happy hours kinda pinched us given the happy hour rates.)

Would totally recommend this place for the happy hour prices.

The only bummer would be the insanely loud music. Wasn't to the liking of my friend or me, who like to enjoy our drinks with soft music.

All in all, a brilliant first time experience.

For starters, do not be fooled by the Happy Hours stated by Zomato, I walked in to unhappy hours.
Ambience is on the positive side as it is a centrally located chilled out ace but the music is very disappointing, not for EDM lovers though. 
I was pretty full when I walked in hence did not have the courage to order food. We had draught beer which tasted decent.
So much so for this review, will add more to it on my second attempt the; as soon as I visit again.

Went there yesterday , being 25th Dec there was a looong Que to get in. We got our number within 30 minutes. It was a duplex. The ambience was good. But the place could have been better as there was quite a space wasted, it would have been great if there was a dance floor. 

Now coming to the food drinks and hookah. We ordered a mix sauce pene pasta and a veg kabab platter.  They were good. The menu was unique. It was designed as a newspaper. 
They had a tieup with ozi for hookah and the hookah was good. The staff was friendly . The dj was not at all great playing similar kind off tracks. 
Overall it's a one of a kind place in kolkata, however it could have been better if there is some work done around creating a small dance floor and also a better dj. The space is underutilized.

The Great Booze Story...located exactly were Soho used to be (i know u might have read it 100 times here already :p but guess thats the best landmark ), so its very easy to locate this place. Since we went there on Christmas,and we were in a group of 5 , had to wait for an hour :( but i just hope thats not how it is on normal days.The place has been decorated well with the dim lights wodden tables...they have quiet a big bar available as well,since this is more like a pub,it doesn't really have a proper dance floor,but therez a DJ console.We had some tequila..vodka n beer...the drinks prices r reasonable.As far as food is concerned can't comment much about the main courses since we had only ordered for some Bucket of wings...Chilli Chicken & Hara Bhawa Tawa Kebab (this one was veg) and it all tasted ok.But i didn't like the hookah,as per the suggestion we ordered for Mint Pan and it was literally choking,the rest seemed good.

At the same place where Soho was on Sarat Bose, has opened this new place with new interiors and more tables. A little dimly lit (pleasantly) with tables arranged so close to each other one can hear the conversations on all the tables around. Parking is an issue though one can get into the Ideal complex parking and pretend like you live there.

Spent six happy hours amidst a happening capacity crowd and super music drinking like a fish. Happy Hours prices were so low they were almost unreal (Old Monk 30ml for Rs 45). Golden Fried Prawns, Caesar Salad and Achari Paneer Kebab were all amazing for a place like this though Vexican pizza was totally avoidable. (Thin crust pizza goes the best with alcohol which isnt in the menu) The staff is very friendly and there's a pretty competent bartender called Saurabh.

Rocked the Saturday afternoon with minimum wallet damage.

Loved the grungy feel. Too dark? Not at all. It's exactly right.
The choice of music is great, the beer is awesome and VERY reasonably priced. I've been here just once, so I cannot vouch for the food, perhaps the next time. The staff is courteous and prompt with the service. What I liked the most? "Le Daily Tipple", the quirkily made menu. Super job! But just one suggestion. Why not not come up with quirkier names for the drinks, considering the menu is so neat! :)¬†Shall visit soon again.

Ambience is nice. Decor is average.
Price is pretty pocket friendly if u hop in during the happy hours.
Staff is kind of rude and bit prompt.
The place is dimly lit so sets the mood nicely.
Nice place to spend an evening with friends.

One of the worst places to go because altough they offer domestic drinks at low cost but all are never available. It is just on the menu to attract people to come bit they do not have the same to offer. It is not from now but since inception.

Well much more was expected!!!!!
What attracted me after sitting was the menu card which looks like a newspaper...
To start with the ambience--no it is not that great! It is an average hookah parlour rather! not a proper bar cause not every kinda drink is available as per the menu so nothing GREAT about BOOZing here but one can definitely make or break a STORY since you would get ample of time after placing the order.
I had to poke them for the food 4 times!!!!
But yes the food was good! we really liked the starters & the grilled chicken.

Location-sarat bose road,where soho use to be..
This place has got some excellent interiors with quite a good ambiance and service but the food is quite on the expensive side at this place.Drinks provided are quite cheap.
Would recommend to visit once-

Food-3.5/5
Service-4/5
Ambiance-4/5

Situated where Soho used to be, The Great Booze Story is dim lighted bar cum restaurant which also serves sheesha. When you enter you will be greeted with great music. The food is above average and the drinks are average. The price is reasonable but drinks are not up to the mark. We had a cosmopolitan, Long Island iced tea and beer. We had the masala chips ( which was the fried chips that you can buy from the market- was disappointed with this), the veg kebab platter and the fish and chips; which were tasty. So I would say that it is definitely a must visit bar.

I was quite excited to visit the place owing to its attractive name..after entering liked the ambience and music.. food was also good. Had a veg platter. All items were good. However, didn't like their drink preparation much. Had an liit. Hope they improve the cocktail preparation  before my next visit. .‚ò∫

Good ambience and nice look of the place, but a bit too dark. Music is good. Pretty spaced out. A good place to have beer, although Budweiser wasn't available. Food is moderately cheap and the kebabs tasted good. Especially the cheese tikka kebabs. But they didn't serve Chakhna with the beer.
Service was okayish.
Overall a nice spot for weekend hangouts. Pocket friendly.

Good and cheap a place for non concocted drinks. The nibbles to go along with the drinks like chips and nachos were pretty cheap and good. Liked the dabba wala concept for the CHAKHNA.
BUT the bartenders here do not know the measurements for concoctions. We had ordered a long Island Iced tea. It was utter shit. Had to ask him to take it away even if they charge us for the same. Do not try any cocktail here..
It is a good place though to have beer, hookah and other non concocted drinks. Make your choice. üòÇ

The Great Booze Story turned out to be The Great "Disappointment" Story!! Went there for having a great time but was really disappointed with the quality of service. Staffs seemed to move at snails pace and took long hours before we could get our orders. Poor quality of service as well as food.

The Great Booze Story was truly a ‚ÄúGREAT‚Äù experience. I so wish, I could rate them negatively. They have their own definition of ‚ÄúHappy hours‚Äù. Their menu was a dummy one. Firstly, half of the items mentioned in it were unavailable. Secondly, they have two menus, which we were not enlightened about. All this was bought to our knowledge, when the bill had arrived. For a good lounge, music is USP. And as I have mentioned above, this place is ‚ÄúGREAT‚Äù, so the music was an utter disappointment. Our first food item arrived after an hour. The list can go on. Even writing about this place, is a waste of time, but I care for people.

We were a group of 15 people and each of us had a pathetic experience. Thanks for making our night!

Loved the place for the ambience and music. The place was pretty busy even on a weekday around 7 probably because of the happy hour pricing of alcohol..

The place had an extensive menu to choose from..however surprisingly there was no mocktail menu but maybe the name suggested it..however would recommend having the same as one or two people in a group might not want to drink at all..

the food was average and the service was too too slow. It seemed we had to wait for eternity for our food to arrive..the staff was cordial and apologetic but the wait was too long to make up to it..

A definite place to visit before 7 for people who want to drink as alcohol is cheap..but food quality, service time and sheesha needs to be massively improved. Oh yes the most important thing the hookah is very expensive priced at 500 for a regular one is too much with so much better ones available around that place.

Food that we ordered did not live up to the standard of a place which promised so much with the kind of decor and staff..really need to work on your food guys

The best things about this place are the decor and the unbelievably low prices. But beware...the 'too good to be true' drinks menu suddenly metamorphoses into a pricier version at the stroke of 7pm...a bit reminiscent of Cinderella! Jokes apart...the food portions are quite small...ordered a pizza and a plate of chicken cheese kebabs. Pizza turned hard as stone the moment it cooled down to room temperature. Kebabs were decent but could have been bigger. Drinks were fine but the loud music made ordering food/drinks terribly difficult. Had to literally scream to be heard. But all said and done...I do think I will visit again (before 7pm)!

The first thing that gripped me about this establishment that's popped up in place of one portion of Soho was the interior and the ambiance - the dim lights, the air conditioning duct running overhead, the shelf of booze at the bar ... Just Fantastic & brilliant!! Nothing like something Calcutta could have! Really!

Then, why ruin the entire lounge feel with loud music, guys? Why destroy the amazingly western ambiance with really jugaadu, sub-standard food? Why not use tortilla chips big chains use for nachos and why Cornitos? I had so much hopes pinned on you guys, just going by the look of the place, but it all came crashing down the minute we got the shisha on our tables, followed by the food. Okay, in spite of the fact that you used Cornitos, your Nachos were too substandard and dull for something one should pay for - one could easily nip those up in minutes at home - as were your marinated chickpeas (a disastrous choice on our part) and your shisha (unclean pipes, for example), sloth-speed service being the perfect icing on the cake.

Your establishment, The Great Booze Story, seems like just another plain woman drenched in heavy cosmetics - she sure looks good, but once you remove the makeup, you feel cheated.

Strong suggestion: Get rid of Cornitos as substitute for tortilla chips, lower the volume of your music for the lounge-like ambiance, make food that is different really from a typical shisha pub, or else just bring Soho back!

That said, a highly courteous staff ... And I really love your interiors!

I kept in mind when I visited, the Newly Opened tag, and the dearth of signage material at doors and such certainly attested. But the interiors didn't disappoint. The place feels like a British styled industrial zone pub (probably heftily inspired from the "Social" chain of Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore) with high ceilings, a structure of pipes on the brick-laid walls, menus printed on newsprint. DJ plays quite decent mixes.  

Me and my friend were seated at the bar counter to be transferred to a table later. Never happened though. But in the process we did end up drinking more than we'd come for. Not that we had what we wanted. Every time we opened the newspaper to check the menu, chances were what we wanted wasn't there. Wanted Vodka and Dill Mushrooms, not there. Cheesy Dynamites, not there. Jalapeno poppers, not there. The bar didn't even have Carlsberg or Tuborg and we had to settle for the Good old Times of KingFisher.

There's a real inadequacy of true Continental fare in Calcutta. The onion and scallion cheese crepes (Chilli Cheese Delights) were just about okay. The spaghetti lasagna (Trio Bake) was really good though (hard to go wrong with Lasagna, I guess). Also my opinion is that a pub menu must have steaks and cured meats, but this place also chooses to be more safely focused on the Indian fare.

Even though many things were disappointing, there seems to be a long way to go for The Great Booze Story and I'd definitely like to come back sometime and find out.

It's just adjacent to ozi. The management of both the restaurant is the same. Service here is pathetic slow.
Food is good. Many of the things mentioned aren't available including drinks.
Tried the veg pizza and nachos, they were really good. Nothing short of anything.
Ambience will remind you of Social.
Music is perfect. The DJ is superb.

For such a place and money need better service.
Have a dedicated smoking zone too for smokers.

Alright! Not a regular reviewer. But places which are shitty kind of crank me for writing.

So, food - bad. So bad, that it hurts to recall the name of dishes we ordered. Drinks - returned twice to get the whole feel right. Sangria is kind of the basics a pub should never go wrong , well! they did.

Lets move to the whole ambience and look and  the feel of the place - WORK ON CHAIRS/ CUSHIONS - whatever they are. They are either tooo high to sit or just tooo low on the other side , you could sneak up and may be sleep. Spacious - yes! Music - ok.

And, oh! Did I tell you they have a foosball, though there is not a ball to play. 

Booze mostly makes stories great, unlike here.

One word to describe this place- PATHETIC. For a place where even the manager is unavailable to speak to you and you will be allowed entry at the whims and fancies of the bouncers at the gate says it all. With such a discriminatory approach this place is nothing short of an absolute failure when it comes to customer service. Marketing itself as a pub do not quite understand the logic of not allowing stag entries. Well if the management could be so narrow minded, need one say any more about this place. Indeed a Great Sordid Story!!

The place is cheap and at a convenient location. But thats it.
I hated the seating.My legs are still hurting! 2ft tall tools,you have to literally fold your legs and its very very uncomfortable! 
And according to some shitty policy they do not allow a group of 4 people to sit on the couch,which is supposedly reserved for 6people.
The story did commence well,but wasn't good enough!

Finally a PUB in south Kolkata, I thought. Been there twice and was disappointed. Though the interiors are nice, it still feels more like a club than a PUB.

1. The bartenders are amateurs. we ordered a LIT and a mojito. Both were not well made at all. Surprising, because even the most uninspiring bars in the city are making good mojito's now. Its the most basic of cocktails.
2. We wanted a bolognese pizza but they didn't have it. Ultimately ordered the vexican, which again was average.¬†
3. The menu lacks any innovation. The same traditional cocktails and pasta and pizza. Some authentic bar food would be a great addition. ¬†A extensive cocktail menu is lacking. THERE ARE OTHER drinks than just LIT and MOJITOS. Try spritz, old fashioned, whisky cocktails etc etc.

One can understand that every place goes through teething problems. But every good bar or restaurant must have something worth going back for. World over people are creating such fascinating and innovative gastronomic experiences. What the The Great Booze Story lacks is the STORY itself. Hopefully it will be created soon enough.

CHEERS and best !!!!

Visited on a Sunday noon few weeks back, instantly fell in love with the place. Very neatly made, apt distance between tables give u the feel of privacy and warmth simultaneously.¬†
Innovative menu styling. Booze is moderately cheap during happy hours.¬†
Courteous staff, great food & chilled beers what else do we want.
Their hookah's deserve a special mention. Super smooth and great after taste.

Gonna frequent from now on.¬†
In anticipation that they start some membership's for frequent visitors. ;)

In kol we have very limited options and this place meets most of the requirements..Fast food options are great and cheap as compared to the other places..Load of fries is a must try along with nachos!! For beer lovers prices are really very low even during the evening time as they have two menu cards one for the day and other one for evening..Sheesha is also good..As the place is new two changes are required one is that all cards should be accepted and the other one is that stag entry should be allowed..

The team needs to understand that just opening a 'Happening Place' doesn't run the Restaurant business, it requires sense of credible service. Beer served was flat & warm, on complaining on stern voice was changed with similar item & team didn't even bothered to check with us if its fine.. No recommendation to this place for service...

Horrible is the word. I heard its reasonable. Reasonable maybe only for millionaire marvaris as the place was filled with them. Firstly they said stag entry not allowed. I was shocked. How can a lounge say that. Anyway we went in coz i somehow knew one of the owners and the ambience seemed nice. We ordered golden fried prawns as suggested by the waiter with our cocktails. They said they dont have mutton items. Then we ordered chicken kalmi kabab which is usual leg pieces in tandoor. We ordered another round of cocktails with fish n chips. The coating was too thick for fish. Anyway in the menu we saw goan fish curry which the waiter said non available. I was bummed. Then i ordered for something else. The waiter took the order and i took another beer to have with main course but then the waiter comes and says there is no main course. I mean how can u say that on a friday night??? I think chilli baby corn and paneer tikka were available because they are catering to mostly that crowd. Disgusted i order check and then they say they dont accept cards. Thr bill was over 4k and i had to go out and withdraw money. I mean seriously. I have met one of the owners amit at loft and he is a nice guy but he needs to do something about his quality of food in all his places. Not at all what i expected and maybe not my type. I might give it a try after i hear they have changed the chef.
