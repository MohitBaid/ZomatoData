This place is nothing less than a hidden gem. The owner is an absolute delight to interact with. The warmth, hospitality in his personality is impressive. The food is absolutely brilliant! I ordered the Reshmi kebab roll and the chicken tikka sandwich. It was fresh, healthy and delicious. Highly recommended!

One of my most favorite places it is. Once it used to have dine in as well. Nowadays its just take away which makes it a little bad. The oilfree rolls are a speciality of this place. Sandwiches and rolls are beyond words, and the black coffee completes your snack!

Somakaccino is one of the most underrated sandwich joints in the city. Most people don't know about this hidden gem! Their sandwiches are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For a reasonable price, they make really filling sandwiches that are too huge to be finished by one person. They have a wide variety which includes chinese dishes and rolls as well. The owner is a really interactive and passionate person. Sandwiches to die for ! :)

A nondescript joint, neighbours of the legendary Maharaja/ Maharani of Deshapriya Park. Haven't had the opportunity of visiting this place in the recent past, but was a regular consumer of their rolls and sandwiches. Had their chinese fare once at a friends place. Sumptuous really. People might miss it because of its facade, but not if they have had the food even once. It is a real hidden gem, inspite of being bang on the main road and a real life saver for people who like oil free food. This is the only place you will find oil free Egg chicken roll ( grilled chicken, chopped boiled eggs, onions and capsicum wrapped in roti made of flour with dollops of mayonnaise). Their sandwiches are ones to kill for. The only flip side I find is the absence of a proper seating space. I wish this place was closer to home.

Although I cannot find the time nowadays, but Smokaccino was one of my favorite places in my youth, especially after band rehearsals or recordings at Kalighat. Their chicken mayonnaise sandwich, coupled with the awesome strawberry shake was a true delight. The place is perfect as a takeaway joint, but not so crowd friendly as dine in option, as the seating space is quite cramped. I had also tried one of their wraps once, but nothing comes even close to the Sandwich-Shake combo. Would visit again as soon as I get the chance.

One night almost at 10 pm, i decided i should try the Chicken Smokachelow going by the reviews on zomato. So i ordered online. Got the smokachelow and Chicken club sandwich with extra cheese and extra meat. 

The chicken smokachelow was good. The rice was fresh nicely cooked with a nice herb flavor and had an egg poach on top. On the sides, one side had red colored chicken kebab pieces and the other side had green colored kebab pieces. It also came with boiled capsicum in it.

The chicken club sandwich was just perfect and totally worth the money.

I ordered smokachelow chicken, using swiggy. There were other dishes ordered however i stuck to this one.  

When you order from small joints , most menus are basic or rather mass consumption driven.  i have also learnt the hard way that is good to stick to the basic and not experiment too much.  

Smoka offers a wide variety that combines chinese continental etc. For a small joint the flavours are not entirely unappetising at all. Rather some select dishes are better than some of their larger counterparts. 

Yes i have my reservations about their overdose on the herbs - overpowering to the point of irritation. However the smokachellow herbed rice was quite the balancing act. Subtle in taste.  However the kebabs were a disappointment. The chicken was so much done that it completly dried out and so, what i chewed on was a heavy dose of dried and less flavored meat.  Certainly the chicken needs to be more succulent and then we have a much nicer dish coming together.  

But having said that they certainly bring out some flavorful dishes as well.  Hope the smokachellow finds an improvement.

Ordered via  swiggy, a fried chicken wrap, which was hearty, with lots and lots of mayo and tender pieces of fried chicken, wrapped inside a roti. I quite liked it and it was very reasonably priced. 

The smokachino chicken chelo was disappointing - the rice was dry and bland, the chicken chelos were tasteless, and grilled veggies were burnt. Verdict = strictly avoid !

Located two blocks away from my house, this joint has caught my attention many a times. Finally had the opportunity to eat here, or rather order food from here. Today again Swiggy came to my rescue. Ordered :
• Crispy Chilli Potato - spicy, crispy, amazing! Thumbs up for the quantity. 
• Chicken and Fish Smokachellow - has been on my wish list since the time I've checked their menu on zomato. Well, I was really happy with what I received. The herb rice was spot on, mildly flavoured and the kebabs were soft and juicy. Total value for money!
Pocket pinch - 385 bucks only!  Absolutely ordering from here again. :D

First off, I was told that their delivery service had been discontinued.  Secondly, the Prawn smokacello which we had was bland, verging on tastelessness.  Thirdly, the dry chicken chilly was pedestrian.   The only saving grace may be the generous portions.

On this mundane weekend wanted to eat off the hook. Opened Swiggy to check availability. The Continental fiesta with 15% discount was hard to put down. I have seen this place too many times at deshapriya park.Never found it appealing enough for a sit down meal. So thought to test my stars tonight, if it's good I'll thank them 😉😉. Ordered a Devilled Chicken combo. The food arrived on time. It was a marvellous experience to see two huge crumb fried cheese stuffed chicken in a box. Sauteed veggies which had babycorn, mushrooms, carrot, beans, green pepper. Another container with potato mash with fresh parsley and black pepper. The veggies were excellently tossed and seasoned well. The mash was great creamy and the aroma from the fresh parsley made it outstanding. The crumb fried cheese stuffed chicken was awesome a close kin of ala Kiev.Good amount of cheese oozed at every bite.The chicken fillet was a thick one nicely tender and flavourful. It was Customer Delight experience for me. Never expected a roadside eatery to produce such gourmet delight. Price was just 200 no added taxes.Luckily I got a discount on that too.Completely satiated can't get better.Foodies must try place for pocket friendly continental food.

Came across this tiny place near deshapriya park and decided to give it a try. The place looks really unhygenic and the staff seems very ignorant. They might wanna consider making the place a little more attractive or at least clean. We ordered two plates of BBQ Chicken Wings. The serving took a long time, as if they were under prepared. The food wasn't absolutely terrible, but it wasn't very good either. The meat was hard and felt undercooked. Also for the price, the quantity wasn't very much.
But the most unprofessional thing was that they didn't provide me with a bill and on repeated asking the people behind the counter told me that I'd have to wait 15 mins for a bill because they were having lunch themselves. That is a really unprofessional thing to do.

All in all, terrible experience!

NEW: Okay. So I tried the food here again after 4/5 months. Had soup. Twice. Increased the rating solely based on the soups. The quantity was ample (more than ample) for one person. They are reasonably priced. Taste really good.

P.S. Where is the soup section in their Zomato Menu? -_-

Reminds me of good old college days when we hunted for places lighter on pockets. Smokaccino is one of them.

Situated on Sarat bose Road beside Marco Polo it had seating arrangements before alas its a take away right now.

Serves great rolls ,wraps and sandwiches.We used to ditch the Lake CCD nearby and sat here with coffee and wraps.I wish they re-open the seating area.
Never mind a great option for take away.

P.S:Try from their variety and Smokachello  and wraps are must try.

I have ordered from here several times for home delivery and they have been just wonderful. I don't live in Kolkata and they have been helpful and courteous in delivering the food to my house. Smokaccino was the only restaurant specializing in continental food that would deliver to my house on Christmas and it just made my mother's day so special, for which I am truly grateful to them. Their whole chicken roast was succulent and my mother's absolute favourite. Their fish and chips were also great, and the portion sizes of everything was very generous. I personally have never tasted their food, but the warmth and helpfulness of the owner and my mother's reviews definitely make it my top list priority place to visit next time I go to Kolkata!! Hopefully, my next review will be from personal experience! :)oo

A small takeaway counter of spicy and mouth-watering food in the heart of Deshapriyo park sharing it's place and standing worthy in the competition of food joints along with Royal Lebanese and Zeeshan. One might mistake this place for just another roll/snack joint. But it is really a class apart. Smokachino can undoubtedly provide you with the best Chinese food you have ever tasted. Their Chicken Chowmein is full of greens and perfect quantity of protein and perfect combination of spices makes it the best choice and the quantity? :) 2 people can eat it and feel so full that they would definitely have to skip their dinners if they have it at 7 in the evening. Most importantly it's pocket friendly so college going students can eat to their fullest and not burn a hole in their pockets.

Visited here on 2 occasions. In the first one, I remember having packed Honey Chilli Pepper Chicken for home. Wasn't too spicy with a mild flavour of pepper intact.
On the 2nd visited, had taken Beer Batter Chicken. Basically a Chicken burger with a fancy name. They do give an extra layer of fried onions and tomatoes in soya sauce as a layer beneath the chicken strip. Not a bad try for Rs. 90.

This was the first order I placed after downloading the "zomato order " app.I asked for chicken chelo kebab and chicken stroganoff.The order was on time on a rainy sunday,so that's much apreciated.While the chelo kebab wasn't as avant garde as in peter cat or maharaja,it's decently lavish with "sunny side up" egg on jeera-butter rice adorned with 3 pairs of kebab.
You will never hear me foul mouth an honest rendition of stroganoff,and I am not about to start now.But this definitely felt like a chicken chettinad gravy right from tangerine served with butter rice and some bell pepper and other veggies.

a short note on "zomato order" app- Nice UI,good collection of restaurants(more options than foodpanda),option for both COD and online payment.word of caution-some eateries might not deliver on time,or deliver at all,and yet the app keeps them listed.Also,the customer care representatives might seem pressed for time to hear out your concerns.

[Date visited: April 27, 2015]

Location: Adjacent Just Baked; Near Maharani.

This place had been on my wish list for a long time and was finally visited on April 27, 2015 around 19:30 hours while returning back home.

Smokeccino is a small takeaway counter (needs a bit of renovation, the taped counter top might make a customer skeptical about the quality) serving the people of Kolkata with decent food out from a decently hygienic kitchen. The taped menu (a new one would look better) had quite a lot of options, out of which the first item that caught my eyes were the ‘oil-free’ rolls and wraps. 
Without much ado, placed an ORDER for a Roll:

- Paneer Roll [INR 50]
The all purpose flour (Maida) roti was griddle-cooked (not upto the mark; was still floury raw; a few more seconds of griddle-baking was needed. Did give me a tummy ache later in the night) without oil and had a filling of mint chutney, averagely marinated succulent cubes of paneer, thinly sliced onion and capsicum and chatpata masala. Rolled & served hot.
The roll tasted pretty decent as the paneer lacked the required level of seasoning. The mint chutney inside did add as a plus.
For the price paid, one expects a better tasting roll and at least a perfectly griddle-baked roti!

The STAFF was polite and SERVED at a prompt speed.
The PRICES were slightly inclined towards the moderate end, but, the quality served somewhat failed to justify the charges prices.

• Also have home-delivery option upto 2 kms above a minimum billing of INR 200.

Overall was a bad experience. 
- The looks of the place gave a negative feel and seemed as if it was just running for the sake of it, but, the quality is a tad better (can be much better) than the looks. The management needs to take necessary steps before its too late. :)

A small joint near Desapriya Park, one might mistake this place for just another roll/snack joint. But it is really a class apart. The food is great and very easy on the pocket. There is a wide range to choose from, and the items worth trying out are the chicken garlic witch, the chilly chicken wrap and the chicken coleslaw salad. The service is fast and efficient, and despite the open kitchen, this joint is quite hygienic.

This was the first place where I ordered through the Zomato app. The delivery was on time . We ordered Grilled Fish and Chicken with mashed potatoes and a Mixed Chelow Kabab. The chellow kabab was tasty.  The grilled fish in cream sauce  and  the devilled chicken was really delicious . Very satisfied and cant wait to order again .

Visited here on 2 occasions. In the first one, I remember having packed Honey Chilli Pepper Chicken for home. Wasn't too spicy with a mild flavour of pepper intact.
On the 2nd visited, had taken Beer Batter Chicken. Basically a Chicken burger with a fancy name. They do give an extra layer of fried onions and tomatoes in soya sauce as a layer beneath the chicken strip. Not a bad try for Rs. 90.

This was the first order I placed after downloading the "zomato order " app.I asked for chicken chelo kebab and chicken stroganoff.The order was on time on a rainy sunday,so that's much apreciated.While the chelo kebab wasn't as avant garde as in peter cat or maharaja,it's decently lavish with "sunny side up" egg on jeera-butter rice adorned with 3 pairs of kebab.
You will never hear me foul mouth an honest rendition of stroganoff,and I am not about to start now.But this definitely felt like a chicken chettinad gravy right from tangerine served with butter rice and some bell pepper and other veggies.

a short note on "zomato order" app- Nice UI,good collection of restaurants(more options than foodpanda),option for both COD and online payment.word of caution-some eateries might not deliver on time,or deliver at all,and yet the app keeps them listed.Also,the customer care representatives might seem pressed for time to hear out your concerns.

[Date visited: April 27, 2015]

Location: Adjacent Just Baked; Near Maharani.

This place had been on my wish list for a long time and was finally visited on April 27, 2015 around 19:30 hours while returning back home.

Smokeccino is a small takeaway counter (needs a bit of renovation, the taped counter top might make a customer skeptical about the quality) serving the people of Kolkata with decent food out from a decently hygienic kitchen. The taped menu (a new one would look better) had quite a lot of options, out of which the first item that caught my eyes were the ‘oil-free’ rolls and wraps. 
Without much ado, placed an ORDER for a Roll:

- Paneer Roll [INR 50]
The all purpose flour (Maida) roti was griddle-cooked (not upto the mark; was still floury raw; a few more seconds of griddle-baking was needed. Did give me a tummy ache later in the night) without oil and had a filling of mint chutney, averagely marinated succulent cubes of paneer, thinly sliced onion and capsicum and chatpata masala. Rolled & served hot.
The roll tasted pretty decent as the paneer lacked the required level of seasoning. The mint chutney inside did add as a plus.
For the price paid, one expects a better tasting roll and at least a perfectly griddle-baked roti!

The STAFF was polite and SERVED at a prompt speed.
The PRICES were slightly inclined towards the moderate end, but, the quality served somewhat failed to justify the charges prices.

• Also have home-delivery option upto 2 kms above a minimum billing of INR 200.

Overall was a bad experience. 
- The looks of the place gave a negative feel and seemed as if it was just running for the sake of it, but, the quality is a tad better (can be much better) than the looks. The management needs to take necessary steps before its too late. :)

It's a fervent place for wraps and it's especially endearing to people who like a lot of Mayo in their food. 

The place is like a normal roll joint nothing fancy.... It's quite easy on the pocket but it's something you can get at many places... Nothing or of the ordinary... A good place to stand and eat..

Their kitchen really smells. I have had a chicken mushroom sandwich from here once and I must say I did like it. All they need to do is maintain a cleaner kitchen since theirs is an open one.

This little takeaway counter in deshopriyo park area is a bright justification of the saying that “looks can be deceptive” ! While you do not get any of those “take a snap” walls or appealing interiors that are in vogue these days what you get here are some amazing wraps and lip smaking “smokachello” which are their version of the immortal chello kebab . The wraps are quite generous and is sufficient as an entire meal and needless to say very much pocket-friendly . Overall I would say this is yet one of those places that still believe in nothing but good food and if you believe that too go grab your wrap at smokacinno !

A small joint among many biggies lining the Lake Stadium to Deshapriya stretch, Smokaccino, would stand out as a regular's paradise. The quantity and quality of food at the price has made this a favourite among college students and a quick take away for a party anywhere in the vicinity. 



The quality an taste of food here can be blindly trusted, as the host/owner of the place himself cooks most of the dishes and directly supervise the chefs. Also, the open kitchen is quite a reassurance.



The rolls, smokachelo and sandwiches are a must try. Grab on the go and you would be happily full.

Had the Fish Smokachelow a couple of days back. The food was good. The rice was buttery and very well made. There were two types of kebabs in the item - tandoori and reshmi(somewhat). The tandoori was well made and the fish was of good quality. The reshimi(I'm not sure whether reshmi or not) was not so great. The flavors had not really infused in the fish and it tasted a little blank. Plus there was a very well made poached egg. I didn't have it, so I cannot comment on it.

One complaint I have is that the delivery took a lot of time. Considering the fact that I live just 10 minutes from the place, the food took about 2 hours to reach. Also I had to call up around 4 times to confirm whether they were delivering my order. :O :O :O

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 2/5

Mediocre quality, in my opinion, but I still order from them because they are so cheap and fast. To their credit, the food is always made fresh and orders are rarely screwed up. Most dishes are average, some are better than others. Fish fry & fish finger should be avoided, I tried twice both time found them under prepared. Chicken wraps, sandwiches & kebabs are worth trying.  This place always a good option for take away meal.

A small joint with a small sitting area on the 1st floor with a variety of cuisines thats the gist of this place. The waiters take some time to fetch your order. The food is good in terms of taste and quality. There is nothing authentic about the dishes but it leaves a good impact on your taste buds. Have tried veg chowmein, chilli potato, chilli babycorn and fish fingers. All are good with an indian touch. Even the mayo sandwiches are pretty good. Prices are reasonable. Overall an average place.

First lemme tell u why this is not 5/5- Coz the classy owner did not invest much for making it good looking and also what u see is the kitchen and despite of two large vent system the roof looks untidy.
Rest is joyful.
Mr Owner is himself a fancy taste-bud! I think he loves to satiate people with good foods. Hence often he himself manuscript the dishes. They have the best of sandwiches and  delicious burghers. Wraps are too good for healthy-eaters. Best thing is the blend of spreads. The place is a real rendezvous of foodies.
And one thing I must add, it almost has been a decorum to comment/ praise the chef after having the food.

Kolkata has a dearth of drive-in eateries. Smokaccino is a welcome entrant in that sector,successfully bridging the gap between road-side roll joints and multi-cuisine eateries.
Its an open kitchen,so you can really build up your appetite watching the veggies and chicken gearing up to create wonderful creations and the smell of grilled bread..delightful!
Being managed by only two guys,the service is a bit slow but chat with friends and the aroma of food will keep you in good company.
It serves a wide array of dishes,though going by the orders; the fish fry,wraps and sandwiches seem to be the top picks. The sandwiches are stuffed generously and crisply grilled,I only wish they had an option of brown bread.The Mochaccilo shake was thick,chocolatey:way better than a CCD's.
The pricing is moderate,so this place remains an excellent option for a casual eat-out or a take away meal.

A tiny ,take-away joint tucked beside the Just Baked out let of Deshapriyo Park, but promises good food. They'll chop, blend, cook and wrap all in front of you and titillate your taste buds in the process. Frequent waves of  bulk orders make it difficult for only two men to handle it all, delaying the service slightly. 
 
 Coming straight to the food, I simply adore their Double Chicken Mayo Roll, Hariyali Chicken wrap and Garlic Chicken wrap. Tried Crispy Chilli Potato the other day and must say they were crispy and hot indeed. My vegan friends love Cheesy Babycorn wrap and Spicy Mushroom Wrap. The best thing about their wraps is the generous stuffing and ultra thin pita bread, just the way it should be.  Decent Crispy Chilli Baby corn, Chilli Chicken and Hot and Sour Chicken Soup they serve.

Their daring venture, Smokachelos are impressive to say the least. Love the sashlik kebabs and perfectly poached egg topping a bed of smooth buttered rice. 

However, there are too many changes in the price and menu post pujo making a few all-time favorites unavailable at times. That's the only disappointing bit.

This is a very small place that you would pretty easily overlook while travelling from Deshapriya park crossing towards southern Avenue. But the food is that it serves is definitely something that you would not want to miss. Being a pretty small shop, nearly being a road side stall, this place cooks up some wonderful wraps and rolls ( made with roti instead of the regular paratha, which makes it much healthier ). Apart from that it serves quite good Chinese  starters and the best part the cooking is done right in front of your eyes, which makes your eating experience more pleasant.  
We went there for some starters only.We ordered for the spicy mushroom & cheesy baby corn wrap and both of them were excellent.  In non veg the Tikka & chilly chicken wraps were also awesome and so was the dry chilly chicken. And considering the cost the quantity was great. It was a wonderful experience. Would love to go there again. Highly recommended !!!

Pros - 
Good quality food, Moderate price, Freshly cooked.

Cons -
Take away - no sitting area, Little slow on service.

Almost all the dishes that are unique to this place are must tries. The chicken mayo roll is very good..but the wraps (which includes chilli fish wrap and manchurian chicken wrap) are insanely good. The diet chicken is a must try and their Shechuan Noodles are quite good inspite of being eye-watering hot!!

a few years old this place was one of the pioneers of roti roll. owned by a person who claims to have a degree in hotel management and knows your palate better than you the joint does serve decent food. I never find the roti roll to my liking. diet consciousness can go down the drain when your having a kathi roll but still its worth a try. the burger they serve is pretty decent and at 60 bucks each it is both pocket and tummy friendly. but my recommendations would be the coleslaw sandwich and the wide array of wraps they have. though a weird combination but the chilli chicken wrap gets my two thumbs up!!!

Famous for their 'Oil-Less rolls'. I am at times diet conscience & I really feel these are healthy and are least harmful. They serve really slow; otherwise its a descent food corner! Foodies must give it a try :D
