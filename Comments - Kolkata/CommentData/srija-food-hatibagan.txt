I ordered 2 chicken rolls and a plate of chicken momo from swiggy
Roll was good in taste which helps this restaurant to give a star 
Talking about momo it was worst soup was equally bad in taste

Would not even give a single star to this restaurant..
Ordered Boti kebabs and lacha Parantha from swiggy..
As no other restaurant delivery executive were free..
To decided to order from here..
And that was the worst food I encountered..
Lacha Parantha was rubbery and chewy..
Kebabs are the reason it got a star..
