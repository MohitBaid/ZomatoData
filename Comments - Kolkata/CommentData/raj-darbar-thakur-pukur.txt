Once upon a time, in a no-proper-eatery zone called Joka, where trams ran through rice fields, some enterprising entrepreneur decided to have mercy on the Gastronomic Society of Joka and took the risk of opening a food joint serving mughlai dishes, called Raj Darbar. 
Yes friends! This outlet is the first food service of note to enter into the Joka - Thakurpukur area, where even a good jhaal muri shop could not be found for miles. The setting I am speaking of is around seventeen years back, at least. And lo and behold! The risk paid off! Till today the place is full of hungry Horaces, eagerly awaiting to take away scrumptious rolls and delicious
 biryanis and tender kebabs. 
Open air chairs and tables are always occupied more than their recently opened a. C restaurant. Over time, some more eateries have come up in the Area but Raju Darbar still does have a solid Raj here. 
However, their quality seems to have become slack due to the passage of time or perhaps due to the ease with which they have acquired a regular following. And the cooking medium used is dalda. One cannot eat the biryani if it gets a little cold as then it is totally congealed.

This place is situated near to my house. So had tried their many items over years. Their Biryani and Egg Roll is just mind blowing. The ambience is pretty normal but the waiting time is too much. There is a lack of proper management. Often the AC restaurant remains empty. Most of their curry items are bland and contains too much oil. Their Mutton Biryani is just awesome. But recently tried their egg roll but honestly I will say that the taste had deteriorated to a great extent. I was thinking to give them 2 stars but for their biryani I will settle down on 3 stars.

Biryani is good but I always find their chicken and mutton to be undercooked in rolls and main courses. For that reason I have stopped going to Raj Darbar even though it's pretty close to where I live. They charge you more for minimum quantity.

Raj darbar is located near my home...over the years i have tasted most of their items...sadly though Â most of them are bland...specially the curry items...waiting time is especially long even when the restaurant is near empty...earlier their biryanis used to be good but nowadays its taste has deteriorated considerably...the only saving grace for them is their rolls which are real good...

No ambience what so ever.. If i rate for the restaurant den i must give 2,as they offer not up to the mark quality of biryani. Except that the roti they offer is good and even the side dishes are good too. They are mainly known for their roll joint offers good quality of rolls.

Its in my locality so tried almost all types of their Rolls. Rolls are very good, though Paneer and Mutton is not that great. Chicken and Egg is really good. Their Biriyani has got a slight spicy taste which is good and distinguishes them from others. Their take away is fast but service for seated customers are pretty slow.

The food quantity has dropped ..;). But the food has got better. The biriyani is pretty good. I would recommend try the egg chicken mutton combo roll. Its really really yummy. Don't keep any high hopes for the ambience fellas...!!! Its nothing to take someone on a date..

Today I had kebab and biriyani here. It's a small fast food center. I will say as per the cost of the food the quality of the food is ok. I will suggest to go here if you want a good food at cheap rate.

Cool place.
Food quality is good especially their tandoori chicken.
Biriyani is is not among the best in kolkata but its good too.
Only problem is their eating place is a bit small.
Take away service is quick.

Though it is located near my place but i managed to get some parcelled food from there for once only. And all i cam say is that food which was parcelled was not that much good in quality and it was very oily even.

Good quality rolls. Average price. Nothing great or worthwhile to share. Just another roll corner cum restaurant in the city ( behala thakurpukur to be specific) . Well it does well because of lack of restaurants in the area and a nearby college. Thats all.

Of all things, I have realized this for sure. It's really difficult to find food that tastes awesome. We ordered quite a few things here. Matar paneer, Aloo Matar, Chicken Haryali Kebab, Green Salad and Tandoori Roti and Chicken Biryani Special. While the dishes were just fine, kebabs were a little salty and biryani didn't taste any good. 
We had also asked for egg biryani which was never delivered.  It's a no go...  Wouldn't recommend it!

Quantity hunters should frequent here as they give two mutton pieces with their Mutton biriyani.Otherwise nothing worth mentioning.May be  a centre for gulping rolls at evening though.
