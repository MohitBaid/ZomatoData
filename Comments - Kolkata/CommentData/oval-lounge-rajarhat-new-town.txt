The steak factory menu is overwhelmingly good! Serves drink of your choice. Cordial staffs. Has a smoking zone and perfect ambience to enjoy lunch and dinner in perfect serenity. Will definately visit again for gulping down some octopus dishes which weren't available when i visited lately!!

We have visited on 25th December for lunch. We ordered mostly continental food. The food was fine. Chrispy fried chicken was too good. Few other chicken dishes were not that much good as it seems that it was undercooked and the chicken was little hard. Otherwise the prices are cheap and on low budget you will get nice steaks food. Overall it is nice restaurant and bar.

One Thursday for lunch I went there. It is at dlf IT park near Newtown. Restaurant looks good. It's outer structure is oval. Maybe for it's  building structure it's name OVAL. Ambience was moderated. Food was also good. We ordered vetki gandhoraj and chicken tengri kabab as starter. In main course we took masala kulcha and kadai chicken.

Well the place sure makes an impression with the decor,space and location. Very comfortable seating arrangements with a very peaceful enviroment for dining. I had visited the place around summer so quite a late review. Met up with a school buddy for lunch who happens to work for TCS. Im a serious eater at a dining table and make it a point to order just enough to finish everything and leave nothing to waste. We started with a Pinacolada and Good Lord off went my expectations from the place southwards. It tasted like some one just rattled up a drink in haste with absolute no idea how a Pinacolada tasted or should be prepared. Bad start, so we just gulped it down for the sake of it and ordered beer instead. 
After a brief chit chat, we went through the menu and agreed to try the big spread from the  Menu and ordered accordingy. The order was for Chicken Sweet n Sour Soup, Shredded Lamb for Starters, Mixed Freid Rice and Sliced Lamb in black bean sauce! 
The Soup tasted average, Shredded Lamb was really good and kind of made me a little excited for the remaining orders. But soon when the rest of the food was tasted my excitement just slided down to Neutral again. Both the Fried Rice & Sliced Lamb in black bean sauce dish tasted as if it was brought from the road side vendor. The Lamb although moist tasted stale and seemed to be cooked after days. 
Well honestly, i thought initially the place mst be really upmarket and hence the crowd must be really those kind of ppl who are willing to spend a few extra bucks for the Oval Experience. But as it turned out not only was the place overpriced for the quality of food it served but the whole 1 hour or so we spent at the Oval, it was an out and out desolated place during lunch service. 
The Oval like i said is a lovely place for a casual conversation given the absolutely comfortable seating arrangements and ambience it carries. But, it needs a complete reconsideration of its menu and dishes. I also hope they bring a decent barmen at the counter.

As the sun disappeared from the sky, the dim lights at the Oval came into effect and the effect was mesmerizing. We were looking for a quite peaceful evening, where we could talk and the oval provided us with just that. The setting was perfect and so was the food. We had ordered lamb and it was cooked to perfection in both our side and main dish. Although missing a few bottles that we requested, the place had a decently stocked bar. For a Wednesday, the place had a decent number of clientele. The only flaw of the place was that they housed no Smoking Zone and that can be irksome to some of the customers. But all in all the rest of the experience makes up and goes beyond that flaw. Oval is a place which i would certainly recommend to my followers and friends, and I shall be returning to it soon.

A pretty average restaurant and bar with less than average tasting food. But it wins some points because it's cheap and it provides a restaurant ambiance with less pricing. 
 It's located in the DLF office in Rajarhat which is a prime location. 
Surprisingly even on a weekday the place was almost filled. 
The entire place is lit with a dim blue lighting which gives this place a somewhat shady look. The service is quick. The managers are courteous. 
For people looking for just decent food/alcohol in Rajarhat and have a budget constraint, this place is perfect.

Drums of Heaven -same as above
Murg dhania kebab -excellent
Tandoori chicken-good better than average
Kabuli naan-excellent
Chicken hakka noodles -very good
Kadai murg-could have been better

Overall very good

We had been wanting to visit since long, but somehow always chose KFC over this whenever we were nearby! Finally we visited few backs back. Overall, a nice experience and decent place. Even though it was a Thursday, place seemed packed. It's a lounge so expect dark interiors and comfortable couch seating.

We tried cream of chicken soup and chelo kebab. Soup was super good, above expectations. Chelo, of course, was nowhere close to the Peter Cat original, but still just okay. I personally didn't like the chicken tikka much but my husband did!

Not keen to visit again, but neither would I mind to :)

Visited on 7 September 2017.

Located in the DLF building, this restaurant cum lounge offers a good view and fine environment. Music is average. We basically ordered Indian cuisine. Both starters and main course was very ordinary, may be less in taste than other places. Service was not very adequate as nobody paid attention due to which we had difficulty in calling them each time. Not a go for family dining. Chilling with friends for drinks is better.

Last Sunday afternoon me & my friend decided to visit this place as this place was on our list from a long time. We entered at around 1pm but to our surprise, there was not a single guest inside. We thought we will get good service as we were the only people to served. We asked the waiter to recommend good Indian started and he recommended..murg dhania kebab, chicken was no at all tender and there was no fragrance of dhania as well & service was very slow. So we have decided to leave the place, when we asked for bill they gave me a bill of 3 beers when we had only 2..I told them that we had 2 beers but somehow they they brought 3 empty bottles of beer & told me that these are the bottles we have comsumed. But I forced them to check the CCTV footage as I was sure we had only 2..after checking the footage they agreed & changed the bill...overall horrible experience...I would suggest people to look for other options if they are looking for good food & service...

I came here for a team lunch and it wasn't a good experience. We arrived at 1:30 p.m. and due to delayed service, the main course wasn't served till 3.
Mushroom salt and pepper was salty and pepper-y enough to generate a irritation in your throat. The chicken dishes ordered were average in taste and not at all worth the wait and the price. The vegetarian main course too was not well prepared. The waiter was missing out on serving some or the other dish to a few people. Add-ons like salad and pickle etc. wasn't served until we confirmed if it was there or not. The only good thing in the whole meal was Fresh lime soda. I won't recommend anyone to go here if they really appreciate good food and service.

Situated in the oval extensions of the DLF IT Park, the place is a discreet surprise. Starting from the moment you enter the place you get to feel its unique vibe. The place has cool interiors, paired with the best possible use of space. The food menu is nothing great but it does the job, although it feels a little expensive at times for the amount it offers. The food quality is really nice, and the buffet menu too is a decent offering. Staff is a little new by experience but gets the job done mostly. The prices can be a little less, but hey isnt that what we expect at many good places.

We ordered crispy chilli baby corn, chicken tandoori in starter; chicken steak with mashed potatoes in main course and a hell lot of deserts including custard, tutti-frutti and ice-cream with brownies... Quality of food is quite good except for the baby corns as they had stiff coating and unnecessary sweet taste. Need to mention the chicken steak, which was really delicious.
Service was good and prompt. 
Good place to hangout.

Talking about food quality it was just not up to the mark. We ordered Chinese main course and it wasn't tasty.The prices too are on the higher side. The staff was soft spoken but seemed completely untrained. If you want to eat i would not recommend this place. :) The 2.5 is only for the decor

I have visited this place a number of times and thought that I will take some time out and write a few words about it .. so here goes .. Oval is the only proper restaurant present inside DLF IT Park 1 at Newtown, Rajarhat . It is a multi-cuisine restaurant and serves Indian, Chinese and Continental . It also serves buffet on Fridays . I have tried all the 3 varieties and I must say that I have enjoyed their Chinese and Indian every time. I tried their Continental a couple of times and concluded that Oval is not the place to have continental food . I have also tried their buffet a few times and have quite liked it. The ambience of the place is nice ; the cost is probably a bit on the higher side. If you happen to be around DLF IT Park , give this place a shot (provided the security guards let you in) !

A Saturday night, after office, we went to Oval to satiate our hunger due to close proximity, good food, cordial behavior. The experience was totally different this time. We reached there around 10.20PM and we were asked to hurry for the orders as the last cut off time was 10.30PM. We were uneasy but managed to complete. We were happy as there were less customers and the food would get delivered fast. No one said that the restaurant is going to close @11PM. The starters came in @ 10.40 and the main course was served @ 10.55. When we just started eating they came and asked to pay the bill. We requested that let us complete and we would pay as we are not going to run away. The manager came in and started arguing that the restaurant closes @11 and we need to pay immediately. We tried giving him logical grounds that we have to stop midway, wash hands to get the payment done and then resume eating the rest, or we pay him and leave without even completing the food. This is never done in any eatery or even in this industry that customers need to pay in between. They started misbehaving and said it is not their concern and no matter what we need to pay immediately, we paid, wanted to leave but logically we shouldn’t as we have paid in full and if we leave it is not going to hurt them in anyway but we would remain hungry even after paying in full. The other group present there raised the same concern. We tried to argue with them that they shouldn’t have let us in @ 10.20 if the restaurant is going to close @ 11 and in no way we couldn’t have finished our dinner served @10.55 by 11 PM, a 3 course meal would certainly take time. Then they started putting off the lights and left us in dark. We had no other choice but to leave without finishing off. In addition to that the food was half cooked in a hurry which caused stomach upset the next day.
            The food is average and eventually if you land up there you can try out Prawn Tempura, Awadhi Tandoori Murg, Beckti Gandharaj, Zafrani Murg Tikka, Mutton Rogan Josh and at last Tutti Fruity

Oval, yes the shape of the restaurant justifies the name in accurate.
Location: DLF-1
Ambiance: Sleek and cozy is what I would describe it. Dimly lit and soothing. Have got some cozy couches along the periphery. 
You get a good view of the road, if seated towards the window panel.
Staff: Cordial and helpful.
I had amazing experience here. A treat to visit this place, always. 
Their range of dishes and options boggles me up, and then I am confused what to have. Every dish is well made, ample amount and served on time. 
Its a great place to chill out. I'll definitely keep on revisiting.
Pocket pinch was a bit on the pricier side, but the taste and feel overwhelmed it !!

Let's talk about Chinese first. The Chowmein was nice, good in taste, nice texture and looked healthy as well. Devil's Chicken was the Bombshell. tasty and Juicy Chicken balls in a tangy red sauce nicely flavoured with Garlic. I would surely try that dish someday with my family.

Among the Indian Dishes I liked the Lahsuni Dal Tarka the most and disliked the Mutton Do-Pyaza. The Dal Tarka was rich with Desi Ghee. It was normal Black Dal (Kali Dal) with lots of Lahsun or Garlic. It was tasty with the Butter Naan.

Even the mutton biryani was good. Staffs are courteous. I have to say its a perfect place for an evening date with ur bae. Good food, drinks, music, great interiors. Though prices are a bit on the higher side but still the ambience & food makes it worth.

I am back in the scene.
So started my journey again with my last restaurant at rajarhat.
Ohk starting on with the flaws. Guys you got some seriously lazy staff which do not go with the awesome ambience.
You guys scored high because of your food and the ambience and the deco.

P.s. guys work on your cocktails a bit. Bring in some flavors in the..

Went with my family to this lounge. Luckily google maps helped us to reach this place properly. Food was ok, nothing great. 50% of the place was booked and the staff offered us a corner table but didn't switch on the A.C saying that there are less people so they can't switch on more A.C. this was a pathetic reply but then we asked to change our table and fortunately we got a better seat. The staffs were least interested in their work. Ambience was good. One can try this place at once atleast.

I had a really a bad experience from the management and I will not suggest you this place if you like to have food after 10 PM. Even when people where having inside they switched off ac's and tv and were feeling so suffocated. And management over here say some stupid reasons for switching off. I suggest higher management to look on to this and maintain good relation with customers.

A decent place to spend an evening with friends or colleagues. Average food and ambience with cozy seats and a decent collection of liquor sum up this place. Though its been quite some time since I had last visited this place, yet the oval shape of the establishment and friendly attendants are the first things that come across my mind when I hear the name of this place.

The restaurant probably derives its name from the building structure. Well, the building is oval as well!

The cuisine is super awesome, they serve like everything! The food is of excellent quality and the quantity suffices three people.

Not so easy on the pockets but a good place.

Located on the 1st floor of DLF1 Bldg. at Rajarhat New Town, i have visited number of times at this place mainly for lunch for their weekend buffet - starters and desserts are good, but nothing great about the main course...The lounge gets decked up nicely by the illuminations during the evening.

A spacious Lounge with nice illumination and decent music. It gives a nice view of outside road if you sit by the glass window panes. The waiters are courteous. 
In side dishes, recommended :
#Shredded lamb in pepper & salt
#Fish finger
#BBQ chicken
#Stuffed chicken
#Crispy conjee chicken
They also serve a stick of pineapple,cherry and cheese cube, on bed of ice-cubes which goes superb alongside beer. Though, you won't get this on menu card.
They screen live games, so perfect place to go out with your gang and support your favourite team over a bottle of beer.

I've been to Oval Lounge on two occasions - the first time was for the lunch buffet and the second time for dinner and drinks. The buffet is good , especially the salads and the starters.  The mocktails are also quite nice and complimentary with the buffet. Main course and desserts were average but overall a good experience. 
For dinner, we ordered a number of dishes in north indian and chinese. Konjee crispy lamb was one of the most delicious starters. Mixed fried rice and fish manchurian were also quite good. We ordered screwdriver for cocktail and that tasted nice too. Ambience and service is very friendly. Cost per head is around 800 with alcohol. Recommended for corporate meals.

very nice sports bar ambience. seating is comfortable, well laid out and not clumsy. food is decent. service good. nice crowd. a little expensive on food. but that must be for the ambience, which surely is lovely with the dim lighting inside and also the blue lit round look from outside. a major problem though was that the guests had to go out of the whole building gate, for just a smoke. one couldn't smoke anywhere within the gate. I hope they are soon coming up with a smoking zone. I was here quite a few months back and in overall, I loved it.

Oval lounge is situated at DLF 1, Newtown. I am a frequent visitor as its the nearest of all after office.
A decent place to access easily from the IT Firms of Kolkata.

The Oval shaped bar cum restaurant has a nice ambience with blue LED lights, a little darkness (which I like though) and some posters of Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix etc. by which, we can say its a wannabe Rock Cafe. 

I Never listened anything except Eagles(Hotel California is repeatedly played) and Shakira and sometimes even PSY's Gangnam Style which is slightly against the theme I believe 😊.

Sometimes, I face a stock-out of middle-class whiskeys or beers and at the same time it also has the collections of Jura, Blue Label, Dalmore etc. 

Food quality is average and a bit costly. Preordered Buffet lunch is with better quality. Conji-Crispy Chicken is preferable.

Service section needs to be improved a bit. Smoking area was nice before (a small room with glass) but its permanently closed and now, its utterly poor.

Overall, this place can be tried once or twice if the distance is more. Sometimes, I do have some fun time over there with friends and a glass of beer. 
Cheers !! 🍻

We visited the place on a Friday. It was pretty crowded because of buffet, but wouldn't suggest buffet. Go for the al-a-carte. The food is good. Well cooked. We had the veg ginger and capsicum fried rice. It had a little too much ginger. Otherwise the devil chicken was really good. Can visit with friends for a drink. A little costly but alright to visit once in a while. The pan fried noodles was awesome.

We came here for lunch on a rainy afternoon all the way from Gitanjali Park. But the toil sufficed. We loved the food and the ambiance.
Location - DLF IT Park Rajarhat.
Pocket Pinch - Rs. 700 for 2 inclusive of 10% corporate discount. Buffet costs Rs. 490 +taxes.
Cuisine - Continental, Chinese, Indian.
My food story - We ordered Drums of Heaven for starter, It was sweet, salty and spicy, totally balanced blast of taste. For main course we ordered roasted pepper  fried rice, ginger fried rice, chilly chicken oval styled, devil chicken and pan fried noodles. Pan fried noodle was awesome. There was nothing special in oval styled chilly chicken. The chicken was very tender, juicy. The devil chicken was very good unlike some places where they make it unbearably hot. Loved the total experience. I would have given a 4, if the air conditioning system worked properly.

We ordered Chicken Kebabs, Chello Kebab and Fish n' Chips. Chicken Kebab was juicy but could have been better. I did not like the Fish n' Chips that was served. The fish seemed stale.
Surprisingly the Chello Kebab was perfectly cooked.
Drinks are nominal in price. Not having Old Monk in their stock was very disappointing.
Ambience and service was of high quality.

The location and the structure are quite prominent as it goes by the name. The interiors gives a feeling of a budget place, which being just an antony. As understood from my 1st visit, you must take out adequate time to have a lunch or dinner there as the waiting time is high. They takes 25-30 mins to serve cold drinks and sweet lime soda. The food was tasty but could have been better as compared to its positioning. 

19/8/2016- Unfortunately had a team lunch which was a second visit to this place. Was totally dissatisfied by everything. The AC was not working, which I assume has a financial relation with the devoluper ( as AC being centralised). The plates seemed gloomy and dirty, with an added feature of a hair line crack. Was into some real formal discussion thus could not point out in public. The waiters was friendly, however had lack of knowledge about food, billing and all. As usual, and as conveyed in my afore review, the service was extremely slow, they took almost an hour or more to serve simple dishes like mixed rice, mixed chowmin, schezwan chicken, Hong-Kong chicken, with a pre additional time of around 45 to almost 55 mins to serve starters. The food was not that good to be complimented. In a nutshell, it failed in all aspects.

I was told Oval used to be one of the most happening bars in Rajarhat few years back. I paid a visit last year with friends and family. Oval is located on the 1st floor of the DLF 1 towers. Easily tracable from the major arterial road that connects from technopolis to Unitech square. Nice ambience, with all the led's and a blue tinge with the lighting. Music is a bit loud but yes you get used to it over time. Landing on the food,  they are good. Mushroom salt and pepper, Bar B Q chicken, Tangri kebabs and they serve chelo kebabs too. They served good food. And all of us liked it. Its a safe haven,  you can go with family, friends or your mates.

After a brief adda session in Eco park, our group decided to grab something to bite over drinks. So we decided to visit Oval Lounge in the DLF building. We ordered a chilli fish on the recommendation of a regular visitor, the Crispy konjee chicken and The BBQ chicken.
The chilli fish and the bbq chicken was lipsmackingly good, and the konjee would rank a bit lower compared to the rest.
The ambiance was very comfy, the staffs very warm and prompt, service was superb. In short, I loved the place and will definitely visit again

Heard a lot of good things about this lounge from the friends. Went with colleagues for a team dinner. The buffet experience was exactly opposite of the à la carte experience that my friends had. The staffs were lousy. The place was very dimly lit. The menu was very basic. There were only two starters, crispy chilli baby corn and dry chilli chicken. Those were served in very less portions. The stuffs were finished before half of the people had it on the plate. Three types of salads were on the menu, however there were cucumber, tomatoes and onions rings for three kinds of salads. For the main course there were butter roti, one rice item, yellow dal, one paneer item and one chicken item. The sides were served and the roti and rice did not come even after half an hour of serving the main course. The only dessert was vanilla ice cream with chocolate source. The staffs scooped out ice cream and poured sauce in a way that they were not willing to serve. The only good thing we experienced was the bar. The attendant was prompt.

I think it's an over-hyped place, given the mediocre quality of food yet hefty price. The ambience is undoubtedly splendid, with blue, dizzy radiance accompanying your tipsy hour, but staffs need to be more on their toes! The lounge runs out if the most common starters as coriander soup and chicken drumstick during the early evening hours of a Saturday. The most sad part of the story is rats! Yeah, there are rats   running from here n there .. I won't recommend the place as you can get a hundreds of other better places in Saltlake or CC-2 to hang out.

So this place is at my office only😉. When we have birthday treat or any other high level treat to give to our colleagues within office hours due to hectic schedule,  Oval Lounge is always our first choice. Interior is smart designed, seating areas are comfortable. Staffs are all nice and helpful and suggest the best of the menu. would get north Indian, Chinese, continental,sofisticated bar all in one (& the nearest with best food in DLF area). I have visited this place at least 12-15 times and I have my favourites now. First is prawn tempura - super soft prawns of perfectly balanced sweet & chilly, then American corn salt and pepper ( this is a simple item & I have it many places but Oval makes them best), chicken malai kebab, mushroom salt and pepper, drums of heaven ( not that good but ordered always when went with a large group). Mains are good too, Chicken sweet & sour( have pineapple & 3 types of bell pepper) worth mentioning. I personally didn't try but others say mutton Biriyani is also good. They also have lunch buffet which I never tried but would do anytime soon. Will visit this place again and again, worth a try after hectic office hours.

Dropped in at this place with family. The place boasts of a more corporate crowd due to its location and proximity. The place is low lighted with few spot lights and soft music in the background. For dinner we ordered Butter Naan, Dal, Prawn Bharta & Gosht Ra Ra Curry Mutton which was very tasty yet not too spicy. The service by the staffs were satisfying. The gents washroom was unhygienic. The authorities should try to maintain the cleanliness.  Overall nice place.

Food and drinks are as normally priced for a lounge. Chilli paneer dry was very tasty.. Totally apt. No extra chilli or extra oily. And sauteed veggies also well.cooked. 

Glad with the service. Just good music would be an excellent add on. Looking forward to the next visit.

>It needs a proper place for smokers(though i am non smoker :P)
>Proper musicians must be outsourced to play western and Indian music to make the   experience more memorable.

Excluding the points above it is a good place for hangout.

The Oval Lounge is located in the first floor of the DLF complex located near Nazrul Tirtha! It is very prominent and can be easily spotted from both sides of the road. To get in you have to take the service road. If you are coming from Eco Park side, you have to take right from Eastern High signal and then enter the service road. 
The place is known for its lovely and laid back feel, making it ideal for boozing! The snacks are also very good. We tried the Bar B Q chicken and the Konjee crispy chicken which were very nice. 
Pros:
1. Prominent location
2. Lots of parking space
3. Big sitting space, ideal for big groups or corporate parties
4. Good cozy ambience
Cons:
1. Not so cheap!

I went here last december i.e 2 months back on a weekday afternoon .We had buffet.It was pathetic.Only 1 non-neg starter.The service too was bad.In the main course the mutton and chicken were exhausted early and took a long time to get filled.Also the place of main course was so small that people had to stand in queue to get a simple serving. after standing for 10-15 mins we left and went for desserts and were surprised to find only 1 sweet dish..that's it...no ice cream....overall i think it is one of the  worst place i have ever had a buffet lunch.Go at your own risk.

Went there last week..conveniently located with good ambience,you can have nice views of the newtown road..prices are quite reasonable.. I was floored by the hospitality..the staff is really courteous and helpful..
Now coming to the food,I had ordered stuffed tandoori aloo which was awesome..thai red curry wasn't edible at all and they replaced it with veg fried rice and some papads and even offered me 10 % off on the total bill..

Going to this place since 2011, when i was working out of the DLF building. Must say the decors and ambiance is great. The food is amazing but definitely not pocket friendly, however a good to visit place in Kolkata if you are looking a nice evening with good food and alcohol.... Would really appreciate if the pricing is looked upon, and revised rates are put up, will definitely attract more crowd as it would be more pocket friendly

Happy Munchin :)

It is a decent lounge in the rajarhat area... The ambience being quite good... One can go with family or friends or spouse... It was a bit noisy to begin with, but if needed the readily seat you somewhere else...

Food requires a lot of improvement especially their chicken starters-on ordering drumsticks, we got chicken lollipops, teriyaki chicken was basically fried chicken caramelized with honey, the chicken kebab was average....
The fish starters were really good though, fish tikka was soft and was of good quality, same with fish fingers....
For drinks, we took long island ice tea which was dilute compared to the actual LIIT...the other spirits were fine (as long as they are not made into a cocktail)

Well, I had visited this place some 3-4 times, as it is right beside my workplace. This restaurant has a cozy ambience which provides a laid back feel.
The staff is very polite in behaviour, helping us in choosing the right combinations as per our taste. But the service time is quite lengthy, as you would need to wait for 30-40 mins for your food to get delivered to your table. At night, the lounge is dim lit with blue lights, which lends a scintillating atmosphere to the place.
I have had Buffet Lunch at Oval. There are roughly 15 items(veg and non veg included) in their Buffet menu, and it does not burn a big hole in your pockets. A complimentary Welcome drink is served alongwith the Buffet Lunch. 
Recently when we visited this place. we ordered Crispy chilli chicken and Chicken and Lamb Steaks. We wanted to opt for Steak Sizzlers, but due to its unavailability, had to go for General Steak Servings.. The Crispy Chilli Chicken was well prepared, was crispy and good to taste. The Chicken and Lamb steaks were served with some rice and boiled vegetables. It was delightful to taste, the meat pieces being too soft and chewy.
It is always an enjoyable dining experience at Oval and look like to visit this place in future to explore new delicacies and much more!!! :-)

Ambience was great and quite spacious. Had chicken drumstick and bhetki gandharah for starter both were tasty n prepared perfectly. .
Mixed fried rice was not so good..rather the mixed noodles was better. I would recommend noodles over fried rice..
Thai chicken curry was very sour as it sud be may not be good for everyone's taste buds. . Try pepper chicken ..tastes better. .
Overall had a nice and complete team lunch for 16 people. .

A nice place to be with friends. As the name suggests, its oval in shape. Table are arranged around the corners. The restaurant has a bar counter. The restaurant actually confuses you with the ambience, sometimes they play indian classical music. Better to call it a simple bar & restaurant. Food is also ok, nothing so great.

We went for a lunch buffet and was astounded by the fact that they were completely unprepared to deliver. Our first serving took almost 20 minutes. The second serving never arrived. Frustrated we went to have main course to find that the 4 main-course items (including veg and non veg) were over. Again waited for 10-12 minutes only to get semi-cooked items. What ever we ate were not too special in taste and quantities were so controlled that once we had to discuss weather 'it was rotis they were serving or keema made of rotis'

Eventually we left unsatisfied and decided never to go there again.

Located in DLF IT Park, Oval is a nice lounge with sophistocated decor, reasonably priced liquor, nice staff and good tasty food ( based on starter)

We had ordered CHICKEN DRUMSTICK ( most of the places screw up this dish, but here it was with nice flavour, proper spice level and crunchy outside, soft inside chicken drums), CHICKEN MALAI KEBAB ( grilled chicken chunk with nice kich of ginger and topped with melted cream, a nice dish I must say) and KONJI CHICKEN ( crispy Chicken strips with fried bell pepper, onion and tangy spice)

If you are a smoker, you will be happy to know that they have smoking zone in the lounge itself!! So don't need to step out to have a fag.

This is the first time I went to this place and fell in love with it. We planned to visit another restaurant in the same building which turned out to be closed that day and we went in Oval instead. I frankly didn't have any expectation. But stepping inside, seeing the decor and ambiance I expected an expensive  high end lounge. It's definitely a high end lounge, in terms of quality of service, variety of liquor, taste of food etc. But definitely not an expensive one. We ordered for a pitcher of Kingfisher beer as the place do not have any Microbrewery. My earnest suggestion to the management team, please do think about it. I know this concept is not yet popular in Kolkata, but you've the potential to make it a success. We tried, some chicken starter, fish n chips, and fish finger. All are delicious. The staff here is extremely courteous. We spent almost 3-4 hour there. It clearly shows, how well attended we were. I'd definitely like to visit again.

Have been a regular visitor to Oval since its very inception. The only good lounge bar in the new town area. It hurts to see the fall in their service and food quality. The lemon beckti used to be their signature dish at one time, but the standards have slipped like anything. Service was always poor,even being a regular customer they would never make you feel so. Ambiance is pretty good, if you manage to get a seat right beside the window then nothing like it. Prices are reasonable. Rating it 2.5 primarily because of the high standards they had set earlier.

Been here many times for its lovely ambiance and cozy lighting. It gives a lounge type feeling to a well spaced out dining restaurant facing the Newtown main road. Perfect to visit for dinner for seating on the window side seats.
Prefer their continental spread. They come up with combination platters during festive occasions which is something to look forward to in order to take a break from monotony.
Dishes to try- Bar BQ Chicken salad, Fish n Chips, Bekti in lemon butter sauce, Lamb steak

The visit was for Dinner . 

Ambience :: encompassed with huge glass  planes overlooking a busy street,  soothingly lit in hues of blue , Comfortable seats .., good music (almost vacant )is what one experiences entering Oval Lounge  .
nice & cozy except for the smoking room ( which wasn't open ) so people were flocking a super small pathway decked with dustbins ! 



Service :: very hospitable and gracious staff . 

Food  :: 
We started with Red wine ( and they paired it with cheese :)  ) and whiskey !! 


Prawn Tempura - it was not really my liking for I have had better elsewhere , i found it too bland .

Masala Kulcha - soft & super delicious . 

Butter Naan - nice 

Chicken Kalimirch - i was so content eating this 
The meat was succulent & the gravy yum :)  

Had a nice meal :)

We had tried chinese cuisine and the food was quite good. Overall a good one.

The place is situated at DLF IT Park on the 1st Floor. 
The place is quite decent in terms of ambience....with enough seating place and good lightings.
But it lacks crowd... I hope more people turn up here....
I was quite surprised to find the place was mostly empty at 8:00 in the night on a Sunday!
We asked for beers, and they could not offer any strong beer, only had light beers (was disappointed again). 
Along with beers, we ordered chicken wings...found it good enough..
Overall the place is good only if you have a nice group .

Coming to the food, we ordered starters like Barbeque Chicken and Konjee crispy chicken along with a number of hard drinks. The starters complimented well with them. However, their quantity were much less compared to their price. 
Coming to the main course, we order Butter nan, Chicken bharta and Chicken Thai noodles. All of them were good but nothing extraordinary. The prices are on the higher side and will pinch your pocket to an extent. Last but not the least, the service was courteous and was prompt too ! So no complaints about that ! :)

Huge huge disappointment. Had ordered veg biryani and while eating found pieces of chicken and bones in the rice. They basically used the chicken rice and added veggies to it. Huge setback for a restaurant not being able to even maintain separate veg and non veg dishes. On confronting the manager and chef about it they simple asked for an apology and opted for a replacement of the dish. shows the quality of food they maintain inside the kitchen. To all the vegans out there. Visit the place at your own risk.

Pros: great value for money - I mean if you are a 3 friends and have 1500 rupees you can spare you will not be disappointed with the variety or taste of food you can order .
Absolutely fantastic starters- my recommendations are dhania murg kabab, seekh kabab,drums of heaven
Good ambience - you can walk in late on a Saturday evening and be seated in front of one of those large screens watching football and enjoying ur drink or food.
Big portions of sides - each plate is good for 2 hungry people and may be just enuf for 3 less hungry people .

Cons : they don't accept Sodexo or ticket restaurant coupons .
In case you have leftovers that you want to carry out they take a lot of time packing it 
I don't like their decoration in front of the big screens it obstructs the view of the TV
Sometimes their AC is not effective as it should be 

Bottom line: any time and money spent at the oval is worth it

Yet another place that I would probably never visit if not for Zomato. For people like us who work in Unitech and do not consider KFC, Dominoes and Azad Hind Dhaba to be our culinary heaven, we badly needed a place like this.

Although this place looks very sophisticated with its glass decor, it has a calm decor and a vintage wine collection. It is mainly visited by IT specialists who prefer some quiet time. I had a simple lunch here that comprised of crispy chilli baby corn, fried rice and schezwan chicken. The serving time was slightly high but the food was fresh and tasty. The staff was courteous and made sure that we were comfortable and asked for feedback after the meal.

In my short duration of stay I had a good impression of the place overall and might revisit in the future.

The Oval has been in my checklist for quite a long time and decided to give it a try  for the friday buffet. The ambience was nice and the view from the restaurant was good as well. As for the items concerned, it was fewer than expected. Salads, soup, baby corn, spring roll and dry chilli fish was in the starters. Steamed rice, hakka noodles, shahi paneer, mutton roganjosh, lemon chicken in Mains. Pudding, Chutney and vannila ice cream was all in desserts. But quality of the food was good, specially the Dry Chilli Fish and the Mutton Roganjosh. Service was good too. Overall nice experience for a first timer

Oval lounge is the go-to place for IT professionals from Technopolis, DLF IT Park 1 and sec V.
I have been to this place many times as it's located right inside my office complex. And I liked this place from the very beginning. 
I gave it a try since the very beginning when I started working at DLF 1. 
I first went there for my birthday treat on a friday especially to try the friday lunch buffet. Well the buffet was pretty decent.. with quite a couple of starters, a main course comprising biryani which was really good and some good desserts to conclude.  But this was the only time I found the Friday buffet to be good. Afterwards had again tried the buffet but was not that good. One thing about the buffet is they keep changing the menu so it's worth a try.
Now coming to a là carte, the choice of items is really widespread. Can be chosen a very wide range of items. Almost all the items are quite good. Both taste and quantity which makes the price justified.  I really have not had any awful experience yet regarding the food.
The ambience of the place is good and the muted decor is nicely done.  You can enjoy the view of the busy newtown road as you have food. They also played live matches when I visited this place during FIFA WC 2014.
The staffs here are polite and suggest you good.
I went to this place again a couple of weeks back. And this time me and my friend were on full experimental mode. So we've tried new dishes.
And this time we ordered chicken teriyaki for starters.  Well its actually soft boneless chickens tossed in brown sugar. A very good change if you're tired of the usual drums of heaven/chicken chopsticks starter route. For the main course we've ordered chicken pan fried noodles which was really good in quantity (one plate feeds two sufficiently) and taste. Another we had bhetki in lemon butter sauce. now this dish was really awesome. Soft boneless bhetki with the distinct pungent smell of mustard paste and finely chopped raw onions along with a bunch of boiled vegetables.  
Our experiment was totally successful. 
So all in all, it's a good restaurant that you want to have within your office premises.

This place was on my list for quite a while, and got a chance to visit this place. Situated within a IT Park you can expect only IT people here, and yes once you enter this place you'll see different tag baring people enjoying there share of fun after a hard fought day in the office. The moment you enter this place, the welcome view of vine variants displayed in the glass cascate took my eyes, will surly try them one day. A thing that disappointed me is that being a lounge there's no dance floor in this place. 

Comments on food, and yes that was good the starters were served really well prepared. I liked the dhaniya Murg and boti kebab here. The mutton was very tender and juicy. The konjee crispy chicken was also good, but I found it a bit more dry then the usual stuff we order elsewhere and also didn't find any difference between the konjee crispy chicken and the lamb variant of the same. 

The ambience and services were good, and the pocket pinch is quite affordable. All in all quiet a good experience and would like to visit the place again.

Visit this lounge quite often. Best things - the location, the ambience and the hospitality of the staffs. Some food items are pretty good and yes they can prepare some good continental dishes which goes well with drinks. Some food items though present in the menu are not available due to the unavailability of the chefs quite often. This is something which needs to be improved. They have good variety of liqour. Recommended- stuffed chicken. Not recommended - chicken pakora. Price is okay... Good place to hang out overall.

The food is pretty good, and the wines are fine, but the biggest bonus is it being close to IT offices. One of the best places in the Newtown area for a drink, it also offers good non-veg fare. The service is quite quick on weekdays, but pretty slow from Friday. The lighting is a bit dark and background music sets the mood quite nicely.
Tip : On Fridays, it is best to avoid this place as it is too crowded and smelly too. The fare is on the more expensive side and if you are a vegetarian, there are very few good starters available.

This place was on my list for quite a while, and got a chance to visit this place. Situated within a IT Park you can expect only IT people here, and yes once you enter this place you'll see different tag baring people enjoying there share of fun after a hard fought day in the office. The moment you enter this place, the welcome view of vine variants displayed in the glass cascate took my eyes, will surly try them one day. A thing that disappointed me is that being a lounge there's no dance floor in this place. 

Comments on food, and yes that was good the starters were served really well prepared. I liked the dhaniya Murg and boti kebab here. The mutton was very tender and juicy. The konjee crispy chicken was also good, but I found it a bit more dry then the usual stuff we order elsewhere and also didn't find any difference between the konjee crispy chicken and the lamb variant of the same. 

The ambience and services were good, and the pocket pinch is quite affordable. All in all quiet a good experience and would like to visit the place again.

The ambiance is very pleasing but I did not like the buffet menu which they served.
No doubt it was cheap and the service was good, but the quality and variety was not up to the mark.
The buffet menu was pretty short. I did not like the chicken wings which they served because it was too saucy and cold. The tandoori chicken was not bad.
In the main course, the nun was very dry and I did not like the chicken preparation also. But the lamb was very tasty. In desert, I liked the vanilla ice cream with the hot chocolate sauce.

A nice restaurant and the bar at the back was well decorated.

Oval is located inside the DLF IT complex and is visible right from the New Town main road. It's quite nice to see how the ambiance has been built. It's fancy and cozy and the music they play is appropriate to the ambiance. The Oval offers a large variety of drinks with a good combination but the prices are on the higher aide for both food and drinks. Many might not be satisfied with the food quality compared to the price they pay as I didn't.

Certainly, I wouldn't recommend Oval to those who wish to get stoned by the end since it's a bar cum lounge with many people visiting just to eat. Overall, a nice and soothing place with a great view and the servise is nice and the staff takes good care of you.

Visited this restaurant yesterday. A team dinner was arranged at this venue. 

The most surprising thing was, they were not serving in the table, neither the booze nor the starters. I don't know if that is common in this restaurant or it was because of the large team dinner, but in either way, it is very embarassing and can lead to chaos. 

Starters were nice at the begining, but with time, the quality degraded slice. Fish fingers were cut in halves and served. Tandoori chicken pieces were also cut small and mostly boney pieces. I did not take the main course, so cannot comment on that.

The bar tender was quite amusing and qualified.

Overall a nice experience. Looking forward to visit again. Decor is very nice and relaxing.

Had been to this place once with office colleagues   but with relatives around thought of it as a safe bet.
Cocktails were good , Especially the Bloody Merry ... Served differently in a more stylish manner...
We ordered food from the Chef's Special Menu & it was good, very well made & in dessert we had Devils Fudge which was comparable to the very best . After a long time had a dessert tasting so good and nice!!!!
Plan to visit it for their Valentines Couples Specials @ ₹999/- !!!!! Great going guys keep it up!!

Since its launch I have been to Oval Lounge many a times with friends & family. Had been looking for a place in Salt lake to have a party & finally decided to have it here.
The ambience with its neon lights is just perfect for parties .They agreed to give us a section for our do.
They have various party packages & the best part is that they are accomodative as per our budgets and goes to an extent to include some in-house surprise dishes in the package.
Amongst the dishes they provided fr the party,the WHOLE GRILLED BHETKI was something noteworthy. Drinks as well as the cocktails/ mocktails  were well stocked but the best part of the party which had my guests happy ws their DESSERTS . It was Californinan  Strawberry Creme which took all the points.
I can happily conclude that i am glad with the choice I made fr my party..From this forum I thank Team Oval for giving us a wonderful time with no choice for complains... Its a must must visit for everyone espcially with its beautiful location and hospitable staff.

Every time I go to Oval, I am surprised by how worse their food quality can get. Why do I go there, mostly forced. Working in Rajarhat area many of us find it very hard to get out from office in time after the prolonged meetings & this place is conveniently located.

The ambience is definitely nice however you would need to remember that the loud music won’t allow you to chat with your colleagues or friends.

The staff is easily one of most indifferent I have noticed anywhere. 

Now the food – please try not to order fish – it really sitnks. When we ordered chillie fish & fish finger, both stank to high heaven. We had asked last time even before ordering whether the fish will stink & their indifferent answer was “all fish stink” with an expression on the face of “duh what an idiotic question”. We actually discussed whether we should take the waiters / owners to eat at many of the other restaurants in Kolkata or anywhere. Probably they live in a world where fish always stinks 

Can’t tell much difference between their different Chinese cuisine starter & won’t say much about their quality of mutton which was undercooked twice.

I definitely avoid going there nowadays.

Probably the only good bar cum lounge presently in New Town locality. The place has a nice feeling to it. The neon lighting arrangements do make the place a lot more attractive. The seating arrangements are also quite the good stuff here. The price here is towards higher side. The food provided here is not something extraordinary but definitely does fulfil the standards the place portrays. The service here is quite good. They are all helpful and nice. This is one place that if you visit new town, you should visit without fail. It will surely impress you and I am sure you will want to visit it very soon again.

Though they don't much options in deserts. But in that price range, I will say it's good for money. Visited again in end of May, this time, it's not good in terms of service, food availability is not good. Complained to manager, he listens and was cooperative, taken all the complaints. Downgrading rating, till the next visit.

Most of the drinks from the menu were not available reason stocks are missing... No Corona... No Budweiser only Kingfisher so on a friday night when the crowd shall be pulling in i suppose the bar should be stocked. Food pretty standard stuff nothing I can take home...

Since it is within DLF IT Park, have been there many times......the ambience and decor are nice, the choice of drinks is good, but the snacks are not very tasty. Common accompaniments like crispy chilly baby corn as an example do not taste well.....mostly a bit too salty......prices could have been more pocket friendly as the place caters primarily to regulars who work within the sa.e complex and would prefer it more at better rates.

Serious dunno how this has 3.7 rating in Zomato! Got seriously misguided by its rating and reviews. Can't talk about A-La-Ca-rte though! Had dinner buffet at this place with my office colleagues. HORRIBLE would be an understatement for them. Starters average but maximum time it was not there when you go for refill. Main course mutton smelled bad. Chicken OK. Paneer? Lets not even talk about it.
Dessert only had ice cream with choco sauce. This was the best dish out there but the credit goes to Kwality Walls.

Service very POOR.

The whole buffet costs us around 650 /-. Highly OVERPRICED. Not at all a value for money.

It is a nice place...nice ambience..light music..but sofas were not very comfortable

We ordered Reverse swing(lichi juice) and Sex on the beach(Cocktails) and beers.
The cocktails were great.

We have zafrani murg tikka and Murg tikka Lababdar ...those kind of melted in the mouth...and  the crispy chicken,crispy chilli baby corn..they were good but too crispy....and chilly mushroom and chilly chicken oval.. those were mind boggling...
But the teriyaki chicken was too sweet...and not worth it..

For the main course we ordered garlic naan..kabuli naan... and two side dishes..all were good...
Overall a nice place to be with office colleagues as well as friends to savour some great food.

Would have given a 3 rating...but finally clicked on 1 because of the shameless behavior of the Manager Mr. Rajesh Saha. With the nice ambiance, nice soft rock music, crowd, quality variety of drinks and a screen showing T20, we friends were enjoying our time at Oval. For me it was the first time and i really liked the place. So it happened after the last order time (it was 5 minutes past the cut off time) we requested the service guy if he can manage one last drink for us. The guy politely said he would want us to talk to his manager regarding that. We readily agreed to talk to the Manager Mr Rajesh. The service fella went up to Mr Rajesh and told him that we want to speak to him, now bugger just ignored our request and went back to watch Cricket match (dude you are not paid for this - pity for ur boss who pays you to watch Cricket match - wish we had a job like this..lol).Anyways, coming back to the topic, this made us pissed off as he had ignored his customer, which is the worst thing to do in service Industry (dude we all are from Service Industry, and we know how to serve our customer, you better  go back to your management days take the grumpy old man's lecture a bit more seriously instead of checking out girls, it will help u). We requested again that we would want to talk to him and now it was not for the last order but for the kind of behavior he has shown to us. (Remind you, we were not drunk, and we did not want to fight with you if that had scared ur balls off). The second time also he ignored us went back to his Cricket match and told that his shift is over and did not want to entertain after his shift is over (seriously douchebag, this is what you learnt after all your experience?, who even made you the manager, you are not suitable for an Intern also, even Interns know how to think out of the box and go that extra mile to serve customers.). After this his audacity was to say aloud his name to us and say "write a complain, lets see what happens". I am never ever going to step in this place again and I will make sure to spread this word out in every social media. I have been to many places but no where the manager's treatment made me pissed off. If you are looking for quality time go some where else but not to Oval.

This is the worst place that i have been to. I along with couple of my office colleagues had been to Oval last week. The service was pathetic. We had taken coupon from Groupon. The staff was very adamant, we asked them to join the table but they did not allow us to sit together. We had to sit separate.  We had to wait for 1+ hours between Starters and main course.
We had to complain to the staff and eventually to the manager of this place, but still we did not get any response. By the time the food came we were all exhausted. Although, food quality was not bad but the portions were small and the groupon menu was not flexible as it asked you to order to side dish (curries) and one main course (rice/chowmein) , to be shared by two person. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Very good place to go with someone or with friends and family.  Very decent ambience.

The Friday buffet may not be satisfying but dine in with ala carte and they will create an impression. 

Food is really good here and price is decent.

The place feels pretty amazing on the evening...

I went here for team lunch, the place has decent ambiance. The food could have been better, some starter items like murg dhaniya kebab, baby corm, drums of heaven were really good. In main course  kaadhai chicken, jeera rice, mutton dopyaza were good, but chilly chicken was very bad, crispy baby corn was not at all crispy, mixed fried rice was so so. Desert was good, but little unusual as sizzling brounies were served over cabbage leaves, tutti fruity was nice.

Nice decent lounge to hang around after office hours. The ambiance is really relaxing and soothing. Have been here with my friends for a birthday party and it was really a nice experience. Our birthday gal was given a complimentary mocktail and more over the waiters gathered around and clapped over for a happy bithday song. Food is quite good but I think it is little bit overy priced since there is no one around the deserted new town area to provide such nice ambiance.

Please do not order salad here. They just do not know how to make it. I ordered bar B Q chicken salad on 15th August. They do not even know what Bar B Q is. They chopped some bell peeper and onion, put some grilled chicken on them and poured a bowl of mayonnaise over it. No Bar BQ sause, nothing. I suggest to Team Oval, Please do not put anything in the menu, that u do not know how to prepare.

This is a decent place in DLF IT Park to savour some good food in a decent ambiance during lunch or after office hours.
I have tried their Chello Kebab twice and I quite liked it but they could swap the chinese style fried rice in the chello kebab with just butter rice since fried rice with kebab is a big turn off.
Their Chinese preparations are well cooked though the quantity is a bit on the lesser side. I have tried their crispy baby corn, mixed fried rice and chicken in garlic sauce and liked them.
But the north Indian dishes are not very tasty with just thick gravy and the same taste in the vegetarian as well as chicken dishes.
The service is not good and some of the waiters are just ignorant of how to treat their returning guests. Overall an average experience compared to the other options available in the IT park.

Well, yes about this place. This place has been on my list for a very long time and I was hoping to step into that place one day. It reminded me every-time I used to go past that place, of airport lounges. I was fortunate enough to give this place a try and that too at night and I am instantly attracted to this place. The place lights up very beautifully at night. The ambiance looks stunning with chilled AC and very nice sitting conditions. Now coming to the food-its expensive yes, but the quality and quantity of the food both is exquisite and very good.  Right now, one of the best places to hang out in with friends, family alike.

Situated at a very convinient spot this is an inescapable place for a little chill after a regular week in the office. Oval is running a sort of monopoly near the Rajarhat area, because around the deserted IT locality there are few hangouts which serve good food & drinks with a good ambience. Naturally the place is crowded with young office returned fellows chatting over some drinks and snacks. Although our visit was during the lunch hours, the crwod was minimal and the environment impressive. We were seated quickly and our orderes were quick too. Our choices for the day was Tengri kebab, Crispy baby Corns, stuffed chicken, a mocktail (I cannot remember the name) and some regular liquor. We later ordered some Chinese for the lunch.I feel all of the items were definitely up to my expectation with a good service, We were enoying the meal, And then in the middle of this we found a tiny hair in our crispy babycorn !When we asked for an explanation, the authority swiftly apologised and exchanged the plate with a fresh one. We were little high and not in a mood to create a fuss, hence we ignored. But henceforth we were eating more cautiously and attentively.Although I have no complaints with the taste of your food, the ambience and service but no matter what, a hair in a food item means unhygiene and it is highly unacceptable. I understand a single hair can be a rare accident but, with the charge we pay for the meal and the status you hold up, we would have expected a bit more responsibility from your part.Concluding Notes:1. I would love to come back, once satisfied with the hygiene of the place.2. This place is moderately costly.3. You are going to love the view from the oval windows.4. The food is good in taste.

Oval lounge , well donno where to begin from. This place has been on my list for quite some time and each time i hit  city centre - 2 i would look at the restro from my car window and wonder how it will look from within. Especially at night the place lights up and gives a really nice outlook. The restro reminds you of the airport lounges where one can sit, enjoy a meal and watch the planes take off or on the runway. So one day i finally decided to give this place a try. Initially i thought the place would be flocked by corporate employees since its located in the DLF building but i was wrong. I saw families, friends, business people hang out and enjoy their time. 

The ambiance is really nice, the decor, the comfy sofas, the panoramic view from the window, the bar  and ahh thank god the music was just perfect and soothing. Not the loud kind where noone can hear each other. Just a perfect lounge to chill with friends and enjoy each other's company. The waiters were prompt and very polite.

Now coming to the food- everything we ordered was yum, the mutton rara, the malai kebab the dessert, the thought of it is making me salivate.This place is perfect to throw parties, just that its located far off from the central area. Other than that  I have to say i really had a good experience and at an affordable cost.

The worst service i ever found was at oval. I planned out my husbands birthday at oval, and unfortunately that was the worst thing i did. We went dere and asked for a little comfortable table which should be enuf for food and liquor, and they denied saying that another section of the restaurant is closed. They still had few tables left which was spacious but they denied to give.  A lady who was serving us was extremely bad in her approach and was rude. In short the restaurant is having the worst service and in order to not spoil the day even more we walked out of the place and went to the poolside bar at stadel (newly opened). We had immense fun dere and had a wonderful experience.

Very good ambience, great food and reasonably good service. Liquor price is also reasonable and there's a wide variety on offer. The kababs are great and better than the Chinese/Oriental dishes. Special mention must be made of the Mutton Boti Kabab, the Fish Tikka, the Mutton Seekh Kabab and Gondhoraj Bhetki (grilled bhetki with a hint of lemon).

Good place to let your hair down after a hard day at work.

We ordered teacher's 50 large nd first russian salad with french fries. 
After tht my frend suggested sizzler nd "pinapple cherry cheese stick" 
The cheese is not the perfect one bt its awsomely tasty. 
As per food its good place to visit once a while, ambiance is good and staffs are very responsive nd helpfull. They take feed back after u finish. 
Love the place wish will visit again.
At last as I always say keep eating nd smile Cheers!!!!!

Visited Oval Lounge yesterday with my husband hoping to have a good time over drinks. The ambiance and the food is good though the  Service needs improvement. We were enjoying our drinks and food and were discussing that we should come here more often 'coz of the comfortable and cozy environment with good music playing in the background. But, what made us change our minds was the repeat order of our drinks. My husband ordered a repeat of 100 pipers and what was served was no where close to 100 pipers. They served him some cheaper brand whiskey . When we asked the manager if our order was served correct, he said it was but 'coz both of us know our drinks well, we knew the repeat order of drinks was not the one which we had asked for. This is a trick small bars and cheap hotels do, replacing the repeat order with cheaper drinks and billing for the original expensive one. Didnt expect this from a place like Oval lounge.
Caution to all those who visit this place : Ask the bartender to serve you your drink from the bottle itself at your table. This way you'll know that they are not cheating.

I have been going to this place for the past one year or so but with every subsequent visit i have been sadly disapointed.To start with i really liked the place because of the good food and ambience but lately the quality of food has really deteriorated.The last time I was there with my friends and family we had ordered lamb steak,chicken stroganoff,fish in lemon butter sauce which was a total disaster.Only Good part of the entire meal were the fish fingers and stuffed chicken.The air conditioning on that particular day was anything but comfortable or ambient.It was really hot and the television was playing very loudly.As a whole it was one of my worst experiences at OVAL till date.I will definitely think twice before heading back there in the future.

Well, this one’s located at the DLF IT Park (one out of the only 2 bars in the building – The other one’s Penguin) and hence 99% of their revenue is from the office folk in and around DLF. There is a Lunch crowd (courtesy Team parties) , with buffets ranging from 400 – 500 INR. And there are disgruntled IT folks who would drink down 2 pegs and head back home in the eve (hoping they don’t get caught: P).
Parking is huge and an absolute non-issue. You have to enter the IT Park from Gate 3 (on the Major Arterial road), enter the building, climb up a floor via the elevator/escalator and there you are: Oval, above the KFC. The ambience and interiors are neatly done, with subdued blue lighting, giving it a Lounge feel. Huge glass walls give you a nice view of the busy Rajarhat road. There is a giant aquarium on your right and a nice collection of wine bottles below it. The capacity is quite large, and it can accommodate around 60 pax (Guesstimating) at a time. 2 giant LEDs play House/Pop HD music videos (also sports – IPL/EPL) all the time. And also, there’s music to add to the feel. The Bar counter/cellar area has a couple of bar stools and it’s a nice place to down your drinks and watch some sports.
At one point of time, Oval decided to go high on tech and they replaced their Menus with tablets and you could select and order from it. But given the poor quality and complex software of the tablets, the paper menus returned soon. 
Well, the food is just above average. Though I didn’t have a full course dinner out here (except maybe Biriyani) at times, it does not have anything to boast about. The starters are decent, but the amounts are not wholesome, considering the prices (For eg. A Shredded Lamb and Pepper costs you 325 INR). And there are silly offers going on (Like Chilly Paneer free with 4pints of beers), which are of basically no use.  The drinks are a bit on the pricier side and the staff is ok. 
All in all, it scores a lot on Ambience and décor, but when it comes to food and boozing, it is pretty ordinary. I know I would (have to) visit it again, but Oval has clearly not bowled me over. My Rating is 3.5

A place that is just beside my office and we end up going there almost every month. Though its a bit higher on the price chart but every penny spent is worth it.
Starting from the biryani to the continental, all are cooked perfectly.
If you are food buff and interested in trying different cuisines, I suggest you to try the Thai chicken curry.....it's just amazing with a twist of lemon and is so light that you won't feel any discomfort after the meal.
Liquor brands are abundant and served with finesse. 
Ambiance is really good and the behavior from the staff id most cooperative.

The service can be improved and is really sad, but otherwise a nice place to chill out with friends over a drink and snacks.The quality and taste of the food is definitely good and that's a surprise considering it's a lounge.
I would recommend it to all those who are in that part of town, the music could however get better considering the place has so much going for it already.

The best thing about this restaurant is its location - in a direct catchment area for the IT crowd. However perhaps it's biggest drawback is also it's location - the entrance of the restaurant is nowhere near where people would like it to be. Perhaps that is the reason it witnesses such a low footfall. 

The food is quite average - the lunch crowd comes in for the buffet, which I felt is a bit overpriced. But again, how many restaurant options does a person have in this area?

Oval is a regular hang out for people in DLF IT Park, we just swing out of our offices in Tower A and step in the restaurant in Tower C. 
Oval scores well in all the departments  decor, ambiance, space and above all Food. Though it may seem a bit pricey to many, it is not. I have visited this restaurant umpteen times and don't remember any time when I was not happy with the food. The Kadai Chicken/Veg Hara Bhara Kabab, Pan Fired Noodles, Aloo Do piaza, Oval Special Chilli Chicken are awesome and a must try for all. 
The buffet is a once a week thing, though it started on not such a good note (I blame it on my expectation!) it has picked up pace later. Also @499 this is one of the good deals you will get in this side of the town. 
A point for the management- continental serving has a margin of improvement, specially the sizzlers.

Visited the restaurant yesterday evening with my family to celebrate new year eve’s dinner. This is my 4th visit to this restaurant in last couple of months. I like the ambience and quality of foods here. I ordered “Roasted Turky” from the list of their X’mas and New Year special menu. It was served with mashed potato and herbed rice.  And frankly speaking this was worst though the mashed potato and rice was good in test but the main course of the dish (Turky) was horrible. I had tested Turky in many different restaurants across the city and globe. However, this was the worst experience I ever had. I gave my feedback when one of the staff members asked about the quality. Unfortunately, what I heard only the excuses and defensive statement. This added more dissatisfaction on top of the bad food. Indeed it was a pretty much bad experience at the start of the year. Anyway, the other dishes ordered by my family members were as per the expectations. 

Recommendation: Please don’t try Turkey here.

Masala kulcha paneer butter masala roasted duck in Brown sauce with garlic bread & sautéed vegetables & Russian salad. Food quality was great tasted nice warm & meat was tender. 
One mark I cut cause of the white wine it wasn't perfect. Otherwise this lounge was satisfying.

after a long discussion we decided to have lunch at Oval, I was very confused and disappointed with the reviews on zomato, but after having food at Oval I was really Happy, food is awesome, I loved veg handi biryani,  as for the non veg , as per my family it was awesome too. So I would strongly recommend this restaurant.

Ambience: Quiet nice to hangout with friends, enjoy the drinks and chat while the perfect song selection is being played hotel California, coming back to life just name few.

Food: Average. We ordered around 20 different dishes but none of them can be rated above average except the Fish Finger.

Service: I would say they have a long way to go when it comes to this. Additional requests apart from ordering foods required multiple reminders. Even the person who was taking the orders seems to be lost in some other world.

Price: Reasonable. Also just for information, if you can order before 7 PM you will get Buy 2 get 1 offer on drinks.

Classy ambiance, appropriate lighting, good music and nice view is what you will feel as first impression on entering the restaurant. Staff was courteous. One going through the menu immediately one will immediately realize that the price is on the higher side. Needless to say they have wide variety of drinks.
We ordered kebabs which not only satisfied my taste buds also made me consider the steep pricing keeping the taste in mind. Fish kebabs just melt in our mouth. However, once entered the main course zone this is where the disappointment began. Being a hardcore Mughlai cuisine lover so for evaluation I always prefer Biriyani. According to me how the Biriyani tastes will give you the idea about the competency of the chef. Chicken Biriyani comes with a hefty price tag of INR 190 w/o tax but the taste, look n feel doesn't justify the same. Taste was very flat and doesn't gives that zing. 
I will strictly recommend Oval for drinks and starters.

Been here twice,and the experience has been pretty much the same!

LOCATION:In the new town DLF building.

AMBIANCE: amazing at night!
You can bring your date,family or even hangout with your frnds here.
As the name says,its literally Oval in shape!


SERVICE:they took normal time to deliver the food on the table,nothing to complain about in that part!Though I wish they could have more confident waiters.

FOOD : Ordered Hara bhara Kebab,Murg Kalimirch and Butter Naan.
Hara Bhara Kebab was so bad that i couldn't finish the entire dish!It tasted a bit like koraeshutir kochuri's stuffing.
Murg Kalimirch was tasty but not out of the world.For a price of 290 bucks it only had 4 pieces of chicken but had enough gravy.
Naan was soft and not very thick just the way I like.

PRICE:on the higher side.

CLEANLINESS: 1.Window panes were not cleaned.
2.The fork I was given had red marks on it.(it was not washed properly)
3.Finger bowl had water stains.
4.Beside the sofa seats you can see a layer of pebbles,which looks good but has dirt in it,,like hair, red marks etc.

I couldn't help but wonder,when was the last time they had actually cleaned up the place!
And also when i entered,I noticed a few waiters removing some decorations from the ceiling.These things should be done when there is no one in the restaurant.it looks plain odd!


May visit here again but only because its close to my office.

Oval Lounge is the only bar cum restaurant of its kind in DLF Tower C and in that Rajarhat area to my knowledge. Last Friday we had an office organized lunch there and approximately 50 of us hungry techies descended on them at around 12:45. The seats were pre-reserved for us and apart from another group of techies the place seemed deserted.

The ambiance is nice. Even at 12:45 in the afternoon the interior is dark thanks to the heavy curtains that hang in front of the glass outer wall of the restaurant. At night, I am sure, when the curtains are pulled back it provides a spectacular glittering view of the IT sector. I was also impressed with the range of wine displayed in a glass box just on the side of the entry way. 

Now coming to the food. Since it was an office lunch, buffet was the natural choice. For starters they had two salads, harabhara kabab , chicken drumsticks and bar-b-q chicken. The salads were quite unappetizing. Although they had given them separate names, both of them were cut veggies dipped in an embarrassing amount of mayo dressing. The harabhara kabab, made of minced peas and nuts was rather nice. The chicken drumstick and the bar-b-q chicken tasted exactly the same. The only difference being the bar-b-q chicken was boneless and had chopped bell pepper along with the chicken pieces. But the positive thing being that the sauce it was cooked in was sweet and spicy and nice.

For the main course they had naans, kali daal, paneer butter masala, chicken chap, mutton biriyani. They were also serving white rice to those who specifically wanted them.  None of the main course had anything remarkable to write about.

The dessert was downright disappointing. They only served vanilla ice-cream with chocolate sauce.

The staff were cordial. But they seemed rather confused which became highlighted when they served the welcome drink of pineapple blossom after most of the customers had finished their dinner.

I give them a 1 for their ambiance , 1.5 for the food and 0.5 for their staff.

The interiors are very nicely decorated. The ambience is pleasing.. The color scheme is blue which is very soothing.. The staff is courteous and helpful.. We ordered Tandoori Chicken and Murg Malai Kebab which were awesome.. Though, we thought the menu items were a bit overpriced.. But the total experience kind of makes up for it.. Just one suggestion: Try to play different type of music so that it pleases all.. It was only playing English.

Dear Friends ,

Please do not visit Oval ,this is a worst restaurant we had visited in our life.Worst service,food quality is not good as per price.The main point we found these guys are doing manipulations in the bill , i would suggest please compare the bill with what you have ordered.We are from IBM we found several times these guys are doing this manipulations in the bill , last time we caught them and asked then why you guys are doing simply they call there security guy who is local gunda and started fighting with us.So please do not go the Oval why we are saying you might face some same unpleasant situation which we had faced.If you have any queries please contact us.
Thanks

Went to Oval Lounge with Zomato Voucher on Friday afternoon lunch with family.

Location and parking : It is located at Rajarhat just above KFC in DLF IT Park. Parking is absolutely great with lots of parking space.

The Ambiance : The restaurant will score lots of points with its excellant decor and ambiance. The oval shaped lounge is spacious with good sitting arrangements and overlooking the Rajarhat Road. 

The Food :  The food is great. You have option of going for buffet and also you can order your food. We went for ordering. Highly recommended are Crumb Fried Chicken Wings, Barbeque Chicken and Chello Kabab. The taste was great and all of us liked it. The mutton kababs could have been a bit more tender and juicy.

The Service : The service is great. From the time we entered the restaurant, we were directly and attended very well. The food serving time including starters were average 10-15 minutes. I liked the fact that we were personally approached by staff for feedback and suggestions for improvement.

The Price: Looking at the ambiance, it looks like it would be high priced but the price is quite reasonable. I recommended this bar cum restaurant to my brother-in-law who went their for official dinner the same day and the prices are quite reasonable (even with alcohol).

Overall, a very good experience. Would recommend this restaurant to others too.

Boasting about plush interiors. But with that kind of food quality and service, i don't know till when would people want to continue visiting that place.
Taste and service needs not only an improvement but a total makeover.
A place like this should have more innovative cuisine. Should not only be a Dhaba category also serving regular Chinese and Continental cuisine.
Rise..!! as you have an opportunity unlike others is all i wanna say..

Finally, I got the time to utilize my free meal voucher sent by Zomato at the Oval Lounge, New Town. "Thank you so much Zomato!"

We went there on Sunday after visiting Avani River Side mall at howrah, so, we were in hurry but reached there on time at 8:30 PM. Parking is a bliss after you enter the premises of the DLF IT Park from the gate no. 3 located just on the major arterial road.

At a first glance you will know why this restaurant is named Oval because of it's unique architectural shape seen from the outside. From inside it looks fabulous and the ambiance was awesome which is surrounded by glass walls, feels premium.

So far so good, we went ahead and jiggled through the menu but were unable to figure out what to order because of the wide range of dishes. So, we started off with vodka n mocktail for the ladies, 3 large pegs of whiskey, and crumb fried chicken wings which was on offer and also had barbeque chicken which has got 10pcs in a portion. Both the items were delicious, especially, the barbeque chicken.

So we were bit confident about the food quality here. Now we wanted something so that maximum items can be covered in a single platter. What else that could be? Yes, Chello Kebab, they have it. Four pieces of each mutton and chicken kebabs with butter rice and egg poach on top of it. Everything was excellent but the only thing which was disappointing was the mutton kebabs, it was stiff and half cooked. I don't know but they should have checked the same before serving, after all it's a nice place and we had such good food initially.

Staffs were really polite and good at their job. The manager took our feedback and promised that next time onwards they will take care of the food quality. Lastly, we were informed that they host birthday and office parties too. Over all it was a good experience and will visit this place again.

First of all it is easy to find.. Just in the DLF and the parking place is pretty good when you are in..And now on food, I'll say it is good.. Few of the items like stuffed chicken or few fish starters are great.. If you visit there with 2/4 people it is good.. but when it comes to big group it is quite difficult.. I remember once we went there with 12 friends, the seating arrangement wasn't that great.. and buffet section was pretty clumsy .. but surely I can recommend you to visit there may be with 2.. service is good.. Overall it is a good place to be with good food..

One of the worst resturant in the area. Waiters have no courtesy, including manager. I went this resturant several times before, but that time the food was good and service was ok. But in recent times, the Waiters are rude, idiots and nonsense. They don't know how to talk to customer. We went there yesterday to see mach of India Pakistan. But the Waiters tried to ruin the experience, we were lucky that we left the place just before toss.

have been there 2 times and was pleased with food quality. indian items were really good. liquor price is on the higher side compared to competition available in vicinity.

edit: visited twice recently and found food quality came down. quantity per serving is less and the price is high. also, alcohol price has been hiked so, a basic dinner with your partner with couple of drinks would throw you back by 3000+! the ambiance and decor is very nice though. the lighting is a bit dim but that adds to the mood of the decor and theme. it's a nice place to hang around with friends but food quality+quantity must improve for the price they charge otherwise, their customer count would decrease day by day.

This restaurant /bar has a wonderful ambience. The food is above average. Cost for alcohols is slightly on the higher side.  Even if you are a non drinker you would acknowledged the beauty of its mouth melting chicken reshmi kebab. Never ever try to taste the buffet that they offer during lunch. ONLY the starters are good over here. Main dishes are very inconsistent. I ordered chicken ala-keiv and got chicken in white cheesy gravy with white rice. Being an admirer of cheese I was able to have it, but as you understand, it was NOT chicken ala-keiv.

Tucked away on the first floor of the DLF building in Rajarhat New Town, Oval Lounge is lounge bar which blows you away with its ambience. Velvet shades, glass windows with great views of the Rajarhat township, funky lights and a well-stocked wine cabinet greet you as you step inside.

There are loads of options on the menu, but to be honest, this is a place where drinking is first priority and everything else is second. The decor itself sets the mood accordingly. Despite what its extravagant interiors suggest, its not a very expensive place and is a favourite haunt of the techie population in the city.
