The first couple of times the cakes were really good but from the third time the quality detoriated. I hope they go back to their previous standards.

my friend had ordered for my birthday cake from here.
well the design of the cake was beautiful and the taste was AMAZING.
soft spongy cake, not so oily cream and perfect sugar balance.
i loved the cake so much that i finished the one kg cake in almost an hour!!!!

Mouth Melto is located close to South City on the opposite side. The place is popular for pastry. I went with my friend and we had the Blue Berry pastry, taste wasn't much good, atleast I didn't like it much. They have a small seating inside.
Prices are all between 30-40

It's a small shop but the quality is really good. Especially the birthdays cakes. Chocolate cakes are gooyi and delicious. Must try brownies, truffle cake. Breads are also good. Make to order available. Recently tried chicken puff and mud pie . It was so good.

Mouth Melto is in the opposite foot of South City Mall, a minute walk from South City towards Jadavpur Police Station.
Ambiance is very ordinary with only one seating place accommodation of 2.
Tried their Blue Berry Pastry. Nothing special. Fat layer of not so fresh cream covers the pastry.
Prices are very reasonable. Almost all the pastries range between Rs.30-35.

The name itself conveys a little hint to you that what they are up with. When it comes to mouth melting stuff then cakes pastries and desserts are the options. Dropped to this place located at the Prince anwar shah road just opposite of South city mall alley road. They sell some homemade cakes which have been their specialty. Tried the the Black and white cake. Taste was good, it was creamy and the chocolaty flavor was coming nicely in my mouth but missed the mouth melting feature in this. Due to high temperature the cake got little hard though i guess it will be worth eating with the right temperature.

Surprisingly new! One of the very few places I have had the best Black Forest Cakes! Really tasted yum and fresh. The inside had a huge filling of chocolate chips and the cake texture was really soft and smooth! Kudos to Abir, the owner as he made extra effort to make sure it was delivered well to my door step! Reasonable pricing and tasty stuff are the secrets of any venture. Mouth Melto a big brand in its making!

Pleasantly surprised to discover that this place bakes you fresh cakes in 20 minutes and home deliver it for free !  The taste was truly better and fresh. Thankfully they have some good options in egg less cakes. Highly recommended.
