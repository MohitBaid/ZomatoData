The service is totally horrible. Minimum waiting time is 45 minutes. Moreover they serve you stale,cold,un-healthy food. The staffs are always quarreling with each other in front of customers only!!

Staff is not well mannered .

Just amidst the hustle bustle o Goruhata, you will spot this one step up bar cum restaurant with amazing food. They serve you alcohol hence +1 from my side. The waiters were quite good nd served us really well. Hot garlic chicken was what I loved, especially when paired with beer. It's a family restaurant so they have special sections for all kind o customers.

Located at Dum dum cantonment, gorabazar. A good place in locality. Food is good but can be better. Service is fast. Prices are reasonable too.

The place is one of the first multi cuisine restaurant in dum dum but now a days it has lost its charm and quality. People now a days knows this place mainly for its bar area which is also quite shady though the stuffs are well mannered. Still a good place to hangout with friends for the college goers.

Initially when it was opened , it was a very happening place for the people of Dum Dum & vicinity.The restaurant on the first floor with live instrumental music played in the evening on week ends was something nice.Quality of food & service too was fairly satisfactory. Of late the place has become very noisy and somewhat the initial charm that it had is lost.None the less , the food is still appreciable and I for one prefer to take away rather than dine at the restaurant.Parking is problem, and so also the approach to the restaurant as it is located in a busy market zone.
One of my favorite items Fish Roll & chips is no longer served!
The Zaffran Pulao & Keema Matar is good!

I never has a good opinion for this restaurant, but now I feel its is worst then my thought..... Zero could have been the rating if it is available....
 the food served is stale, half cooked and tasteless, and when complained, the shameless manager take it as a compliment. Hygiene of the resturant is also A Big Zero.

Quality of food is decreasing day by day. Also the behaviour of assistance is rude. Even toilet is not well maintained. There is only one toilet in the whole restaurant that too in the bar. So if you have to go to toilet then you have to go to the bar first.... I should say don't bring your family here,especially children,cuz the environment of Pleasure Hut is not good.

The drinks are cheap all right... but the food... i am not sure about it.. We ordered Paneer Pakora. I used to think that this is something that no one can mess up while cooking... But boy wasn't I wrong.

We had a plate of Paneer Pakora that was undercooked and bland in flavour.

The namkeen that we were served with out Beer had more flavour than the Paneer Pakora.

One of the worst restaurants in my list...first of all not at all suitable for family dinners..the moment you enter this place the smell of alcohol will very much bother you(if like me you aren't accustomed to it). Well,even after that we sort of thought of checking out their food. Since i have had russian salad before i thought of ordering it and nothing extra with it cause i know 1 plate russian salad only fills a person up. 1 coke accompanied it. When they brought over my order i kinda asked myself whether i wanted 1 full plate or just wanted a pinch to taste! They sort of brought over only a pinch..n the taste..it went nowhere near russian salad. With this only i thought of leaving the place immedietly..somehow finished off with whatever rubbish they brought over and left..such a bad experience..swore of never visiting this place again..may be the other outlet of pleasure hut but not this one anymore!!

Pleasure Hut is located in one of the better parts of Dumdum i.e Gorabazar!but however the entrance is such that you wont find the place if you dont know exactly where to go!The staff is very cordial,and the restaurant is also spacious.They serve both Indian and Chinese.I had Chinese,and the food was good.The quantity was very very good!The ambience was okayish.And the best part at the end-the BILL.This restaurant is cheap!So if you are low on money,and you are in Dumdum,this is the place to be!

Prompt home delivery within 15 minutes of placing the order. Decent food quality and very decent quantity for the price range.
The menu might be out of date though, as the prices seem to have been revised.

had been here for a friends treat ..it is located in the dumdum gorabazar area...it is quite a nice restaurant i liked the ambience and the cordial behaviour of the staff..we were a bunch of 10 there..and it is a spacious restaurant..it serves both chinese and north indian cuisine..

we ordered for chicken tikka kebabs and drums of heaven  in the starters..in the main course one of us had tandoori roti and chicken bharta...and some chicken fried rice and hakka noodles with singapore chicken and garlic chicken..each item was delicious..i never knew this restaurant serves such good food..ranging from chinese to north indian each was made to the near about perfection...
and ending it in a sweet note we had chocolate and butterscotch ice creams...

i loved this place...we had so much food and such awesome food in a pocket friendly price..with such nice ambience and great food i will be coming here again..!!

I have been going to this restaurant since they had just one room as their dining area (excluding the bar, that is). Over the years they have expanded their seating place quite a bit, but the thing that hasn't changed is the quality of their food. I have been to this restaurant to eat and sometimes even for take away. Have tasted numerous of their items starting from tum yam thai soup, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka to mixed fried rice, garlic chicken, chicken bhurta etc. The mixed fried rice with garlic chicken and chicken bhurra with tandoori paratha are two of my very favourite combos. Pricing of the food is fairly reasonable and ambience is pretty acceptable too. However the attitude of the staff has changed a bit over the years! They used to be much more attentive to the guests previously but may be that's because they have expanded their area of operation quite a bit! Anyways, I love their food and it being very conveniently located in regard to my house, I will defintely keep eating at this place and do take aways!

5-10 minutes away from my house.
Been here countless times.

Firstly, the restaurant's location is pretty difficult to find for any outsiders.

Secondly, it is a bar cum restaurant, and we have to cross the bar before the restaurant section which is a depraved system when vising with family.

Thirdly, the staff! You need to wait for 5-10 mins for them to come and take your order.

Ambiance is quite ordinary.

Food is average at best. 

Indian Breads section is average and from the Indian Khazana section, Kababs are not good. 
Biriyani is a big letdown and shouldn't be tried!
Chinese Snacks are nicely made all together.

A below average restaurant overall in this area!


Recommended only you want to drink with some snacks.

This is another small restaurant in gora bazar where everything is low. The ambience is not that good, but for the air conditioner. The service is another drawback.  We waited for about ten minutes for the waiter to fetch us the menu. Even the prices are low, who serves chow at just 50rs these days anymore? The food quality is low, like street food. Even liquor cost is low which most people visiting this place opt for. The number of people who have reviewed this place is low,so obviously even my rating is low.
