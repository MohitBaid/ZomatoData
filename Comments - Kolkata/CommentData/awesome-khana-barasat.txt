So so experience it was.. I have ordered their non veg combo containing veg rice,garlic chicken and chicken dramstick.. And definitely i have to say that the salad showing on their list, was missing..chicken was fresh.. delivery was not too time taking..and obviously you can check their combo once..

Just loved the budget friendly small food joint.During my university days was a regular visitor of this place. Tried almost all of the snacks here.. chicken tikka kebab, kasuri chicken leg fry were delicious. But chicken roast was average in taste. Mixed hakka noodles deserves special mention.. noodles were full of egg and chicken and it was the best hakka noodles at such a pocket friendly price.. egg chicken gravy noodles, fried rice,chilli chicken all the Chinese dishes were very tasty.. mutton biriyani was also superb. egg chicken roll was not upto the mark.. though the seating area was small with 4-5 tables but food quality was great and service was prompt.

We ordered paneer momo and vegetable chowmein from this outlet today. They called up to say that paneer momo wasn't available and recommended paneer pakodas. We didn't know where their outlet was. Honestly, we expected stale food, bad service and tiny portions after going through the reviews. But surprisingly, the delivery boy was at the door within 30 min and the packaging was quite neat.

Recieved a packet of chowmein, a packet of 6 paneer pakodas, tomato ketchup, cucumber+onion+green chilli+lime salad. Everything was fresh and piping hot. The chowmein was loaded with vegetables and properly cooked. The pakodas- huge chunks of paneer dipped in spiced batter and deep fried were really good. We actually regretted ordering the paneer pakodas since just the chowmein was too much for us! The portions are more than enough for two so don't order too much for a meal for two people. There are some negative reviews so there is no way of  knowing how good/bad they are.

Pocket pinch for two-
Vegetable chowmein - INR 40
Paneer pokodas - INR 120
Packaging and delivery - INR 30
Total - INR 190

Rubbish!!
Total waste of money . Gave rotten chicken.. Denying that as well.. Took full price. Not at all good.. They should work on their food quality and staffs.. 
The staffs were also having lunch with the cistomers.

Nice little food joint, nothing extra ordinary but worth a visit if you are in Barasat. Located beside the iconic Arpita Mukhorochok at Chapadali More, Barasat. Very pocket friendly and reflects the suburban feel of the town.
