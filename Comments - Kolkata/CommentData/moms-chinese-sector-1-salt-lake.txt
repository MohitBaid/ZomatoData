If u want to pass long time with friends, family or with gf then CC1 Hangout is one of the best places in salt lake. Foods are also available in cheap rates so dont go with quality. Environment is awesome.

While the chilly chicken was well done and so was the egg Hakka chow mien. The egg wrap fried rice was very disappointing. But such is the quality of food in entire hangout I believe. You can hangout but not enjoy great food.

I really don't know why this place has such low reviews. However my friends and I found this place when we were ravenous in city centre 1. It offered us reasonable combo meals which appealed at that time. One combo had chicken noodles(with an omelette on top), shanghai chicken and chicken manchurian(4). And the other had chicken fried rice, chicken drum sticks(3) and chilli chicken (4). They also included chicken noodle soup which was yum! As well as salad and french fries with ketchup. All these at like 550 bucks, which I thought to be cheap at a place like CC. The staff was friendly and cooperated with our fickle-mindedness. In my opinion, if you are looking five-star dining then this will surely disappoint. But it's good for a light snack with friends, at an affordable price. At least it was for me.

I had been here on Bengali new year. Naturally like others, I went in expecting some really soul satisfying Chinese. What I got in return was dilapidated chicken which was begging not to be eaten.  Do something about the quality before it's too late. :)

Among lots of options in Hangout we chose this as we were craving for some Chinese food and they didn't disappoint us at all. Food quantity is more than sufficient. We ordered crispy chilly baby corn, one rice item, two noodles and two chicken dishes and the bill was around 1k only.

Hangout CC1 is still the best foodcourt in the city as far as pocket friendly food is concerned. This outlet is one of the few serving filling items at reasonable rates. The combos are good value for money. Although the taste is not that great like 49. If you are really hungry order from them. Or else it would be tough to finish their food as it becomes really monotonous after the initial few spoons.
