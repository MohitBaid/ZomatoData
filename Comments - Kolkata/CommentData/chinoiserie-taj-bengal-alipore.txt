The best place in town to have authentic chinese and cantonese food. The dishes are prepared in authentic style by master chef Lien. Even the presentation of the dishes are perfect. The prices of the dishes are on a higher note. The ambience and decor is perfectly done according to the theme. Its worth comming here to dine out.
An awesome fine dining restaurant.

I have enjoyed food here for a long time but lately I felt that the food served is no more a reflection of the standards that Taj holds itself up to.
I ordered scallops that were served cold and under cooked. The gravy around it was not cooked either. It had under cooked flour in it which was so distasteful that it spoilt the entire experience for me.
The water chestnuts were overcooked and unnecessarily spicy.
Soft shell crabs ..... batter fried could be better.
Fish poached in a soy and ginger sauce was served with a garnish of coriander. As much as I love coriander, i didnot know what to make of the coriander and ginger and soy combination.
I feel there is definitely scope for Chinoiserie to improve their food, given that Taj has always had an array of very able chefs. It is just a matter of minding the small things that can either mar or create a gratifying culinary experience.

Chinoiserie is one of the best restaurants for exquisite Chinese cuisine in Calcutta. The restaurant has an enthralling ambience with excellent interiors, delectable food, and heedful service. A fine dining restaurant in the city, starting from the ambience to the food to the customer service, everything is amazing. Since we were tired of having non-vegetarian, this time we decided to try out their Vegetarian menu. Surprisingly we savoured every bit of it. The food was light and of admirable quality. The entire dinner was cooked to perfection.Would like to recommend their1. Crunchy Broccoli with Corn Kennels Sui Mai, which was full of flavour and an extraordinary taste. 2. Spicy Lemon Garlic Vegetable Broth: The soup was nice and light with sufficient veggies and the flavour of lemon was accurate. 3. Burnt Garlic Rice and Golden broccoli and corn: Lovely non-sticky rice, perfectly blend with burnt garlic that served well for our main course. This was savoured along with Golden Broccoli and corn in Hoisin Sauce. The prices are on the steeper side, but if you want some authentic Chinese with some great taste in Kolkata, this is one of the places to visit. Fantastic Chinese food whose taste remained for long, and whose experience will surely last forever.

This place needs no introduction. I had been to almost all the good chinese joints before visiting this place and it did justice to my expectation.

Right from the ambiance to the staff everything will make you feel special and the food is just awesome.

I tried the Pan fried chilli fish on the starters and it was too tasty, along with it tried the seafood soup which I believe I had such a lovely and refreshing one after a long time. On the main course had the chilli pork which was brilliant. 

The pocket pinch may be more, but if you want some authentic chinese with some great taste in Kolkata, this is one of the places to visit.

Here as it was my first time, I asked for suggestion from the server. Crackling spinach and baby pork ribs with sweet chilly sauce, followed by the egg wrapped rice and guju chicken. These turned out to be the comfort food and I sincerely am going back for these. Love these place. Now for a detailed review, crackling spinach is something, which arguably, was introduced to Kolkata food scenario by this place. And, I can easliy understand, why it's still one of the most selling dishes here. The chopped spinach was perfectly crispy while retaining its flavor. The baby pork ribs was another beauty, I must say. While, the egg wrapped fried rice was subtle, the pan fried noodles made up for it, and probably one of the best I've ever eaten anywhere. 

Overall, definitely recommended.

Chinoiserie is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the city. 
The flavours are delicate, far removed from the “Indian” Chinese one is used to, and the vegetarian menu has a lot more options than what has been shared online. Besides, they are happy to customise your order as per preferences. 
The ambiance is soothing and while their service is sluggish, the dining experience here is always enjoyable.

A restaurant of this stature is supposed to be having an absolutely brill ambience and service, which Chinoiserie definitely has. It is all a regal affair. 

Coming to the food. What I ordered was : 

Butter Chilli Garlic Prawn - if you have been a fan of golden fried prawns so far, you will not go back to them after having this. For sure. 

Sweet Corn Soup with Crabmeat - the best I have had. 

North Atlantic Scallop In Ginger Spring Onion Sauce - this is the ONLY place here in kolkata serving scallops and they are amazing. 4 well cooked scallops in a light sauce is what will steal your heart. 

Chicken in Plum Sauce - fell in love with it. But if chicken with a sweet sauce is not your thing then do not go for it. The plum sauce is really sweet but in just the right manner. 

Their special fried rice - so nice and fragrant. 

Stir fried noodles - an absolute delight. 

Almond pudding - so dauntily made. But the portion is too small. It will fill your heart but not your stomach. 

Running back there again. FOR SURE.

Chinoiserie is my favourite haunt for excellent Chinese cuisine in Calcutta. The food is delectable the service is attentive and the ambience is soothing. 

On my birthday we went to Chinoiserie for dinner and had an excellent meal. The starters were a Prawn Dimsum Crispy Chilli Babycorn and an excellent portion of Peking Duck crisp and tender at the same time.

The main course was Hakka Chowmein, Exotic vegetables in Hot Garlic sauce Trio of Mushrooms sautéed and Lobster in Chilli Oyster Sauce. 

The entire meal was cooked to perfection. They even brought out a delicious Birthday cake on the house. My compliments to the Chef. I can't wait to go back!

Date of Visit – 12/05/2017

Location – Located in Alipore area, it a part of Taj hotels.

Ambience –  The interiors are excellent. The seating arrangements included round, square & rectangle tables with cushioned chairs or sofa.

Service – The Service was good. The staffs were courteous, well-informed and guided us with what to order.

Food & Description – It was a casual dinner with family and friend. I had a 20 % discount voucher which was expiring soon. So decided to try it before I loose the offer. Chinoiserie was on my wishlist for a long time after hearing so much about the amazing Chinese food they serve. I will say my experience was not that great but it was not that bad either. Coming to the food :

Kimchi Salad – Kimchi salad is cabbage soaked in the flavours of garlic, ginger, soya sauce, vinegar and chilli flakes. It had a perfect flavour. It came as complimentary with the dinner.

Cucumber & Carrot Salad – It was tasty. It was a perfect munchies till the starters arrived. It also came as complimentary with the dinner.

Trio of Mushroom Pepper Salt – I am a mushroom lover and for me mushrooms can never go wrong. This dish was also not an exception either and had an amazing flavour. Recommended for mushroom lovers.

Spicy Onion Pancake – This dish was something different. Never tried this anywhere else. I loved the flavours of it. Highly Recommended.

Crispy Tofu with Sichuan Spice – The tofu was perfectly fried and frispy. The spices were excellent and gave wonderful taste to it. Recommended.

Burnt Garlic Fried Rice - Fried rice was average. Burnt garlic flavour was not coming that much. 

Three Flavoured Noodles - Noodles were bland. Not much flavour. Not recommended.

Devil's Choice - Devil's Choice was excellent. It has some good exotic vegetables. Recommended.

Pan Fried Noodles - Another disappointing dish. It was totally bland. Not recommended.

Cool Tropicana - It tasted more like a cough syrup. Highly disappointing Mocktail. Though replaced it with virgin mojito which was great.

Ginger Brew - It was a respite after not so good experience of main course. Well made Mocktail. Absolutely refreshing.

Overall the experience was average. Service was very good. Starters were excellent but was followed by below average main course. Paying such a high price for an average dish is disappointing. It may b an odd day for them. Have eaten much better Chinese main course elsewhere.

Pocket Pinch - 2800 for 2 approx.(before discount)

Went there last week. 

Service & Staff - highly understaffed. I wouldnt say he was rude but our particular waiter seemed to be in a hurry taking our order. Let down considering it was TAJ. Im from Chennai I'm a regular at Golden Dragon, Taj Coromandel so I know to a fair extent what to expect when it comes to the Brand of Taj. However i was Disappointed with Chinoiserie at Taj Bengal. 

Food - Order the the following (Only vegetarian)
Crispy / Chilli potato - Good
Trio of mushroom - Average
Fried rice - They recommended this but I found this very ordinary.
Schezwan noodles - This however was VERY good.

In my opinion when you're paying mainly for the ambiance and expecting the the food to be top notch and you're disappointed with both it then no point giving it more than 3 out of 5.

Would I go there again - No

One of the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata, with a calm music, serving top quality authentic Chinese dishes. It was one of my most memorable dinner, on a special romantic date. We had ordered for sweet corn Soup, American corn pepper salt in starters, Veg. haka noodles and veg potato corn in hot and garlic sauce. But they served us wrong, they had served us chicken, I was shocked to see the pieces as it didn't seemed as potato at all. But then the staff said several times sorry, and changed our plates. Food was delicious. 
We got a cake from the restaurant, it was yummy. Arranges by my sister.

Why ? I mean why would they serve such food. 
The quest to find the best Asian food in kolkata made me try this place at the first place, as it was the most talked about Asian restaurant here. I was taken aback by the kind of food they served on my plate. 
The food was nothing more than the street side Chinese, I mean there are far many Chinese restaurants that serve better food and are not even so heavy on the pocket. It was so disappointing the entire experience especially the food. The quality of the food I would not comment on but the flavours and preparation was lacking everything it should have had to be just good.
Everything we ordered from starts to main course to the desserts was far below average and me and my family sure would never want to visit the place again.

Chinoiserie is one of the most revered Chinese resturants in Kolkata. More so as its in Taj and seems to be a very favorite places of many people I know. 

In Short : Unfortunately, for me Chinoiserie was a downer at all fronts and it was a very ordinary experience. The rating here seems veryy exaggerated based on my own experience. 

Occasion : It was my better halves first outing in a long long time and more so after the delivery of our first baby. :-) 

Positives : 

1. 1+1 offer on Black & White whisky thanks to EazyDiner. 

Negatives : 

1. Service is very poor, only one person was on the floor to take orders for all tables. They seem to have hired newbies for servings and their first day seem to be on our visit. 

2. Food is astonishly very average. 

3. Super rip-off, set us back by about 5k. 

Location : Taj Bengal, Alipore, Kolkata

Ambiance : Average for a 5-star that too Taj. It felt like a dead place. Hardly any vibrant vibe, the staff also didn't help much. We were given a table in the side, may be that was the reason. 

Service : As mentioned above, very poor. 

Food : What we ordered in Veg -

1 Soup - Coriander Lemon Soup (Rs. 550) : So very ordinary with nothing good about to justify the price. 

1 Starters -  Veg Spring Roll (Rs. 900) : Embarrisingly bland and bad. A street side chinese joint can serve much better Spring Rolls. 

Main Course : 

1 Tsing Potato (Rs. 975) : Decent, meal saving as Potato goes with anything. 

1 Wok Tossed Wheat Noodle (Rs. 750) : To be fair, this was good and inspite of being Wheat Noodles it didnt feel so and was tasting like usual Noodles. 

1 Darshaan-Honey (Rs. 600) : Decent, nothing great. 

Portions : Chinese portions are usually big, but here it was fit for two of us and we are NOT very big-eaters. 

Total Tab - Rs. 4549 (excluding the drinks bill of Rs. 477). After a long time I really felt bad paying this much and not enjoying the meal. 

Concluding Words : Chinoiserie is not worthy of a repeat for sure and not worthy a visit even for those who have not visited yet. Many better places like Mainland China, Asia Kitchen, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, etc exist. 

Should you visit : No.

We celebrated my birthday here recently and I must admit it was one of my most memorable lunches. We ordered a variety of soup, starters and everyone enjoyed them. The spicy seafood soup and lemon garlic broth and mushrooms starter were particularly good. 

The main course was even better and the schezwan fried rice deserves a special mention. 

We got a birthday cake from the restaurant and I don't remember having a better chocolate cake in a long time. I think they should have this on the menu for days you are not celebrating your birthday :)

Chinoiserie is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Calcutta serving top quality authentic Chinese dishes. My experience each time keeps getting better! 

Starters worth mentioning were the chefs special cheese balls and the lotus steam with wild pepper along with the asparagus and silken tofu soup. For the mains we stuck to the authentic chilli garlic noodles and exotic vegetables in Hunan sauce. Lastly the darsaan was also quite amazing!

Chinoiserie has always been my favourite Chinese restaurant. The food is light, smooth and of superior quality. 
We ordered the mushroom dimsums, crackling spinach, lotus stem , devil's choice , tofu in black bean sauce, red rice, fried rice and chilli garlic noodles. 
First of all , chinoiserie will serve two complimentary salads - one kimchi and one in chili vinegar. I absolutely love their kimchi salad, it's tangy with a lot of garlic ; the other salad is good too. 
Coming to the starters, the dimsums were basically sui mai and had finely chopped and sautéed mushrooms of various kinds. The dimsum wrap was soft and well steamed. They provided chili sauce with it and a side of chopped green onions in oil. They all tasted good. The crackling spinach was crispy and sweet, and the lotus stem was cut into very thin slices and fried. All in all very good. 
Main course - the chilli garlic noodles were thick and full of flavour. The fried rice was also good. The red rice was something I had never tried here. It was cooked rice with its coating , which was soft and delicious. The devil's choice had an array of vegetables in an orange and spicy sauce. The tofu in black bean sauce was something I loved. The tofu was unbelievably soft and it was smeared by a thick black bean sauce , with its characteristic fermented taste and smell. They provided burnt garlic as a garnishing too. 
We had also ordered soup - hot and sour and lemon garlic broth. I had the lemon garlic broth and it was amazing. There was dominance of kaffir lime in a thick broth with a variety of vegetables. 
For desserts we all had the coconut ice cream and the rose ice cream. The coconut ice cream had chunks of coconut tender in it which made it very wholesome. The rose ice cream was something very different and new. Its an off the menu item. Looking at the consistency it seemed as though it was hand churned. The taste filled the entire mouth with the flavour of rose and the ice cream was perfect in sweetness. It was the perfect way to end the meal as it also acted as a mouth freshener. 
Coming here after so many years made me feel that the quality of this place may have gone down. But fortunately it hadn't. It's the best place for Chinese food and you must eat here.

The bill....frankly speaking was very reasonable considering the ambience, the service and the quality of food and considering the fact that this was The Taj.

One of my favourite Chinese restaurant's in Kolkata.Excellent ambience and staff service.When it comes to food,the quality and taste is fantastic.Last night we tried chilli fish along with fried spinach and eggplant in plum sauce for starters.All the starters were great but the fried spinach could've been better.For main course,we had lamb in soya sauce,spare ribs with cashew nuts and chilli ,prawns with ginger spring onion sauce along with fried rice and Hakka noodles.Everything was great but the spare ribs were disappointing as there was alot of fat and the meat was tougher than usual.All over it was a good experience,will keep on visting.

Many would not agree but the very few times I have been here has always been very disappointing. 

Today was quite a nightmare. From Stewart's to the quality of food and more importantly the behavior of all the service staff. Beyond imagination.  Will never feel like going again.

PS. So the signature dish "Chilli Garlic Noodles " was needed to be returned twice and still came back half uncooked and with a strong pungent of raw garlic back to our table.

A gentleman named Debahish should be kicked out of the Taj Hotel & Resorts.  I wish my experience was such to refrain using such  harsh words but he deserves much more than this. Infact I had another stewart named Raven. He seems too clever for his shoes as well and spoke more than needed. 

An uncooked ramen once again served with just addition of some red sweet sour sauce does not make it eatable again .

Meant for daily and regulars . No more a friendly walk in place.

PS. So the signature dish "Chilli Garlic Noodles " was needed to be returned twice and still came back half uncooked and with a strong pungent of raw garlic back to our table.

A gentleman named Debahish should be kicked out of the Taj Hotel & Resorts.  I wish my experience was such to refrain using such  harsh words but he deserves much more than this. Infact I had another stewart named Raven. He seems too clever for his shoes as well and spoke more than needed. 

An uncooked ramen once again served with just addition of some red sweet sour sauce does not make it eatable again .

Meant for daily and regulars . No more a friendly walk in place.

I visited his iconic Chinese restaurant at the Taj Bengal with my brother and sister in law. Because, they worked in the hotel for many years, the staff just didn't take an order but brought their favourite dishes. The seafood starters were absolutely fantastic and probably the best I've had in a long time. The main course comprising of rice, noodles and a lamb dish was excellent. Strongly recommend a visit to this restaurant for visitors in Cal!

A classy place...we hosted a dear friend's birthday lunch here.

Overlooking the beautiful blue pool we had a 4 course meal.

No complains.

Footnote: The eggless cake which I designed myself and ordered from the hotel bakery was delicious.

One of the finest Chinese restaurant in the heart of Kolkata needs not much of introduction.
There is so much intricate precision about the decor , the service and the food.
The fine crockery , cutlery , service defines the fine dining experience.
Food experience has been great too
The crab babycorn soup - its out of the world. Shredded crab meat and babycorn tasted perfect in a soup
Lat me kai chicken was soft , succulent and tasted good.
Prawn butter - the prawns were good in size and well batter fried being essentially soft and crispy.
Chilli Fish - a bit spicy.. balanced the prawn batter well and was cooked really well

In  main course we tried 
Non veg fried rice - nothing much to describe about it. It was good
Malha chicken - shredded pieces of chicken in a whitish gravy with red chilly flakes was a good combination with the rice
Overall a fine dining experience. Would love to visit again.

Today after a long gap went to my favourite restaurant, Chinoiserie.

We ordered for Veg manchow soup..exotic vegetables in black bean sauce, potato in mustard sauce, burnt ginger fried rice and veg Hakka noodles.

Lemme tell you the vegetables were full of flavour and extraordinary taste. Loved the food as usual and service at its best!

dining at chino is a delight!!

It has been almost a month since I dined there but now that I've got the time I'll try and do justice in my review of Chinoiserie.. I am a regular at the buffet but never went to chinoiserie which is just next door so I thought I should give it a try ..
White Windows, nicely laid out tables and I got down to have the following :
Lat Mai Kai which is the popular one, crunchy chicken with a garlic flavour . I liked it 
Next I went for the traditional crispy golden friend prawns . One thing for sure is that I always prefer to have something crispy /crunchy as my starters.. 
Okay then comes the prawn hakao dimsum (we all know Chinese dining can never be complete without dimsum) I liked the thin, glossy skin and the stuffing was devine🤗🤗.. 
I thought I was ready to go until I saw a couple having something very temping on the next table, I learnt that is the tenderloin and shiitake quick tossed with fresh red chillies( don't stare at people's food because it is rude but I can't stop doing this🙄..)
That was it I asked for the check before I ordered more .. I'll come again when I have someone kind enough to take me because it burnt a hole in my pocket!!! 
PS : Go on/after payday 😊😊

This has been quite a legend in the premium Chinese cuisine category in Calcutta for a long time and rightly so. The place is as sophisticated as it can get and you are sure to be spending some top money dining here. 
The service no doubt is impeccable 
Tried a few things:

Lat Mei Kai - the chicken was perfectly crunchy and thats why you could eat them but personally it was not over the top awesome for me. The spicy garlic sauce made it better

Salt&Pepper Lotus Stem - again very well cooked but not a go crazy kind of dish.

Schezwan Whole wheat noodles - delicious noodles. Flavorful to the fact that you could eat it without any curry

Mongolian Chicken- probably one of the best chicken gravy dishes I have had. It went so well with the noodles. Sure could have eaten a bowl of it.

This place has been in my wishlist for so long. Everytime I searched for this place on Zomato, the big white French windows and the sitting area by it always attracted me and I thought of coming here all the time.
It was a very special lunch on last Tuesday when I thought of coming here. And I must say that I wasn't disappointed at all, rather all my expectations were fulfilled thoroughly.
Chinoiserie has got a variety of range in their menu. Decorated beautifully, I was attracted by the French windows. Though I didn't get a chance to sit there as all of the sitting arrangements in that part were for more than 6 persons and we were just two in number.
The ambience is classy and elegant. The lampshades, the colonial railings, the milky white tablecloths and also the cutlery - everything made the whole saga even more complete. I absolutely adored it.
The food was perfect. I loved it like anything. There were so many types of dimsums. My friend who is a big dimsum fan got too excited about this. We had ordered the Prawn and Crabmeat Shao Mai with Fish Roe and Pork Chinkao dimsums for starters. For the maincourse, there was Chinoiserie Special Fried Rice with Prawn and XO along with Hangzhou Green Pepper Tenderloin and Stir Fried Pork in Chilli Sweet Bean Sauce. In mocktails, there were Water of Paradise and Watermelon Cooler.
The prawn and crabmeat shao mais were extremely delicious. They were so soft from inside and separate flavours of prawn and crabmeat could be devoured. The reddish orange fish roe on top looked exactly like a cherry upon the cake and it seemed to be the same. Loved it when you put the same inside your mouth and it popped off after a while. The pork chinkao too was very delicious. The covering was so soft and thin. The pork tasted too good. I think the whole concept of dimsums goes best with pork and Chinoiserie has proved it to me once again.
Now comes the main course. The fried rice was so good. Ample amount of prawns in each spoonful bite, tender yet well cooked. The XO sauce went so well with the rice that I simply fell in love with it. The tenderloin was extremely tasty. It was soft and the sauce blended so well with it. Thanks to Mrs Dipika who helped us with the selection and serving throughout. It was her special suggestion to us and it impressed us. Even the pork was good. Stir fried and the sauce tasted pretty good. I must also thank the chef who had sent in some sweet garlic sauce on hearing that I love sweet and tangy things.
Portions were of normal standards in the maincourse, fair enough to share between two adults. I even thought that the pork was extra when it got a bit difficult to finish the dish. But the dimsum portion was a bit less - only four in each plate.
The mocktails were very good. Water of Paradise had freshly cut fruits and sparkling water in it along with lime juice. It tasted kinda different from what I have had earlier. Watermelon Cooler, my all time favourite was also fantastic. Made with fresh watermelon and lime juice, it was extremely good.
I always thought that having a meal over here would be more than perfect. Starting from the entrance, the ambience, the staff courtesy, the food, the drinks everything was so perfect matching to each and everything that I expected it to be like.
This place obviously has a much higher pocket pinch than other places. I would say it is definitely recommended if you're ready to splurge on a special meal with your special someone on a special day. They serve really good food and the ambience is like heaven! I am loving it. Absolutely. You will love it too! Happy Dining! :)

Class Apart! That's what Chinoiserie is. Beautiful Chinese chandelier, dim lighting, soft soothing music & a view of the pool (If you are lucky to get the particular table)!!! Therefore Ambiance/Decor gets 4.5/5.

Service: Flawless. The staff is trained to delight you! 5/5.

Food: Being a Taj Bengal intern, I had the privilege to taste most of the dishes of Chinoiserie & other in-house restaurants.  I am listing down the must have's. All the following items get 4.5-5/5.

Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Lat Me Kai, Wok Tossed Suid, Lotus Stem with Sichuan wild pepper, Shredded chicken noodle soup, Prawn in Sichuan sauce, Wok tossed chicken, Chinoiserie Fried rice with prawn & shrimp paste, Baked Cheesecake.

Apart from these you must try the dumplings. I do not like dumplings, so I have never tasted the same.

Portion is good. Price: Again, Reasonable. Considering it's a 5* property.

Fantastic Chinese food coupled with the Taj Hospitality sums ups the Chinoiserie experience. A meal whose taste lingers on for long and an experience that lasts forever.

I would recommend starting the the meal with a flavourful but extravagant soup which had noodles, veggies and meat. For starters it could be the open faced steamed Sui Mai with their specials sauces and spicy pan fried fish.  The sichuan fried rice and Tsing Hoi potatoes with cashews was a perfect combination. The fiery rice was well balanced with the tangy sauce of the potatoes. There are endless options for both vegetarian and non vegetarian chinese cuisine lovers.

Every meal is a culinary journey ending in a destination called delight. Chef Lian, who has been there almost a decade is a true legend who has the wonderful ability of identifying traditional Chinese that is best suited for the Indian pallet ! 

The legendary Taj hospitality is an added bonus !!!

Visited Sunday last for an early dinner. The decor was ravishing and elegant and the staff were courteous and helpful. Tried a few dishes like tofu and spicy onion pork and devil's fish along with fried rice and Hakka noodles for main course. Just a soft shell crab and a sort of chicken for starters and a hot and sour soup. All the food was top notch except the tofu which had This weird , sweet flavour . Overall, a very satisfying experience and though it's a pocket pincher, will sure be back in near future. Highly recommend. Cheers.!

Chinoiserie is much like its name. 
Chinoiserie is much like its name being named most probably after the Chinoiserie style of western art. A bad remake of an ancient cuisine . While it's a perfectly pleasant break to eat kolkata Chinese food in places in  tangra .
I do not approve of it being served to me at a five star (Had to sell essential organs to afford ) joint.  The menu seems to be modeled on American Chinese take out but is devolved further  to tomato-esq sauce pumped full of sodium glutamate on steroids .

Hotel restaurants have a tough standard to follow because they are 30-50% more expensive and should represent the star rating of the hotel it belongs to. What I experienced was horrendous. Slowest service since the birth of restaurant dining; one hour from ordering to receiving starters, vegetarians and non-vegetarians received their food at 10 min interval difference creating awkward moments of waiting and watching other ppl eat, 1.5 hours to refill water, and a further 30 min wait between starters and mains. Food itself was amazingly bad. The skins of the dumplings were too doughy and not pleasant to eat. The fillings were stale. Kung pao chicken was alright but for the price they are charging I expected much much MUCH better. Everything else we had, from the Tsing Hoi potato to the hakka noodles, were difficult to eat. In sum, not worth the time and definitely not worth the money.

The ambience of this place is amazing. Interestingly, it is inversely related to the quality of the food. This place serves one of the worst examples of Chinese food in Kolkata. The only points that it deserves are due to the dressing of the food and the above mentioned ambience. On top of that, considering the price it makes little sense to visit this place.

The ambience of this place is amazing. Interestingly, it is inversely related to the quality of the food. This place serves one of the worst examples of Chinese food in Kolkata. The only points that it deserves are due to the dressing of the food and the above mentioned ambience. On top of that, considering the price it makes little sense to visit this place.

Chinese options are many in Calcutta. Good food served by good people in a good ambience comes at a bit of premium. It's worth it. I didn't like a kind of noodles and they immediately changed it with a new one without a fuss. Love that.

I had heard about Chinoiserie serving the best chinese in Kolkata, well it so is true!! We started off with crackling spinach, super yummy ofcourse, and then moved onto the main course directly. We had lamb in blackbean sauce and poached fish in a white garlic sauce with burnt garlic rice. The Lamb was stunning, phenomenal and much more. The sauce was tangy and black beany :) but the lamb was melt in the mouth. I could not figure out if the lamb was softer or the poached fish!! I usually refrain from ordering lamb in Chinese preps since they tend to be chewy, but needless to say if i go back to Chinoiserie this one shall be my staple favorite. The fish was predictably good, you cant go wrong with poached fish and garlic can you?! The burnt garlic rice was a good version of our favourite. I give my thumbs up to this place for sure! Going to go there with a greater appetite and more adventurous palate next time!!

Such a brilliant restaurant this is within the Taj Bengal. Usually I prefer street food as opposed to eating at these fancy places as they are overrated more often than not. But the story with Chinoiserie @the Taj in Kolata is very different. The food is excellent. Its been over a week since I have eaten there but I just cant get over how good the food was. Usually Indianized Chinese food has over the top flavor with a lot of aginomoto and all the shenanigans. However, I got the Sichuan style wheat noodles Veg, The Spicy Malha Veg Fried Rice and Chruchy Green Veggies & Shitake in Zesty Black Bean Sauce and this was by far the most tasty and flavorful chinese I have had in a long while.

Chinoserie is so hit and miss ... On some days the service is just right, but on other days it is so poor that you will feel you are sitting in the the restaurant of three star hotel in small town India praying that the waiter has mercy on you.

When we dine at a restaurant like Chinoserie, a certain minimum level of service is expected and when even that is missing, it cheeses me off big time. Things like, waiting for the menu, or crushed ice, or for you drinks, or for having your order taken for upwards of 15 mins is just not done. And having to repeatedly ask for Sichuan sauce ... that's sacrilege.

These guys must go across to see what stand alone restaurants around the city are doing at half the price point.

I am definitely wishing adieu to this restaurant.

Starters were outstanding! Sparkling Spinach & corn kernels - rocked with the chilli paste. Shittake was well prepared with the greens in black been sauce. 

On the whole - worth it, I used up all my points so that was icing on the cake.

We were set of 15+ people who had come to this place on a Monday to celebrate. We started off with some wine - Sauvignon. And had asked the service people there to help us with the starters and the food.  For vegetarians, they suggested the following - 1. Brocolli Sui Mai
2. Stir Fried Crispy Okra

For the non-vegetarians, the suggested dishes were - 1. Pan Fried Chilli Fish
2. Crispy Golden Prawns

For the main course, we had the following - 1. Fried Rice
2. Steamed Noodles
3. Kung Pao Chicken

Overall, the food was decent, not very inspiring. The service was excellent. Our wine glasses and plates were never empty. With regards to the ambiance, it was very nice but the place was too small, very compact. A little space would have been better. The music too was uninteresting as I am not able to recall as to what they were playing. But all of us had good fun, helped by the alcohol and the excitement. 

Good to go for a one time thing. Hope to explore the other restaurants in the Taj Bengal soon in the future.

Well the ambience does not need to be commented on along with courtesy shown by the staff. Thank you.

Went there for Ashtami dinner with family and enjoyed every bit of it.

Firstly the crowd was light!

Food was brilliant and particularly the Boiled Pork with 5 spices needs special mention. Perfectly cooked and probably one of the best Pork preparations that I had in the recent past. Juicy and succulent. Will go back for this again.....and again

The Konje Lamb was perfectly crispy. The Pan Fried Noodles was awesome.

Overall a lovely experience.

Remember to carry a coat or blazer. It's pleasantly chilly :-)

I love the Taj and after years had a chance to come here. We chose Chinoiserie to celebrate a birthday. The birthday lady loves chinese and wanted to come here for a long time.
It was worth our time and money. No words for ambience, as it is the Taj. The staff were extremely warm and co-operative. 
The chicken rice cracker lemon soup was the lightest yet the most delicious chinese soup we ever had.
The starters from scallops to prawns were out of the world. The mains lamb and chicken curries and fried rice were so delicate and delicious and absolutely non-greasy!
The Taj is always outstanding in terms pf deserts, bakery and sweet tooth offerings! And here we had a delicious hot chocolate spring roll along with a yummy complimentary birthday cake! (The waiter came to know about the occasion being a birthday) 
It was a grand meal yet not over done! 
Expensive as expected and once in a while indulgence-worth experience! 
Wah Taj!

Authentic Chinese ambiance with a hint of modernist luxe. Personally, I love the feel the places offers. Being one of the city's favourite Chinese restaurants, Chinoiserie has been cooking up quite the storm. Worth going to for a date, as well as with family and friends.
The service is exemplary. 
NOTE: Presentation is great, but nothing out of the ordinary or unique. Thus presentation points have suffered. 

•Kim chi
The famous oriental cabbage amouse bouche. Usually one of the best available in the city. This time however, I sensed a little space for improvement. 
PS - AMOUSE BOUCHE is the dish served before the starters. Usually pre-served on every table. 
Taste - 3.8/5
Presentation - 3.7/5

•Corn Kernels Pepper Salt
Another name for American Corn Salt Pepper, if you're wondering. Chinese seasoned fried corn kernels. It's a classic starter dish, one you really cannot go wrong with.
Taste - 4.4/5
Presentation - 3.7/5


•Chilli Mountain Chicken
I personally recommend you to try this dish. It's a very flavourful starter dish. Dry Chilli chicken made in a different style with sweet chillies. It is also worth mentioning that Chinoiserie is the only place in Calcutta that serves this dish. 
Taste - 4.8/5
Presentation - 3.7/5

•Veg Pan Fried Noodles
A classic gravy noodle dish, widely available throughout all Chinese restaurants in the city. This variant was perfect. One of the best in Calcutta, I believe. If you like noodles, it would be a loss to not try this dish here.
Taste - 4.8/5
Presentation - 3.7/5

•Chef Special Chilli Chicken
If you're a Calcuttian, you'll understand that as a city, we obsess over chilli chicken. To many, Chinese is chilli chicken/fish with a rice/noodle dish. 
The restaurant doesn't have the dish in it's menu. However, the chef does curate his version of a chilli chicken if requested, and does quite the justice to it. We had requested a semi-gravy version to pass as a main course side dish.
Taste - 4/5
Presentation - 3.7/5

•Burnt Garlic Spring Onion Rice
The name says it all. We ordered a vegetarian version of it. Most of the fried rice dishes get oily and have such strong flavour that it takes away from the side vegetable/meat dish. This one hits the spot - less oily, the flavour is not in the face, and at the same time not absent entirely. When it comes to vegetarian rice dishes, this one is an all time favourite.
Taste - 4.6/5
Presentation - 3.7/5

If you're fond of Chinese cuisine, this is where you'd want to be. You're losing out if you haven't tried the place.

Specially the chocolate darsan which is worth mentioning as I never seen any restaurant serving chocolate darsan. Just want to mention one thing to the people who will visit this restaurant in future that the portions of the food will not suffice for the people with high apetite. Will love to visit this restaurant again n again.

This place has a lot of history for me. My parents have been taking me here since The Taj first opened up. And till a couple of years ago we would end up here every other week or so. And of course. All birthdays or any celebrations were always here. Sadly this year was not treated well on my birthday at all. The new staff that is in charge was rather rude. And after being told that it's my birthday celebrations didn't show the usual birthday celebrations that take place. Luckily. One of the older managers who knew me remembered and rectified the mistake. But it does feel sad that a place that you've chosen to make special for 20 years doesn't really care for it's older customers. Out with the old in with the new seems to be the motto these days. Ah well. 
Ps. The drums of heaven hasn't changed in the last twenty years. Which is the best thing about this place.

It definitely is on the expensive side but once u are dun with food u will find every penny spent worth it. Very gud options for vegeterians. The staff helps u out with your preferences and makes the food as u like it. Their corn & broccoli sui mai is higly recommended. All in all a must visit place for all.

My family's favourite Chinese restaurant in Kolkata.Period.

Same decor,same waiting,same craving for at least 25 years,more or less.

Lat me kai(spicy chicken pakoras),golden fried prawn for starters,the seafood coriander soup,the onion pork,prawn medium to big in Sichuan or hot garlic sauce,the lamb in black bean sauce,the chefs special mixed meat fried rice and the pan fried noodles it was today and like every time could not fault taste,quantity or quality.Issues with serving time which was inordinately long and of course like always it was expensive.

My point is simple now.Having straddled the Kolkata Chinese scene for a quarter decade isn't it time to reinvent itself,maybe have a regional Chinese provincial festival?Just a thought from a loyal customer

Having eaten many times here the problem is that this restaurant is not consistent and that is something you definitely expect from a reputed 5 star hotel restaurant which is also popular. Recently ate lunch here and was a bit disappointed. Did not get red rice and overall spinach lotus stem noodles rice vegetables was all decent but nothing great. I guess with these rates also I would prefer to go to red hot chilli pepper than here.

What can i say about this place.. a chinese restaurant in one of the most iconic hotels in our city if not the most iconic. Most of the dishes here are overtly delicious and the Chicken Lat Me Kai and Lung Fung soup are the pick of the lot among the starters and soups...everytime i come here i have these items. The staff here are extremely co operative and for people who are regular visitors they are ready to offer their utmost hospitality and care. Overall everything about the place is very satisfying...however, one thing i would like to point out is that the theme or ambience of the restaurant needs some overhauling as though there is nothing wrong with it, but it has been like this for quite sometime now...apart from this everything about this place is nothing but exquisitely beautiful and enjoyable!!

Having eaten many times here the problem is that this restaurant is not consistent and that is something you definitely expect from a reputed 5 star hotel restaurant which is also popular. Recently ate lunch here and was a bit disappointed. Did not get red rice and overall spinach lotus stem noodles rice vegetables was all decent but nothing great. I guess with these rates also I would prefer to go to red hot chilli pepper than here.

What can i say about this place.. a chinese restaurant in one of the most iconic hotels in our city if not the most iconic. Most of the dishes here are overtly delicious and the Chicken Lat Me Kai and Lung Fung soup are the pick of the lot among the starters and soups...everytime i come here i have these items. The staff here are extremely co operative and for people who are regular visitors they are ready to offer their utmost hospitality and care. Overall everything about the place is very satisfying...however, one thing i would like to point out is that the theme or ambience of the restaurant needs some overhauling as though there is nothing wrong with it, but it has been like this for quite sometime now...apart from this everything about this place is nothing but exquisitely beautiful and enjoyable!!

When you go to a Taj group restaurant, you have high expectations and I must say that the restaurant has managed to meet most of them. From ambience to service to food, everything was top notch. They pamper you from the moment you enter the hotel till the moment you leave. The servers strike the right balance between being attentive and being intrusive. Now coming to the food. Almost everything we ordered from the rice to the lamb to the fish to the toffee walnut dessert tasted awesome.

The one complaint I have is that considering the prices, the portions served are too small . The one dish I found underwhelming is the Peking duck. I have seen elsewhere that the Peking duck often forms the centerpiece of a muli-course meal with every part of the duck being utilized. The roast duck is sometimes carved up by the chef in front of the guests adding to the theater. But here you have none of those. The portions served were small and the pancakes not up to the mark. One expects much better from a fine dining restaurant charging such high prices. 

But overall a great experience and an evening well spent.

The fact that I was a guest at the Taj meant that I saw this restaurant every day.
In terms of the ambience the barely lit restaurant is adorned with Chinese art and crafts the tables have the basic revolving centre that many Chinese restaurants have.
The food was quite good with the duck and the lamb standing out. Their sweet and spicy noodles were outstanding. The jasmine tea was not that good I've had better. All in all it was an outstanding experience and i will be eager to return again.......... hungry for more.

Regarding the ambience, this is a place you may fall in love with. Minimal lighting, serene decor and quiet surroundings make this restaurant perfect for dinners when you don't want so oily and heavy food and don't want to get tired with the lights and noise. The food, obviously is awesome. The clear soups are a highlight of this place so you should really try it, be it veg or non-veg. The helping is not quite good, but you can't expect them to give you a sack of chow and rice. Now, back to the food. The fried noodles and garlic rice were very tasty and were in good quantity. But the chefs' culinary skills makes it so simple yet tasty that it doesn't feel hefty on your stomach. However, think twice about ordering the spring rolls as they were very oily. That is yhe reason they lost a 0.5 star. 
The waiters and staff were very friendly and they were very helpful in giving advice and things the way you want. Perhaps, they were the best restaurant staff I have ever met ! .And after all, the heavenly brownie is a must eat !

Must try sweet n sour prawns, crab meat onion soup, mix meat fried rice, pan fried chilli fish, shredded lamb in blackbean sauce etc. you can't go wrong ordering at this restaurant because they will assist you to pick the right dishes and wines to suit your palate. Very good staff and superb chefs make this my favourite restaurant in Kolkata to which I look forward to visit each time

Chinoiserie serves one of the best chinese cuisine in town and the standard has remained the same over the years. Good ambiance and equally good service which ofcourse is Taj Signature.  from soup to starters each and every dish is worth mentioning and the same for its main course. The portion is good and is sufficient for 3 pax. 
A must visit to taste chinese cuisine.

The highlight of this place was the Rabbit Meat which they used to serve! Don't know whether they serve it anymore. It's different. So you might want to ask for it in case you are visiting the place. Amongst all the Taj Hotels pan India, Chinoiserie has probably the largest range of items on their menu. And I have now been to many a Taj across India. Taj stands for a certain standard in their food - this place reflects the spirit and will never disappoint you.

This is one of the few places in Kolkata where I absolutely love chinese cuisine. One of the finest restaurants Taj Bengal has to offer, they serve some really good food. The sophisticated interior is stunning with soft colours and a wooden touch, this one just can't go wrong where good food is concerned. The corner tables offers view of the beautiful swimming grounds and is a visual treat.I love the fact that even when it's full the place remains quiet, which has become an essential part of my dining experience. I just can't tolerate supremely crowded and noisy places anymore. I have been visiting this place since my childhood and it has managed to remain a favourite till now.
Some of my personal favourite dishes are the Pan fried chilli fish and Lat Me Kai...the flavours are wonderful and it's like a mini carnival inside your mouth. The portions are also adequate for two to three people. Another all time family favourite would be the Butter Chilli Garlic Prawn, also their fried chicken wontons are a must try if you are craving for something deep fried with super delicious minced chicken filling, even the sui mai is great !I am completely biased towards this place and cannot find any fault with either with their food or with their service.
The chicken pan fried noodles, stir fried prawns, chinoiserie signature crispy konjee lamb shouldn't be missed if you are there ! Goo Loo chicken with it's sweet and sticky texture has been a childhood favourite!
Being located inside Taj Bengal, it is definitely not easy on the pockets, but it's a beautiful place if you are out on a date or just celebrating some special ocassions. The staff is highly experienced and goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable but does hover around much which is the best thing.
This place is highly recommended by me and I am sure whoever has been here once will only agree with me.

... I've been here for almost a year and a half and have tried the food almost everyday. Yes service feedback is something I get from you guys everyday so I have seen heaven and hell in the restaurant at the same time on opposite ends. Lol. It is definitely fascinating to run such a place, meet the hob knob of the city and take part in their lives, cause this is where families meet, deals get made and relationships nurtured. No matter what others say I do think the food is a class apart, not being biased but because I do eat around. People do comment that they have been to China and Hong Kong and the food is not the same, but then its a style of cooking that you come for and each chef has his own method of madness. I've tasted the best biryani from an auto driver in Agra, the best pizza from my mom at home, the best salad at the Baan Thai and the best cheesecake at a cafe coffee day. So it is but natural to compare.

One of the finest Chinese restaurants in the 5 star category in town. The ambience is warm,inviting and decor elegantly done. The table lay out is excellent and you have plenty of privacy inspite of the place often being full. Over the last three decades the place has grown from strength to strength and is one of my favorites,having enjoyed many  many  great dinners. The dishes are well prepared with ingrediants being fresh and well selected. The seafood is definately their forte as are some of the exotic vegetarian dishes.  Service is vintage Taj and ofcourse a bit pricey.  A great place to entertain business associates or have a quiet romantic twosome.. Would suggest discuss your desires with the steward and chef for a great meal.

Chinoiserie is one of the finest restaurants to go for luxury Chinese dining. The ambience sets the mood for a lovely evening with your loved ones and is undeniably lavish. The lo mein soup is delicious and is a must try and so is the spicy seafood soup. Also I loved the chicken pepper garlic noodles and the dry chili chicken and pan fried fish. The lat mein kai chicken is one of the best i have had in kolkata. They dishes compliment each other very well and it is delicious and lightly cooked. Also if you are in for experimenting with new food items, do try their red rice in mixed meat along with Mongolian chicken, it is delectable. Its fine dining indeed and its totally worth every dime. Loved it.

CHINOISERIE, Taj Bengal, is exemplar of the best Fine Dinning Oriental restaurant in Kolkata. The Master Chef is one of the finest chefs in town and  makes every meal here a meal to remember and cherish.

Ambience: The ambience is quite true to its name. The whole setting comprises of Chinese artifacts. You will be lost in an oriental journey with the calm and quite backdrop and to top it all the authentic Chinese music adds to the oriental aura.

Service: Impeccable. The attendants would pamper you with their attention to every minute detail.  One of the many reasons I visit this restaurant is their unparalleled service. It is in fact the best amongst all other Taj Bengal restaurants. 

Food: 

Butter Chili Garlic Prawn: Probably the best starter here and a must have for first timers. The prawns are juicy and the dry sauce makes it irresistible. I can eat it everyday and still not get bored. There are options of six moderately sized prawns or two jumbo sized ones but I always prefer the former. 

Dimsum: 
You can try their Wontons and Sui Mai with your preferred stuffing. Both taste absolutely heavenly and can’t skip this. I have tried their Chingkao but you can give it a miss, if you are not curious. 

Kung Pao Chicken: It’s the best here. The crunchiness of cashews along with the chicken makes it very interesting. Once again you can’t give this a miss. 

Noodles: Very high quality ingredients and can be made to your perfection. 

Desserts: Darsaan, Almond pudding, Toffee Walnut all tastes wonderful and served in a manner, which makes it irresistible. 

Price: Very Expensive. A full course meal for two with alcoholic beverages would set you back by around INR. 10000 including Jumbo Prawns

I came to Chinoiserie with very high expectations. People had spoken very highly of this restaurant and I thought the food wasn't as good as  people said it was. Some of the dishes we're  not up to the mark and needed a lot of improvement. For example, the Lemon Braised Chicken I ordered was like chicken in marmalade and was more like a dessert. Apart from that, the food took a little too long to arrive and wasn't worth the wait.  The pan fried noodles wasn't good. The Crispy Conjee Lamb was over fried and too crispy.

Looking at the positive side of things, the cake I ordered was very good  the Cantonese noodles and the Golden fried prawn was very good. The ambience of the restaurant was very good

I  wouldn't recommend Chinoiserie to others as the did wasn't great. Overall, wasn't very happy but Chinoiserie is a restaurant with a lot of potential.

One of the finest Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, Chinoiserie is becoming the foremost choice for authentic fare. The menu serves up, with excellent food and hospitality.

Vegetable Spring Roll, Crispy Corn Kernels, Trio of Mushroom Pepper Salt are great starters. The crispiness along with the right spices and sauce make them absolutely delightful. 
Moving onto the soups...Sichuan Noodle Soup and Spicy Lemon Garlic Vegetable Broth steal the show. They are not just stuffed with veggies and you will get the apt quantity.
For the main course, Potato Corn Mahlak and Green Asparagus are a must try. They will leave you wanting for more. The Singapore Rice Noodles with the above are a great combo.

Chinoiserie lives up to the reputation of the Taj Group with its exquisite cuisines and excellent customer orientation.

Came here after a long long time. But somewhere the nostalgia of the place was lost during the meal. While going there expectations where quite high awaiting to relive many memories with family some still here some a mere memory. 
The ambience though remains same along with the general decor but the appeal was lost on the body language of the waiters and their bad service. Exorbitant prices but the quantity has been drastically reduced nd not living up to it was the flavors. I felt I could have gotten this same food taste and all at half the price. Table set up was not at all as expected from a 5 star establishment. Water was served in large thin stemmed wine glasses. And the scotch glasses made me not want a drink. I have better glasses at home. All in all quite disappointing afternoon and worst of all their darsan was not at all like I remembered. Ironically this was the 1st place I had ever eaten darsan back when I was on my moms lap

I still remember the Prawns in Black Bean Sauce that they served me...  And all the other dishes from chef Srideep and chef Chang...  Simply delicious and finger licking.

Chinoiserie a great Chinese restaurant to visit .
The ambience is good and service a bit slow but ok .
As for the food, I ordered  the lotus stem and chilli garlic  shredded potatoes which were not oily at all and was different to taste and also I was told its the only restaurant that does not put ajinomoto in its food, over all the starters were good and i also ordered the draft beer from junction which is a must try if you like beer .
And for the main course, I ordered chilli garlic noodles and exotic vegetables in pepper sauce which is not in the menu but the chef makes it on request.
Also on the table if you check the sauce they have this spicy green sauce which was good.

All over everything was good . Will go again to try the order things on the menu.

Per head cost with alcohol comes up to Rs.1800 - 2000 .
Also go with a reservation or you end up waiting in the lobby.

This place redefines fine dinning. Its the best Chinese restaurant in kolkata. Located in Taj Bengal, its packed on weekends so make sure to make reservation, unless your willing to wait for up-to and hour. Crackling spinach have been my absolute favorite since i was a kid and a must order dish. The Potato Corn Mahlak is best in town.

Chinoiserie - The name is enough! Located n ground floor of Taj Bengal,Kolkata it's a luxurious authentic chinese restaurant! Obviously it's extremely high on the pocket as it's a part of a 5 star chain. But the ambience, courteous service, food quality, cleanliness, presentation and homely suggestions by the waiters and sometimes, The Chef himself will make it worth the price! One of the very few restaurants of Kolkata who prepare lip smacking authentic chinese food without adding Monosodium Glutamate. It's a place where u can ask for your dish of Chicken, pork or prawn or fish with your own choice of vegetables, sauces and spices by conversing with the Chef himself! It will be charged the same as the other side dishes of the same category on the menu card. From a restaurant u get a wonderful view of the swimming pool outside.
Coming to the food, The best that i have had and are MUST TRY recommendations for everyone are Butter Garlic Prawns and Chilli Mountain Chicken! *_*
In Main Course Try their Rice noodles, Chilli Garlic Noodles and Chinoiserie Fried Rice with Shrimp Paste ( must try ) with ur choice of Chicken, Prawn , Pork or Fish..namely...Prawns with rainbow vegetables,Mahati Chicken, Goo Loo Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken....etc.. Even veggies! Chilli babycorn is perfect there.
End the perfect meal with their Rose Petal Ice cream or their Special Jaggery or Nolen Gur er Ice Cream! Pure Bliss! Complete experience of a 5 star hotel in the best possible Chinese way ever! Thumps up for Chinoiserie! :')

One of my favorite restaurants in India. The quality of food and service has never gone down, it has only appreciated. Must try is chef bapi style chicken. It's off the menu. Also try out the new broccolini dish. It's outstanding. Other favorite dishes remain unchanged - lat mai kai chicken, cheese balls, corn and broccoli open style dimsums, Szechuan egg fried rice and the pan fried noodles. The daarsan over here is the best compared to all the other Chinese restaurants I have been to.

I visited Chinoiserie for dinner with my family. I had a lot of expectations and here are my two pennies of thought:

1) The decor is not something traditional Chinese and there is a farcical tendency to make you wait even if there is no one in the restaurant. You will also wait a long time for food even at off peak hours.

2) I started the meal with prawn, dimsum and chicken soup and crispy fried duck. I admit it is a star restaurant but at 2200 a plate the duck could almost not be seen in terms of quantity. It was served with steam patas which added to the flavor. The soup was tasty but nothing extraordinary. Dimsum were soft and juicy but lacked a definite tinge in terms of flavor

3) For the main course I ordered prawn in garlic butter sauce, tenderloin, mixed rice and wheat noodles. The sauce for the prawn was definitely too thick which made the experience very gooey. The tenderloin was not too hard but the oyster sauce was not definitely up to the mark

Please bring back the "Chinese" back to the flavor. It has become some sort of fusion of Bengali and Chinese, which we find everywhere in Kolkata.

A great joint with brilliant food.A cost affair, but it is worth it.The ambiance is great, service is perfect. But you have to wait for a while after ordering for the food to reach your table.

The Taj group will make a good impression on you for, you to remember and cherish.

Deserts are a must try..Keep up the great food! :)

During my last Kolkata visit, I stayed at Taj. This restaurant is located at the ground floor. I tried Chicken Dumsum, Sichuan chicken with chilli sauce and Sichuan fried rice at diner here.  I have impressed with taste of Dumsum.  Ambience is not that great. Staffs are really good, always keeps sharp attention on customer. I will definitely try again here in foreseeable future.

Location: Alipore. 

This place need no introduction as such. 
With its great ambiance, come along its great quality of food. 
This restaurant serves Chinese cuisine, which is authentic to the core. 
I have been here so many times, just to give my taste buds a heavenly feeling. 
The ambiance is calm and soothing, relaxes your mind.

Coming straight to the food, 

- Crispy Fried Spinach (Crackling Spinach)
Delectable! 
Highly recommended. 

- Spicy onion pancakes 
Delicious, recommended! 

- Chilly Garlic Noodles 
Great taste! Perfectly boiled noodles tossed into the right balance of spices! 
Highly recommended.  

- Veg Hakka Noodles 
Tasted great, but I preferred the chilly garlic noodles. :-P 

- Tsing Hoi potato 
Authentic preparation! 
Loved it. 

- Darsaan 
Absolute delicacy! 
Recommended. 

The staff was courteous, well-informed and guided us well with the choice of dishes. 

A costly affair. 

An excellent Fooding experience. :-) 
The prices make it a little difficult to make this place a regular visit spot. 

Overall a great experience. :)

I beg to differ with the general opinion here.. This review is coming quite late from the actual date of the experience, and that is primarily due to my increased familiarity and liking for the Zomato portal.
The ambience of this place is nice, as one would expect from a leading 5-Star hotel of a metropolitan. The tables are big and laid out conveniently in the generally spacious restaurant. The restaurant gives you a good feel of oriental fine-dining due to the decor, music, and uniform of the staff.

It is the food, the deciding factor of any restaurant, where this establishment failed to deliver. We had ordered a dish of crabs, which was basically just battered crabs deep fried to a crisp finish. The dish was unnecessarily oily and flat tasting. I understand that several dishes in an authentic chinese restaurant may have moderate to low spices - but this dish was almost tasteless. The extent to which the dish was fried had robbed the preparation even of the natural flavours of the ingredients.
The other foods - the noodles and rice were alright, at best. Nothing stood out as I was expecting from a place of Taj's repute and prices! Finally, came the desert - if I remember the name right - it was a baked chinese cheesecake. This was a major disappointment. The cheesecake was heavy, and clearly lacked the fluffiness which many cheaper restaurants, Delis and Cafes are also able to offer these days. The service too was lacking in many aspects. The waiters seemed to be grumpy, and the wait was long. Also, I had to walk up to them on more than one occasion to talk about the order as it was impossible to catch their attention otherwise. Again something that came as a surprise for Taj Bengal's standards... 

On the whole, the experience was quite a bit of a wash out. It felt all the more so, because it was my treat to my family on my parents' wedding anniversary, and I had hand picked the place after hearing so many good things about it. I was left wondering as to why this place had won such rave reviews. Was it a one-off case that I had this rather unpleasant experience? For all I know, there are a lot many places in Calcutta where one can get far better and authentic chinese food, and at quite a few of these, at almost a tenth of the price. Tung Nam, anyone?!

The chilly garlic noodles. Exotic veggies in black bean or Tsing hoi potatoes with spring onion fried rice all are to die for. The flavours are just perfect and makes you think that whenever you don't want to go wrong with Chinese.. It got to be Chinoiserie

Chinoiserie at the Taj Bengal is perhaps one of my favorite restaurants ever.  I thought it was only fitting that my 500th Review on Zomato should be for a place I love and would unhesitatingly give a 5 to  so here goes ! Personally I hardly ever give a five star hotel restaurant a five star rating because though the food is very good the service or the value for money quotient always makes me end up giving it a 4 or 4.5 but this place always did and still does get a 5 from me.The minute you walk in the elegant setting puts you at ease , the service is perfect they don't hover over you infringing your conversation and privacy but discreetly make sure your every need is taken care of.
I have so many favorites on this menu that its hard to eat them all in one meal :-P. That being said I love to start my meal with the Chicken Wanton Soup .... its delicate flavors set the perfect tone for the meal ..... however for those of you who prefer something tangier try the Spicy Seafood Coriander Soup which is delicious. For the Starters take your pick between the Lat Me Kai , Chicken Spring Roll and Crispy Spinach. However if your in the mood for more offbeat exotic stuff try the Lobster with Spicy Black Bean Sauce which is so good it blows my mind , Steamed Scallop Morsel with Flying Fish Roe again simply sublime or the Hong Kong Style Soft Shell Crabs.
By now it will seem like your attending a Grand Ball and your taste buds have transcended from doing the Waltz to the Tango so dance your way into the main course. Take your pick between the Goo Loo Chicken with Spicy Plum Sauce ( its sweet taste with the lingering hit of spice is perfect ) , Signature Crispy Konjee Lamb , Kung Pao Pork Spare Ribs , Hangzhou Green Pepper Tenderloin paired up with Singapore Rice Noodles and Moon Fan Fried Rice thus making for a perfectly orchestrated feast.  End your meal with their home made Green Tea Ice-cream and if your in a group comprising of kids try the Honey Apple Cinnamon Crispy Wanton or the Nut and Chocolate Spring Roll ...though I dare say quite a few adults like me love it too !!!



----- 19 Oct, 2012 -----

Fantastic Fabulous Chinese food in a wonderful ambiance with service par excellence ..... very expensive but if food is your love its a great dining experience..... You walk out in contented and pampered .... Start with the Chicken Spring Rolls, Lat Mai Kai and Crispy Fried Spinach. All three are absolutely delicious .... For the calorie conscious or the dim-sum lovers .... Chicken Sui-mai and Prawn Hakao are highly recommended. The Chicken sour and pepper soup is also super .... for your mains ..... the Chinoiserie Special Konjee Crispy Lamb and the Gooloo Chicken are my favourites .... along with Mixed Meat Haka Noodles and Crab Meat Egg Rice . Save room for dessert and finish off with the Homemade Coconut or Green Tea Ice-cream which is delicately lovely.

Came across this place when we had this great urge for pecking duck. The pancakes were perfect, the duck skin being thin and crisp with just the right amount of meat. The cucumber sticks and spring onions were fresh and nice too.We also tried the chicken in oyster sauce and the fried rice. Both very well done.Portions were good..overall a great meal!

The service and the ambience was very nice as you can expect from taj. 
We didn't understand most of the menu and the attendant chose for us when we told him what we were looking for. I think that was the best thing because the food was excellent and the lamb was out of the world. There are various dishes which are more traditional Chinese and usually very bland for our taste. So I will suggest always take the opinion of the attendant here.

In a nutshell:

A visit here during Durga Pujo turned out to b quite disappointing as the food was more Chindian than what cud b expected of a true blue 5 Star Chinese Restaurant. Royal China, The China Kitchen etc do a much better  job in terms of Authenticity & variety of Chinese Cuisine.

Short Description – in case u r in a hurry:

Taj Bengal is a landmark Hotel in Kolkata & hence expectations were touching the sky as we planned to have a lunch at their Chinese Restaurant, Chinosserie. 

Chinese cuisine has a special place in my heart as I have been to & stayed in China many times & I have always loved the food. In China I have eaten Chinese food at 5 star restaurants, Government run canteens, mid range restaurants, humble eateries, roadside shacks & factory worker’s canteen as well. In all places I have found most of the items to be simple, made fresh from fresh ingredients, effortlessly & quickly made food used to b so good that I became a fan of it. 

The Chinese that u get in most places in India is what I call Chinjabi – Punjabized Chinese food. Everything seems to have starch, lots of deep frying, thick gravies etc. In Tangra, Kolkata, the Chinese population settled here serves some good Chinese food though due to pressuer of local taste, they have also come up with their own Indianized version that is called Tangra Chinese. 

The food at Chinosserie was close to Tangra Chinese & also at times Chinjabi & quite removed from the original Chinese version. My expectation wud b to have the most authentic & themost exotic of food at a 5 start restaurant. Nothing of that kind was available as well. We were asked to choose from a ‘Navami menu’ that I realized much later, was not the normal menu card.

I was wondering that if I were to have this, I might well have gone to tangra & had the same food at 1/10 the price (I am guessing). 

The service was good as expected. The guys & girls knew their job very well & did not leave any stone unturned to keep us comfortable.

Ambience was good – I wud not say that there was anything special that reminded me of China but in general it was a nice ambience. 

Lighting was dim & I had a hard time trying to click pics for u all.

Food – if u do not have a baggage of authenticity, u might just like the food here – Indianized Chinese is usually chatpata & made to Indian taste. If u r a hardcore foodie & have tasted the original stuff, u might just have a hard time………………or u might just b in the good mood & pay multiple times more to eat the localized version of Chinese food in a city that had many who admired the Chinese model of Governance.

Detailed Description – In case u have the Time to NJOY reading:

We started our meal with Crabmeat and onion soup. It was a thick soup with a lot of starch unlike the numerous fresh clear soups served in China where they almost add ‘nothing much’ to fresh crabs. The onions cud b felt and so was the crab meat. There was a subtle taste & flavor to it which was contributed by both. It could have been ‘good’ & I wud have given it 3/5 but for the excess thickener I rate it 2.5/5 

The first dish in starter was Pan fried Chilly fish. It was ‘Chilly fish’ which in itself is a non-Chinese dish invented in India. There is a close cousin of that in China but the sauces r different there. I ordered this dish out of sheer curiosity – do they serve the cousin or the ‘born in India’ Chilly fish. True to the name, Chinosserie served the Indian version. It was exactly what we have grown up having – for decades. Hot, slight sweet, slight sour, flavor of soy sauce, some bell pepper & pieces of boneless fish. The fish was  nice & soft. It was overall good but not great. I rate this dish 3/5

We next went for Prawns chilly butter garlic. I was shocked to find that the prawns were coated with a layer of corn starch & fried b4 sautéing it in sauces. The direction of the dish was good, the prawns were soft, non rubbery & good but the corn starch killed it all. It was like putting 2 drops of lemon juice in reduced milk that took a long time to make. This is usually done if the prawns r not fresh. I have never ever seen anyone do anything such in China or Far East. I rate this dish 2/5.

Post this we got Sichuan crispy potato. I do not know what was Sichuan about it.Neither did I find the people of Sichuan province that fond of potatoes. It was basically ‘aloo bhaja’ with some ‘Sichuan spices’. It was neither here nor there. It was just a chatpata aloo, somewhat of the kind that u get aboard Indigo. I found it totally irrelevant & bad for the price that one pays for this dish. I rate it 1/5.

The next dish was Fish with black bean sauce. This was quite good. The black bean had an enjoyable fermented feel to it. The fish was soft & tasty. The gravy had quite an authentic feel to it. Thankfully not too much corn starch in this one. I rate this dish at 4.25/5

We moved on to Spicy onion pork. This was excellent & the best dish for the day. The pork pieces were too good – soft & juicy & superb to taste.  Rate this dish 4.5/5.

The last dish we had was Ginger and wine lamb. This was again very soft, nice shredded lamb. Liked it a lot. The brownish sauce was pretty good to taste. I rate this 4.25/5

We had this food with mixed meat Mei foon (Singaporean rice noodle). This was super thin strands of noodle made not from maida but rice. Among mixed meat was pork, chicken, prawns & egg. Very balanced taste. The veggies thrown in were crunchy & enjoyable too. I rate this dish 4.25/5

Fresh Lime soda sweet & salt was just perfect. As good as it cud get. Perfect balance of sweet, sour, salt. I rate it 4.5/5
Rating of food at Chinosserie averages out to 3.4/5

Clarification: In case u r thinking I am too price conscious (due to numerous mentions above), I am sorry to say that I have not been able to explain myself well. Lemme try to explain again. I am happy to pay (even) a fortune if what I get in return is awesome. If not, it pinches me. A Rs. 30 dish pinches me if it is bad & I smilingly pay Rs. 3000 for a dish if that is something ‘out of the world’. 

I wud not revisit for sure. Look forward to hearing from u.

Some distant relatives were staying at taj so we went there to meet them and ended up having dinner here. Right from ambience to service I would rate 10 on 10. The food was amazing as we tried everything right from fish , lamb to babycorn. Just delicious. We were so much dilemma regarding the menu and what to order, the friendly attendant (wont refer them as waiter) took initiative and surprise with his excellent choice and taste. After the dinner, the nolengur flavoured icecream was like icing on the cake. I would love to visit again.

This is by far the best Chinese restaurant in town. The quality of food they serve and the menu covers a really wide range of flavours from all over China. I haven't yet been to China myself but was told that the food is very close to authentic Chinese served in China by a friend who resides there. The crispy aromatic duck, the crispy scallop infused with garlic butter served in its own shell, the steamed scallop with fish roe, the lobster, the peking duck and the tenderloin served in garlic butter are few of the dishes I have tried on the various occasions that I have been there and I strongly recommend these to anyone who decides to dine there. One could also try the whole wheat noodles and malha fried rice which is more aromatic than it is spicy.  And I almost forgot about the scallop egg fried rice which had really unique flavours. Although the hot pot is not served in an authentic manner but the chilean sea bass hotpot also cannot be missed. Make sure you have place for dessert as they are as awesome as the mains and appetizers, adzuki bean pancakes and honey apple cinnamon wontons are my personal favourites.

Chinoiserie holds a special place in my heart as this was my place of choice for celebrating my first job offer with my mother. The place, needless to say is lavish and since we went for lunch there was ample sunlight to keep us from feeling gloomy. Service was impeccable and the staff was very well informed about their offerings.
My mother doesn't consume any non-vegeterian items excepting fish, seafood and eggs and I was on diet ( as always ) , the staff taking our order was extremely co-operative in suggesting dishes suiting our tastes. Each of the dishes we ordered, Prawn Hakao, Crab meat soup, Singapore rice noodles and very hot steamed ( lots of chilli in there ) tofu with nuts were delight to our taste buds. My mother, who is a very picky eater was all praises for the food. Our meal ended on a sweet note with darsan which  was served with honey and lots of it.
Eating out here is an experience  in itself, an experience to be cherished by your taste buds for years. Can vouch to have had the best Chinese ever :-)

Did I mention the decorative chinese plates that run the length of the dining room wall? The four raised circular tables that allow you to be the center of attention at the restaurant if you happen to be seated there? The faux lanterns hanging from the ceiling? The water glasses that were never less than half full?

It's the Taj Bengal, I mean, who am I kidding. It's got to be more awesome than I expected. My first experience here happened to be on one of my birthdays for which I was in Calcutta visiting my cousins. The waitress brought me a cake with candles to celebrate. Then there were repeat orders of their open style dimsums, batter fried veggies in chili garlic sauce, panfried noodles, trio of mushrooms, and onion pancakes. They were all first-rate preparations and come highly recommended from me. Especially the onion pancakes.

If you're in Calcutta for a day and feel like dining at their best restaurants, Chinoiserie should be on top of your list.

Food:- Excellent...Must try dishes are Whotap babycorn, cheese balls, chilly garlic noodles, egg fried rice, 3 tier of mushrooms and onion pancakes. 

Hospitality and Service: Motherly feeling one always gets when one visits any Taj property.  Excellent as always. 

Ambience: Very good. A little gloomy during dinners but also sets the mood right for amazing Chinese food.

I have gone to this restaurant umpteen number of times.  Must go for people who haven't visited. APC without liquor will come close to Rs 1200 plus taxes....

One of the most quaint restaurants in Calcutta. Great food, not very consistent though. Most of the time its just super delicious and at times makes you regret being there. But something thats always average is the guest handling by the staff who at times seem over friendly and mostly make you feel like an unwanted guest.

If there is very very good chinese on your mind, then Chinoiserie should be your destination. A place where everything seems to be just "Perfect"- Good food, great service, amazing hospitality, elegant ambeince and a satisfied you, at the end of it all. A meal at Chinoiserie gives you a reason to be happy.

Vegetable spring rolls and the corn kernels, chilly garlic noodles, burnt garlic and spring onion fried rice with devils choice and a choice of vegetable in black bean sauce, and  made my day. 

And for the price it comes for, its truly worth it all. Deserves a 6 on 5!

Oh My God I just love this place like crazy. This one seems too be perfect and nothing going wrong excepting its high pricing. To start with the ambience is awesomely done and the interiors are eye-catching, dazzling and absolutely grand I would say. If you want to have the Chinese in Kolkata well honestly this is the place for sure. The food is tender and amazing to taste with reasonable quantity. The staff are well experienced and quite equipped and interactive. 
Yes the prices are very high but what else can you expect from Taj Bengal. The high prices are worth the food you eat and the amazing ambience that you experience. After visiting this place from inside you feel serene and fully satisfied and truly happy. 
So I give it a perfect 5 and cannot find any reason for taking away anything from them. 
Hail Chinoiserie!!!! Long Live Chinoiserie!!!!!

Consistently rated one of the best Chinese restaurants in India, this place serves delicacies such as Peking duck, crispy spinach, and a highly unusual selection of corn dishes. Try the golden corn and broccoli in black pepper sauce or the potato corn chilli mal-ha. Unsurpassed food, a calm green-and-beige color scheme accented by old-world mirrors and paintings, and excellent Taj service make dining here a top experience. My personal favourite is lobster is black bean sauce,simply melts in mouth.Juicy,succulent and tender with the perfect mixture of aroma and spices. If authentic chinese cuisine is on your mind,then Chinoiserie should be THE destination for every foodies..

To be honest, this was my first visit to any five star restaurant, so, for this time, i wont be counting the "Pocket Pinch".

The overall experience was really amazing. The staff were well trained and quiet polite( obviously due to the high profile place).

Talking about the food, no doubt it was great. Specially the starters.

I had been there few years back....Its located in Taj Bengal at Alipore. 

I would utterly say that it is one of the best chinese restaurans. Food quality is terrific and ambience is wonderful. Staff is polite and service is quick. First when i went there, i was shocked after seeing the prices. Its too costly but worth it. Pan fried chilly and Tomato Egg Drop Soup was my favourites. Hakka Noodles is very nice. If you visit there, i would suggest you to have their Spicy Mahti Chicken for main course,,,its simply delicious. 

I would rate 4.5 for CHINOISERIE.

Not a big fan of the other restaurants at The Taj Bengal.. But Chinoiserie without a doubt is my favourite for Chinese after tangra ;) 
Service is excellent  and the food hasn't changed since the beginning. The spicy clear soups, crispy fried chilli potatoes , gooloo chicken are a must try. One of the only Chinese restaurants in Calcutta where no MSG doesn't necessarily mean the food tastes bad. If your pregnant and craving some really nice Chinese, chinoiserie should be at the top of your list, not only because the food tastes amazing but also because its perfectly safe.

Chinoiserie.. Located in Taj bengal, Alipore..
It is an expensive restaurant but considering that it is in a five star property, its okay. food quality is great.. It serves Authentic (Indian) Chinese :P
the staff is very cordial, polite and helpful.. service is quick and good.. ambience is good, very spacious, one cant visit this restaurant often , it should be reserved for special occasions.. If you are tempted to have Chinese on a normal day, consider Mainland China :P 
Three stars from me :)

by far the finest chinese avaialable in the city.. chinoiserie is the place to be for all chinese lovers.. wonderful decor.. gives u the feeling of old peking style eateries... everything here is a must try.. if givn a chance then would surly try all the dishes available on the menu. the prices are not so high if you compare the ambiance and the quantity served there and the onion pan cakes are to die for.. i would surly recommend you to try this wonderful place out! 
i would rate this as a perfect 5 !

Pretty disappointing for a restaurant that is part of the Taj brand. Quite ordinary Chinese food.

For a restaurant in a 'status' hotel, the ambiance is just ordinary and the food tasted bland! It might have been two freak days - but on both the occasions we've been there, it was too noisy.

One of the best places to have authentic Chinese food. The chef is from Sichuan, China. Staff can pick the best food as per your requirement. Had five times dinner there and wants to get back.
