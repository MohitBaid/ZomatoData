Hey! I just ordered a half plate Egg Hakka Chowmein through Swiggy. I ordered after 4 PM, so delivery was free due to their happy hours offer. 
Coming to the food, it costed Rs.60 and I was basically expecting a big quantity of street style chowmein. But guess what, it turned out to be really good restaurant style Hakka Noodles. Even though the quantity was slightly less, quality was more than expected. Will look to order a full meal soon.

Poor experience. here I ordered through Zomato. Was happy to get a 20% off.

The Pan Fried Mushrooms had little mushrooms, more of other veggies and most of very highly starchy lumpy gravy and was already cold. Very sad. The Tandoori Dhaba Chicken was over-sweet, not not what I expected. The chicken pieces were on the lesser side (expected a small half chicken). The Tandoori Butter Chicken... too spicy and too thick, with the tandoori chicken pieces too soft. Basically nothing was enjoyable. Lacchha Paratha was already soggy, though Roomalis were fine.

While the prices are very friendly, the quality leaves a lot to be desired. Stuff is way too oily. Some of the food was cold.

Good food. Reasonable price amazing staff.. the dadaji in the reception makes a great lassi .. had lunch here for continuous 2 weeks ... You will not get air condition .. but the food will compensate for the price you pay

Had ordered from this hotel few days. Had Peas Pulao, Dum Aloo and Chana Masala. All the items were tasty. The quantity of the pulao was sufficient for two but the side dishes felt a bit less. But all of them tasted good.

I wish there was a negative rating for this restaurant. Ordered Chicken Curry and Egg Curry via Swiggy and all I got was 'Oil' in the name of gravy. Moreover, the pieces of Chicken were stale. Don't waste your Money! Not recommended at all.

This eatery is located near Phoolbagan crossing, Kankurgachi.

Simple ambience.

Slow service.

Ordered Tandoori roti & Chicken Bharta. Food was finger licking with good quantity.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

I've always been a fan of Punjabi food, but places with reasonable prices such as this are hard to find! Go for the tandoori baby naan, tawa chicken and chicken tarka. The quantity is very decent and can fees 2 at Rs 300 only!

I have had visited this with a friend of mine and I like the hospitality provided by them.

We ordered for a Paneer Butter Masala along with Tandoori Roti. The quantity was  more than optimum and the taste was really finger licking.

A recommended visit!

Review: New Panjabi Hotel

Location - 4.5/5
Situated at Phoolbagan crossing, this place is not at all hard to find. Readily visible from the main roads, and accessible by public transport from all parts of the city.

Facilities - 3/5
No parking facilities whatsoever, but parking within a walkable distance should not be tough. Dine in & takeaway facilities are there. No by phone/ online order is possible.

Ambiance - 2/5
You will have the feeling of entering a really old restaurant, with no AC, but still have comfortable tables and rickety chairs to eat peacefully. The distance between tables are not comfortable at all. Lack of cleanliness will grab your attention, and the tandoor on the open footpath will keep you pre-occupied with the questions of food hygiene.

Food - 4/5
The taste of the food is nothing to talk home about, but fairly good for the price. From local hotel/ dhaba you won't expect more than this. The Tadkas, Butter chicken, Chicken bharta are tasty, and well priced Tandoori & Roomali rotis will not let you leave hungry even if you are on a tight budget. Just for around Rs. 100 to Rs. 150 you can get a fulfilling tasty meal here, both Veg & Non-veg, which is becoming a rare commodity these days.

Service - 3.5/5
You will be attended for the orders shortly, in dhaba style, and food wouldn't take too long to arrive. Overall I don't really expect much more from a place of its league.

Overall - 3.5/5
A nice place to grab something for a fulfilling meal when you are on a tight budget, but not really advised for a meal with family or even friends group due to underwhelming ambiance of the dinning area.

This place is situated near phoolbagan crossing and is very close to my house. It is a very old dhaba. They serve north indian and south indian food. The quality and taste of food is not at all good. Even the sitting area is not pleasant. The only edible food from this place is masala dosa which seems alright.

One of the best punjabi food I have ever had. Chicken Bharta and Butter Nun is just heavenly. No such ambience or decor. No good seating arrangement. But food is just top knotch. Tasty af. The Lassi is great too. Must try.

I just love Punjabi dhaba food. Fortunately this place is located near my house. This restaurant is very old. I am a regular in this place. Tried chicken bharta, tandoori roti, butter chicken, chicken do piyasa, masala dhosa, tarka and uttapam. They make delicious Punjabi food. Just like the traditional Punjabi  dhabas. The quality is good. All the dishes I tried was awesome. Quantity is enough. Chicken bharta is their masterpiece. It consists of shredded chicken with egg white and a delicious mixture of spices and a thick gravy. Their south Indian food is equally fabulous. Recently they even started the Chinese section. Will visit soon to try it out. They recently renovated the place. So the ambience has become better. The staff are friendly. Service is quick and good. There is a suggestion..
Please please introduce the tandoori dishes. Overall it was experiences were yummilicious as usual and I will definitely recommend this place.
