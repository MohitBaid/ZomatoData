1. Excellent value for money, especially the combos.
2. Prompt delivery.
3. Good Quality Chicken.
4. Would be happier if they improve their packaging to something more reliable.
No complaints at all !

Tasty food, prompt online delivery and good quality chicken. I would suggest them to improve their packing and provide some napkins too. Chicken Burger and chicken wings are worth the price.

I ordered fried chicken and chicken wings through zomato and the delivery was on time..
Both were good in taste and even crispy but a bit spicy..
Best for students as they provide dishes at such an affordable price.
Its not like the kfc chicken wings but it has its own taste which is yumm.
