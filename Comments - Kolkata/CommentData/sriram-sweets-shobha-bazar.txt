SriRam Sweets on Nimtala Street is a prominent and big sweets seller her. The shop is just beside the road and attracts a big crowd. I really liked their quality of sweets. I had which is called Khir er Payes. You can see in the pic below. This was suggested by my friend Namrata Saha and it was wonderful in taste.
Beside this we also tried a few casual sweets and each were good in quality.

Very average quality of sweets available here, the rates are very low. The service is pretty good. Though I wasn't allowed to click a single picture of the shop.
