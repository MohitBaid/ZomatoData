We went for some kebabs including chicken reshmi kebab, chicken tikka kebab and their special soup. The kebabs were delicious and the soup was the best. It included chicken,prawn,eggs and a lot more. I love that soup. The Ambience was great and the service was awesome. All the tables are surrounded by a wall like structure so you get your privacy and can eat without being embarrassed!!

If you are in Konnagar , Mukherjee's Royal is the only best option. The quality of food is good and serving time is less. Though there is not much variety but whatever you find is nice and tasty at comparatively lower price than other nearby restaurants. Home delivery is available. Bike parking is availabe nearby.
