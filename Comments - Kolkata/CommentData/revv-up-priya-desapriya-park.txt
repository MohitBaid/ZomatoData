A brand new concept, ethnically suited too. The freshness and variety of the flavours is definitely there. And learning more about it, it seems this is just the beginning. And this is not just a one-off; their tea varieties are already on the shelf in US.

Revv Up - probably a new and very refreshing concept is on the air for the first time in Kolkata!! The tea lover must visit at Priya Cinema (near Gariahat) whenever you fell like sipping tea! The beauty of this boutique tea shop is the variety and the taste! Frankly speaking, the quality of different tea varieties are simply awesome. Moreover, the tea lovers will have hospitality at personal touch as complimentary-for sure!!

Thumbs up - Revv Up!! You will travel long path of success - for sure!!
