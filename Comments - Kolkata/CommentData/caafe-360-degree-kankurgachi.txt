This place is my one of the favourite for it's shakes specially oreo and brownie along with that it serves good pastas. I always like to prefer pasta in white sauce here, it's mesmerizing. And pizza is good but the crust is very thin.

The place is well maintained, and the sofas are comfortable for a cafe. The food wasn't prepared good at the first but after the complaint they prepared it in the best possible. The KitKat shakes were good and I think their Roesti is one of the highlights. I can have that multiple plates alone. So good job overall but I think the kitchen chef should maintain consistency so that no complaints come out. Overall good.

Its a really good place to Hangout.Visited here on yesterday evening.Its located in Kankurgachi opposite to Aqua Java.This is a very pretty and decently decorated joint.Large sitting arrangement in both the floors.Upper floor is more¬† preferred.Large television to broadcast live match or music.Music will be played all the time to make this place more happening.
Coming to food,we didn't much items.Had garlic bread and Aglio -Olio in Pasta made with spaghetti .Took Brain Freezer in Shisha. Only veg foods are served here.
Strongly recommended outlet for Hookah lovers.We'll try more food items upon visiting this place next time.Cheers!!!

The place has very friendly environment in it's atmosphere. It's best place to hang out in kankurgachi area. Somewhere we can spend quality amount of time with your friends.

Now coming to food,
White sauce pasta- It was really nice no complaints against this.
Baby corn Crispi chili- It was not that good yet it tasted okay
Virgin mojito - The drink was classy and enjoyed every drop of it.

Overall it was has been a really nice outing.

PS- For hookah lovers , this place offers hookah too.

Located in kankurgachi, one of the best place for hookah lovers. The interior is great having both upstairs and downstairs sitting. The staffs are really nice. We have ordered pizza, ice tea and hookah. The food is good but the only thing which I don't like about this restaurant is they do not serve non-veg. Otherwise this place is best for hanging out with friends.

Cafe 360 in kankurgachi is an average cafe, with very basic interiors, but amazing food. The pasta they have is bang on, and the pricing they have based on their location is pocket friendly to a great extent. I visited the place with my friends and had a couple of dishes along with some shakes out of which the pasta and the garlic bread tasted the best, the noodles and the babycorn were also very good. The kitkat shake was just average. They have seating arrangements on two levels, one just after entering the cafe and the other seating arrangement is one the first floor inside the cafe after one climbs the stairs. I would totally suggest to choose the upper seating.

Caafe 360 degree is a decent hookah joint. Ambiance, good food quality, prompt service, reasonable rates etc are all covered. The staff were kind enough to replace the drinks we were dissatisfied with without questions. The babycorn and pizza are especially good and are worth a try. The kit Kat shake, wai wai bhel can be given a pass. Hookah lovers looking to chill should definitely bookmark this outlet.

As I am not a big Hookah fan, I tried just 2 times in my life. But the place is very very good for any Hookah lover in the town. Very reasonable. Friendly service, loud music, tasty food. There are few combos stars with 599, then 799 and 999. All are very good on basis of the no of group member. For couple 599 is good. For big group 999 will be prfct in any day.

So after a lot of searching through zomato. Went to this cafe. It's near kankurgachi pantaloons, it's a cozy place. The top floor is a hookah zone. We ordered hot chocolate, mochachino, virgin mojito, a 4 topping pizza, a cheese burger and a Brownie with chocolate sauce. The burger was good. Mochachino was good as well. The hot chocolate was a bit dilute, not concentrated enough. The pizza toppings were less in amount. Other than that the food was good.

Saw cafe 360 while I was going to pantaloons. I thought it was a nice place when I ordered sisha with a milk base, they gave me the sisha with normal base. I did not tell them anything. Smoke was just like a cigarette. After repeated complaints, the staffs did not even bother to change the sisha..  when I asked for the bill, they charged me for milk base and on telling the manager, he told that its the milk baseüòÇ... ended up giving 12% service tax for such a worst service.

Take a metro to Girish Park, then an auto to kankurgachi crossing, walk straight and take the first right, walk straight for around 5-10 mins until you see cafe 360¬∞ at the left hand side. 
This could be considered as an average cafe, but compared to its location and the pricing, it gets all the marks. The little bit deduction because of the taste of the babycorn and Sizzler. 
Food we ordered - Family garlic bread, Crispy chilly babycorn, Veg Sizzler, Mix Sauce Pasta, Kit Kat shake & Cadbury Shake. 
Overall Taste was good but babycorn and Sizzler was just satisfactory. Pasta was 10/10. 
Ambience wise, it is good too. 
Should definitely visit with family or friends.

And people.. They are charging service charge which is totally optional so please don't pay it if you don't want to and do check it before paying as SERVICE CHARGE is optional now. They charged us and after payment when we told them that refund or they didn't. So please see to it before paying the bill.

Caafe 360 degree is a nice place to hangout with friends. It is near to Pantaloons kakurgachi.

This place is vegetarian. It has a hookah lounge along with a separate dining area for non-hookah people.

Went there with my best friend Sweta . It was nice experience. We ordered only food. Quality of food is ok but service is poor.

Coming to the food we had pizza paratha, veg au gratin and chocolate avalanche.

PIZZA PARATHA-: hence we disappointed in this one. Amount was hug but test was not that much good. Not recommended.üò•

VEG AU GRATIN-: this is one of my favourite dis but cafe 360 made it little different way... It tastes good and I recommend for this.... üòõ

CHOCOLATE AVALANCHE-: presentation was good. It looked really tempting and scrumptious. It had proper brownie chunks with vanilla and chocolate scoops and nutties sprinkled on it. One thing is disappointed me that it was very sweet. It would have tasted better if thay would have maintained sweetness .üòë

price is reasonable but they are charge gst 18% + service charge 6% extra.
Good cafe... Visit here whenever possible.....

Destiny planned the last visit..!!
It was very crowded that day with a decent ambiance..!!
Nothing much to describe about the place quite similar to any other caafe..!
Service was sincerely very poor, it was going almost full..so we were first asked to wait..after that they don't even bothered enough to ask us to take table..we have to get indulge into it personally..
Food quality is the only of such thing for which I would prefer to give a next visit..!!

I frequently visit this place. One main reason is the quality of food. I have never had a single bad experience. Also, it is pocket friendly. 
Would recommend pasta(cream cheese, arrabiata and aglio olio), pizza(all of it. It's well cooked and crispy), sizzlers(Chinese, Italian), chilli garlic noodles, chilli paneer,chilly cheese toast, masala chips and of course, brownie all the way!! 
Hookah is great too!

Till now I have opted for online delivery in this cafe. So I have no idea of the ambience and interior decor. I have mostly ordered pasta of different flavour. All I can say about this cafe ia they are quite reasonable and serve tasty food in sufficient amount. Sometimes it is even difficult to empty the packet by one. I am looking forward to visit the restaurent in near future and also strongly recommend their online service

The pasta was really tasty and would love to visit this place again to have that. However, the service needs to improve.
Overall a good place to chill with friends.

The place is vegetarian. Personally i am not a vegan person but went for a friend. But if i didn't go i would have definitely missed it. We order oreo smoothy and crispy chilli babycorn which tastes great. The price was a but over priced. Lovely ambience. Well decorated. There is hookah parlour. The waiter are courteous . Would come here again if i have vegetarian pangs!

Worst food quality ever...Yesterday night I ordered a pizza and spaghetti agli olio...The pizaa had no pizza sauce..The base was had cooked..toppings needed to be hunted..And the cheese was all shit....Tasted like rubber...Worst ever
.The container of the spaghetti was half full with oil...No basil no Garlic..No flavour s...It was spaghetti cooked in oil only..Something like spaghetti oil olio...Worst food...Waste of money...Highly not recommended...Do not order..Asked for tobasco sauce got tomato sauce...

I have visited this place many times and I m in serious love with the hookah they serve from my point it almost the best hookah served in the town.
The service is a bit slow. For having hookah I prefer 360¬∞ is the best üòÄ

The food here is decent but the service is deplorable. The waiter wouldn't voluntarily bring knives where required and when asked he brought just one for the three of us. Also, when asked, he could barely serve the sizzler. The service really puts you off and you tend to not enjoy your food as well.

Right in the backyard comes a great cafe to hangout.  It has a hookah lounge along with a separate dining area for non-hookah people.  Love love the pasta they serve here and their mojito is absolutely awesome.  I've been here just once with a limited menu selection which I tasted thanks to just being two people who couldn't possibly eat more.  They have super size servings and the quality is great. Looking forward to going back to the city and visiting the place once more.

Opposite to Kankurgachi pantaloons inside the lane.

4 guys, 3 looking for hookah, one looking for food and music.

Got in!

Lovely lounge pub like interiors garlanded with neon blue lights, awesome music and ambiance(except for the hookah smell raging high)

We go this brilliant combo for 699 of one hookah two food items and two beverages.

Cheese pizza ordered which was good if not great.

Kitkat shake and oreo shake were at prime form, sublime, tasty, chocolaty and a feel-good factor.

Veg Lasagne, oh wow, dat was heavenly, melting cheese and perfectly baked veggies.

This place is a great show!

If only it served non-veg too!!

Ambience is okay. Food is okay. Its mainly a hukka bar so if don't wanna have a hukka its a little bothersome as the whole place is clouded with smoke. The service there is a bit off. Waiters are not fully aware of the menu  there. The only thing thing I liked about that place is there comment / feedback board. They've used different coloured post it for each feedback in a board. It looks lovely.

This place can be tough to find, so I suggest you to stick to the map location provided on Zomato only and no other application. It‚Äôs in a lane that runs parallel to CIT Road, near Prafulla Chandra Park. It‚Äôs been quite some time since it opened and has been on my wish list since. I was surprised to know that the caf√© is vegetarian only, as it is a rare thing in such a segment.

The caf√© has a nice fa√ßade which makes it easy to spot. There isn‚Äôt too much to write about the interiors. The lighting is dim and the d√©cor is pretty normal. Nothing eye catching nor a round quirky props could be seen. The space has been utilised up to its potential and the seating arrangements have been well managed. The sofas are comfy with huge cushions to go with. The caf√© is divided into two sections ‚Äì ground floor and first floor. I am guessing the ground floor is a smoke-free area.

Coming to the food, we had the 4 Toppings Pizza for which you can choose the toppings. We opted for mushrooms, bell peppers, jalapeno and onion. It was a thin crust and had optimal amount of cheese. We also had the Cream Of Mushroom Pasta and it was really very good. It had overwhelming taste of fresh cheese and mushroom paste. There were ample amounts of minced mushrooms too.
For drinks we had a Sweet Fresh Lime Soda and Cranberry Mojito. The earlier one was surprisingly good. The mojito was amazing too with authentic cranberry flavour. Drinks are strongly recommended and definitely worth ordering.
We had ordered a Guava Chillam Shisha with Teen Paan Rose flavour. Everything was fine with the hookah except that it didn‚Äôt last too long (max. 30 min). Plus, due to the strong air-conditioning, the smoke gets scattered and people might not be able to show off their tricks.

The service is pretty decent. The USP of this place is its consumer friendly pricing and cheap combos. Great for low budget treats.

Good, comfy place with inviting vibes. Food was fine. Service was good too. We had ordered Chilly Baby corn & Mix Sauce Pasta. Pasta lacked proper flavours. White sauce was prominent & had no sign of cheese or any other flavour in it except the fact that it looked as if it had the red sauce but the taste buds couldn't spot it. Chilly Baby corn was good. Though a fine place for hangout with friends if you order what they can cook well.

A popular vegetarian cafe located close to kathgola, kankurgachi.
It offers a very comfortable seating and a decent ambiance. They have a separate section for shisha and that's what impressed me quite as the smoke becomes almost unbearable for  nonhookah smokers. 
Coming to food we ordered
CAPPUCCINO - coffee was good served with two crunchy cookies.
CRISPY CHILLY BABYCORN-  there was too much batter !  While the sauce was perfectly spiced up.
MIXED SAUCE PASTA- it was delicious. The sauce was yummy beyond explanation. It had too much cheese topping. Recommended
HAKKA NOODLES- it was fine. Nothing special worth mentioning.
BROWNIE WITH CHOCOLATE SAUCE- bliss! Brownie so soft with generous amount of pure chocolate sauce ,made the preparation so tempting.
HOT CHOCOLATE WITH ICE CREAM- upsetting!  It was just a hot chocolate drink served in a cup with vanilla ice cream( as they said) , unfortunately the icecream has almost been drowned in the drink and melted totally and we had a hard time searching for it's existence. It was quite a dumb preparation. 
The service was so fast .
They charge  additional service tax on 14.5% vat. So the prices are a bit on the higher side.
I might get dragged back for their pasta :)

Situated in Kakurgachhi, Caafe 360 Degree is a great place for hangout, offering a wide range of finger food among others. This place has got 2 floors, both providing nice and comfortable seating arrangements. I always prefer the upper level which is more vibrant and got a better decor. Food is quite good over here. They make awesome Cheese Garlic Bread. My favourite pick is the Pesto Pasta. They make the kind of Chocolate Avalanche to die for!! (Well, pardon the exaggeration ...lol...but trust me, it's fab!!) The Crispy Chilly Babycorn is also pretty good over here. I really each of their items, though I'm not too sure about the Sizzler, which I feel could be made better, maybe the choice of the order wasn't right. Apart from that, the food has always satisfied me. The price is also pretty reasonable as compared to other caf√©s of its kind. Interior and decor is cool with a nice ambience. Overall, a positive feedback for sure. :)

The moment you enter Caafe¬†360 Degree, you are stunned by the sprawling expanse of this cafe. This place is huge with separate sections for "Bring on the smoke" and "No Hookah, thank you" located on the First and Ground floor respectively. The interior decor isn't exquisite per se, though I must add that the dusky ambience combined with plush seating arrangements make the place look very appealing.¬†

I ordered a Lasagna, a Dew Drop Babycorn, a Mocktail 360, and a Hawaiian Blue. The mocktails were praiseworthy and definitely the high point of the visit. The Mocktail 360, in particular, was very eclectic and delightfully sweet. I am very divided on the Babycorn. It was certainly good and zesty but I think that it had nothing special to offer in terms of taste. As for the Lasagna, it was decently delectable. You won't find it to be the best Lasagna you have ever had and you certainly won't hate it.¬†

The place is moderately priced and doesn't burn a hole in your pockets. A good place for hangouts.

Cozy vegetarian joint, location is a lil difficult, in the bylanes behind kankurgachi market. Has good popularity with veg eaters and due to its hookah joint upstairs pulls in a lot of suave teenagers.
Ordered a falafel slider which was not available. Shifted to coleslaw sandwhich. Cad b shake and mocktail 360. Serving time is quite a lot.
Quantity was ok for the price, the cadb shake was d best with chunks of chocolate, the mocktail filled with stiff ice and syrup, a mismass of non descript nature.
Sandwhiches were standard. The decor is soothing with plush sofas and cushions and there s this cute stick on board near the entrance asking your opinion.

A cozy vegetarian cafe in the bylanes of Kankurgachi, opposite Pantaloons and near APC Park.

FOOD: Well, it's a vegetarian cafe. So, an out and out carnivore like me couldn't order most of their main course dishes like pizza or pasta. Instead, I settled for some mocktails, shakes and desserts. We ordered the Colesaw Sandwich, Cad-B Shake and the Chocolate Avalanche. And I must say I was impressed with the food they served. The presentation of the food was very neat and the items like Cadbury shake and Chocolate avalanche totally stole my heart. They know how to make shakes and desserts and does it well. :)

AMBIANCE: The Ambiance is super. Loud desi music plays in the background and a TV with latest music videos keep running. The seating arrangement is extremely comfortable and cozy in nature. Interior designing of the place is very upscale and homely. Awesome place to bring ur friends over, or to have a nice little personal time with ur girlfriend. They have a first floor also, which is solely dedicated for the Hookah enthusiasts.

SERVICE: The waiters were very supportive and attentive. They knew pretty well about the items in the menu and were prompt in the service. Card is accepted without any hassle. Price is not very cheap, but a light snacks with desserts for two people can be easily wrapped up within 500/- bucks.

OVERALL: Pretty nice cafe to bring your gang and have fun. And even though I'm a non-vegetarian, I'll be returning here again for their shakes, desserts and definitely to try their highly famed HOOKAHs.

We ordered garlic mushroom . It ws perfectectly cooked. It was good. The cheese garlic bread was slightly undercooked bt was good. Worth trying. The chinese sizzler was not upto the mark. I didnt like it at all. I loved the kitkat shake . The shake was heavy and was stomach filling.

It was a sudden visit as me and my friend was passing this place.. Its well decorated and anybody would like the ambience and decor. The staffs are ok but i felt a bit insulted as the waiter started explaining the difference between red sauce and white sauce when i asked him if pasta alfredo is also available in white sauce. The music was good and the food was tasty, Coming to the hookah.... Well one of the best hookah i ever had.. Teen rose paan never tasted better.

A cozy vegetarian cafe in the bylanes of Kankurgachi, opposite Pantaloons and near APC Park.

FOOD: Well, it's a vegetarian cafe. So, an out and out carnivore like me couldn't order most of their main course dishes like pizza or pasta. Instead, I settled for some mocktails, shakes and desserts. We ordered the Colesaw Sandwich, Cad-B Shake and the Chocolate Avalanche. And I must say I was impressed with the food they served. The presentation of the food was very neat and the items like Cadbury shake and Chocolate avalanche totally stole my heart. They know how to make shakes and desserts and does it well. :)

AMBIANCE: The Ambiance is super. Loud desi music plays in the background and a TV with latest music videos keep running. The seating arrangement is extremely comfortable and cozy in nature. Interior designing of the place is very upscale and homely. Awesome place to bring ur friends over, or to have a nice little personal time with ur girlfriend. They have a first floor also, which is solely dedicated for the Hookah enthusiasts.

SERVICE: The waiters were very supportive and attentive. They knew pretty well about the items in the menu and were prompt in the service. Card is accepted without any hassle. Price is not very cheap, but a light snacks with desserts for two people can be easily wrapped up within 500/- bucks.

OVERALL: Pretty nice cafe to bring your gang and have fun. And even though I'm a non-vegetarian, I'll be returning here again for their shakes, desserts and definitely to try their highly famed HOOKAHs.

Its a good place for hangouts. I loved the place coz the seating is very comfortable. 
We ordered garlic mushroom . It ws perfectectly cooked. It was good. The cheese garlic bread was slightly undercooked bt was good. Worth trying. The chinese sizzler was not upto the mark. I didnt like it at all. I loved the kitkat shake . The shake was heavy and was stomach filling.

It was a sudden visit as me and my friend was passing this place.. Its well decorated and anybody would like the ambience and decor. The staffs are ok but i felt a bit insulted as the waiter started explaining the difference between red sauce and white sauce when i asked him if pasta alfredo is also available in white sauce. The music was good and the food was tasty, Coming to the hookah.... Well one of the best hookah i ever had.. Teen rose paan never tasted better.

Located near kankurgachi kathgola bus stop.
A very popular cafe cum shisha bar. Loud music, big screen.Service is slow so you can spend a long time chatting. Ambience is good. Separate section for hookah. Food is okay though completely veg.. desserts are good. Hookah is also fine easy on pocket. Staffs are well behaved.

A very popular caf√© in Kankurgachi and probably one good caf√© with decent interiors and comfortable seating arrangements. They have separate section for Shisha which is really good about this caf√©.
Ambience is fine and service is even good. Waiters are courteous and are well informed about the items on the menu.
Dishes which one must try out here:
Firstly,Mixed sauce Pasta : Not too tangy,not too cheesy,perfectly balanced and absolute relish. One wouldn't certainly be dissatisfied with it. Quantity is even pretty good.
Secondly,their Pizza : Thin crust pizza,absolute crisp with veggies loaded on it and cheese on top.
One can drop here for casual chitchats with friends and can enjoy the easygoing ambience.
So I tried Chocolate Avalanche with one of my friend. Presentation was good. It looked really tempting and scrumptious. It had proper brownie chunks with vanilla and chocolate scoops and nutties sprinkled on it. It would have tasted better if they would have added a better chocolate sauce. Hershey's chocolate sauce wasn't really going well with it. It kinda made it a lil average in tatse. Considering brownie and ice cream, nobody would say that the dish wasn't good,but it could have been prepared in a better style than this.

After a heavy meal, I was just strolling through the lanes of Kankurgachi ‚Äì and my eyes fell upon this place. The outlet might be half my age old (please don‚Äôt ask my age though) and also, just half a kilometre away from my house ‚Äì but for unknown reasons, I have never visited it till date. So, yesterday, just decided to walk-in. 

This one‚Äôs a caf√© ‚Äì which serves a variety of soups, Chinese foods, fast foods, starters, sandwiches, sizzlers, wraps, pizzas, pastas, mocktails, desserts and shisha (of course). The place was blatantly vacant when I entered around 09:30 p.m. on a weekday (Monday). Decent seating arrangements are available in terms of sofa sets with pillows. They also have some seating arrangements on the 1st floor ‚Äì which I believe is for hookah smokers. 

Ambience is very nice ‚Äì with loud music playing in the background and an LCD playing some cricket etc ‚Äì just the ideal scenario for a caf√©! 

Since I was already full, I decided to settle only for a dessert. Ordered their mini sundae ‚Äì which ought to comprise of brownie and 1 scoop of chocolate and vanilla ice cream each. The dessert was served after some 15 odd minutes ‚Äì but I was grossly disappointed at the size thereof. A dessert costing Rs. 152 (A.I.) which does not even measure half a centimetre in radius and one and a half centimetre in height is just too much of a treachery! 

The brownie was warm and contained walnuts and was crispy and went well with the vanilla scoop in chocolate sauce. However, they did not serve the chocolate scoop citing that they serve either of the 2 scoops ‚Äì vanilla or chocolate (although, their menu states otherwise ‚Äì you can refer to page 15 of their menu uploaded on Zomato). 

Prices are just toooooooooooo high and service is fine.

Its a very very average. The interiors are bad to be honest and so is the crowd. You can find a lot of funked up guys with their collars held up and notebooks rolled up in the pockets (I swear i saw it) inside. Hookah isn't great. Nothing new to offer in the menu.
Won't recommend to be honest. But if you live nearby and are out of places, you can give a shot.

Waow. This place is great. Starting with the beverage- being the Kitkat Shake, it was good.  The food was excellent. The sizzler was so filing and worth a try.  The hookah was up to the mark.The chocolate avalanche made me go mad after the place. 
My only issue is that the ambience was not that great and the menu was over priced. 
Overall a very nice experience.

A hip-hop shisha bar-cum-caf√© on the outside - mainly targeted¬†to cater to the¬†young and the restless of the eastern city - so veg only please! BUT they have surprised me each time - with their fabulous service to begin with. The management will ensure that you have a cozy time!They are innovative with their stuff - I was mighty impressed with their floats, finger foods, and the oh-so-refreshing lime soda with a twist of ginger and freshly diced¬†green chillies - a MUST TRY!P.S - Music is loud! But they will turn it down on request!

We were casually wondering where to go to have some hookah. My cousin suggested us this place. On reaching there, the first thing I attacked on was the cushion. I can't explain how fluffy the cushions are. They are more fluffy than the ones we have at our place.

Talking about the stuff and service, its my personal opinion that the place needs to work on its service. The waiter served us the hookah of someone else and when we started taking the same, he tella us that the order belonged to someone else and takes it back thereafter (Coincidentally both the orders were the same). 

Furthermore, the cuisines are good and they need to add more Hookah flavors.

Overall, a very good place that needs to improve its service.

Visited this place this new year!! Food was not the thing we were looking, we had shisha! Regular chillum with royal pan masala and mint! 
I kind of liked the ambiance, not too loud! But just the way I like it! 
Service was slow! 
Waiters should definitely learn how to behave and explain their complicated menu and not lure people into costlier versions of normal stuff ! 
We had tried pizza with cottage cheese, it was more of a biscuit in the name of a thin crust, with soo less toppings man total waste of money! Only I liked was the ambiance and hookah for such cheap price.

It was amazing to witness such awesomeness at such reasonable prices. Everything we ordered was yummy. The oreo shake was great, the desi wrap was good, the pizza was perfectly made, the pasta was good, the crepes were good. The family garlic bread, mexican beans on toast and the cheese roesti had some room for improvement though. The mocktails were amazingly refreshing and flavorful, specially the virgin mojito. The best part was the party combo in which we got two fruit chillam shishas, a large pizza, a sizzler, an Oreo shake and a red bull for just 999. Highly recommended for a party at reasonable prices.

So it was after a monotonous 6-hour class that my friends and I, a bunch of 12 people decided to check into Cafe 360 Degree located at Kankurgachi. Went up to the upper deck and was allotted a cozy comfortable place by the courteous staff there. We ordered the Cadbury shake, the Crepe, the Rosti, the Risotto and the Green Apple Mojito. Cadbury Shake was delicious. A must try. Crepe was also good and fulfilling. Rosti was satisfactory. Risotto didn't quite live upto our expectations. Had to sprinkle a lot of oregano on top of it to make it better. Green Apple Mojito proved to be the best finishing part of our meal. All in all, a great place to hang with friends and experiment with food.

Sitting arrangements are not clumsy making the space airy and privacy is maintained. The staffs are friendly and listen to the guests. The only thing which is a con is the bill. Kindly check the bill carefully before making the payment. U might b trapped in the fooling game.

I happened to go to this place last night and had high expectations due to the good service and food. I had at their salt lake outlet. It did not disappoint.

The seating is comfortable with large sofas and place looks spacious. We made our way to the first floor which is where they serve hookah.

The staff was polite and the service was quick. 

We ordered for the guava chillam gum supari hubbly bubbly which i really liked.

For food we had the vegetable gratin and garlic bread along with iced tea for drinks.

The garlic bread was nice and cheesy and i loved it. The gratin was also really delicious. What i really liked about it was they put pineapple in it which for me takes the gratin several notches higher. 

The bill was 800 which according to me is pretty reasonable given all that we ordered.

All in all a good place to chill with friends and have a good time. üëçüèª

Very nice ambience, lovely d√©cor, cozy seating arrangements with apt lighting made the outing pleasant. The people over there are courteous enough to make u feel comfortable. We ordered Virgin Mojito, Hot & Sour Soup, grilled cheese sandwiches, garlic bread with cheese and Penne Arabiatta Pasta. Food was good and the portions were decent. Overall Caafe 360 Degree experience was good. A great place to hangout with friends. üëçüëç

Thanks zomato for guiding me to this hookah joint near kankurgachi. I would liƒ∑e to rate it a full five. Ambiance is mesmerizing. Staffs are too cool and helpful. We have ordered one guava fruit chillam, 3 mocktail 360, one double cheese margharita pizza, one mexican sizzler, one fresh lime and one iced tea. Each of them was great. They have quite surprising combo offers also. Cozy seats, loud music and impressive hospitality are their USP. I will visit there again shortly.

The ambience is rrally very good but the food served tastes average and the amount is also poor compared to the price tagged... atleast that is what i felt after having my pasta arabiata....the shake chocolate temptation js not as good as the comments it got but is fairly good. overall 3 .

My friend had really got me on a high for this cafe as she had practically bragged for an hour about this joint.. I went there last week with my friend to actually taste it for myself.. The interiors are nicely done with a hukah area which is upstairs and a non hukah zone which is on the ground floor.. We ordered for brownie on the way which is a drink but serves  purpose of dessert as its full of brownies i would give it a 4.5 out of 5..
Next we ordered mexican rice with jacket potatoes . That was amazing.. The flavour was perfect in both the dishes and really loved it .. I would give it a 4 out of 5.. 
The staff is courteous and the price is just right..

This is one of the best cafes I have ever visited. This cafe has two floors- the upper section is for those who want to take hookah and the lower section is for those who simply want to enjoy cafe food.
It gives me immense pleasure to write about this place. The people who do not want to take hookah can enjoy without struggling with the smell of the hookah. The pasta arabiatta, risotto 360 and kitkat shake are a must try of this place. I would like to try other things on the menu as well.
This place is highly recommended.

So! It deserves nothing less than 4.5!!
There would be hardly a person who won't like this place!
We ordered a combo.
The most smooth Hukkah I've had in Kolkata! They definitely don't know what choking is. So dense smoke! Royal Paan was really a delight.
Food: Mixed Sauce Pasta: Everything in proportion! It was really creamy and tasty.
Crispy Chilli Baby corn: Upto the mark.
Shake 360 and Strawberry Shake: Kuddos for both!
Staff and Service: Polite and satisfactory :)

Ambience: 4.5/5
Hukkah: 4.5/5
Food: 4.5/5
Staff and service: 4.5/5

Had gone there on a weekend with a bunch of friends. The overall experience was quite average. First they misplaced our order. Then they took quite long time to bring the orders. The Double Apple flavor hookah was good but Teen Pan was just average. Pizza and baby corn chilli were also average. Ambiance could have been better too.

Went there today for the first time. We were 8 people. The experience was not as good as we expected. The staff misplaced our order and served the wrong items. After we complained, they took our order again. After this, they made us wait for around 20 minutes for the hookah. When we complained again, the staff apologized and their attention increased towards us. The food and hookah were good. But the initial experience spoiled our mood.

Nothing could be better than sitting @ the place and reviewing it !
Ordered a normal chillum Hookah- 3 paan and rose .. Flavour is good but after 15-20 mins i was feeling like the flavour was burnt ,i informed the waiter he tasted it n again told me it was ok but i again tasted .. It was horrible.. There was a waiter wearing spectacles he told" teen pan rose aisa hi hota hai sir hmlog aisa hi banate hain"..
That guy was teaching me how to take hookah and i m seriously angry with this kind of service .
I paid my bill and went away ..
Me and my friend was very embarrassed with such kind of behaviour of that staff!
Owner should take strict action against it !
Worthless to visit such places where owner gives jobs to such staffs which are mannerless and Full of attitude.
A big thumbs down to u @ Caafe 360 degrees !

Food was horrible ! Baby corn was pathetic and kathi rolls were tasteless .
Staffs were not helpfull they were busy on their own abusing each other and i called them for order thrice then they responded !

A great place to be. I guess I dont need to say anything about its hookah coz its "360". The cheese mushroom paratha is highly recommended. I liked brownie all the way and cafe 360 shakes that we had. The best part that I didnt find in other parts of the city is the fast service they have with their food. The staff is also very organised (which is always not the case everywhere). A cool place to hang out with your friends if you want to kill time.

It is located in CIT road in the lane opposite pantaloons kakurgachi. Cafe 360 degree is hookah parlour which is divided into two sections where one doesn't serve hookah. So we sat in the first floor which served hookah. 
Ambiance: Ambiance is nothing extraordinary. It is a basic place serving hookah. 
Food: The staff helped us through the menu and suggested that we order the mixed sauce pasta, which we did. It was beyond delicious. It was the best that I have ever had in kolkata. We had also ordered crispy chilly babycorn and cold coffee. The babycorn was perfect. It was crispy, and not too sweet. The coffee was good too. 
Hookah: It choked a little but then it was fine. 
Service: The service was fast and staff were courteous and friendly. 
Go to this place for their mixed sauce pasta.

When it comes to courtesy,this is one of the worst cafe's I have ever been to.We had just made the payment and were waiting for the balance, when a bigger group entered.So to clear the table quickly the waiter told us to collect the cash balance and the cake( It was my birthday and my first visit to this cafe) from downstairs ..wow!! You guys literally made my day. I give u 10 on 10 for rude behavior and for spoiling my day.
Never looking forward to visit this place again.

Okay, so this has been one of my favorite hangout places in north Kolkata because of its quality food and amazing hookahs.
But the last time I went there on 24/10, I was in for some hooliganism. A guy sitting right across my table along with 2 others, was behaving like a nerd. His was continuously shouting n singing loudly all the songs that were played, imagine inbetween he stood up and danced alone, seemingly drunk. He was rolling and almost lying down on his couch and to top it all was continuously staring at my girlfriend. She felt really uncomfortable because of his actions.
You may think as to why dint I approach any manager of the place, the reason: he knew almost all the waiters by their names, he even shouted inbetween to bring black dog scotch for his friends. None of the attendants cared a bit about his behavior.

Really awful experience!! I hope the management takes some action on this.

Location-   opposite lane of kankurgachi pantaloons .. Easy to locate the place ..
Food- thats what this makes a place to come for another time .as the food is really good.. One of the best pasta i had in kolkata cafes.. Mojito was extremely refreshing for a sultry weather like kolkata..and hookah was also well prepared.. It had mongolion too.. But i quite didnt like the sauce.. As it was way too spicy rather than good mongolian flavours..
Ambience-  i like the ambience of the broadway one much better . as it looks a little shabby.. With no proper coolin.. As it wasnt really cool with the number of acs fitted.. But the staff were well versed with the menu.. So good place for adda with friends..
Must go.. Pocket pinch 250 per head.. Along with hookah..

Tucked into a small lane in kankurgachi...this cafe was a lil difficult to locate intially! This place is divided into two areas floor wise! We took our seats upstairs as that's where they serve hookah. We ordered for a kiwi-springwater hookah...it was good! Then we called for a brownie shake for which they took 20 minutes... But it was worth! One of the best shakes I've had so far! For food we called for a mixed sauce risotto and it was amazing :) good experience! Thumbs up!

Location: Kankurgachi. 

This place was visited twice, and to my surprise I found the Fooding as well as the sheesha quality just the same as their former outlet at saltlake (reviewed before). 

Ambiance is great, lifts up the mood, but the music is a bit too loud (on request is lowered down). 

Summarizing it up, 

Sheesha: Smoky may it be any flavour! 

Fooding, 
Apart from the dishes that I tasted at the former outlet and found it to be just the same out here, I tried the following out here: 

- Mexican Rice 
It was outstanding. 
Recommended. 

- Palomino Pasta (Mixed Sauce) 
Was made as per choice. 
Tasted great.¬† 

- Crispy Chilli Babycorn 
Was good, but was a bit inclined towards the sweet end.¬† 

Staff is courteous and well-informed, little laid back. 
But definitely not interfering as the ones in the other outlet. 
Partially Happy. :-) 

Pricing is moderate.¬† 

Overall a good experience. :-)

70 mins on a hookah. That's remarkable. Anand Bhaiya pushed it right with no compromise and I must say this is awesome.

Sheesha is not about the chill and thrill but a lot more about the flow of senses and that long makes it perfect. High Five.

----- 01 Oct, 2013 -----

its what you call a paradise for the sheesha addicts. They are focussed and determined with the cause and they serve right. Great staff strength, right priced hookah's great food menu which tastes brilliant and appropriate. the seating capacity is dynamic and the music is bearable. Hookah never runs out nor does the flavour. wifi is also a bonus. the location is a bliss amidst multi functional zone and the centre of the most refine crowd.

I call it the real 2nd home, you visit occasional or regular you will be served well and right and in time.

This one fills the dearth of a caf√© with proper seating space and service in the Kakurgachi-Phoolbagan area. But the place with its dim lighting and sofas, looks more of a lounge than a caf√©. A caf√© is supposed to give you the feeling of ‚Äòsunrise‚Äô, unlike a lounge, which goes more with ‚Äòsunset‚Äô.

This outlet is like a duplex, with the lower floor designed to be a caf√© and the upper floor designed to be a hookah bar. I did not check out the latter, so cannot comment on it now. We tried ‚ÄòLebanese Rolls‚Äô for the first time and they were good. Other food items were ok as well. Staff is courteous.

*** The manager is busy?  ***

This review is definitely not about the food at this Cafe, because we did not eat anything there. But it is more about the lackadaisical attitude of the manager who is in charge of the place.

Went to Caafe 360 degrees just now (Sunday, 1st December 2013, 8:30 PM) to inquire about whether they can host my daughter's first birthday party of around 60-70 people. We liked the interior and the ambiance.

Someone attended to us, but we still had some questions and we asked if we could talk to the manger. This person went to call the manager, but returned saying that he was busy. "Aaj Sunday hai na, isiliye Manager thoda busy hai".

We were really surprised to see that the manager did not have time to even come and meet us, someone who could potentially give him business? What kind of a manager is not interested in getting more business? The attendant/manager could have even asked us if we could come on some other day... that would still be considerable. And neither did the attendant ask for our phone numbers so that the manager could call us when he had more time. 

When we asked for a visiting card, the attendant did not have one. 

The impression that we got from this short episode was that the manager was not at all bothered about getting more clients.

You enter this place and you find it huge compared to many sheesha lounges in Kolkata.

They have exciting combos on sheesha and food

Staff are a bit pushy infact very pushy , they try to sell you their most expensive hookah with the most expensive base and even if you say no they would be like you should try it.
They will come 5 times to you if you are just having hookah to ask if you need anything else but you would need to call they 5 times for a coal change .

Food on the other hand in fantastic , Roasti with herb sauce and mexican rice both tasted good . Brownie shake brought a smile . Just make the staff little less pushy and you get 5/5
