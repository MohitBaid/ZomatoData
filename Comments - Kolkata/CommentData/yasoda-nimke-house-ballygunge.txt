Have been a visitor to this sweet shop since childhood. Their kachoris(don't know of they make it anymore), dhoklas, dil khush(my fav), samosas are all decent. Even though this shop's sale is less due to the good ones around this, but this shop is mainly good for snacks like chanachur, bhujiya, potato chips, non bengali sweets, crackers and many more. Because this wasn't in ZOMATO, I didn't get to take pictures whenever I visited.
