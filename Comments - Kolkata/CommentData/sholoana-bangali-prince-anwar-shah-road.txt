Was there for lunch. The food was delicious, ambience was fine, but the restaurant is a little congested. Nevertheless, Bhetki fry and Dab Chingri were my favourite and is a must-try. Staff were friendly and cooperative as well.

This is an easily locatable restaurant in Prince Anwar Shah road. I have been there twice. The first time i went there to have lunch was a bit dissapointing because they couldn't provide us the food we wanted to have(koturi, luchi,payesh and pati shapte). Then we ordered yellow polao,bhetki paturi and kosha mangsho. The bhetki paturi was amazing. Other items were moderately good.

Sholoana Bangali is a must visit for every authentic Bengali cuisine lover in town. Granted that we eat most of these food almost every day in our homes, Sholoana is the place to go if you're in the mood for old wine in a new bottle. We went there during the Puja rush, and though there wasn't any choice in the menu and everyone had to order the same thali, service was prompt and food was fresh.There was a huge amount of food with tons of varieties in only 750 rs. per head buffet. The Chingri Malaikari and Mutton Kosha were amazing, and their Rajshahi Aloo Dum is absolutely to die for.My only complaint was that the size of the Chingri was not consistent in all the plates.¬†Otherwise, I'd visit this place again and again.

Sholoana Bangali, an out and out Bengali Restaurant serving some authentic Bengali food is a must visit for all those who are reading my review. Not only they provide a variety of recipes but they serve it with utmost love and care. This Durga Puja I went along with few of my friends and ordered the Non veg thali. Believe me they serve so much in excess that one thali can easily feed two people. The thali had bhat, Dal, shukto, alu bhaja, bhetki Mach er paturi, crab, chingri Mach er malakari, mutton kosha, pulao, chatni, rosogolla and that too for just Rs 750 each. So , all the non Bengali friends or those who are staying away from home and missing their homemade food ,this place is a must visit. The staffs are generous. Though nothing can compensate the 'ma ke hat ka khana' yet this would surely remind you or get you nostalgic.

Satisfied with my experience with Sholoana Bangali. üòä

My first impromptu attempt to visit a restaurant that serves BENGALI CUISINE. Went there with my friends, which is just few minutes away from South City and is just opposite to Habbibs
The interior accompanied by a low ceiling and a "tried to bring in" the bangaliana ambience is not bad!
The service was prompt but a lot of dishes were not there plus the quantity was not satisfactory

Utterly disappointing. Starting from it's 'great' ambiance to the 'tasty' food they serve. My in-laws treated me a lunch today on occasion of bijaya at Anwar shah outlet and we tried 'mahabhoj thali'. Not getting into reviewing on specialised dishes like fish paturi, even a simple alu bhaja wasn't prepared properly by them.

So, walked in to this place located on Prince Anwar Shah Road right in between lord's more and Southcity Mall. We went in for a quick light dinner before going out for pandal hopping. Ambience of this place is good, but they could yet improve on the same. Staff Courtesy was Ok. What would enthral u is that fragrance of Bengali food all around and that bangaliana feeling, just perfect spice before pujas. 

In food we ordered:
 
Yellow Rice- 4/5
Chicken Kosha - 4/5
Chicken Dak Banglow - 5/5
Tawa roti - 4/5 (They should try increasing the stocks for the same at rush times)
Fresh lime soda - 4/5

The overall experience was good but could have been better. I hope the management is working on the same constantly. 

Hope to visit soon again for better experience.

I have been in this place on osthomi during puja and the place was small but it wasn't full of people even in pujo rush. Decor and ambience was decent. We had their mohabhoj thali which contains rice, polao, jhuri alubhaja, dal, veg nabaratna curry, potoler dorma,vetki paturi, chingri malaikari, Mutton kosha,chatni and misti and ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶®. The foods were OK but not that tasty and more over they should have given atleast two pieces of chingri... We have tried non veg thali in other bengali restaurants like bhojohori manna.. They provide quality food with good amount and well sized... Please do look upon these.. Otherwise overall good

Convenient place. Awesome Bengali food. Pocket friendly. We had the perfect Bengali lunch: basmati rice, moong dal, gandharaj lebu, alu bhaja, chhankar dalna, eilish machh fry. No excessive masala content in the food. The home-cooked nature of the food makes this place worth a zillion visits. Would love to go back soon. Highly recommended for Bengali food lovers. The menu even has an elaborate variety for vegetarians.


PS: the rest 0.5 has been deducted due to the height and interiors of the restaurant. I am a tall person ;) and the ceiling was just about less than a feet above me.

It is located near Prince Anwar Shah road near south city. The space is large with nice dinning and staffs. The food is good in affordable price. If u compare it with bhojohari manna, the quantity of food is good in cheaper price but the quality of bhojohari manna is better than this. So if you want good quality of food, go for bhojohari manna. But if you want good quantity of food in cheaper price than go for sholoana bangali bcoz bhojohari manna is bit costlier than this.

Ambience: Small place, little uncomfortable if you are going in a big group.. a very humble abode

Location: very good.. within a 10 minutes walking distance from South City Mall

Food: Amazing! Being a pure vegetarian visitor to Kolkata often invited the same comment "tum vegetarian ho toh Kolkata kyun aaya?", and it had me feeling that I won't get decent veg food anywhere in the city.. and how I loved to be proved wrong at this place!! Although pure veg options are extremely limited, the food is very flavoursome and enjoyable. Dhokar Dalna was spicy.

Must try items on the Veg menu: Benguni, Sukto, Moong Dal and undoubtedly the best of all Mishti Doi

Good food not the best version of the bengali cusines. The topshey fries were overlycooked. They serve good quantity. Ordered a thali, but was enough for 2 persons.
Serving was clumsy, could have been better!
Service is prompt!

Service was a bit slow , they bit of mix up things , like they served mutton before sukto .But quality of food was awesome , just loved their lip smacking pulao and mutton dak bunglow.
Nice place , nice decoration , nice ambience , nice waiters , nice location.
A must go place for family outings if you are in love with bengali cuisine.

Last saturday while coming back to home from Prince Anwar Shah Road , I was hungry enough & also searching for some bengali food , then Sholoana Bangali was top in my wishlist and I opted for this one .I've been there with some of my friends .

On entering we found this restaurant quite small , but it was neat & clean .The decor had nothing worth noticing .

Frankly speaking , it was quite good experience of us .We had ordered Topse fry ( amazingly crispy), Mutton cutlet (soft) , Basmati rice , Phulkopir malaikari, Chitol muithya, Bhetki paturi , Dab chingri, Chicken dak banglow , aamer chatni & Nolen gurer icecream .

The experience was averagely good .Staffs were authoritative there .

Wanna definitely suggest others to have a shot there .‚ò∫

How can you not like a place which serves tasty Bengali almost home like food? Sholo ana bangali is exactly so!

Located beside South City, finding parking can be a bit of a problem so recommend you park inside the mall and walk. 
On entering it's a small resturant with steel chairs and    tables, nothing worth noticing.  

The waiters will pop in to tell you their speciality the the day. We had ordered steam rice, naarkel diye muger daal (which was so amazing), topshe maach (Yummy & crispy), mochaar torkaari, and bhetki maach er paturi. For desert we ordered malpua.

Everything was delicious. Special mention to the fish preps which was good. 

Price is a little steep. But it's worth a visit if you are craving Bengali Food...or you can drop in to the many places on the street offering different cuisines for the same price.

On Poila Boisakh, I would have preferred the ala carte not the thali. Its overpriced. Moreover the mutton needed more steaming. When you are serving mutton that too at a big price you need to ensure that its nicely steamed. Others, the itemss were tasty, especially the pui sak with macher matha and the daab chingri.

It is very easy to locate as its just by the south city mall. We went on a sunday afternoon, though not a single thali (buffet ) was available so we had to order from the ala carte only. We ordered "kumro fuler bora" (fry of pumpkin flower ) as starter. The main course included rice , dal (moong and masor with coconut) and we took hilsa , pabda and also kajuri. The tastes were really great . The service boys attended us in every point and also suggested us with the menu. Though the interior might seem a little congested but you will forget everything when you start dining.

Disappointed by the quantity! The fish dishes are quite costly considering the quantity they serve and not even boneless.
P.S. They gave a rose and a chocolate to everyone as a valentines day gift . Loved it !

Well had read few reviews wherein reviewers have criticized about staff behavior so I went with a preconceived notion of what to expect but was happy to b catered by polite and attentive staff members.... What I loved was each and every staff worked quietly and fast.... D place is really small and got filled up fast... 
Cumin to d food- it was gud... 
Ordered topse fry and mutton dakhbanglow for takeaway
Value for money indeed..

Best thing is the way they serve like an contemporary bengali way. Feels like homely taste. The ambience is also bit clam and peaceful. About taste its good not excellent some of the dishes you will find better at home. But having such authentic bengali dishes will surely melt your heart if you are staying out of your home. Overall worth visiting the place and really satisfied.

Since it was my birthday my parents decided to eat something pure Bengali food
Food was good not wow service was very bad we asked for some extra rice they didn't gave and they had misplaced one item also
Many good foods were not available
We were not satisfied but food was good not bad üòÑ
But I must say it is better than bhojohari manna

Today we went there for having lunch. Just because it's Christmas,the restaurant was pretty much crowded.We had to wait outside for 15-20 minutes. Ambience was good.But when it comes to food,they are just awesome.We ordered beguni,yellow polao,daal,chanar dalna,mutton kasha,jalpai chutney,mishti doi and fresh lime soda.Price is very reasonable.They also served paan with the bill.Our taste buds were satisfied :)

It s a little crowded restaurant situated at prince anwar shah road, near to south city mall. Ordered mahavoj veg thali, basmati rice, chicken duckbunglow n cold drinks. Price is a little higher but food taste is very good. I will suggest them to increase the space of restaurant. Overall it is a good experience.

As the name suggests, you'll get Bengali food but the food is seriously very good. We pretty much tried half the menu and we loved all the stuff we ordered. Just one example is that I'm a big fan of ghee rice and I ordered that along with prawn and malai curry items which was great. I'm going there again soon.

Good authentic bengali food.. Wud have been regular here but for the pathetic service of the waiters there.. Will never again visit here and will definitely share this as much as possible because taste is not the only criteria for customers now.. Am not expecting a 5 star like service,  just basic courtesy of attending customer and talking to them the right way.. Waiters here are not working,  they are doing a favour to customers.. Thats the attitude..

Its located just 2mins from south city mall towards lords more the location is prime,the decor is nice,food is also very nice,the one thing negative is their service like I read in other reviews, Most of the servers pay more attention to the TV,than the customers, they show too much lathergy in there service, and the most irritating thing was- the most things we asked for were not available, say like almost 6 out of 10 items were not available,that really pissed me off. all the other things are good about this place,they really should improve their service we took basmati rice,macher matha Dia muug daal,which was really so good,mutton daak bungalow, that was good also,but I have had better, the best thing was -the Nolen gurer Ice cream,it was soo good,that made my day.

Visited this place last Sunday. A delightful surprise!

It is located very close to South City Mall, and is a small restaurant which serves great Bangali food. 

Coming straight to what we ordered :
‚Ä¢ Rice 
‚Ä¢ Alu dum - this tasted brilliant. In fact one of the best alu dum preparations that I've ever had. Just couldn't get enough of it.
‚Ä¢ Chicken dakbungalow - another stunner of a dish. Consisted of 3 chunky pieces of chicken and an egg. Fingerlickingly good. 

The food was ridiculously cheap and amazingly well prepared. Hence the surprise. 

However something that disappointed me was the service. It was bad. In fact half the servers were busy watching the Atk vs. FC Goa match, and hardly anybody was interested in the customers. Still there were only 2 attentive servers who were juggling between the customers.
Really disheartening service.

However, the food, unlike the service won't let you down. 

Pocket pinch - 370! The best part of the evening!

Do give it a visit. Amazing food at amazing prices.

Me & my Hubbypie were dead tired & hungry like anything, we wanted to gobble on some rice immediately so we found this place open & went inside. Sholoana Bangali is a renowned place but however the entry gives it a very average status. Once you enter the restaurant it looks shabby like an old garrage transformed into a restaurant. But the magic starts once you get the menu card & see all the famous bengali delicacies which we cannot prepare in our daily diet for the lack of time & ingredients. Basanti pulao, maccher dimer bora, loittey macher jhurro, aloo fulcopi er dalna, chicken Duckbunglow, chingri maccher bati chochchorri, lebu, lonka, noon. The staffs were friendly & nice. Loved the food, quality proportion pieces & sizes were just perfect. Looking for perfect bengali meali hope you guys know where to go...

Just another bengali restaurant in town. Nothing special to stand out of the crowd. Had been at the Prince Amar Shah outlet long time back. Quality of food was ok. Quantity was good. Space is congested.   Doesn't make a top of the mind recall. Can be visited if you are looking at adequate qty of food at a moderate price, specially when in a group.

Hello! To put it bluntly, my overall experience to my 1st&last time Visit to the shanty bengali-cuisine food joint, had bn pretty disappointing. 
The reasons r s follows:
1)To begin with the moment i had got in, the expression &comments the restaurant boys threw at me was like why i had dropped in so early in there. To mention, it was 12:44p.m. 
2)Secondly from the point of view of hospitality &professionalism cant't give more than 2/10. 
3)The crockery &cutlery they used, bn looking most cheap &ordinary. 
4)Moreover, although i had gone fr the ordinary pure veg. Thali, the bill i was handed over, had included an amount of hidden charge(that too without informing me). 
5)Besides, the overall charges seemed to me lil overpriced. For instance while other reputed restaurants in the nearby vicinity offering the special non-veg. Thali at 400/-. This particular joint charging 700/- for the same menu. 

To conclude, i won't recommend this place to anyone, neither for sitting &dining nor fr takeaway or home delivery. 

With such a pathetic unprofessionalism, can't wish sholoana-bangali, my aykana good luck!

Lets face it, eating in ur sweatpants or shorts with legs up ¬†and chilled beer is much more relaxing, atleast for us. anyways, our normal order is luchi and mutton kosha but sadly now a days the quality is a tad bit.well.... bad tbh. ¬†I really hope they read this and pull up their pants.

Ambience is quite good with mild lights and comfy seats. The place is not too big but its not cramped too. It serves authentic bengali cuisine which are really good. Their sense of decoration is just wow. Things are served in a plate covered by a fresh banana leaf which looks really cool. Officials are cool too. All dishes were good but NOLEN GURER ICE CREAM which was served as dessert was just mind blowing.

Ambience:3/5
its not too good.its avg. bright light all over here & the restaurant is not soo big. staffs are well behaved.
Food: 4.5/5
16ana bangaliana mainly known for bengali dishes. only bengali food dishes are serve here. like sukto, dal, mocha chingri, dhokar dalna, all types of fish items, chckn kasa, kasturi chicken, mutton. etc.
the quality of the food is excellent & they always serve fresh food. quantity is too good. one couple can share easily.
one thing is that some of item are not available most of time & one good thing is that some spl dishes those are not in menu card are serve here. u shld try chicken kofta curry. if u orderd katla kalia u shld love it nd size of the piece is too big.
this point should be noted that with the bill Misti Pan are served here.
cost:4/5
the cost of the food is avg.
Budgt oriented. but the fish dishes are little bit higher price.

We visited this small eatery just beside the South city mall on a lazy Sunday afternoon to satisfy our taste buds. They serve good Bengali food. The place is neat and clean. We had ordered for Basmati Rice, Narkol diye sona moong dal, maacher dimer bora, mochar ghonto, bhetki bhapa, katla kalia, chingrir malaikari, anaros chutney and papad. The food wasn't very rich or spicy and were prepared with much care. It tasted fresh and inviting.
The malaikari, I felt was overpriced as compared to it's quality and flavour, but the bhetki bhapa and the katla can safely take away all the brownie points. Certainly a joint, where would love to come back.

My colleague Pankaj has a huge fascination over Bengi cuisine. So yet again he takes us out to Lunch at Sholoaana ...... Being the nearest outlet to.my office , he brought us here. 
The place is situated near Southcity andthe cuisine on offer is Bengali.

The staff is polite and the decor subtle. 

For starters we ordered the Mutton Chop. Then we moved into the main course with a full blown bong meal with Rice, Dal with Maacher matha, Mutton Dakbungalow Nd Kasturi Chicken. 

The food was yum and made u remember the ma er haather ranna. Had fun. Will definitely visit again ..

Have been here only once a few years back. Don't know how is it serving in the recent times. A small cosy place for around 12-15 people dine in at a time. Serves authentic Bengali cuisine. I remember having Yellow Basmati Pulao with Chingrir Malaikari. At the end we have had Kooler Chutney since the time was somewhere around Saraswati Pujo. My mother didn't love the quality of the prawn but I can recall that I loved eating here. Haven't been here in a while. Have plans to visit sometime soon and update the review. Happy Dining! :)

On one occasion I had dinner during durga puja and a fixed menue in a rush was being served. I Wasn't impressed that day (durga puja is not a good time to judge a restaurant).  on another occasion I walked in for a snack and I relished the fish fry. Decor needs to be worked on

I had taken my mother for dinner on poila baisak to this restaurant as she wanted to eat bengali food. The food was smelling specially non veg items.  When asked to change it, the waiters started showing attitude. They didnt serve all the items which were mentioned on the special menu.  Very bad place + people were rude and to top it up, the food was smelling.  I would suggest u all readers to think twice before going there.

It's cheap if anyone likes to compare¬†with other Bengali cuisine out there. Food is also very good. been there few of times and usually on a very busy date like Bengali new year but I had to say they serve well and fast. but a table reservation is recommended¬†if someone is planning to have something on a day like these.

To most people who love authentic Bengali food, this place has surely been tried. But I can assure you, this is one really bad and smelly place. As you enter the restaurant, you feel a strong smell of fried fish and people like me who do not eat fish, it's a real suffocation in there. The food is overpriced compared to what they serve. I would suggest to look into other Bengali joint if you're looking for one. This shouldn't be your choice.

We had some sudden guests for lunch, who wanted authentic Bengali food. Since this place is nearby I went there to pack some food. Well first of all they should reduce their 4 pages menu to 2, as whatever I was ordering was not available. I mean what kind of authentic Bengali restaurant does not have bhetki paturi even it was on their menu? Anyways, after all my viable options were not available, I asked them for suggestions. After I perused their detailed suggestions I ordered bhetki bhapa, shorshe pabda, chicken jhol and morola macch er bati chochchori. The chicken was sweet, morola mach was great, bhetki bhapa had an odd smell though it tasted okay and pabda shorshe was just horrible, the fish smelled. If anyone wish to try authentic Bengali food better try 6 Ballygunj Place or Oh Calcutta. Had mixed experience here!

I don't usually go for Bengali cuisine when I'm dining out..but after a tiring shopping session,somehow,my brother and I decided to drop in this joint for lunch.It was very easy to locate (near Southcity Mall) . The entrance was way too ordinary. Mediocre ambience.Service was quick and friendly.Ok now about the food. Ordered yellow polao, chitol peti and chicken dak banglow. And for dessert we chose to go with nolen gurer ice cream :))))) We were actually very eager to taste their food ..thanx to zomato!! :) when the food arrived..the portion wasn't enough..that was a bummer.. :( Taste wise ...food was surprisingly delicious. :))
If you like bengali cuisine do give "Sholoana Bangali" a try :)

I write my ordeal here after 3 visits. Have had enough of their nonsense. The only plus point is the location. Period. Whenever one walks in, waiters are busy chatting or watching TV. The only persons who respond when you walk in is the security guard and the cashier who directs the staff to get water, put plates, follow up on order delay etc. WT*??? The menu card is long but that's the end of story. Actually, whatever you want to eat IS NEVER AVAILABLE. Then why offer menu card? The food is way way below average and not worth the price at all. Food at hospitals have more masala. The only thing worth trying is the nolen gurer ice cream. Otherwise this place is best avoided. I recommend the fast food eateries at Lords More or South City Food Court in case you happen to be at Prince Anwar Shah Road area.

My last experience was two weeks back the food was quite good but not impressive,the service was good and prompt.
We ordered dal,aloo bhaja,lote fry,bhetkir paturi and tel koi.
Lote fry would have been better if the whole fish was fried instead two or three pieces were made from it.
Bhetkir paturi was good but pretty dry.
Tel koi could have been done better.
Though overall experience was satisfactory and value for money

The alu bhaja was so less that it should be served as a complimentary item. Worst experience. Not going again for sure. The items are highly overpriced. The service cannot be poor as there are very few people visiting them anyways.

This place is hidden somewhere next to South City Mall. The entry is not that special and the interior is quite crammed up. The decor ranges from Gram Bangla to City life. The day we visited, it was super packed but the staff managed to get us a seat quickly. After we were somehow seated, menu was given and orders placed. I'm a dal fanatic. Every Indian restaurant I go to, I always order Dal first. So we ordered the Moong dal narkel diye, steamed rice and murgi kosha. Pretty standard stuff since the hot weather almost killed our appetite. 
Everything was served piping hot. Dal and Bhaat is a match made in heaven and in this case, it was no exception. The dal had nice chunks of coconut and carrot pieces and it was mildly spiced. Murgh Kosha was how you would expect to find in a normal bengali household without the aloo but still tasty enough to get you salivating. Spice balance was perfect, chicken was juicy and properly coated with masala and the gravy itself was infused with layers of flavor. All in one, a wonderful meal.
This place is a place to go in case you want a home meal away from home.

This is a small restaurant near Lord's more giving all the flavors of Bong cuisine. We ordered Mutton Kasha with Ghee Bhat and Yellow Pulav. The Ghee Bhat was really delicious even though the quantity was a bit less than expected. Yellow Pulav had a lot more quantity though. Mutton Kasha was really tasty and kept us wanting for more. On a negative side, they did not have many dessert menu items in stock. In all, had a good lunch experience. Would visit again definitely.

I go frequently with my partner when we get tired of eating other western cuisines and Moghlai, the ultimate destination is Bengali cuisine. Going back to roots is fun when you're a fish lover bong. The ilish bhapa and bhetki paturi seems very delicious. Although I love cooking myself, and I inherited that from my mother who herself is a wonderful cook. We tried chingri posto as a side dish which is good. The price is a bit more than other bengali outlets ¬†but they do serve good food. From sukto to main course it may cost 1000 for two.

I have been here for a Family Lunch last year.
The Place is very small and not very well ventilated, A/C is the savior. Even the wash area (Only hand Wash) is very cramped

Seating- Chairs are very close to each other, adds to the woes.

Food. This is what saves the day, and 3.5 is for food only.
We ordered,
Fish Fry - This was very good. Specially the Kasundi/Mustard sauce
Aloo Bhaja

Narkel diye Mug Dal- Awesome. Very fresh, and simple, yet tasty.
Rice

Dhokar Dalna- Less spicy, the raw small of dal is managed very well (Some place this smell is prevalent)
Mochar Ghonto- Again, awesome. simply great.

Chitol Muthia- This is Star attraction for me. Fish melts in mouth, taste like mutton, but have all characteristics of fish intact.
Pabda Jhal, Parshe Jhal- Both good, but not stands out

Chingri Malai curry- Very good. 
Kakda Jhal- Another star, I asked them to break it for me. It was sweet kakda mangsho with jhaal curry.

Mutton Kosha- Ok.Ok

Aam Doi- Good.
Raj Bhog-Good.

Quantity- Some dishes like Mutton/Chingdi can be improved.
I will recommend anyone who is looking for good Bengali cuisine near this area.

Ignore the space crunch.

I had always wanted to visit this outlet as I crave for bengali cuisine often if not most of the time. However, on a lazy Saturday afternoon, when procrastination takes over, one might want to order for home delivery. And so I did.
I expected the meal to be delicious enough but it turned out very ordinary. I ordered for Yellow Pulao, Chicken Dakbunglow and Mishti Doi.
The Pulao was fair enough, and was in good quantity, while Chicken Dakbunglow with only three pieces of chicken and one egg, priced at a hundred and eighty isn't a fair deal. The chicken item was quite ordinary and similar to any chicken curry, mishti doi was a regular doi you get on any sweet shop.
It was worth a try, but the pricing is a bit disappointing.

Food wise I would say a great experience. Food was great. Service was good, compare to Kolkata device standards. Ordered Hilsa at peak of its price season. They specifically told what piece I would we getting and what's the price. End comes the paying part. Asked for if they accept Sodexho, answer was yes. I tore all and gave it to them to which they told  mysterious reason of the coupons were torn. Yes indeed they were torn but the bar code was intact and fine. So at end comes the typical non customer oriented mentality of Kolkata restaurant, being penny wise.. Else food wise I was more than happy to give it a 4.5

Visited this restaurant with my mother, about a month back. The decor and ambience both, weren't extraordinary. The place is also not very spacious, but can accommodate a decent crowd. It was obviously very crowded when we went there, as it was during lunch hour on a Saturday. However, the service was very prompt and the food tasted pretty decent, as well. We had ordered for yellow pulao, chicken curry and bhapa ilish, all of which tasted fabulous. For dessert, we had the signature dish,nolen gurer ice-cream, which did not disappoint us either. All in all, a decent, pocket-friendly option, when it comes to Bengali cuisine. They can however, think of expanding their restaurant space, and thus, making it more spacious.

All I can say is for those who would like to try authentic Bengali food, this place is a visit. The taste and quantity of food has maintained its tradition according to any bong appetite but rest of it is a total turn down. 
Starting with the space.. which is tiny, especially during lunch/dinner hours, you can see a que building up. Moreover, during such hours if you are inside and having your meal... then the waiters would rush you to finish off, sometimes even forgetting to ask if we would like to have dessert!!! 
The service has deteriorated over time and so has the cleanliness. On one such occasion we had ordered a 'Daab Chingdi'.. where you would expect the 'chingdi' to be served in a 'daab' bringing along an earthy odor of tender coconut.. but Woah, a piece of chingdi was served on a plate which was actually a dismissed item by another diner, and the waiters tried to pass it off as 'daab chingdi' to our table!!
Also would suggest to carry your own sanitizers as the wash basin could be a mess and churn your appetite.

When I‚Äôm craving Bengali food on a Sunday afternoon, and am too lazy to cook, this is the place I call. A big fan of ‚Äòchaatni‚Äô of all sorts, this is the first thing the family orders. Now, don‚Äôt judge. Not choosing your ‚Äòbhaaja‚Äô or your ‚Äòteto‚Äô first isn‚Äôt sacrilege. Devouring the ‚Äòchaatni‚Äô before the ‚Äòshukto‚Äô, though, might be. 

Speaking of bhaaja, the ‚ÄòBhetki Fry‚Äô or the ‚ÄòTopse Fry‚Äô is always on the menu. Choose the ‚ÄòYellow Pulao‚Äô or the ‚ÄòGhee Bhaath‚Äô depending on what you plan to devour it with. The ‚ÄòMutton/Chicken Kasha‚Äô and the ‚ÄòMutton/Chicken Dakbanglow‚Äô pair well with the former, while the ‚ÄòLau Chingri‚Äô, the ‚ÄòPabda Shorshe‚Äô, and the ‚ÄòDhokar Dalna‚Äô are better eaten with the latter. 

Prompt delivery and proper packaging (most of the time) are a bonus.

Visited this place yesterday before entering into South city mall. It is located in Prince Anwarshah road.The decor and ambiance is ordinary..nothing special.As the name suggests it's a complete Bengali Restaurant.As it is relatively a small place so we were lucky to get a place for Sunday lunch! We ordered Basmati rice,Macher matha diye Mug daal with alu bhaja.After that we took their specialty item Pabda jhal and Mutton Dak Bunglow.They are lip-smacking and spicy also.and in dessert Aam Chatni also makes the lunch a complete one! Their budget is also pocket friendly.Overall satisfying!

Disclaimer : no knowledge of bengali cuisine. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
 Ok so lets start. my first experience with bengali cuisine and i have to say, it wasnt a good one. we ordered mutton kasha with rotis (luchis, kachuris were not available), the rotis were nothing like a north indian imagines, the mutton was okayish but very small portions. Fish fry next, terrible idea, smelled so fishy i was trying to get the smell off my hands till the next day. Finally some chicken curry with pulao (the waiter recommended this) and it was bad combination. the pulao was sweet so didnt make sense having with chicken curry. i dont know what flavour i was supposed to experience...oh wait i know...a bad flavour :/ tried the aam poda sarbot, was fine...so was the raj bhog. I had 2 raj bhogs just to fill up since i coundn't eat some of the food. Very homely kind of food, so could be authentic, i dunno but the experience wasn't a good one. D√©cor is below mediocre. Service as well. i am definitely not coming back neither will i recommend this place but like i said in the beginning, what do i know about bengali food :|

Sholo ana bangali is a pure bengali cuisine restaurant serving delicious bengali food for years now. This branch is located judt beside south city mall and so is well accessed. The ambience reminds us of a typical bengali restaurant with all its decor having a touch of bengal.
Food is good,delicious,hygenic and is given in good proportions. Taste is accurate and no one can find traces of any other flavour than bengal masalas. The thalis served on special occassions r good and plentiful. I had my usual pulao and mutton and prawns. No complaints at all. No place is perfect and so this place has its share of cons too, most important being the small area which becomes a little conjested at times. 
A decent and nice eatery though.

Sholo ana Bangali is a quintessential bengali food joint. They were among the first few organised bengali food joints serving authentic bengali food. But as years passed by many other similar joints came up and presently they have too many competitions and that too places which serves better quality and variety of food. Food tastes good,  service is good but somehow whenever I have visted this place I never got what I wanted. May be they should bring a bit more variety in the menu.

I went here a couple of items when i was staying in Kolkata. this outlet is just beside Mecon towers in Lake gardens. The problem is most of the items are not available and whatever I had I loved their Doi ilish the most. Amazing stuff. But improvement needs to be done for other items. An average place overall

The cuisines, they serve is purely bengali food.Being a typical bengali girl,i can have any Bengali cuisine at my home itself but,jst to skip the 'mayer hather ranna' for a day i planned my visit to this joint with my fianc√©.. 
The food tastes awesome,and never felt missing the taste by my mum..The behavior and the attitude of the people were homely too with the flavour they served..
Overall experience with the food along with the decoration was awesome and memorable one!!

I love Bengali food and their fish. No man knows his fish as much as a Bengali does. This is a typical Bengali restaurant.. I always order Bhaat & Mach n I just love their sukto as well. I took my parents their once, they simply loved their bhekti paturi. I love combining luchi with mutton kasha.. Their fish is fresh and cooked with the right ingredients in a very balanced proportion.. U Vl not regret visiting the place..

Sholoana bangali at prince anwarshah road...I love their atmosphere . its like home from home away. This is my second visit here and I really liked it. We tried basmati rice , mung daal , jhuri jhuri alu bhaja , chanar dalna, yellow polao, chicken curry , amer chatni and most important a aam pora shorbot . everything is so good and delicious. But price is little bit on the higher side. Overall a very good experience.  The most important thing when you are with your fiance everything is just to perfect

Sholo Ana Bangali at Prince Anwar Shah Road ... 2 mins walk from south city mall and 5 mins walk from my apartment is a place where you will relish almost everything if you are a foodie and love authentic Bengali food ... They have everything just perfect starting from the interior decor to well dressed waiters to the way they dress the preparations and serve it ... Everything on the menu is lip smacking and mouth watering ... Last time I tried topse fish fry,macher matha diye moong daal,mutton kosha, kofi er dorma,chingri malai curry and of course ilish sorse jhal ... And to my surprise everything was cooked to perfection with the right quantity and absolutely outstanding quality ... The atmoshphere was like a home from home away especially because of the homely recepies ... I always love to go to sholoana and relish whatever I see new on the wall menu starting from a non veg Thali to ala carte to desserts like nolin gurer ice cream ,sor bhaja to misti doi.. And surprisingly inspite of being a well know chain of restaurants in west beangal their prices are not sky high they are quite reasonable to the pockets ... A must visit place for anyone who would love to die for authentic Bengali cuisine @

My sister's friend suggested to try this place for authentic Bengali food. When we reached this place, it had a very simple set up. We took our place and since we were very hungry we ordered the entire meal in one go! We ordered Bhetki Fry, Bhetki Bhapa, Coconut Moong Dal, Mutton Jhol, Rice and Roti. Bhetki Fry was crisp and delicious. The fish melted in the mouth. Bhetki Bhapa was made in a mustard paste and had a true flavor. Coconut Moong Dal was little sweet and tasted great. But the star of the menu was Mutton jhol, rightly spiced with gravy. Mutton was cooked properly and tasted sumptuous with Rice. After the lovely food, we wanted to have sweet dish. So, the waiter suggested us to opt for Jaggery Ice-Cream, the specialty of that place. We opted for it and it was worth. It came in little pots with the Jaggery Sauce over it. This was the perfect way to complete the meal. The service was super quick and the people around are very sweet. It was a great dinner and highly recommended when in Kolkata.

A go to place for some tasty bengali delicacies. Visited this outlet last year on Ashtami for a casual family lunch during a mini pandal hopping trip.

During that time some durga puja special thalis were being served & hence we all opted for a non veg thali. The service was pretty fast considering the rush. All our food came in a clayey plates & bowls which instantly attracted my attention & gave an image of old bengali styled feast. So moving on,the thali had many items like rice,dal,mix veggie,mutton,fish item,sweets,chutney etc. All the items were very tasty & sumptuous.

One of the better outlets of 16 ana bangali to be honest

Ummmm and happy ending is there reasonable bill. Though the stuff came to serve us the starter of machher dimer bora at the time of main course (as he forgot), I will give it 4 in 5

The decor is mediocre. The food is good but way too expensive. One prawn in one plate of malaikari costing something Rs.350! That's "dine dakati"! It is better to go with a large group of close friends where you don't mind sharing the dishes and the bill. Then it's okay. Otherwise for standard Bengali spread, for Bengalis, it is unreasonable. The bhetki paturi is very good. The chhanar dalna is delicious. The chutnys, all kinds, are excellent. The chital machher muithha is gorgeous. Overall, you can take your corporate non-Bengali friends or foreigners to show off but the decor and ambiance, specially with a TV in the place, is disappointing.

Went there with an out of town friend because she wanted to try Bengali cuisine. The bummer was it was not open for service as suggested by the site. However we waited for it to open for dinner as per their convenience. The dinner was a fixed menu and gosh was it disappointing. Every single item down to the rice was cold. If that was not bad enough in itself,the mutton wad undercooked and pretty inedible. I looked around and realised that most of the patrons had unfinished thali and it wasnt certainly because of their serving portions. I was left severly embarassed for bringing my friend to such a palace that too at around 700/- a plate. Never visiting this place ever again. It is a sholoana promise i have made to myself.

Never thought would land up here because normally i don't prefer eating authentic bengali cuisine at all but tonight was different. We loved the Non Veg thali which cost us 700/- but honestly though we were little pissed with some personal issues but we felt good having them. Mutton was okayish maybe because its puja time..the Chingri was tasty and so was the paneer..again pulav was a bit average ..we were probably the last set of people inside... would want to visit them sometime soon when they have the full fledged menus available..overall a unique experience. :)

You will have to peer on to the menu scrawled on the blackboard next to the cashier.

not feeling like cooking?
any occasion?

whatever happened we used to order from Sholoana Bangali. We always opted for home delivery. The menu was always same...yellow pulao and mutton kosha...sometimes we also ordered for prawn malaicurry. The quality was really good initially however with time it started deteriorating. there was too much oil and spices so finally we started ordering from other bengali food joints.
However, the food is okayish and not bad at all. but they should seriously consider of using little less oil in their cooking.

i went to their patuli outlet. Apparently the place is quite small but have aesthetic decorations. Coming directly to the food... its not delicious as in but moderately tasty. it could have been better considering the fact they have dared to open a bengali cuisine restuarnt in kolkata itself. we orderd topshe fry,dhokar dalna,macher matha diye mug daal,aam doi,chiken dakbanglow,bhetki paturi. They did not have cholar daal..luchi...pulao so that was disappointing. the food was overall good specially macher matha die mug daal. But the bhetkir paturi was a disaster. It had less of shorshe and more of posto in it. the fish was over cooked and on the verge of getting burned. Aam doi was very normal. The waiters are cordiall the only problem is if you visit the restaurant during peak lunch hour they would be in hurry to move you out. I would not say this is one of the best bengali cuisine restaurant. The food needs to be improved.

Two buildings away from South City Mall,nested on the ground floor of a nondescript building,is this little haven of Bengali cuisine. The decor is unflattering. The ambience is roughly bearable. The hospitality is moderate. But what will blow your mind away is the food. It retains the flavour of a home cooked meal and is cheap on the pocket. However, one may face non-availability of a few items on the menu. That can be disappointing. So if you just want to relive the taste of a proper unpretentious Bengali meal,do drop by this place. Psst..they serve paan after dinner instead of the regular saunf.

Bad food..and most of the items are "NOT THERE IN TODAY'S MENU" and trust me...the chicken kasa of a 'hospital' would be much better than that of this place.

Something good is the warm and overwhelming staff.. Nothing more..

Visited this place after several months. Was a little disappointed to see the unnecessary price hike. They have an extensive menu card, but most of the dishes are not available, which really is blow to the expectations of the customers. We had ordered both mutton and chicken kosha. Both had very bad pieces, full of 'chorbi'. I also found the mutton to be a little smelly. However, the sweet dish came as the saving grace. I wouldn't say the quality was as excellent as it used to be before, but the Kheer-malpua roll is something I always look forward to when I'm here, and it did satisfy me this time as well! Even had some aam doi, and it wasn't that bad.

They bought all dishes together. As due to ac it was getting cold so i had to tell them to take away the pulao and mutton and bring them later...potol chingri was good..Nothing xtraordinary. Ilish was pretty good. I lyked it.Had it been a bit spicy it would have been more tasty..i think. Then it was time for pulao and mutton..pulao was good.mutton dakbunglow was also good. But comparing to mutton dakbunglow  of other restaurants it was average.None of the dishes were xtraordinary but it was good.liked it. I asked for aam doi.Dey didnt have it.Den 5 waiters came turn by turn in different time intervals to ask wether we would have some of their deserts. Bit strange as i told dem once or twice that i wont have nethnig else as they didnt have aam doi. Total we had to give Rs.730/-.Can be visited.It was good.You wont feel "it was a total loss for money".

I feel that the place is a bit underrated. 
Been to this place thrice. It never failed to delight me.
The ilish available here is absolutely wonderful. 
The non-veg thali pleases most gourmets. The veg n non veg preparations are equally tasty..
I love their mutton dakbungalow too.
I feel d price is ok considering d happiness of mind and stomach one has after eating there

Ambience ZERO, Test of food ZERO, Performance ZERO, Behavior ZERO, 
rice was broken and with small stone inside, fallacy is they said it may be happened and it is used to. Tables are sticky, You may loose your time as well as your temperament also. I cant put my rating below "1", that's why 1 for SAB.

My first Bengali food experience. And it was really good. Everything on the menu isn't available all the time. But what you will be served will not disappoint you. And I assumed a crowd is to be expected during lunch hours. Thankfully our server was very courteous and unlike mentioned in other reviews. Looking to visit again.

Whenever I am at Kolkata I most definitely visit this place. This place has a very nice ambiance and a good service. Coming to food they give you some really authentic bong dishes. Some of my personal favorites include- 'Norkol dia Moog Dal', 'Echorer Korma', 'Dab Chingri' n 'Chicken/ Mutton DakBabglow' among others.

Had been to this place last year and I will not rate it for its bengoli food as we had none. We went there for dinner but the smell of fishes and oil was so strong that it was impossible for us to stay there for long and to have our food. So we decided to leave the place with only misti doi which I think had good taste, but again the management need to think over this as it is not bengolis who are going to visit them.

Last week I have visited this place to enjoy the authentic Bengali cuisine. We decided to go for Rice, Dal, Alu bhaja, Alu Posto, Enchor Chingri & Mutton Kosha. The food was really good and it had the Bengali texture on it . Basically, this place is very crowed at weekends, you have to wait for a bit for your chance. I found the service & ambiance very reasonable, also the price. 

If you want to enjoy pure Bengali cuisine, visit this place (Weekdays will be the best to visit).

Visited the restaurant for some Bengali food. The place is cramped. The waiters are not courteous and the most important aspect is the food or the lack of it. One of the dishes served was just simply stale and the fish accompanying it was atrocious to taste. On being pointed out instead of being courteous the staff simply started arguing back. Our first visits would definately be our last.

Had been there last week and it came out to be a sheer disappointment. Normally I don't get the opportunity of eating out too much wid my parents. So, thought of having some good bengali dishes and spending some quality time with them. As we were in south city mall, this place was an obvious choice.
The ambience is not great, rather gloomy and congested. The waiter wasn't friendly either. Anyway, may be the food will make for it, we thought. After going through the menu card and trying different combinations, we settled for basanti polao (saffron pulav), bhapa bhetki (steamed bhetki) and chicken dakbunglow (comes with an egg and 3 pieces chicken). However, neither basanti polao nor bhetki was available, only steamed rice and plain roti were the choices. We gave up all hopes of savouring our taste buds woth authentic bong delicacies and ordered plain roti and chicken dakbunglow with doi alu (potato in dahi/curd, very much like kashmiri dum aloo), in short ruti-mangsho-alur dom. The taste was descent though the quantity was pathetically less. The chicken dakbunlow tasted nothing different than a normal chicken curry! The only good side is that the food was less spicy and they served mishti paan at the end I stead of mouth freshner.
But, for a place like this, the overall standard is expected to be much better than this, specially the varieties in the menu card should reflect in real life as well.

For a bong, fish is necessary. Sholo ana Bangali may not be the most extravagant bengali cuisine experience but people who love bengali food and doesn't bother about the ambience it's a place you must go!
Pros- food quality is impressive. Have the non veg thali. Me being a huge foodie couldn't complete it. Location o's convenient. 
Cons- congested place and a bit shabby! 
Overall 4 stars! For people who wants to know what bengali food is about don't wait anymore!! Jao Giye bhuri bhoj korun!

Recently visited the place. Never new of its existence. Have been to other bengali restaurants in Mumbai, but after having the food at Sholoana Bangali , it was for sure that I will miss his place when I return back Mumbai. Food is good, staff a bit untrained, ambience mild. Overall a bengali food lover must visit this place.

No matter where you reside, for a Bong, a casual palate must consist of rice and fish.  So, inspite of being away from my State for so many years, I preferred having Bengali food instead of Chinese, Italian or Moghai. Bengali cuisine is popular worldwide for its spicy and aromatic flavours. So, you can imagine the joy of a Bong girl who gets to taste Bengali food after many years.  Sholoana Bangali is a small, cosy restaurant in Kolkata that serves authentic Bengali food. I heard the name from a friend of mine who has been living here for many years and chanced upon eating here many times. Tired of eating street food, I was looking for a change in my palate when my friend invited me for a luncheon at Sholoana Bangali. 

Though visible from the main road, it is tucked up in a corner, and once you are inside the restaurant you won‚Äôt hear the hooting and honking of buses and cars.  Traditional objet d'arts adorn the shelves and walls of the restaurant.  Elegantly craved tables and chairs along with brightly coloured walls add a traditional touch to the restaurant. It is not a big restaurant and can hardly accomodate a few customers. Nevertheless you‚Äùll feel at home once you are in and comfortably seated at your table.  Since it has been long time I had Bengali food, I ordered an array of dishes listed in their menu card. Mochar cop, sukto, jhinge alu posto, cholar dal, chitol muitha, bhetki paturi and mutton kosha topped my list that day.  Steaming hot basmati rice accompanied all these dishes to my table. After all, a Bong is a rice lover and I enjoyed all the above items with steaming hot basmati rice. 

After this sumptuous meal, I was served anarasher chutney (pineapple chutney), daber payesh and nolen gurer ice cream. How can I express my pleasure when the cold and sweet nolen gurer ice cream melted in my mouth! I was transported to a different world, forgetting all my worries and enjoying my food in that small restaurant. My heart craved for more. I know I could only taste a few among the many dishes listed in their menu. But my gut did not permit me to have more. It was already full, satisfied after a lavish meal. Years later I actually got the taste of ghar ka khana. I became nostalgic, remembered those good old days when I enjoyed a whole lot of delicacies at home. However, now I know that Sholoana Bangali is the place where I‚Äôll get my ghar ka khana.

The most worst bengali food I ever eat.  They charged 550+vat non veg thali for each person at the time of puja and the quality of the food is so bad.  They do not even know how to cook pulao and also the mutton is bad as well as prawn and bhetki and quantity is also too small.  In one word bad...bad....and bad.

Decent bengali food @ decent price is all i can say about this place... People who are fond of Bengali food can drop in here anytime for lunch or dinner... the only drawback is the waiting time to get a seat in there; the average waiting time during weekend is 15 mins. The sitting area is comparatively small but spacious enough for movement... But if you can compromise on ambiance and a bit on service, this place is for you...

'Maaer hater ranna' or 'Food cooked by mother' that's what you call a proper bengali food in Bengali! But pure bengali food is hard to find even in Kolkata these days after the arrival of too many chinese, Italian, thai, north indian, mughlai blah blah blah restaurants.. But then came Sholoana Bangali, Bhojohori Manna, Oh! Calcutta to the rescue..

We decided to give Bengali food at Sholoana Bangali a shot.. Guess what? We were not dissapointed, infact we were happy!
Situated just 2 minutes away from the South City Mall near Lords this restaurant speaks pure 'Bangali Khabar' or Bengali food.
The ambience is quiet and nice and decorated in a different way with many old Bengali style art works.. The chairs and tables are ok but not eye catching. Overall a good and quiet place to have some Bengali food. Now the waiters hand you the menu card and don't think of getting everything on the menu.. We ordered sorse ilish which they didn't have! Was somewhat dissapointed.. But then we ordered
1. Plain bhat
2. Macher matha die mug dal
3. Alu bhaja
4. Mochar ghonto
5. Chocchori
6. Posto
7. Pomfret fry or bhaja
8. Pabda sorse
and 9. Paneer something..
The waiters were really nice and ready. The food came a little bit late around 15-20 mins later. But boy.. it was good. Really good.. The bhat or rice was fine and long.. the alu bhaja and dal was just perfect.. Mochar ghonto and posto was somewhat good but not that good. Paneer was a delight too with fried paneers and a nicely flavoured gravy.. The food is really delicate. Then I took on the sorse pabda jhal. Oh it was really delicious. Soft yet a little crispy, the fish was outstanding. And the gravy was just perfect. It is the best pabda after a long time I had. The pomfret though tastes good was a bit overcooked.. Anyways overall the food was just perfect. Being a bengali 'ektu mistu nahole chole na' so we had misti doi which seemed nothing different than regular sweet shop ones.. The bill we got after eating so much really shocked me. No.. in a good way. It is really reasonable. It speaks value for money. Only thing is that the service should be a little faster. No more complains.

Now if you want a break from regular chinese, tandoori, Italian and north indian dishes just hop into Sholoana Bangali. But make sure you dont plan ahead what you will eat as all the things on the menu are not available all the time!! A good place to hang out with parents for lunch or dinner. Nomoskar!!

Sub-standard food....Behavior of the staff was appalling ...they acted like they were taking mercy on us by serving food & not that we were shelling out good money for the same.

Have been to other Bengali restaurants of repute .... but this one here is the worst of the lot!!! 

To all who've written good reviews of this restaurant at anwarshah road ... you guys must be demented!!! or perhaps have no idea about how a standard restaurant food & service should be like..... but mostly i think u've been paid good bucks to write these good reviews about crappy restaurants to fool the readers!!!!! Shame on you! Get some idea about good food before writing about them!!!!

To everybody else reading the reviews of this restaurant, i say....take good advice...stay away from this place.

P.S: The pictures shown of this restaurant is not of the Anwarshah road outlet but of the Hindustan Park one!!!!!

Have never been too vocal about my less than warm experiences ‚Ä¶.but have to say my encounter with the AnwarShah outlet of this particular restaurant has been the worst so far.
Was in a hurry & happened to be crossing the place on my way‚Ä¶.so decided to pack a few dishes to take home for dinner. 
The person manning the counter pointed to the wall beside her where a whiteboard was hung with the list of dishes for the day! That was weird ‚Ä¶coz usually restaurants have a printed menu for the purpose!
Anyway, we placed the order & paid for it‚Ä¶..
Honestly, I was not prepared for what happened next‚Ä¶.
We were actually asked by the woman at the counter (it hurts me to call her a lady!) to wait outside the restaurant for the food to be delivered!!!!  There was ample room inside for us to sit & wait‚Ä¶..but we actually had to leave our seats & stand outside in the heat till the food was packed!!
The food delivered thereafter was appalling in both quantity and quality & tasted nothing like a Bengali preparation should.
I have to say I have never felt so insulted and cheated by a restaurant as I have by this establishment. Given that Bengalis are known for their hospitality, the restaurant sets a bad example in portraying the cuisine and culture of the Bengali community.....although its a relatively cheap restaurant, but i feel one would get a better value for their money spent at a road-side stall than in this particular place!
Moreover, the staff needs a serious attitude check.
For what its worth...there's at least one customer who's never going back!!! Then again‚Ä¶.perhaps I‚Äôm not the only unhappy customer as was evident from the empty tables all around at what should have been the peak hours of service.

I love Bengali Food and I am always happy when I come upon a place close to home ..... decided to try the Home Delivery and so ordered the Bhekti Fry , Mutton Kosha , Steamed Rice. The delivery took 1 hour and 20 minutes though I live 10 minutes away and I would not have minded had the food reached me warm but it was ice-cold. The fish fry had too little fish inside and too thick a crumb coating and the Mutton Kosha though average in taste was very chewy with more bone and fat rather than meat in all the pieces. All in all a disappointing experience !

The food at SHOLOANA BANGALI appears simple, bt the flavors have remarkable depth. The taste of the food is like real home made bengali food. Its quite affordable. The shop is both clean and tidy, despite having limited space and more customers than can fit inside at one time. Its a family restaurant . Its most interesting thing is THALI. the non veg dishes of Sholoana Bangali is very very delicious.

‚Äú16 Ana Bangali‚Äù sounds quite an impressive name to Bengalis having endless appetite for their very own recipes. However please don‚Äôt be fooled by them. They are an absolute bunch of idiots serving the worst quality of food one can ever have. I had such a horrible experience on the day of ‚ÄúJamai Shoshthi 2013‚Äù.
On Jamai Shosthi we opted for a rollicking menu for home delivery from ‚Äú16 Ana Bangali‚Äù. Disappointment began right from the word go. Though the restaurant at Prince Anwar Shah Road, next to the ever artificial South City Mall advertised boldly for availability of home delivery, yet bluntly rejected to do the same on the day. The option was to order on the phone and get it by oneself. Being option less, we went for the same. The food was ordered around 10:00 A.M in the morning and delivery time fixed was 13:00. Hold on to your tongues, the menu was Bengali Polao, Topse fry, Bhetki Paturi, Mutton Dakbangla.
While getting to the venue at the time of delivery i.e 13:00 Hrs it was bizarre to find that the restaurant manager, a made up lady trying to copy a smart English accent didn‚Äôt have a clue on our orders. She had just made a mess of it. Not knowing how to manage the same, she offered us a seat at the entrance of their dinner place. On further through the waiters, it was discovered that none of our orders were ready. We had to reconfirm the same and then they started to prepare. Finally, all of them were delivered to us at around 14:00 hrs. The waiting period was only 01 Hr with an empty stomach. Isn‚Äôt it great??
On opening the aluminum foils miserable quality of food was served. Topse fry was emitting a typical smell ‚Äì can be compared to Park Circus leather tannery. The bhetki paturi had midas touch to it. Fish inside the paturi had turned pink. Perhaps they have managed the same with pink salmon in place of bhetki. Mutton Dakbangla was the best of the lot. Raw muttons are atleast softer than the Cooked muttons of the Dak bangla dish. And that‚Äôs all. Enough of the ill experience and sheer wastage of money. Actually, these mushrooms of so called Bengali restaurants are best fit for  NRIs having problems to speak Bengali. Bhojon Rasik & old fashioned Bengalis like me would definitely shun the restaurant. They are just cheating on people with sky high prices and rock bottom food quality.
Conclusion: If you want to have a wholesome Bengali recipe, try to cook them at home. They are best cooked at your own kitchen. Never ever go by the brand names of these nonsenses.



----- 25 Jul, 2013 -----

Very very disappointing!!! I took delivery of topse fry, pulao, mutton kasha on jamai shoshthi. Though I reached as per their time given for delivery..I still had to wait for 1 hour!! (Ridiculous!!!!) Actually they started to prepare for the order only after I got there!!! anyway, everything could have been overlooked if only the food would have been good!! Topse fries were rotten giving out awful smell, mutton was not undercooked. my teeth almost ached trying to tear the mutton pieces. I never had such an embarrassing moment in my life. I made a blunder by not opting for home cooked food! I would suggest you guys to avoid such horrendous experience like mine..

A vegeterian and yet an ardent Lover of Bengali food..People kind of take this as a joke..but yet, this still remains a harsh reality and with the very little adventure I have with vegeterian Bengali food- here's what I have to say:
The first thing that stuck my mind is- how are these people serving food at such low prices..? I mean-thats like amazing..! 
Vegeterian for two would under no circumstance cross 300 even if you order the most expensive dishes..!
Food is good- filler, tasty and the pungent smell of sorso tel is itself so mesmerising.
Thier food isnt great- now thats something to note. You can plan to go here when you're looking for a good eating option on a day you're hungry but definitly this isnt the place to celebrate an ocaasion in a posh style.!
I had Bhaat, moog dal, Alu Bhaja, Jhinger Posto and Dhoker Dalna and it was decently good..!
With the price they charge for this- this is the best they can offer..!
Ambience is crowded with less place but then you have to live with that fact in a small Calcutta Restaurant.
And again - as usual I always stick on to the fact that if you're in for Good Food- ambience takes a back stand.

Ill visit this place again- because with the very few options we have in Anwar Shah Road(apart from S.City) , this place is perfect..!

I've had food from here but I was highly disappointed. 
However, today I took a takeaway from this joint. 
We ordered for one yellow pulao n echor'er daalna. 
We were initially ordering for aalu phulkopi but it wasn't available, hence we settled for echor. 

Coming to the food, the rice was strictly okay ..I would've preferred the flavors to be more strong though. 
Speaking of the echor.. It was good.. A little too oily ( as I say they procure oil for free..) but nonetheless good.

Very authentic..Very tasty..very affordable Bengali food. Casual everyday lunch or dinner. not fine dining or gourmet but everyday home style bengali food. Nice casual place to eat . Quite affordable,but Quantity is a bit less.Stick to the fish and mutton dishes instead of the Chicken as it is not their specialty. Home/office delivery is fast if they say yes a most of the times they decline saying not enough staff.

I had been there only once long ago in the triangular park branch near wheels.
Experience was very bad
The chairs specially are not fit for heavy people to sit and then often do not have more than half of the items.So basically we get food according to their order..
If we compare bhojohori manna with this then this restaurant is way below standard.

I was disappointed with the Food on the whole... The Gravy Dishes tasted more or less the same. The Service was a Let down with the staff seemingly not very aware of the Preparation of the dishes.

If you are in love with Bengali food and your wife is fed up with your constant requests of preparing exotic Bengali cuisine, 16 Ana Bangali is a great place to be. 

I had  Bhat, Daal, Posto, Kosha Mutton and Luchi here. The food was OK not so great. In fact the Kosha Mutton was pretty medicore. On top of that, I disliked the service. A Bengali food joint is incomplete if the service is bad. I think they should learn it from Oh Calcutta!.  Well, I am not here to compare the food with Oh Calcutta as the price of food here is probably less than even a single dish would cost there. 

Also I feel to make it a better restaurant, 16 Ana needs to revisit its menu. It is too large and half of the dishes are unavailable at times. The waiters are not well aware of managing the customer's expectation. So I suggest they keep it simple with less variety. Another key challenge here is parking. So if anyone coming to this place, I suggest them to park the car at South City and come over here.

A nice place for having bengali cuisine food. Its located at Prince Anwar Shah Road and i have been there two times. 

Ambience is mediocre and food quality is average. Service is slightly slow and staffs are well-mannered. 

I ordered Chicken Cutlet, Doi Ilish,Rice and Tomato Bhetk and Chicken Jhol. Chicken Jhol was very tasty. Lau Chingri is a must try.  Aam Doi is also very nice.
 
I would rate 3.5 for Sholoana Bangali.

After a disappointing visit to another outlet of the same chain, I was very skeptical when a friend offered to host me in this restaurant. However he assured me that he is a regular in this outlet - so went along.

We started with rice, fulkopi diye dal with alu bhaja and topshe macher fry. The Topshe mach was coated in a batter and fried. It was extremely crunchy and went superbly with the dal. We followed by a Palang shak (palak) preparation with small prawn (kucho chingri) which was also to my liking. This was followed by rui macher jhal, two large pieces of rohu fish in a spicy gravy.

All the items were well cooked and we finished our meal with tomato khejurer chatni.

The service here was prompt and the waiter responsive. Billing was done promptly too.

The restaurant has very reasonable rates and is light on the pocket. The meal above for 2 person was around Rs 320.

Food: 4/5
Ambience: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5

If You want to try out sumthing different alongwith authentic bengali food, then sholoaana bangaliana is a good option. The ambience is not very special to mention about, though it has some idols of durga & some decorations, but the food that one would have over there, will surely not think twice to come over here. It seems like the food has been cooked by your mom. It has such a homely feel in it. The eyecatching part is their " Bhetki Paturi", " Bhetki Shorshe" , shukto,Macher matha diye dal and mutton dak bunglow. Tastes really nice.I have personally fallen in love with their bhetki shorshe.. Loved every bit of their food. I would prefer taking it as a parcel though.

You need to visit this place for some amazing Bengali food. I have been to Bhojohari Manna but this restaurant is miles ahead in terms of quantity, price and taste. We ordered for Narkel diye mug dal, Basmati rice, Bhetki Fry, Yellow Pulao and Mutton Kasa. The preparations were simply good and the portions were enough for a couple. Our total bill was only Rs 352/-. So you can well imagine how affordable this place is. The decor is simple and the staff behavior was good. The only downside - they don't accept Maestro cards :(

My mouth is already watering at the thought of Sholoana Bangali...
Amazing preparations of Bengali dishes. You feel its straight out your Moms Kitchen.
Portions were just about enough for two. Ilishs needs a special mention. Very reasonably priced.
Can be a little cramped.

Ideal for pocket friendly bengali food. The ambience is basic very utilitarian, the service not too friendly...their main motto seems to be 'feed them n throw them out.' I am not complaining though, I live away from home n like their food when I need a break from my homemade pastas n maggie noodles! The food served is good, hot n fresh! Though some dishes may not be available, try the authentic stuff like sukto, macher matha diye dal, bhapa ilish, amer chatni....all beautifully done! But personally I would prefer delivery from now onwards.

Hello friends!!! its a so- so restaurant not very good but average tasting bengali food. Most of the items written in the menu card is often not available in the restaurant, sometimes the price of the deserts are manuculated by the waiters.

Prices are cheap. Food quality is good. Atmosphere is nice. All over it is a good bengali restaurant. Paturi r Macher matha diye Mug dal awesome. And u can try others bengali foods. but fish preparations are awesome. Staffs are well behaved. Small but seating arrangements are nice. Decoration is very good. U can find "Durga Thakur" and many other showpiece around. which impressed me most. This place worth a visit. hope u will come back again.

me a frequent in sholo ana bangali....food is good and for this reason this place is always full of customars....but the main problem is besides a big menucard,they never have all the items,its really pathetic that u go there with something in mind,but become disappointed...otherwise not bad if fully loaded...
