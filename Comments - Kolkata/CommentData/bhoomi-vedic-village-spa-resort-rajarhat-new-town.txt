Its located within Vedic village resort. Its a good place to relax with family on a holiday or weekend. Its located far from the hustle and bustle of the city and place is calm and peaceful. The road that leads to the place is also very beautiful and u can pick up some good fishes(fish lovers) along the way. 

There are many restaurants within the resort and if ur looking for bengali cuisine , then hop on to Bhoomi. The decor of the restaurant blends well with the overall theme of the spa resort (village). If u go for a la carte , then on an average it will cost you around Rs 2500 per person and it takes a bit of time as well. Considering the high prices of most of the items listed on menu , its advisable to try the non veg thali which has good number of variants(Costs Rs 1300 plus GST ...thats the price as of now).

Amongst the dishes served in thali , i liked topse mach bhaja (starter), chicken dhania the most(although rest of the items were also very delicious). The staff were very courteous. 

The only downside to this entire thing was the taste of the desserts at the end. They served us Rossogulla and Misthi doi . While Rossogula was the spongy one , Misthi doi was sour. This is the only reason i deducted 1 star from the rating. In fact i wanted to rate them 3.75 coz dessert although consumed at last is the most important thing due to that. 

3.5 seems to be too low and 4 seems to be a tad high....my overall rating :: 3.75

A perfect combination of taste, ambience and feeling, Bhoomi, promises to fulfill anyone's hunger not only for authentic Bengali food but culture as well. The Baul songs running parallel to the food serving just made the experience two-folded! We ordered an Amish and a Niramish thali. Had a great time and would love to come back again!
