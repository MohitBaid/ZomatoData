It looks like a small place from outside in the gariahat market, but turns out to be of good size when you enter. Bengali food is pretty delicious, with the quantity of an item good for two people. The rates are reasonable for the variety of items they serve. Staff was helpful and also served that day's special item to us off the menu.

Small eatery hidden among the busy street of Gariahat on your way to Golpark taking the right side footpath. If you are not paying attention, you might even miss it. Clean restaurant, good in hospitality reminding you of a homely atmosphere. Serves good array of Bengali dishes, good on pocket. They usually give complimentary dishes like kochu bata or kumro fuler bori etc. If you are looking for ambience and flashy get up, then this is not your place. But obviously this is your place if "pet bhore bangali khawa dawa" is your mantra.

Don't even feel like rating 1 for this restaurant. Recently visited this restaurant hoping to have a good bengali meal, but had the worst experience ever. Cannot even think of bad bengali food in kolkata. I will never ever recommend anyone in this restaurant. And mostly the service was disgusting. The waiter didn't even have the responsibility to complete a table's order n went away. Lastly the chutney they served as dessert was bitter.

The place hasn't got much decor. Just some basic chairs and table and the place isn't big.
Food is absolutely delicious. They have a vast spread of Bengali dishes and also serve dosas. It's quite pocket friendly.
Situated at gariahat.
Nice place to have lunch after you get tired doing shopping. Happy fooding üòä

One of the best restaurant catering Bengali Cuisine in Kolkata and its my favourite when it comes to bangali khabar. It serves dishes both from East and West Bengal,hence having a huge variety.. uniqueness and innovative dishes. Its situated just beside the Gariahat bridge towards Dhakuria A Golpark. Ambience is neat and clean. Nothing fancy. Service is good. Usp is the food that keeps surprising you with its rich aroma, taste and variation. 
Ilish Bhapa &  Ilish paturi is a hot seller here. Also Mutton Dak Bangla perfectly made to go with Anarasher Madhyamani Pulao or you can simply choose Sada Bhat. The Kochu bata and Posto bora can add twist to any dish you are having. Gulp down any food with Aam pora sorbet to make room for more delicacies. Also we chanced upon seasonal Taler bora ( fritters made of palm pulp)  and pan shot (mouth freshener). One must visit here to taste the real Bengali Cuisine!

A small sized eatery with nothing special to be mentioned, when it comes to ambience, it serves very homely Bengali food. You can even expect 30% of the dishes on the menu to be unavailable at any time. The food tastes pretty much like home cooked food and  thus it is a 'go-to' place for people living in nearby locations. They also don't give you a printed bill.

Authentic Bengali food.. As this restaurant is not so famous like koshe kasa / vojohari manna etc, but it was beyond of my expectations. Damm good Bengali cuisine at a affordable price u can get here. We ordered chanar dalna, dub chingri, mutton dakbanglo, anarosh r chatni..they served bok-fuler bora and kochuu pata bata as complementary dishes. Servers were soft spoken nd with well behavior. Interior was moderate.

Visited the place yesterday with my aunt and a friend. Orders are as follows:
1. Plain rice, 2. Sukhto, 3. Moong Dal with Peas, 4. Alu Fry, 5.Chitol Macher Muitha, 6. Dab Chingri, 7. Chicken Masala special (6pcs). 8. Date and cashew chatni. Complimentary: Kochu, narkel sorshe bata, Kalmir saak and Pan pata sarbat.

A small review about the food.
1. The compliments were awesome.
2. Sukto, Moong dal, alu vaja, Rice were as usual perfectly cooked.
3. Chitol Macker muitha was really good (Don't know it should contain that much hotness or not).
4. Dab chingri was good (I tasted it very little).
5. Chicken Masala was good. A must order, the pieces were very good in size, well boiled perfectly cooked.
6. Chatni was awesome in taste. Cashews were a lot in number...

Time for a little pros and cons.
PROS:¬†
1. The waiters were good. They educate the customers about the items that were available and the special dishes that were not incorporated in the menu cards.
2. The items such as the Rice per plate, Dal per bowl were ample and enough for 2 persons may be 3 also.
3. The digestif i.e. Pan Pata Sarbaat was awesome.
4. Price (the main) of the items were normal a little on the higher side.

CONS:
1. The waiters should help the people know about the quantities of each item per plate.
2. All the items are √Ä la carte, which results in a little huge billing. It would have been good if Buffet is available.
3. The ambiance was also a little bit vintages bathroom was to small and the flush was also in a non-working condition.

Rest it was a wonderful experience. Would love to go there again and consume the heavenly food. Thumbs Up you guys.

Went there for a sunday lunch. Since we were early - the place was pretty empty in the beginning and then gathered decent crowd. The servers were courteous and helpful by suggesting their house speciality. We ordered plain rice, luchi, potol er dorma with prawn fillings, chhana r dalna , galda chingri malaikari and crab masala.

Plain rice was served with kalmi shaak and maan kochu bata - this was splendidly tasty and won our heart. Patal er dorma and galda chingri were delicious too. chhana r dalna was little too sweet for out taste though. Crab masala was tasty but a bit hot.

In the end they served a shot of pan and accompanying spices which is unique and great. 

The ambience is humble and comfortable enough - overall a nice experience.

Tomorrow we went to this restaurant for lunch.We ordered rice,Topshe macher fry,daal and chicken duckbanglow.There were kochu bata and kumrofuler bora as complimentary dish.
The rice and daal was usual. The chicken duckbanglow was quite good(not oily which is a good thing) but it was bit sweeter( we expected it would be bit hot.)
Now come to the topshe macher fry.Some bad smell was coming from the fry.After telling them about the fish they apologised for their fault and diducted it's price from our bill.
Overall it was a mixed experience. I'll definitely go there again to try something new as their menu is pretty impressive and their stuffs are really polite.

I must first admit that i missed out on taking pictures at this place. The ambience is very very ordinary and staff quite courteous. We were given a table just below the air conditioning and there was water dripping on me constantly. I then had to shift to the next chair as there was no other table vacant.
Now coming to the food, we ordered steamed rice, aloo bhaja, mutton jhol and pomfret fry. They gave us bokphul bhaja and kochu baata complimentary. The rice and bhaja were all cold (not even warm). But when we complained they are quick enough to replace it. The mutton jhol was heavenly. I enjoyed every morsel though they can do better with the mutton pieces (most of it was fat). Pomfret fry was usual. There is a lot of room for improvement. Not sure if this place will be amongst my top choices for bengali food

The food was good. I loved their sorse bhapa ilish.. the rice, vegetables and prawn. The dakbunglow mutton curry was again something which i loved. The masala pompret was ok. The aam Panna was good. It can be tried for a decent Bengali food.

My experience here wasn't good AT ALL! I had gone to the restaurant with my mother and we both ordered two plates of Masala Dosa . The food looked delicious and the presentation was good . However, to my disgust I found a cockroach floating in the sambhar! How disgusting ! They offered to change the bowl of sambhar but I retaliated saying that all of the sambhar comes from the same vessel and hence what's the point ? My mother still finished her dosa with only the coconut chutney. I couldn't eat anything . 

However , I must say that the staff were courteous enough to understand my plight . They apologised for such a mishap and as a compensation, did not charge us anything for the food we ordered .

The soft drinks are quite overpriced for example- 50 for a glass of pepsi... not worth it..
plus they give complimentary items lik baigan bharta or kochu bata or taler bora and paan shots in the end of your meal..

Though i am not a fan of Bangali khabar, but dishes of this place do make me feel proud of being a Bong!
Though i never visited this joint, i got foods home delivered quite a few times.

Now coming to the food menu, i have tried their Chitol machher muithha which is the best fish prep i have ever had!
Ilish, Chingri and mutton dishes are all equally delicious and spicy and are definitely worth multiple tries. If you are a spicy food lover then you will love all their dishes.
Leaving aside all the regular fish and meat dishes (that would obviously taste great) what comes as a BIG surprise is their complimentary item Kochu bata!
Honestly, items like Kochu bata are always in my Big No-no list, but this dish is simply out of the world!
And every time i order from here, i mention them to give it a bit extra..;)

Location : Gariahat, Kolkata
Our order : 2 plates masala dosa.
Tired after the hustle and bustle of gariahat , "Padmaparer Rannaghar" is a good place to relive all the shopping stress . Located amongst the hawkers of gariahat , one may have some difficulty in finding the restaurant. The restaurant is fully airconditioned and the  ambience is okay.  The restaurant lacks decor but the staff dressed in traditional kurtas ,  add a sense of ethnic Bengal. The restaurant is famous for all the ethnic bengali dishes but we ordered the most common snack from south to north- " The masala dosa" (due to time constraints:-üòÖ).The look and feel of the dosa was very good .Loved the size of the dosa, enough for one person.  The best part was the flavoursome mashed potato filling which was by far the best one i have ever tried.The dosa had a  perfectly golden colour. The sambhar and the chutney were also very good. The service was quick and the staff were very polite.Pocket pinch was a little high (Rs . 170 for two )but was Worth it. Overall it was a very  nice meal.

Padmaparer Rannaghar is a popular place in the busy food hub of Gariahat. The menu comprises of typical Bengali fare with some speciality items from Eastern Bengal (now Bangladesh) and strangely some South Indian snacks as well! As expected the fish items are their best and very fresh. I haven't tried dining in though, my review is based solely on the delivery experience; which was handled very politely and efficiently with nice packaging and prompt service.

An unique kitchen from across the border. Try this when you shop and drop in and around the footpaths of Gariahat. Ordered Holud Misti Polao, savoured it with Bagda Malaikari. The thinly diced Alu bhaja enhanced the complete experience of kitchen from settlements around Padma for true. The aam sotter Chatni was mouth watering. Unique 'Shorshe narkol Bata' and 'Taler Bora' which were complimentary enhanced the nostalgia of undivided Bengal. The service guys were unique in their get up with Kurta Payjama, the traditional Bengali attire. Improvement can be done to the interiors.

Today visited this place with one of my friend for having evening snacks. First of all what we didn't like was that the items were a bit over priced. We ordered two glasses of aam Panna and one plate of fish fingers. Aam Panna was too much salty. Then came the fish fingers...how horrible it was!!! Both of us noticed that the fish used was neither bhetki nor basa. It was our good old rohu fish. I never even imagined this...a total thumb down to this restaurant...

Now this come under some real Authentic Bengali restaurant...Difficult to locate as it is hidden by the hawkers of Gariahat. Food is just awesome, very tasty and good in quantity as well as quality. Staff are very polite and professional with ethnic touch as their dress code is Bengali kurtas. Visited many times to this place and many more to go.

Food we ordered were Rice, Chapati, Dhakai Mangsho, Bhapa Ilish & Bhetki Pathuri. All were just yum along with their two complimentary items Maan Kochu Bata and Begun er chochori.

It is located at the same place where "Sonali" the South Indian restaurant used to be. Entrane is half hidden by the hawkers (not that the restaurant people can do anything about it). Place was crammed. Hardly any place to wash your hand. (Finger bowls were provided though after the meal). Ok the bad points are over, now the good points. The staff were courteous ¬†and smiling. The food we thought was excellent. Portions were adequate. Loved the complimentary 'maan kachu bata' and 'macher dimer bora'. I personally am a bit touchy about mutton pieces in restaurants, but found them to be big and very tendor and with hardly any bone. When in normal courses you need to order for salad seperately in casual dining restaurants we were served with a plate of gandhraj lemon, green chilli and raw onion pieces. But the best was yet to come. We ended our meal with complimentary "pan patar sarbat" which were just too good. My wife and I are planning to go again soon just to have that. My pocket was also not much affected which is ofcourse a valuable point also.

It's my humble request to all, please don't go and waste money there. Food is not at all authentic bengali type. Mutton Curry was so rich that we couldn't feel any taste rather. Mutton was not fresh also... Dal , aluvaja was much good and the postobata was complimentary and a good starter. Aampanna is nothing but simply syrup made...
Please don't go ...

Among all the joints approved for authentic Bangla food, this restaurant is among those who believe taking one step more.
As the name says, any Bengali can understand that the restaurant belongs to the flavour of Bangladesh,
And no questions, this restaurant has really taken a step ahead when it comes to Bangladeshi cusiene,
The menu covers all the aspects, just name any dish and you will get it. However I was surprised to see dishes here which are rare to be found in any Kolkata kitchen or might have gone absolute.
Fishes of all kind with the unique way of preparation will definitely win your heart, and guess what? I was surprised to get an innovative taste there, as a quick bite I ordered Keema dosa and it was a perfect combination of south and east...
Must try if you like to apprentice concept.
Haven for fish lovers.
-1 for the hygiene.

It is located in b/w golpark and gariahat more. This place is hidden from view. The entrance is over crowded with hawkers.
This is an authentic Bengali restaurant. Ambiance nd decor was basic. There isn't anything to write about. Staffs were professional nd if u gt confused with their menu card thy can hlp u to choose the right one.
Coming to the food, we ordered rice,daal,shukto,posto bora, sabji,prawn malaicurry, mutton kosha, vetki paturi, pomfret kalia, chatni, papad,kulfi. Taste wise those were really good. Quantity was more than enough. They served kochu bata nd begun varta along with the food as complimentary. Nd at d end of all dis their paan patar sarbat is very tasty nd unique.
Wish to visit again soon..

Visited this restaurant couple of days back for some Bengali delicacies. And this place never disappoint us although the ambience is not so attractive here, it lacks that decoration as well. 
We ordered plain rice (2 Plates) , kochur shak ilish machher Matha diye, lau chingri, ilish machh bhaja, shorshe  ilish  (2 plates), barishali ilish, tel koi, khejur-amsotto chatni,  lassi.  Our total bill was around Rs 1850 including 5% VAT. 
Now coming to the quality and quantity of the food- 2 complementary dishes, kochu bata & begun bhatta were just mind blowing. 1 plate rice was sufficient for 2 moderately hungry people. Kochu shak ilish machher Matha diye was  the show stopper. Lau chingri was good but a bit different from our cooking. It has coriender leaves which we usually don't use. Ilish machh bhaja was a bit over fried and a bit small in size. Now while giving order, we were asked whether we want big fish or small for gravy hilsa dishes. We opted for big piece and next we got barishali ilish which is the simplest ilish jhol with bringle and kalojeera. And shorshe ilish was good as well. But tel koi disappointed me as I had better and bigger tel koi in some other Bengali food joint in this city. Chatni and lassi were nice thought. They served gondhoraj lebu, onion, chili,  pickle with food. The behaviour of people were good and friendly enough.

The restaurant is located in Gariahat.If you walk towards Golpark from Gariahat, you will find it to your right side.They have a great variety of Bengali food, south Indian dishes and chaats.
The food was bit Over-priced compared to the quantity and quality they served.

We ordered : Misti Pulao, Kankra Jhal and Kosha Mangsho.

They served kochu baata and begun bhorta as Complimentary but they weren't that good.
Kankra jhal was very very spicy and the gravy was very bad I must say.
Kosha Mangsho was a total disappointment. 2 tough pieces of mutton cooked in a weird kind of a gravy and they called that a Kosha mangsho.
The only thing that we liked was the Misti Pulao.It was nicely made with proper seasoning.
The place doesn't look clean enough.Service is good and fast.
Overall I can say it was a bad experience....

One of the worst restaurants when it comes to customer service. The person who prepares the bill was extremely rude and we were practically harassed but they took a wrong order and suddenly, while paying, we're practically forcing us to take a replacement for the wrong order, which they had billed as well. They just wouldn't cancel the bill and would neither accept card payment because of THEIR OWN FAULT and said suddenly they have link failure. 

Not that they serve uber cool food for which I would go again and the incessant house flies all around also added to my disgust. I hope they have some basic sense and try and buckle up if they want their restaurant and their reputation to last!

If you want authentic Bengali food in a gharoa style and with full of well entertained manner like you are attending a family function,please come here,this is the right choice.Ambience is moderate but it's clean.I am not interested to discuss about their environment or ambience because they are cheap and they are not charging any service cost and too much of vat, prices are really reasonable,so,should keep our expectations like that...But their food quantity and taste is just lajawab.Rice quantity is more than enough for two people.The best part of the whole thing is the complementary dishes,first is kachu bata with coconut which was super yummy,and last one item served by them for digestion which is a drink- juice of pan and other jaljira.Echorer dalna,muger dal,salad and jhuri alu bhaja all are supertasty.And the most awesome part is their range of food items which they can serve----the menu.It's a huge range of Bengali authentic food is available out here,I am just become a big fan of them..thank you for a lovely dinner and keep remind me the taste of ghar ka Khana while I am far from my house.We will surely come back soon for their nonveg items.

It was a friday afternoon..10.02.17.. Me and my family went there to have our lunch.. We went inside and saw the smiling face of the waiter who showed us our seats.We ordered luchi, aloor dum, kosha mangsho, dab chingri, steamed rice, dal, pomfret. The ambience was nice and cool. First the luchi and aloor dum was served..The luchi was really big, soft and tasty..aloor dum was perfectly cooked with adequate spice and the potatoes had all the spices inside it. Then the kosha mangsho, dab chingri and all other food items were served. The kosha mangsho was awesome. The mutton pieces were falling off the bone and the fat on the pieces added more taste to it. The pomfret was good too. I took one piece of chingri and casually started to see the insides of the fish which I dont normally do. Suddenly I found the black nerve of the fish on it which was not removed. I called one of the waiters and inquired him about it. First of all he acted as if he doesn't know what I was showing him. Later he said that those nerves are never cleaned in that restaurant. I took another piece and showed him and asked that how come that was cleaned. He was out of words. He said that people never complain so we never bother about it. This incident made me hate this place. There can be a mistake but being in denial is never an option when you are in a service industry. Later on after arguing they replaced that particular piece. The preparation of dab chingri was also not good. The coconut milk was added in excess. They tried to compensate by serving pan patar sarbat in a shot glass.

A non descriptive place hidden in the hustle bustle of gariahat. A friend and I had gone for essential shopping when we stumbled upon this place and decided to have our lunch there.

There's nothing much to write about the ambience except for the fact that is loud, garish, kitschy!
However, the waiters are friendly and helpful.

We ordered for luchi and alur dom. Unlike those at other places the luchis were quite heavy and treated different. Then we had ordered for mochar chop and postor bora. Give the later a skip since they are miniscule patty shaped and don't do justice to the dish as well as the price.

Rice was aplenty and rui posto was out of the world. I was heavily disappointed with the dhokar dalna whose gravy was sweet in taste.

As complementary we received maan kochu beats (amazing), begun deddo (different and well received). To finish off they served us paan sorbot.

Go for this place if you are experimental in nature.

This unremarkable place is situated on the main road, yet hidden from view. Padmaparer rannaghor replaced Sonali, known for their South Indian items. The ambiance isn't anything to write about. They serve a complimentary kochu bata and saak along with the food. Took home a chicken dakbunglow yesterday. It had about 10 chillies. Could not finish my meal and had to run away to eat ice cream. The kochu bata was quite nice though. They make a decent fish fry as well. Need to up their game to stay in business in such a restaurant abundant zone.

Though the name depicts Bengali food, standard Bengali snacks lack any taste and is hardly edible. South Indian food is really good. Loved the Butter Masala Dosa and Mixed Uttapam. Dosa is served with coconut chutney, sambar and payesh. The aloo stuffing is very nice and sambar is awesome. For Butter Masala the Dosa layer is crispy and soft inside. For Masala Dosa the layer is less crispy and size also little smaller than Butter Masala. 
Fish finger is a horrible one. With 6 pieces very hard to complete all. Extremely thick coating with negligible or no fish inside. The fish fry is a bigger disaster. Very old and dry local basa or worse quality fish that too in negligible amount, coated with a thick Crumb layer with no taste. Avoid please.
The south indian dishes are really good. Anytime I will visit will only be for the Dosa n Uttapam.

After hearing a great review, went there to verify. And their menu impressed me - wanted to try couple of my personal fav items and went with required hunger level.
It was our bad luck that, due to ongoing Durga puja, they were offering a limited menu. Never mind, ordered few from the menu on offer. Unfortunately, it failed to awe me - may be due to over order, they couldn't maintain their trademark. Will give it another shot some other time.¬†
Hope to re-write this review with better feelings :).

Visited this place on the midnight of Nabami during this Durga Puja. We were 6 people, hungry as hyenas from our whole nightout plan. And was inching towards the endpoint when we decided to have dinner here. We ordered Rice, daal (both moongh and moosur), mochar ghonto, rui machher kalia, bhetki bhapa, and a special dish of chicken consisting seven pieces (forgot the name of this dish). Theborder came with a complementary kochur chutney (tastes amazing, I tell you). 

Authentic Bengali food. Not much to say. We were veey satisfied with the food, in general. Only the bhetki looked a bit smelly. 

Recommended for Bengali food lovers.

Very bad experience on Nabami afternoon...ie 10th Oct 2016.
We went to that restaurant at around 2.30pm...and saw huge que outside the eating house...one of the manager is maintaining the que with the in his note book. After waiting long time around 3.45pm...I notice that he has knowingly calling other persons name to get inside and have send some one before me who has came after me.
When asked he started shouting me and when I have started shouting at him and telling this to other persons who are waiting like me in que...about his act....he suddenly pushed me at my chest....
See how this Padda Parer Rannaghar of Gariahat.....behaves with their customers.....
I request to not to go their with your family during this puja days and also try to avoid this restaurant throughout the year...as I usually visit this restaurant 6 to 8 times a year...I will never visit again this restaurant henceforth.

The lunch place of my Panchami Puja Parikrama.

You have to look for the restaurant to find it, for it is at the end of a small narrow corridor and the signboard can be easily missed among the many hawker stalls of the Gariahat footpath.
There is no speciality in the ambience. It is okay. The waiters were not much helpful. They take the order, and after some time, dump all the bowls of food, from the starters to the dessert, on your table, and you have to serve it yourself. Also, the way our waiter was reciting the items on the menu one after another, reminded me of any simple roadside hotel or dhaba.

We ordered the Nayanananda Sada Bhat (rice), the Dildariya Peajer Musur Dal (lentils), ¬†the Panch Mishali Lutoputi¬†Tarkari (mixed veg), the Dhakai Kormar Praner Jhalak, the Murgir Dukbanglow (two preparations of chicken) and the Anarasher Talvanga Plastic Chatni (pineapple chutney). (Boy! They do have a very stylish menu, I'll give them that.) And these came with a complementary¬†Kochubata and Begunpora.

Nothing to say about the Bhat and the Musur¬†Dal. They were as normal as ever. The rice was well cooked, not too dry, nor too sticky.

You have to start with the Kochubata and the Begunpora, mixed with plain rice.
I didn't get any hint of 'kochu' in the Kochubata, only an overload of grated coconut and green chillies.
The Begunpora was awesomely prepared, though. With chillies and onions and all, it was one of the best I've had.

The Panch Mishali Lutoputi¬†Tarkari was okay. Homely preparation, made up of a variety of assorted vegetables.

The Murgir¬†Dukbanglow ¬†is a preparation consisting of two pieces of chicken and an egg in a spicy gravy. Just had a taste, it was devoured by my friends.

The Dhakai Kormar Praner Jhalak was another chicken preparation with two pieces of chicken in gravy. It is sweet in taste, the thick gravy made up of pasted cashew and containing bits of the nut. I found it awesome. And it is a perfect side dish with roti.

The Anarasher Talvanga¬†Plastic Chutney was good. It's gravy had very little sweet in it (which is, to me, a big sweet lover, inexcusable in case of any Chatni), but that sweetlessness brought out the raw fruity taste of the pineapple when you had it, so it felt good in the ¬†mouth. Do not expect to find this fruity taste when you lick the plain gravy at the end, though. Also, the Chatni¬†probably had some yellow colouring matter, for our fingertips were stained yellow after washing.

All in all, a good experience. And it is also pocket friendly. You may try it if you want to.

I tried this small restaurant a few times and this is the place I continue to visit if I am craving for Bengali food. It is located in between Golpark and Gariahat just beside Raymond Showroom.
The best part is the complimentary dishes that they provide, usually it's 'Kochu Bata' (Taro paste in English) and either 'Begun Bharta'(smashed Brinjal) or 'Saak Bhaja' (Fried Spinach) and at the end the 'Paan er Sarbat' (Drink made out of Betel leaf)

The fish items are mostly good, although the last time 'Chitol Mach' was not at all fresh. 'Daab Chingri' and 'Ilish Mach' can be the best bet.

Out of the side dishes, I loved 'Mocha Chingri'. Give it a try.
This place is quite popular among the shopaholics who visit Gariahat for shopping.

Overall experience is good, but the place can be cleaner, especially the wash basin area. Hence giving 3.5

Chances upon this restaurant after a busy evening of shopping in gariahat with my mother. This place is hidden from view due to many hawkers nearby and can be easily missed. The place seems new'ish. Its a Bengali themed restaurant and the waiters wear traditional Bengali "panjabi". There is nothing special about this restaurant. Food is hardly ok. My mother had a masala Dosa and I ordered a paper masala Dosa. I could not find any difference between the two dishes,they looked the same completely. Paper dosa is supposed to very crispy and of a different texture altogether than the regular dosa,which it was not. The sambhar had a very thick consistency and didn't taste like how sambhar normally should. The alu inside the dosa was ok. They served payesh with the dosa,which I found quite amusing and :-p. The payesh was good in taste.We also had kulfi. The amount of kulfi served was a lot. However,my mother complained about the thinness of the falooda. I wish they increase the standard of their food in future :-)

Visited this place with my family for a lunch. We wanted to try authentic dishes of East Bengal. We had ordered kochu shaak, kochu bata, koraisuti deoa moog daal, aloo bhaja, daab chingri, mutton dak bungalow, sada bhaat. All these came after waiting for a long time. The moog daal tasted like sugar syrup. The daab chingri was not edible at all. It was too sweet to be a daab chingri. Mutton was not cooked well. The only edible thing was the kochushaak. The quantity served was very little.

Worst service. Menu card torn and dirty. AC not working. When asked about the same waiter replied that it's not their duty. Ask the manager at the counter. Food not good. It's better to go Hindu hotel in CIT marker. Atleast they serve good food.

It's a small place at the ever busy gariyahat more.
There's practically nothing interesting about the interiors... n the fact that the entire staff wears traditional Bengali attire is rather funny.
Coming to the food....
We had aam panna sharbat , bhhat , muger daak, shukto ,kochu saag with kucho chingri , a big shorshe iilish n mutton dak bungalow.
The kochu saag was good, n so was the mutton.
The iilish was quite average,
The shukto was a big turnoff.... yellow n thin shorba that lacked the authentic bangal taste.
I missed the fact that they don't have the thali system which makes you choose individual dishes.
The menu is extensive n exhaustive. The service was fast... but I REALLY wish they do something with the interiors....
Pest n fly nuisance is just not acceptable in any restaurant.

Chances upon this restaurant after a busy evening of shopping in gariahat with my mother. This place is hidden from view due to many hawkers nearby and can be easily missed. The place seems new'ish. Its a Bengali themed restaurant and the waiters wear traditional Bengali "panjabi". There is nothing special about this restaurant. Food is hardly ok. My mother had a masala Dosa and I ordered a paper masala Dosa. I could not find any difference between the two dishes,they looked the same completely. Paper dosa is supposed to very crispy and of a different texture altogether than the regular dosa,which it was not. The sambhar had a very thick consistency and didn't taste like how sambhar normally should. The alu inside the dosa was ok. They served payesh with the dosa,which I found quite amusing and :-p. The payesh was good in taste.We also had kulfi. The amount of kulfi served was a lot. However,my mother complained about the thinness of the falooda. I wish they increase the standard of their food in future :-)

Visited this place with my family for a lunch. We wanted to try authentic dishes of East Bengal. We had ordered kochu shaak, kochu bata, koraisuti deoa moog daal, aloo bhaja, daab chingri, mutton dak bungalow, sada bhaat. All these came after waiting for a long time. The moog daal tasted like sugar syrup. The daab chingri was not edible at all. It was too sweet to be a daab chingri. Mutton was not cooked well. The only edible thing was the kochushaak. The quantity served was very little.

Cost effective...but to be cost effective they have perhaps compromised with the other aspects like food quality,cleanliness....located at gariahat it is easily missed because of the hawker stalls which hides it from view...not very clean...ambience pretty ordinary....not even have a decent washroom

coming to food, simply put, ordered badshai polao,daab chingri,ilish bhapa(although the names in the menu card are rather complicatedly fancy)

the polao lacked taste

the daab chingri though the gravy was pretty god but the 4 prawn pieces were rather small

ilish bhapa was the best of the lot....a pretty big portion sized ilish in mustard gravy wrapped in banana leaf ¬†and it came for 250 bucks which is pretty economical if you compare with its peers

it's been 3 years now being the regular old visitor of this restaurant. It started when I was in 3rd year of college spending my afternoon searching for bengali cuisine to satisfy my bengali belly, and came across to this restaurant. Affordable quality bengali dishes with right amount of spices and balance of flavours. I am a "Vojonroshik Bengali" and I been through most of the bengali cuisine restaurant, but in terms of affordable cost and quality, THIS IS IT.¬†

they been consistent with their quality for 3 years now, at least with me. Though I hardly explored their vast list of side dishes, still the complimentary "KOCHU BATA" & "BEGUN PORA" OR "DAL BORA" is something i never missed out, nor they missed out to give. If they do, tell them to give you the "KOCHU BATA", it is heaven. ¬†

So I will suggest to all my "Veto Bangali" friends, once try this place out, I think you will like it.¬†
(Their fish dishes are slightly better than chicken or mutton dishes)

This place is hard to locate as it is situated in the midst of the busiest Street shopping area of the city. The entrance is overcrowded with hawkers, therefore the place is noisy. The waiters are polite though.

Ordered steamed rice which was superfine and cooked to perfection. The complimentary items included saak bhaja and maan kochu bata, which were pretty good to begin with. Ordered posto bora, bhuna chhana, ilish macher matha diye kochu saak, ilish paturi, daab chingri, niramish mangso, followed by amsotter chatni.

The posto-bora (poppy seed nuggets) were nice and crisp. Chhanar-bhuna (scrambled cottage cheese) was quite a twist in comparison to the popular chanar-dalna. Did not like the combination of kochu-saak (colocasia stems) and ilish-muro (Hilsha head). The ilish-paturi (Hilsha steamed in banana leaves) came in very good portion but was a bit too oily. Daab-chingri (prawns cooked with tender coconut in coconut shell) was delicious. The prawns were good in size and decent in quantity. The preparation was a clear winner. Niramish-mangsho (mutton cooked without onion and garlic) was light and interesting in flavour, however was nothing over the top. Amsotter chutney (sweet chutney cooked with mango lather) was under seasoned.

We ended up the dinner with kachagolla and chhanar malpoa, which did wrap up the dinner perfectly.

This place if I am not wrong had a south Indian restaurant called 'SONALI' when we were kids. Anyway, these guys are great in their job. I enjoy their style of Cooking. Typical 'Bangal' who knows their 'Shorshe Bata' in Pabdar Jhaal and 'Tel' in Tel Koi too well to be corrected. I love their Loitar Jhuri and Chitol Muitha...what a variety of fish items served here !! As i write, I salivate and that's a confession I am ready to make public. Their Bok Phul Bhaja and Man Kachu Bata are some of the many dishes to die for. Here you don't need a silver fork to eat Good food. Sorry, I have to stop as I am way too hungry.......One suggestion, please open up a few more branches.

I wanted to have crab,mom wanted fish and dad wanted mutton for sunday lunch..but we didn't want to go out and spend a fortune..so the only place we could think of was Padmaparer Rannaghar...formerly known as Sonali,I have spent many an evening in their quaint Gariahat outlet with my parents munching on chop and dhosa- they have a variety of them..they have amazing authentic Bengali fare and an illustrous and extensive menu...which does NOT dig a hole in your wallet...We ordered 2 pulaos,2 mutton dishes,1 fish and 1 crab and home delivered it for just a thousand bucks- with ZERO service charge/service tax. They also give complememtary kochu bata and begun pora with every meal you order.It is one of my most favourite places for Bengali fare and I hope they keep up the good work.

Well, this place was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING for me. It was suggested by a very dear friend of mine. So we went here on last Tuesday. I had checked their menu on Zomato n had pre chosen Mutton Samosa. The moment I ordered the same the waiter said that its not available. I then chose Fish Roll to which the reply was the same, i.e. not available. To my awe the waiter commented that am ordering all the items that aren't available. As if it was my Damn fault that they had mentioned those on the menu n failed to serve. Lolz. Then we ordered Fish Fry, Egg Devil, Mochar Chop, Prawn Cutlet n Chicken Cutlet. The chicken cutlet was average. The egg devil was just a boiled egg fried in a coat of batter with very little filling it in, it was dry n horrible. The Mochar Chop didn't have any salt n so the natural sweetness of the banana flower overpowered the supposed to b savoury dish. The fish fry was good but the prawn cutlet was amazing. The dessert that we ordered, Malpua n Kulfi Faluda were good.
I ended up eating 2 as I had to throw the rest. I took Chingri Malai curry Yellow Mishti Pulao n Potoler Dolma home. My family wasn't excited as well. The Malai curry was ok n so was the Pulao. But the Kochubata which is a complimentary accompaniment with the Pulao had a rotten stench n the the skin of the Potol or Parwal was raw n scaly.
Overall, I will never go there.

"One should never judge something by its appearance". This sentence fits for this place perfectly. The entrance is not good. The sitting arrangements are dull. The hospitality is good.
But the *food is absolutely top notch*. I never expected that the food will be so good on my first visit. One just can't complain about it. 
You will feel that the foods are from your mother's kitchen. It's all traditional. The way a Bengali dish should be prepared, and it has the touch of the 'opar bangla'. 
They serve a mocktail of beetle leaf, which is very much unique.

The interior's simple and practical but the food is the one thing which makes it a great place to dine. Every dish we had was extremely tasty and satisfying. The complimentary chutney which they give is awesome....so is the paan patar ros. Every item was cooked properly..... with love( so it seemed üòÄ). Also the cherry on the cake is that the prices are extremely reasonable.

This place is ¬†gariahat market, somewhere next to the huge Senco outlet..if you have a hankering for bengali meal one fine day, instead of heading of to the much hyped 6 Ballygunge Place or Bhojohori Manna, just give it a shot.

The stewards are courteous and polite and will try to help you in ordering, what they dont tell you off course, is the complimentary dishes ( tiny portions but nevertheless heavenly) is a real treat. So the steaming bowl of rice ( 1 and a half is good enough for two people) comes with Kochu bata and begun bharta...and tastes absolute yumm. The side dishes that follow ( out of the menu) are average but not disappointing. Dessert choices are interesting and has many seasonal delicacies which are a must try during the cold winter afternoons. Finally to round it up, paan shorbot , a interesting complimentary offering comes in shot glasses to complete your meal..

All complimentary dishes are best offerings, and majority of paid dishes are a let down. I know, I know, you are thinking if one can order just a plate of rice and gulp it down with free kochu bata and begun bharta, gorom gorom ! 

On a serious note, it is sad that most of the fish dishes (crab and kakra) came in pre-cooked gravy, the over-fried bok phul tasted only of besan, the murighonto dal, decent though, had a slightly stale fish head dropped later into dal, and worse of all, the morola-macher-tok was so bitter that it had to be returned. 

The dab-chingri and gokul pithe saved the day and were really good out of the paid dishes. The complimentary dishes, though good, weren't outstanding - kochu bata needed more jhajh (pungency), begun bharta needed more heat, and paan pata sorbot a little less sugar. 

Finally, this place is really pocket friendly, and I can hope a meal on any other day might be better. Money-wise you have nothing to lose out, if you drop in once or twice, if you feel like it, that ways. You get the idea, no ?

Easily one of the better places for Bengali Cusine, esp since it comfortably straddles east and west bengal. The service is a shade better than the Kolkata standard. There is a complimentary offering which is an innovative way of getting trails for the menu.

The location is very good but its easy to miss the entrance  in the crowd of hawkers.

Its perhaps the location and the inheritance from the earlier ¬†out let ¬†that is responsible for the masala dosa in the menu

Menu card is quite elaborate & items are coined quite interestingly...

Food taste is average. Stewards were quite cordial & eager to suggest combinations if you are going for a-la-carte.

They offer a Veg & Non-veg Thali as well at a competitive price point. 

Portions are quite filling & you might have to ask them to pack a substantial amount at the end found on the plate as unconsumed, if you are going for a-la-carte & have ordered impulsively.

Being a Vegetarian- I tried their Pulao, Dhoka, Aloor Dum, Chanar Dalna. I appreciated their complimentary Daler Bora & Kochu Shaag. Fragrance of freshly cut Gandharaaj Lebu on the adjacent plate enhanced the fullness of the offering.

Ideal place for working class people who are looking for a lunch at a decent place around Gariahat. 

Weekend dinner can always be ordered as well from this place if you stay nearby.

Don't miss the complimentary 'Pan Sharbat' at the end of your dinner !!!

This is where once Sonali restaurant, the popular south indian eatery used to be for decades, located at a prime location, a stone's throw from gariahat x-ing. Refurbished and rechristened as Padmaparer Rannaghar, the cuisine has shifted to cater more of bengali delicacies. The south Indian option has been kept as snacks and quick bites. Coming down to the menu, its like a magazine, i exactly do not remember how many pages but it gives you choices same like of bhojohori manna, sabji, dal, chicken, mutton, fish, prawn, crab, everyone will get somehing of their choice, be it veg or non veg, they also serve you a complementary begun bharta and kochu bata if you order a bengali meal, service is ok, they serve quick, the decor and odour of the place is fine, prices are average. I ordered simple plain dehradun basmati rice, koraishutir moong dal, mutton kasha and alu bhaji. Bengali food is not complete without an added pinch of kacha lonka and personally i had to struggle with mutton kasha, it was simply too jhal for my poor mouth. Otherwise food is above average.

We visited the resturant last week. The ambience is not very impressive. Most of options in the food menu is not available.  But the food quality is good.

Recently, after a gap of four long years, I visited this restaurant for lunch. Being an ardent follower of this restaurant for the past five years, I found my last visit to be rather more dissapointing than memorable.
My gang and I ordered for Bhetki and Ilish Paturi, Holud-Misti Polao, Chitol Maccher Peti, Chicken Dakbanglow and Mutton Kosha.
The Polao, we ordered was stale enough to emit a fowl smell. On requesting for a fresh batch, we noticed that the portion, served to us was way lesser than what we had returned to the kitchen.
None of the fish was fresh and rather tasted like they have been frozen for a very long time.
Speaking of the complimentary entr√©es, they promote to serve, we got cold and not-so-fresh Daaler Bora and Kochu Bataa. Our waiting staff informed us that they are currently not serving the Maccher Dimer Bora. On the other hand, the Paan Pataa shots were half a glass for all of us. Disappointing!

I had some expectation from this place because of its name and curious names of their menu items as well. The person(s) who assigned names to the items certainly has/have some creative flairs. I along with 3 friends had a dinner over there just before the Durja Puja of 2015. This is a small place and there is nothing really to say about its interior decoration. Just ordinary. I didn't check out their washroom, so can't tell how it is. But certainly the position of the washbasin is quite awkward. You can see an open kitchen just behind and I overheard expletives shared among people working there. This was not taken by me in good spirits. They perhaps don't bother whether women or kids are using the washbasin. This definitely deducted some marks as I would think before taking my family over there next time. Coming to the foods, we ordered Fish Fry as starter, Nayanananda Sada Bhat, Macher Mukta-Kanther Mug Dal, Sarbattom Posto Bora, Mutton Special & Fresh Lime Soda. Well, the Fish Fry was definitely costly and nothing special. You can have better fish fry in cheaper price elsewhere. Mug Dal was tasty. Posto Bara was so-so. Mutton was good in taste. Well, I cannot say any item was extraordinary. Ahh, they also served some complimentary items like Kochu Bata (after the main course began), Begun Bhorta, Narkeler Bora (during the main course) and Pan Patar Rosh (after we finished). Among these, Kochu Bata was very good, Begun Bhorta okay and Narkeler Bora stale. After Fresh Lime Soda, Pan Patar Rosh didn't taste good.¬†Overall, an ordinary experience. I would like to visit this place again and try out other dishes before giving my final verdict on this restaurant. It has a good point - staffs are well behaved.¬†Note: I deducted a few more marks as much to our irritation, a couple of flies roamed around us.

Went for lunch here with my family after reading the reviews @ Zomato. The experience though wasn't all that pleasant. We had ordered macch er matha diye dal, rice, aloo bhaja, vetki maccher paturi, ilish bhapa and kochi pathar jhol. As the food arrived, ilish bhapa was missing. We pointed the same out to the person serving us. The complimentary kochu bata and the dal were really good. The paturi was okay too. When we again enquired about the ilish, they made us wait for another 15 mins to inform that ilish is not a available. what was the point of taking the order in the first place and make us wait? They should have communicated the same earlier. We were really disappointed with Padmapar.

Been to this resturent once for lunch, the food is really tasty and fresh...the flavours are authentic bengali and prices are really reasonable. The staffs are welcoming and the service is timely. I precise have not much to complain, its a nice food joint just that the interiors and sitting arrangements are not much upmarket but that does not take away anything from them. I tried the Chitol and Loochi and they reminded me of my Grandma's kitchen üòä  Lastly the pan patar sorbet is an excellent serving...go for it folks if you wanna treat your Bong taste buds üòä

We visited here few weeks back without a plan. Here bengali dishes are affordable and tasty. Ambience is not good, washroom is like hell but food quality is heavenly. Drawback is many dishes are not available all the time and therefore they offer compliments of kochu bata, that's something you must not miss. Here veg dishes are superior to non vegs.

After shopping went there today for having our lunch. We have ordered halud misti polao and murgir duckbunglow. The amount of polao was enough but the gravy served with chicken was not sufficient. Taste and quality was up to the mark. They have served taler bora, daal bora and kachu bata as complementary dishes. Service was prompt. The ambiance was also good. Overall a nice experience.

This is another long pending review that I am going to clear today. My expression on this joint is like "Wow wOw woW wow WOW". Good food, good cost, cheap and good food again. Eye catcher is the serving persons wearing traditional kurta/pajama and the names of the dishes. I had Muger Daal, Posto Bora, Jhurjhure Aloo Bhaja, Dhokar dalna, Khasir Mangsho. And I enjoyed to my last taste bud. My companions had Machher Matha diye Kochu Shaak, Elish Bhapa and Daab Chingri. And those were also yummilicious. Oh yeah let's talk about the complementaries. Musur Daler Bora, Mann Kochu Baata and Taaler Bora(seasonal) and last but not the least Paaner Shorbot. What else????? Easy on your pocket. To recommend I will mention 
1. a good washroom
2. Cleaner attire
Otherwise keep serving good food and would love to hit again and again.

Went there for lunch today. Was a bit taken aback by the staff wearing traditional attire (kurta and dhuti). The food was really tasty and good. Had ordered mishti pulao and chicken dakbanglo. Very prompt service as well. Reasonably priced menu. Ambience is also good. Yet i was a bit disappointed with the PAYESH. Such an important sish for bongs yet it was nt good at all. The milk was too much watery and thin. Really hoping to get a decent payesh next time.

One of the best Bengali restaurants in Kolkata. Dugdhadhabal mangser pulao and kasha murgi and ilish bhapa are simply lip smacking. The people are good, the Waiter dressed in traditional Bengali attire panjabi and dhuti suit the name and food served. If u r in for snacks then you have a wide variety of dosas to select from.

The name itself is so attractive that I went for an impulsive evening snacking few days back. They do have a wide variety of items on their menu. I was alone and hungry, so i settled for a Chicken Dosa which my neighbour had ordered too. It seemed to be a popular choice there specially in the evenings. Dosa arrived in few minutes stuffed with well-cooked chicken keema n spices. It took me alot of time n effort to finish the whole Dosa alone as it was extremely filling and quite big fr 1 person alone to finish. Will have to try their other items too before giving a more detailed review of this place.

Being pure Ghoti, we were quite fascinated to taste a bit of other side of 'Padmapar' :) ... And it did not disappoint us. The food were tasty and were served in traditional way. The 'Punjabi' clad waiters were prompt, caring and attentive. The complementary food 'man kachu bata' was a surprise of taste but the 'sorse ilish' we were dying to taste didn't meet our expectation. The interior could have been more beautiful, traditional and matching with the its name. Though, we wouldn't hesitate to come back for trying more dishes here.

I have walked passed this restaurant a zillion times and finally decided to check it out recently.A Bengali restaurant needs to be brilliant to satisfy the taste buds of an average foodie Bengali..and this place was fairly good.I enjoyed the coconut chutney they served as an accompaniment.the pabda shorshe was decent.the bhetki paturi could be better.the pathar jhol reminded me of rainy Sundays at home.But the dish I really loved was the machher matha dewa mug dal.
Worth a visit for cheap yet good Bengali food.

This restaurant is located in Gariahat and it serves some really delicious Bengali food.The preparations in Chingri(Prawns) are a delight for the taste buds..the mutton also tastes great here. However, the polao which we had ordered really needs some improvement. Overall food quality and quantity is fabulous. However, the staff is not that courteous and needs to learn a lesson or two for etiquettes and mannerism, which is probably the only shortcoming with this place.

Padmaparer Rannaghar came into existence after having ousted Sonali Restaurant - a South Indian Joint, one of my favourite places for a quick snack. Imagine my surprise when I found Sonali gone and Padmaparer....sitting pretty in its place. Anyway, I have tried their food. It appears that they have retained the South Indian cook from Sonali so that you can still avail of dosas, but I was not interested in it. What interested me was the variety of the menu. So many items I have never seen. Added to it they give you a small pamphlet containing a long poem about fish.
So many varieties of fish items I have never seen in any other authentic Bengali restaurant.

The first time I went there I asked whether any Bengali snack is available. What is authentic Bengali snack? Luchi Chholar dal, kachuri etc. They brought me mochar chop, two long cylindrical deep fried chops made of banana flower. They were tasty but too heavy for one person. Why they didn't have things like fuluri etc. beats me. Of course, they have other chops and cutlets too

Next time I went with the desire to taste some of the authentic fish dishes. The waiter was a smiling young man and he was glad to help me. After mutual discussion, I decided to have shutki paturi - something I have never tasted before in my life, mourola machher tak,     Chital muithya, big hilsa fry, and lote machher jhuri with plain masoor dal and rice. Before ordering for shutki paturi, I was warned that the smell may not be palatable, but I decided to try it once and for all. It came wrapped in laupata. The taste was not bad, though I admit that the thing smelt like a leather shoe. Rice and dal were good. I liked the way they arranged the salad comprising of lemons and green chillies. The jhuri tasted fun and went well with dal. The muthiya were tasty, though a bit small in size. Hilsa pieces were big and tasted great. The tak I didn't like as it was too salty and less sour. I had expected a sweet and sour taste and I was disappointed. 

However whatever little problem was melted away with the presence of the ever- caring waiter, who really treated me like a queen. When I finished eating, he promptly gave me a sweet lime soda without asking, knowing that it would help in digestion. For dessert, I took Mishti doi and there is nothing special in it. Lastly they handed me a pan sharbat which  was complimentary. I was surprised and touched. The green sharbat made of minced pan leaves immediately freshened me up.

They should do something to renovate the decor though. I am more than happy with the service and behaviour.

For Lovers of Food - Must visit once!!!
Though ambience is average but Food will definitely not disappoint you
And best part is that it's neat and reasonably priced 
Complimentary Kochu bata was so awesome n tasteful that one can finish full meal with that n rice
Had taken labongo ghee bhaat - that with kochu bata was heavenly
There was a Bangladeshi dal preparation with vegetables - lovely
Kosha mutton and mustard fish - nice preparation

End was delightful when we got Pan patta sharbat as complimentary - awesome - never before heard of it

Tasteful journey...

Must go if you love food
Avoid if classy ambience is important

The name Padmaparer Rannaghar maybe refers to the non vegetarian items that are supposed to be vegetarian delights. Egg dosa or Chicken Dosa are terms not unheard of but sure it surprises you as you do not how it will be presented. Well, the outer layer is just like any other dosa. What changes according to the name is the masala. We had ordered paper dosa and paper chicken dosa. The paper dosa was alright barring the sides where it was burnt. They have not mastered the art of making dosa. Somehow that's surprising. Any South Indian joint that charges quite a bit for their food is supposed to have achieved that. The chicken dosa was nice but the quantity of chicken seemed a bit less. You may want to go there or you may not. The decision is entirely yours, but don't expect value for money. 

P.S : the restaurant had a peculiar odour and the loo is like a furnace.

Uniqueness - Name of the items.

Detailed description-
Ordered boro ilish vapa & boro sorse ilish. Looked very nice but taste was not that good. May be due to the time I have ordered the food (jun 1st week usually not proper time for ilish) 
Chitiol macher muithya was good.
Echor chingri was okay, not that good.

Price is moderate. Even it seems bit higher if you judge with the taste of the items.

Firstly it is difficult to find this place if you are inattentive due to the huge hawker establishments. For first timers, suggest you to walk outside the footpath and keep an eye upwards on the big signboard which is visible only on a straight view.
The first thing that strikes the eye is that every staff member wears a pajama and punjabi keeping with the Bengali theme of the place.
A good thing is that they offer half plate rice which keeps us from ordering a full plate when we are unsure of being able to eat the entire dish.
Mankochu paatar baata and Note shaak was complementary and quite tasty.
The shukto seemed hastily made.
Moong daal with koraishuti and aloo bhaja was up to the mark.
Coming to the fishes- Bhetki maacher paturi was average, Chingri maacher malai curry is too sweet. Its advisable to save rice to eat along with it else it may taste a bit too sweet. The killer item in the whole menu is the Chittol maacher preparation. It is one of the best dishes I have had. You can have an entire plate of rice only with it.
The maalpua isn't that good.
Instead of the regular paan, they serve paan er juice in a small wine glass which I think is natural and not a flavoured one, which is quite an innovation.
Overall the prices are quite pocket friendly with the fish dishes having its usual high price but the chittol maach is totally worth it!

This place is @ the heart of gariahat.
May b due to congested atmosphere of roadside shops u can not find dis restaurant easily..BT if  u r too familiar with garihat  den u can find it with a ease.
Neways I should come to the point.
Atmosphere of dis  restaurant is quite nice. Many seats are there...the waiters are serving with proper Bengali dresses. Bt the behaviours of them are not quite up to the mark.
Though its a bengali restaurant still their south Indian dishes are very nice.
In Bengali dishes you will get A  to Z.
Taste is good.
Even I ve tried their snacks portion(fish kabiraji,fish finger,fish cutlet) many times. those are also satisfactory.
Overall my experience WS good.Bt BT BT. When I last tym visited this restaurant I found some little cockroaches were roaming here and there....its totally uncool for d customers. They should maintain their hygiene first.
APart from dis there is no complain against them.
If u r a regular visitor of gariahat.give dis restaurant a visit.

The name Padmaparer Rannaghar maybe refers to the non vegetarian items that are supposed to be vegetarian delights. Egg dosa or Chicken Dosa are terms not unheard of but sure it surprises you as you do not how it will be presented. Well, the outer layer is just like any other dosa. What changes according to the name is the masala. We had ordered paper dosa and paper chicken dosa. The paper dosa was alright barring the sides where it was burnt. They have not mastered the art of making dosa. Somehow that's surprising. Any South Indian joint that charges quite a bit for their food is supposed to have achieved that. The chicken dosa was nice but the quantity of chicken seemed a bit less. You may want to go there or you may not. The decision is entirely yours, but don't expect value for money. 

P.S : the restaurant had a peculiar odour and the loo is like a furnace.

Type : Pure bengali food
Quick rating -
Environment 2.5/5
Service 3/5
Menu items 4/5
Looks of served of 4.5/5
Food taste 3.5/5
Price 3.5/5
Uniqueness - Name of the items.

Detailed description-
Ordered boro ilish vapa & boro sorse ilish. Looked very nice but taste was not that good. May be due to the time I have ordered the food (jun 1st week usually not proper time for ilish) 
Chitiol macher muithya was good.
Echor chingri was okay, not that good.

Price is moderate. Even it seems bit higher if you judge with the taste of the items. 
I wont recommend bengali food lovers this place.

Firstly it is difficult to find this place if you are inattentive due to the huge hawker establishments. For first timers, suggest you to walk outside the footpath and keep an eye upwards on the big signboard which is visible only on a straight view.
The first thing that strikes the eye is that every staff member wears a pajama and punjabi keeping with the Bengali theme of the place.
A good thing is that they offer half plate rice which keeps us from ordering a full plate when we are unsure of being able to eat the entire dish.
Mankochu paatar baata and Note shaak was complementary and quite tasty.
The shukto seemed hastily made.
Moong daal with koraishuti and aloo bhaja was up to the mark.
Coming to the fishes- Bhetki maacher paturi was average, Chingri maacher malai curry is too sweet. Its advisable to save rice to eat along with it else it may taste a bit too sweet. The killer item in the whole menu is the Chittol maacher preparation. It is one of the best dishes I have had. You can have an entire plate of rice only with it.
The maalpua isn't that good.
Instead of the regular paan, they serve paan er juice in a small wine glass which I think is natural and not a flavoured one, which is quite an innovation.
Overall the prices are quite pocket friendly with the fish dishes having its usual high price but the chittol maach is totally worth it!

This place is @ the heart of gariahat.
May b due to congested atmosphere of roadside shops u can not find dis restaurant easily..BT if  u r too familiar with garihat  den u can find it with a ease.
Neways I should come to the point.
Atmosphere of dis  restaurant is quite nice. Many seats are there...the waiters are serving with proper Bengali dresses. Bt the behaviours of them are not quite up to the mark.
Though its a bengali restaurant still their south Indian dishes are very nice.
In Bengali dishes you will get A  to Z.
Taste is good.
Even I ve tried their snacks portion(fish kabiraji,fish finger,fish cutlet) many times. those are also satisfactory.
Overall my experience WS good.Bt BT BT. When I last tym visited this restaurant I found some little cockroaches were roaming here and there....its totally uncool for d customers. They should maintain their hygiene first.
APart from dis there is no complain against them.
If u r a regular visitor of gariahat.give dis restaurant a visit.

The authentic taste of bengali food have pulled me there again and again... The ambience is sort of okay but it hardly matters when the food which is served to you is simply fantastic...

Went there yesterday with a friend for dinner and ordered RICE, MACHHER MATHA DIYE MUGDAL, POSTOR BORA,  POTOL ER CHHANA BHORA DOLMA, DIM POSTO. And as complimentary we got MANKOCHU BATA & KOLMI SHAK.
1. Menu:- 3/5 u wouldn't get all the items. We ordered NARKEL BORA, but nothing but POSTOR BORA was available. Only AAM ER CHATNI was available.
2. Service:- 4.5/5 warm welcome, helpful, suggestive,  mouth full of smile. Prompt service and respects one's privacy.
3. Food quality:- 3.5/5 Mankochu bata was awesome. Dal was good, potol er dolma was bit more salty, dim posto was blunt. Kolmi shak was undercooked.
4. Ambience:- 3/5 gd but the giant TV and its loud volume distracts u from enjoying ur food. It's better to keep it in a mute mode.
5. Pocket-friendly:- 5/5 fully, the bill was not even 500/- !!! 
6. Misc:- 4/5 some other aspects like , utensils, food decoration & quantity, traditional dresses of the stuffs, were good. Just need to change the finger bowls.
Hope to visit again soon.

What I should mentioned 1st: this seems to be a big underrated restaurant.
This is a small restaurant but when it comes to taste it is a giant :)
If u really want to taste good Bengali food this one is a must visit for you.
Only ala carte is available here. But the price is really reasonable. So, try it once. It will be a great enough experience to visit it again.

This place is really good. Keep walking along the footpath from Gariahat more towards Golpark on the Union Bank of India side and you'll locate this place on your right. 

It's a place serving traditional Bengali delicacies, but I opted for Cheese Dosa and Dim er Devil because it was 4pm.

The Dosa was beautifully done and the size was really good. The cheese was in generous shreds and they also serve a bowl of paayesh with the compulsory sambar and chutney. The Dim er Devil came as a surprise. It was HUGE. Not because of the beet and carrot filling between the egg, but because the egg itself was really big. I don't know how. Anyways, it was damn tasty and the filling of beets, carrots added sweetness and crunch. The coating was very thin and crispy, just the way I like. They serve two Devils per plate and frankly speaking, it's more than enough.

The ambiance is really good and the service was a bit slow. The waiters wear traditional punjabi kurtas and pyjamas and it adds to the name of this restaurant. Hopefully, I will savour their Bangali food in the near future.

A very good place to eat Bengali food. Specifically the "opar Bangla" cuisine. The menu card is very interesting one to read.
Kachu shak cuisines were really delicious. Hilsa is very good to enjoy. Daab chingri was my favourite among the prawn dishes.
The cost is justified by its taste.
*** Not a very good place for Chinese.

So far I have tried out the Bengali cuisine, the snacks and all taste quite good. Though the snacks are a bit overpriced, one wouldnt mind considering the quantity they serve. Here I would like to mention the dahi vada..wow just wow!! It seems just correct in every thing, the taste, softness, the smooth texture of dahi. They also serve excellent fish items. The waiters wear kurta pajamas..isnt that cute! ;)

We visited this place around 2 months back and this review was due for quite a long time. Actually, I have been to this place earlier also but somehow not tried their actual bengali delicacies. But last time when we visited I made it a point to order authentic bengali food. Being a great admirer of Bengali food, we ordered bhappa illish and some item with head of illish fish (I don't remember the name of the item). The food was really awesome. Thanks to an earlier review where I learnt that one has to go Illish big not small on the menu. Their complementary Man Kachu bata and Begun pura was also heavenly.¬†
Overall it was very nice experience and I would like to go to this place again and again. I deducted 0.5 rating for their washroom area

To be totally honest, I had never heard of this place. Was looking for a place to go for lunch and someone suggested this place. A trip to it's page in zomato convinced me to go there. First of all, the ambiance. Let's get one thing clear, this place is not for fine dining and they don't pretend to be either. The ambiance is what Bengali food culture is all about, eating together. So although we were somewhat conservative about sharing our table with another couple, it soon turned out to be outright fun. Now the main thing, the food! We ordered ghee-bhat (I am abstaining from using the tongue-twisting names), the smell of which was just....orgasmic...there, I said it. And the complementary Maankochu bata was simply heavenly, you can come here and taste just this and I assure you'll go home smiling. Begun pora was another complementary dish which was so-so. The Macher matha diye dal was also fine. The Lote Machher Bharta and Alubhaja complemented it very well (as we all know from childhood). Then came Sorshe Parshe which was also very good. But the star of the show was the Kosha Mangsho. Tasty would be an embarrassingly insufficient description of this dish. The tender succulent juicy mutton pieces, the spicy and tangy curry, with the aromatic ghee-bhat! Need I say more? A trip to this place is highly recommended. 5 out of 5.

If you are a real buff of authentic bengali food, then this is the place to be. Small AC restaurant right near the gariahat crossing... the entrance and the interior will not please you enough, until and unless you taste the food. The waiters in ethnic kurta payjama are very courteous and are well informed about the entire menu. The best thing about this place is the wide variety of food in the menu and there is no problem with the unavailability of items, unlike other well known bengali restaurants. Huge variety of veg preparations as well as the non veg with special mention of the variety of fish items. They even have "shutki" in the menu which can rarely be found in other places. Much appreciated are the complimentary stuffs being provided with the food which included "maankochu bata" in the beginning, which tasted heavenly, spicy "begun pora", and also small paan flavoured drinks in shot glasses at the end, which really completed the meal. Prices are reasonable enough. On the whole a total value for money.

Visited first time on Kalipuja 2014. Just awesome. Every Bangal must visit. Ghatis make a concerned approach only if you want to venture East Bengal food. Some Ghati items available as well. But don't make negative remarks. Our cuisine is ours. Also don't expect too much of luxury and ambience, just decent. Concentrate on the food. The people are courteous.

First visited this restaurant during its inception days and then many more.
Bengalis,specially with nostalgic fond remembrance of opaar bangla (Bangladesh) from the stories you got to hear since childhood, would definitely find this eatery interesting.
Grandmas and mothers have inculcated a deep feeling of the yesteryears delicacies within us ,which we can relive now and again from places like Padmaparer Rannaghar .
The complementary Kochu bata with steamed rice always waters my mouth and the best recommendation for this place.
Go, eat,drool and celebrate our native!

We were interested in trying Koshe Kosha at Golpark on Dashami, but found it closed. Then I remembered about a friend mentioning about this place near Gariahat crossing and pronto we walked across.

The place was not very crowded. The wait staff were in traditional attire. The menu was a long list of items, and the pricing seemed reasonable. We wanted to try Ilish, so ordered sorse ilish along with rice, musur dal and Topshe fry.

While we waited for the food, I went to the wash basin area which was quite dirty. When the plates were laid out, one of them was dirty, and it was changed. So we became fairly apprehensive.

The food was served in 10 minutes. They serve a complementary Kochu Bata which was just awesome. I was having this after a long time and savored with rice. The dal was average, but the Topse Fry was crispy.¬†

Then came the hilsa. I was surprised to find that it was a piece towards the tail (lyaja) of the fish. I refused to accept it. Then they said that they provide such Ilish pieces for Rs 250. If I wanted a proper round piece I will have to order a Jumbo Ilish for Rs 300. God knows what prevented them to say this when I was placing the order.

I changed my order and the Jumbo Ilish came in about 10 minutes more. It was a large piece and the quality of fish was quite good. The mustard gravy was nothing spectacular. Being from Hyderabad, where the hilsas we get have hardly any taste, we were overjoyed to eat a tasty fish for a change - so I am not complaining.

The bill for all the above came to Rs 600. The place needs to definitely improve on their hygiene factor. Also a little more responsiveness while taking the order.

I shot down all the valiant attempts by my cousins to steer me towards Chinese food in Kolkata. With all due respect to Kolkata Chinese, I live next to a huge Chinese expat community in LA and eat fantastic Chinese food on a weekly basis. No, Kolkata is for fantastic Bengali food and I demanded that they introduce me to a place I hadn't been before. 

So off we went to Padmaparer Rannaghar. Although the place claims to be all about Bangladeshi cuisine, they have several very Ghoti dishes on the menu as well (jhingey posto anyone?). 

We started with their aam shorbot which was basically aam panna and delicious. Later we ordered their topse maachh bhaja, chitol machher muitha, potoler dolma and kochu shaak chhola diye. 

The highlight of the entire meal was the kochu shaak chhola diye. OMG - how do you take a humble vegetable like taro leaves and stems and make something so sublime with it? It was a beautiful dish. The other nice touch was the kochu baata (taro mash) they served with the meal - it had a lovely bite from mustard oil that went so well with the creamy taro. 

This was the first time in my life that I ate chitol maachher muitha and hence I have no reference point for this dish - it was lovely but perhaps there are better versions out there. The paan shots to round off the meal were superb - such a refreshing end to a lovely meal. 

The service was polite, attentive and timed just right. Unbelievable how little we paid for all this great food.

We had Masala Dosa, Chicken Spring Roll, Fish Finger. All of them taste good but specially the fish finger was very good. Even my daughter also loved it. She ate 3 fish fingers :D . 

Prices are little bit high but who cares if the food is good.

Though the restaurant is hard to find as it's located in a congested market place, the inside ambience is quite nice & the service is also above average.

This is one chupa rustum restaurant.Though situtated on the Gariaht Road jus near the gariaht more its hard to locate due to the road side stalls and hawkers guarding its entrance.Previously it was a  south indian food joint with different name .Now as the name suggests It serves standard bengali food  in moderate price .The menu card is full of varieties  and they have creative names to their dishes I mus say.Unlike the other biggies like Oh calacutta or 6 ballygyunge place their prices are very pocket friendly.
The ambience is simple and the staff is polite.

We ordered plain rice,bhetki paturi,daab chingri and kosha mangsho..The preparations were quite good.I only had problem with mutton quality which can be improved.

Overall a decent place for authentic bengali food.Only thing they  lack is ambience.So next time you are hungry while shopping you can drop in .

P.S: They serve kochu baata as a compliementary dish.

The decor was standard....nothing too elaborate but not shabby either!The waiters were dressed in traditional 'dhuti-panjabi' and were reasonably courteous.Service was good.
The menu is an extensive one and i was simply at a loss about what to select.The names of the standard dishes were crafted into something quite creative and impressive.however we picked the following-
Rasikjoner kosha murgi and tel e jiyonto luchi : The chicken was very spicy,the luchis were larger than normal.
Nayananda sada bhaat,chhanar dalna,dab chingri,kochi pathar dildaria jhol:The combo worked superbly....the mutton curry was awesome....
Overall,it was an explosion of spices and appetising flavours!

Appreciation of good food is a quality of a person. Bengali is food lover and nobody ever doubted that. We are spending the most of the hard earning in daily food. If one compare the demographic data of Kolkata and ratio of the people who visits the restaurants then immediately one can find that  there are many from the demographic data who don't love to eat at restaurants.  So that will justify what i started writing with. But my recent feedback says that we are giving focus towards ambiance and not the taste. 
Padmapaarer Rannaghar is a place about taste, about those lost menu which your grand-mother or mother is not preparing  anymore. Great place. Very fast service. 
If you love the food and food only, then please visit. But if you want your Luchi and Daal to be pronounced in an Western accent then there are some other place too. 
My first order  - 
a. Maankochu baataa - keep eating again again and   
b. Saarshe Ilish 
c. Loyitta Maachh 
d. Ichorer Daalnaa 
Very well priced, and dont feel the pinch. 

Going back definitely. And, will be taking friends too who are true food lovers. 

Wish you all very good eating pleasure.....

Went there on Saturday evening. To locate this restaurant, you would need to land at Gariahat junction and walk towards Golpark, the restaurant would be at the right-hand side. You would find a board mounted at a entrance of a small inside lane with roadside clothing stalls (matched what I read in Zomato reviews).

Inside the decor is quite fine (in fact I would it is good, maybe, because I have seen worst). You have glass tables, banana plant shaped table mats, LDC television, yellow/chrome yellow based decor and air conditioning.

Before you step into this restaurant, you have to understand that this restaurant is designed to serve Bangladeshi style food. This means, lots (I mean lots and lots) of spice and a different cooking style. If you are not accustomed to East Bengal (Bangal) style cuisine, this may not be the place for you.

I was there to parcel my food. The menu is very extensive with lots of choices. The waiter (all waiters are dressed in traditional bengali style Panjabi and Pajama) who took my order gave me at least 8-10 different options of different kinds of fish. 

Here are the items which I ordered. The names of dishes are very attractive and unique:
1) Maan Kochu Bata - The Taro Root paste was given complimentary. This was the first time any restaurant was giving me something as a complimentary for parcel order!
2) Nayananda Sada Bhat - Rs 60/- (plain basmati rice)
3) Parotay Kima Sundari - Rs 75/- (This was a very thik paratha with thick layer of kima. The taste is just awesome)
4) Bardhamaner Joy Joyakar - Rs 70/- (Mushur daal. Normal taste)
5) Nitya Sundar Macher Teler Tel Koi - Rs 200/- (Koi fish preparation. Fish size was pretty large and the preparation was very tasty)
6) Padmaparer Special Chicken - Rs 550/- (This was not on menu. The waiter suggested it. If you order it, be prepared to be hit with a spicy flavour. However, once you recover from the burst of spice, the taste is just excellant). 
7) Aam Chatni - Rs 40/- (normal kachcha mango chatni)

 The entire preparation and packing took exactly 22 minutes (which I think is pretty good considering I had some items which needed special preparation). Price I would say is moderate (or maybe it is more on the higher side). 

If you are looking for authentic bangal ("East Bengal") cuisine, this may be a good place to visit.

Located at Gariahat, this is a good place to experience authentic bengali food. as the name suggests it focuses more on Bangal cuisines than Ghoti cuisines. The amazing part is the name of the dishes. Dishes have true and unique bengali names here. Starting from "Nayanananda Shada Bhaat"  to  "Rod makhano nolen gurer sandesh" every dish here has a special name. Still I found the restaurant a little costlier as compared to "Bhojohori Manna". The best thing I liked about this restaurant is their complementary dishes, "Kochu Bata" & "Paaner Sharbat"... These dishes adds some extra delicacies to the meal.

The decor was standard....nothing too elaborate but not shabby either!The waiters were dressed in traditional 'dhuti-panjabi' and were reasonably courteous.Service was good.
The menu is an extensive one and i was simply at a loss about what to select.The names of the standard dishes were crafted into something quite creative and impressive.however we picked the following-
Rasikjoner kosha murgi and tel e jiyonto luchi : The chicken was very spicy,the luchis were larger than normal.
Nayananda sada bhaat,chhanar dalna,dab chingri,kochi pathar dildaria jhol:The combo worked superbly....the mutton curry was awesome....
Overall,it was an explosion of spices and appetising flavours!

Appreciation of good food is a quality of a person. Bengali is food lover and nobody ever doubted that. We are spending the most of the hard earning in daily food. If one compare the demographic data of Kolkata and ratio of the people who visits the restaurants then immediately one can find that  there are many from the demographic data who don't love to eat at restaurants.  So that will justify what i started writing with. But my recent feedback says that we are giving focus towards ambiance and not the taste. 
Padmapaarer Rannaghar is a place about taste, about those lost menu which your grand-mother or mother is not preparing  anymore. Great place. Very fast service. 
If you love the food and food only, then please visit. But if you want your Luchi and Daal to be pronounced in an Western accent then there are some other place too. 
My first order  - 
a. Maankochu baataa - keep eating again again and   
b. Saarshe Ilish 
c. Loyitta Maachh 
d. Ichorer Daalnaa 
Very well priced, and dont feel the pinch. 

Going back definitely. And, will be taking friends too who are true food lovers. 

Wish you all very good eating pleasure.....

Went there on Saturday evening. To locate this restaurant, you would need to land at Gariahat junction and walk towards Golpark, the restaurant would be at the right-hand side. You would find a board mounted at a entrance of a small inside lane with roadside clothing stalls (matched what I read in Zomato reviews).

Inside the decor is quite fine (in fact I would it is good, maybe, because I have seen worst). You have glass tables, banana plant shaped table mats, LDC television, yellow/chrome yellow based decor and air conditioning.

Before you step into this restaurant, you have to understand that this restaurant is designed to serve Bangladeshi style food. This means, lots (I mean lots and lots) of spice and a different cooking style. If you are not accustomed to East Bengal (Bangal) style cuisine, this may not be the place for you.

I was there to parcel my food. The menu is very extensive with lots of choices. The waiter (all waiters are dressed in traditional bengali style Panjabi and Pajama) who took my order gave me at least 8-10 different options of different kinds of fish. 

Here are the items which I ordered. The names of dishes are very attractive and unique:
1) Maan Kochu Bata - The Taro Root paste was given complimentary. This was the first time any restaurant was giving me something as a complimentary for parcel order!
2) Nayananda Sada Bhat - Rs 60/- (plain basmati rice)
3) Parotay Kima Sundari - Rs 75/- (This was a very thik paratha with thick layer of kima. The taste is just awesome)
4) Bardhamaner Joy Joyakar - Rs 70/- (Mushur daal. Normal taste)
5) Nitya Sundar Macher Teler Tel Koi - Rs 200/- (Koi fish preparation. Fish size was pretty large and the preparation was very tasty)
6) Padmaparer Special Chicken - Rs 550/- (This was not on menu. The waiter suggested it. If you order it, be prepared to be hit with a spicy flavour. However, once you recover from the burst of spice, the taste is just excellant). 
7) Aam Chatni - Rs 40/- (normal kachcha mango chatni)

 The entire preparation and packing took exactly 22 minutes (which I think is pretty good considering I had some items which needed special preparation). Price I would say is moderate (or maybe it is more on the higher side). 

If you are looking for authentic bangal ("East Bengal") cuisine, this may be a good place to visit.

Located at Gariahat, this is a good place to experience authentic bengali food. as the name suggests it focuses more on Bangal cuisines than Ghoti cuisines. The amazing part is the name of the dishes. Dishes have true and unique bengali names here. Starting from "Nayanananda Shada Bhaat"  to  "Rod makhano nolen gurer sandesh" every dish here has a special name. Still I found the restaurant a little costlier as compared to "Bhojohori Manna". The best thing I liked about this restaurant is their complementary dishes, "Kochu Bata" & "Paaner Sharbat"... These dishes adds some extra delicacies to the meal.

A standard Bengali restaurant with nothing exceptional. I went here yesterday and noticed they have started serving south Indian and Chinese cuisines too. This is a set back.  The food is priced at a moderate range, and the taste is kind of ok. There is nothing exceptional about the ambiance too. The waiters serve here wearing authentic Bengali dresses. You can give this a visit if you are nearby but you won't loose much if you abstain from here.

Relish Bangladeshi cuisine @ Padmaparer Rannaghar
3 out of 5

Some restaurant names really beckon you strongly and Padmaparer Rannaghar is one of them in South Kolkata. Situated in Gariahat, the entrance of the restaurant is really very annoying - it barely looks like a proper food joint because of the roadside clothing stalls in front of its entrance. One will really have to look to find signage with the name of the restaurant on it. It's probably because of this annoyance that this food joint has not yet gained a lot of popularity among foodies, despite of their quality service. 

I have crossed this place several times while shopping in Gariahat but never got the opportunity to check it out. Finally last month, I managed to go there with one of my colleagues. There are many renowned eateries in Kolkata that offer authentic Bengali cuisine and I can't place Padmaparer Rannaghar in the same category. Due to its ambience, this place falls far behind when compared to places like Oh! Calcutta, Aaheli, Tero Parbon, etc. But when it comes to the quality of food served here, Padmaparer Rannaghar stands out due to its real Bangladeshi style of cooking with its spicy curries, typical of O PAR BANGLA (East Bengal). We ordered white rice and misti pulao (sweet rice) with mochar chingri, Barishaler illish jhol and illish paturi. Along with these, we had aamer sharbot. The fish preparations were truly outstanding with a perfect blend of spices and chillies to balance the preparation perfectly with spices without making them too hot to relish. 

Now, my third method of comparison - the prices; extremely reasonable compared to other Bengali cuisine eateries, especially as they offer really very good quality as well as quantity of food. Overall, this place surely calls for a high rating and popularity but lacks any form of ambience simply because of its appalling entrance and non-existent decor.

i went this place 3-4 times...since the 1st experience it was my opinion that it is the only bengali cuisine in kolkata which provide proper taste in their spicy bengali items,unlikely the other restaurants like bhajahari manna,sholo ana bangali usually keep their dishes more on the sweeter side..probably the name "podmaparer..." suggests the taste of bangladeshi food which are more spicy and accurate in their taste...
we took their ilish,chitol,crab..all were very authentic  in taste....along with complementary kochubata and it was really tasty too..
ambience is nothing except the punajabi-pajama of waiters...sometimes ACs will not work properly..entrance is almost invisible..

service is super slow...even they take a long time to provide the bill after eating..

so highly recommended but only if u have much time in hand.....

p.s.- i found the menucard,specially the name of the items very attractive...

Extremely disappointed ... looks more like a roadside joint. No decor, no ambiance. Out of 6 Split ACs, just 1 is operating while according to them, rest 5 are out of order. Food quality is ordinary and ranks low if you compare with other Bengali food courts in the city. Absolutely nothing to do with Padmaparer taste. Service is just OK. Can't recommend to anyone.

I loved this place and if you are a fan of Bengali food and metaphors you should make a stopover at this place when you are tired from street shopping at Gariahat. Located bang on the street this place can't be missed. For regulars this used to Sonali restaurant, serving dosa now a medium budget Bengali restaurant serving some of the best of the East Bengal food.
This place is here to stay !!!!!!!! and for several reasons.

Menu Card: If you know how to read and write Bengali, make a stopover to enjoy food metaphors... You will be in splits!!!! Some egs are:  Machcher Mukta Kanther Dal ( a Dal prepared with Fish head)

Anarasher Madhyamani Pulao ( a Pulao prepared with Pineapples)

Dugdhadhabal Murir Pulao ( Chicken Pulao)

Manshabandi Dhakar Biryani ( Biryani cooked in Dhaka style)

My morbid translations cannot match the food metaphors and I am afraid I might land with up a rather funny literal translation. 

What we ate: What surprised me was the Dim Diye Jasorer Daler Stew ( A  Dal-Stew preparation from Jessore). While I am a huge fan of fish head Dal preparation common in Bengali households I had never heard of  Egg based Dal preparation and we decided to take a chance. As I geared up to order some Sag DP warned me against it. Apparently Rice is served with Kachubata( Colocasia or referred to as Arvi in Hindi) and fried Kalmi greens ! Being a die-hard fan of Dal-posto combination,  I had to enjoy my Dal and Rice with some Posto(poppy seeds) preparation; so we ordered Dekhan Hasi Narkel Posto ( a Poppy seed based preparation with potato and grated coconut).  We thoroughly enjoyed the Dal with sliced boiled eggs and sliced carrots adding colour and texture to the dal. A Must try!

Finally  three non-vegetarian items followed: Chital Pristharakhya Ananda Muitya ( a Chitol Fish Preparation), Kachi Pathar Dildaria Jhol ( Mutton Curry) and Morola Machcher Tak ( A Tangy preparation of Morola Fish). DP recommended the Chitol and Mutton Curry and I insisted on ordering the last preparation. Morola Macher Tak could have been a little more tangy.

We finished our meal with Malpua which was rather chewy. Except the sweet dish and the fries I can go back again to savour the same delicacies particularly the  Dal and the Posto.

If there is one restaurant that serves the authentic kochu bata, this has to be the one. And moreover, it comes free! Food is enjoyable, unpretentious and soulful. Menu is varied and diverse. Kochu bata, kochu shaag e ilish machh, kosha mangsho are specially recommended.
