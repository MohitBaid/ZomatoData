Good place for an occasional bite. Tried the Mixed Chowmein and Chicken Roll here. Food is good, but the waiting time is quite high, one needs a lot patience!

Little place for a quick snack, best for take aways. I tried chicken momos. They were good, but not worth the double price tag in terms of taste and quality. I would prefer tastier momos for half the price at Shyambazar more.

It's a restaurant which has only 2 tables.. now u can guess.. how big it can be... And only two staffs.. very avarage roadside foods...
There pan fried momo is good, other than that normal chow and rolls they serve..

They r good in soups and momos. Id not try d noodles(chow) coz they r too oily.. Still its as good as a cheap roadside restaurant cn be. But im ready to give a 5 star for thr soups. 
P.s.- Always bttr to take a parcel. If u sit thr nd eat u hv a great chnc of dngue or malaria cz d plc gets filled wd mosquitos in d eve.

This is a small restaurant, providing only takeaway facility. Though they serve both Chinese and north Indian, I happen to have the Chinese from here only, as for north Indian, there are much better options nearby, but for Chinese this is one of the best options in that area. Chicken noodles with dry chilli chicken is my favourite combo here !

The rolls and the chinese dishes that they prepare are good.  Quantity is good too. 
Low on budget,  step in here! 
Must try : dry chilli chicken. 

Not much of expectations. Just enjoy the food. 
Recommended for take aways.

I never expected that Hungry Hut would be on Zomato. Woah. This is a takeaway joint and not a restaurant. Seating arrangements are available but then again, the place is not that sprawling. It has been a year since they opened their teeny-meeny brasserie. Gradually, it is growing popular in the neighbourhood. I never tried their other menus but only egg-rolls. Average. Hope they improve their quality in near future.

One word, DISGUSTING.
I don't know any better way to describe this shitty place. Believe me you would rather prefer a pack of Lays than stepping in here.

Its a small shop near to my house .
Might not seem very lavish or fine dining because it isn't , but the chinese here is amazing ! I love the Dry Chilli Chicken here and their quality and quantity too is great . Not a fan of their Biriyani .
The prices are also pocket friendly ! So enjoy the food here .

Not much to look at but a good place to eat if your budget is low. Would suggest having the crispy chicken and the chicken chowmein. Quantity is very good for the price. Take away is d better option.

Good food joint nearby my residence. Chinese dishes they provide is very tasty. Its a food joint and hardly any place to sit. But i prefer to bring Chinese dishes back home to have in dinner. My favourite hakka chicken chow min, gravy noodles, chilli chicken...

Such a small joint yet soooo good! 
Order gets delivered quickly.. And food is just yummy! But there is no proper sitting arrangement. This is what is their only backlog.

This small take away joint has actually quite surprised me with the quality and taste of the food they are serving..I had a take away from here a few times since it was close to my house, and I can testify that they certainly serves the best Chinese cuisine in the locality..Their chinese dishes are prepared with a satisfactory level of perfection and professionalism..SOme of the cons are definitely they don't have any decent seating arrangement,secondly twice they have actually goofed up the orders I placed over phone..Also their prices are a bit higher compared to the level and standard of this establishment,else would have rated them 3.5..Overall they serve quite delectable starters and Chinese mains..Some of the worth mentioning items are: Chicken Drumsticks,Fish FInger,Singapore Fried Rice,Chicken Shezwan,Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce..Defintely give it a try if you lives nearby..

Had ordered for 'chicken with butter mushroom' and they had delivered it pretty fast, to my place, which is a few blocks away from this food-joint. The food was good, but following this, had tried calling them up and ordering for a few more items, on more than one occasion, but they could not, citing reasons such as unavailability of adequate staff. There is hardly any place for people to sit inside this joint, so I don't think that is a wise option.

I have been here several times and overall they have managed to impress me. There has been some minor variability of the kitchen, but nothing to detract from the overall experience. The food is great. The ambience might not be good. The place is small. But if you really want good food. This is surely the perfect place.

Well One fine evening I was here with my girlfriend to taste some snacks here.. The ambience wasnt preety much but we were luking for some kind of crowd free place..They have placed a few tables outside which looks kind of ok considering the road is not so crowded. Next coming to the food we ordered 1 plate chicken in china town and one stir fried chicken.. Chicken in china town was like chicken lollipops dipped in tasty spicy sauce, which tasted great to me. The stir fried chicken was different from what i have tasted before.. It was chicken strips fried with vegetable and with a thin coating..But it was good too..Both the dishes were garnished beautifully and the quantity was preety large..I recommend this place for snacks for now..But i am looking forward to taste some of the main courses too.. :-)
