The best cafe in Behala. Good food taste,  excellent catering and homely ambience. Location is close to Behala Chowrasta and Sakherbazar. Can go for Keema Paratha, French fries and chicken salad if one is a first timer... The dishes all have great flavors. Tea lovers can try out the milky cardamom tea.

First I would like to praise them for their service and their daring nature to bring up a Cafe in a place where it is hardly noticeable.
We did not try many varieties of food there but somehow I liked their service and I feel that with little more promotion and hard work they can survive well.¬†
We had very less expectation from this place tea and ice cream...
Tea was prepared well and they gave good try to present a chocolate ice cream nicely
They have decorated it well with hanging lanterns. However, they should brighten up the cafe bit more with more lights.
Price is very reasonable.

I have been ordering their Chicken Penne Pasta couple of times, both in White as well as Red sauce. The taste is really good and the cooking is also upto the mark. What I am not okay with is the portion of the Pasta which does not even suffice dinner proportion. Also had ordered Aloo Parantha from them and though size wise it looked small but tastewise it was really good. Looking forward to placing more orders and trying other dishes too from them. I would suggest them to increase their food portions.

I should praise them for tolerating us almost 3 hours and this should be an enough reason to visit them again. This place happens to be just a minute away from my home. And I have visited them three times to be precise. A very quiet place which I have loved always, decor of this cafeteria is very soothing. Host is very sweet to interact. Foods are good to be mentioned. I loved their Chicken Salad and Mixed Fruit Juice. A lovely place to set a foot.

Well, I went to this place having heard some good things about it and it did not disappoint. The food quality was quite good, coherent with the price demanded. The ambience was quite cozy, not too much over the top. I would suggest people to check the place out, for I doubt there are many better cafes than this one in Behala.

Aamar Cafe is a minute walk from my home. I decided to visit this one evening and was a little disappointed. The decor of this Cafe is outstanding!! There's low wooden benches and tables , the dim lighting, everything is spectacular. Rupa Di is a very spunky lady and extremely friendly. It was a pleasure meeting her. 

We ordered COLD COFFEE, HOT CHOCOLATE and CHICKEN SALAD. 

The coffee served with vanilla ice cream was good, though a tad bit sweeter than we like. The Hot Chocolate should've been thicker and much more chocolaty. The Chicken Salad was a complete disaster. The frozen chicken was tough, chewy, there was too much peas and the mayo used was no good. I really wish it was better.¬†

I have to admit, it's been a long time since I visited any outlet after checking out zomato. With all the invitations & bloggers meet it has become nearly impossible for me to do so. Thankfully the habit hasn't died & I'm extremely glad that I found a decent cafe to hangout near my place. My hate for CCDs is quite well known to my friends, & my search for pocket friendly adda place continues till date.
Locating the place isn't very tricky, take the lane in front of V3 near James Long & you'll arrive in front of the place. The ambience is done quite beautifully, with dim Chinese paper lanterns. The place seats around 15, including a low seating couch which can be a great place for a session with friends. The instrumental background music sets the mood as well.
Coming to the food we ordered the following:

Chicken Salad: I expected a Caeser Salad kind of thing, however the overall dish was quite good with american corn, beans, cauliflower & generous amount of mayo sans any lettuce.

Fish Finger: I was actually expecting a processed item from Spencer's, however was quite surprised to find freshly prepared ones. I also wanted to try their chicken nuggets, which however weren't available. I'm pretty sure they will be fresh too.

Chicken Kebab: Of course can't be compared to the ones prepared in tandoor, however were quite juicy & enjoyable.

Chicken Pasta in white sauce: Well cooked penne in not too runny/dry sauce. The quantity could be worked upon though.

Tea & Hot Chocolate: Really really good. Specially the tea was a good quality one, & not a dip as most outlets serve. The hot chocolate could have been a bit thicker, but anyway was good too.

Cons: Only two things I felt. One, the chicken should be more carefully de-boned ( I found bits of bones in both the salad & the pasta ). Second, the excessive use of seasoning on the dishes can be done away with & left to the taste of the customer.

All in all this was yet another good find & I will be back there soon for the bread pizza they make. 
Untill then
Happy eating!
Cheers!

I would love to go there again and again just for the bread pizza. Its cheap, cheesy and fills your stomach.It has a very nice ambience and they belt out instrumentals of really popular hindi songs which add to the cosy feel of the place. ¬†The staff is extremely polite and prompt.¬†My only problem is that this place is too small.

Amar Cafe its an opt name for any of us youngsters...it WAS..atlst for me...because the main positive as well as negative point was the food was like "Home Cooked"...but if u go to a cafe i dont think we expect anything like Ghar Ka Khana...i wont say the food was bad but it was like something which u or ur mom cooks at ur home...me and my friend ordered One Chicken Salad with mayo (#nomayo #vegetablechickensaute),Chicken grilled sandwich(#cucumbersandwich), Masala Corn(#indianstyle) and lastly Choco Shake(#milk+water+harshleykindashake)
Now lets strt with the Salad;it had a option of Mayo or Curd nd we opted for mayo..but wen it came there was 0 mayo...the salad was just everyday vegetables tossed with chicken in a homely amatured style ...for me it was a point higher than Bad Food!now the Sandwich this was a Clear Shout Out Disaster there was merely any chicken in the filling it was filled with cucumber nd most imply it was again nothing but our everyday lunchbox story if not worse...now the masala corn it was the only thing i enjoyed it WAS a masala corn no denying but it was with tomato and onion fry which we wont find in a regular masala fry though it doesnt mean that it added to the flavour but i wud say it was the reason which was pulling me back from saying that its a yummy dish..it was tasty but not good..u know sometimes u cook but ur dish turns out to ve something else but still u enjoy it...it was like that..now last but not least the Choco SHAKE...firstly it was sooooo diluted that we were like Just finish this up and run...i mean come on yaar who doesnt luke choco shake but trust me it was pathetic it was like milk flavoured water mixed with hopefully Harshley...now the price was the only turn on factor which forced me to add .5 to the rating..it was really cheap
But with all this criticism i wanna say some points first y wud someone pay even a penny to go there nd eat Homemade Food Secondly when you have so much comptition in the market y wud u do such horrible mistakes??? We have so many diners and cafes in Behala area which are serving good food in a good price on the other hand this cafe serves limited kinda food with very bad quality..though there Service was reallly good and the interior was very pretty...but even after all this i cant rate it more than 3.....

The plan was made in a hurry. So we needed a place where we could sip on our drinks,sit and give adda for long hours and the place should be close to our homes.Zomato came to our rescue as usual. A few minutes walk from Sakherbazaar more landed us in Amar Cafe.The ambience is quite beautiful.As we settled into our seats, picking up the menu I ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich and two Chicken Salads,one with curd and one with mayo.Antara had a cola and the remaining two of us,cold coffees.The staff seemed nice at first.But then it all started going downhill.The ac was on but the room was pretty hot.On asking them to turn it down, they switched on their fan but suddenly after sometime switched it off again.The food was okay,even though I couldn't realy find any difference between the chicken salads made with mayo and curd.Both tasted exactly same.The drinks were nice though.And the chips were complimentary.I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone but on a second thought,this place is okay if you are realy in a hurry and want to grab some drinks and chitchat with a friend during the winter season.
P.S-The place looked clean at first at our first glance.But after the food was served,we noticed flies sitting on our drinks.One of our friends even found a fly in her cola.

Hats off to Rupa Chatterjee, the director of this cafe for her handmade delights, and her strong sense of hospitality, and friendliness with the guests. Trust me, you'll be so delighted that you will be proud to say it "Amar Cafe"(my own cafe). To add upon, this place is frequented by celebrities, and have WiFi facility also.
I strongly recommend all the foodies out there, to visit this place to enjoy some delicious bites, in one of the best cafe of the city.

Again a small eat house as i like it. A 13 seater cafe this time like 5 minutes away from my residence. This cafe has been established newly and i thought of visiting it today evening with my friend. Nice neat and tidy place to start with. The owner herself runs it with another lady to help her. It seems she has been a part of the famous cook show of Sudipa Di (Ranna ghar) as i saw her trophy being displayed at a corner. We ended up ordering grilled chicken sandwich for my friend and for me a cappuccino for me after a long day of office. They took around 15 mins to serve the two. Both were good  at taste. The ambiance was good but the selection of music was really pathetic. You could have gained .5 more on that :) . Take care of that and the rest is all good. Looking forward for better experience the next time. Over all a good place. Recommended. Keep up the good work. ** they have a great Happy hour scheme which says if you order above 250/- you get a coffee or a lassi free. So go grab it.

You can get frothy and creamy cappuccino's in just 55 bucks.. Where else you can get it.. Please try out this cafe..
