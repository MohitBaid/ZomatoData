We had chicken momo, chilly chicken and crispy mushroom. Food was as per expectation. But the mushroom was simply outstanding. We loved it. Other dishes were not bad.

A decent place for comfort food in new alipore. I had their chicken hakka noodles and pan fried chicken momo. The noodles is ordinary but what stands out is its mild taste and black pepper fragrance that inhibit delicately cooked non-spicy noodles. The pan fried momos are stellar. Cooked to the tee and touched with the right blend of spices. Quantity is more than enough for 2people. Overall, value for money at     200INR.

A great joint for momos and other chinise varients . Their combos are equally good but I guess now they aren't available anymore . A big thumbs down to their dine in facilities because they have no place for it . Customers sit on the lane infront the small shop to savour their delicacies . It's a big problem during summer time . I am not fond of their hygiene of plates and spoons too . I prefer takeaways from here if not urgent .

Got Pan fried momos and chicken fried rice delivered at home, owing to the good reviews! Alas turned out to be a horrific experience. The momos were tasteless and extremely oily and the rice was oily too! Quantity is huge though with sufficient chicken in the rice! Nothing else to report. Not ordering again!

This places serves very tasty momos. This is actually better than denzong and other local restaurants. Try out in the evening coz if you are late you might miss the momos as they exhaust quite fast.

Ordered food today from this outlet. Quality and quantity both are good. Ordered many times before today. We ordered :- 

1.Vegetable Steamed Momo :- 6 pieces of Steamed Momo with sauce is completely bliss in itself. Momo was quite tasty and good to eat.

2. Crispy Chilly Baby Corn :- Yet another starter, its one of the best item of this outlet. Quantity is sufficient for 2 or more people. Very crispy and very spicy .

3. Hakka Noddles :- My lunch is completely unfinished unless and until I have noddles. Mouth watering and less oily makes me crave for more.

4. Paneer in Chilli Sauce :- Another good item. Paneer is properly cooked and sauce is quite chilly.       

Definitely​ worth referring to friends and family

This was my first order through Zomato.com. The process was smooth, the only time consuming was from the restaurant side as they were not responding through their app. But after a small wait the order was accepted and delivered at my home. The delivery person from Zomato was very polite while asking for the exact location of my house. Coming to the food, it was hot, & tasty as it should be for the different food items. We had ordered for Steam Chicken Momo, served only the Momo, but the soup was missing. The Chicken gravy Chowmin was tasty and the quantity was good enough, along with it was the boneless Dry Chili Chicken, which was equally tasty and had Ten pieces of boneless Chicken.

(12/09/2017) A "Wow" experience it was.. Ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles and chicken steamed momo. Quality and Quantity of food delivered was juz 10 on 10.. Noodles were properly cooked with appropriate taste in it.. Momos were good too..
Today (14/09/2017) I again ordered egg Hakka noodles and veg hakka noodles from the same restaurant with high expectations bt to my surprise this time they served sumthing juz the opposite what they served on the last occasion.. Quantity was normal but quality was too poor with no taste in it.. I hope they maintain the same quality each time they serve any dish to any person.. M bound to lessen my rating.. :(

Located at Jyotish Roy road , Bank colony at New Alipore this is a take away counter tucked away underneath a house.It is small in size but the taste and flavours that they offer through there food is prominent.
As it is a take away counter, they have taken utmost care in the packing material which are of food grade(Plastic Box for gravy) and even the paper boxes are firm and lined with thin cling film.This clearly suggest an eye for intricate details.
Now coming to the food, order for Chicken Gravy Chowmin and Chicken Hakka Noodles. Portion size is good enough for one and a half and the gravy chow was flavourful with the right quantity of gravy and consistency.Hakka noodles was full of chicken dices with lots of cabbage and sliced onion, carrots, etc properly stir fried,with out being excessively oily. Overall a nice experience. An 80% rating , for good food and even better packing quality, specially taking into consideration that it is a take away counter.

With a great expectation, going by the reviews and rating here, order chicken fingers , pan fried mom and pan fried chicken for home delivery. But disappointed as the taste was only hot and hot..very very spicy. So actual taste was gone due to very hot taste of dried chilli flakes. And pan fried momo means here ia only steam momos tossed with lots of onion, no specific sauce.
Disappointed ..

The cons of this place is its a takeaway or u have to sit on a narrow footpath with chairs. Apart from that its an amazing small food joint which is actually a street food with good quality and good quantity.
I love their noodles with adequate veggies and chicken chunks which has a very faint burnt garlic flavour giving it an extraordinary tinge of Chinese flavour.
And their momo is too juicy.
Thus if you are at home with a very little penny to shred with a good appetite then hurry and order from this joint.

We ordered crispy chilli baby corn, mixed hakka noodles and manchurian chicken. It was a home delivery through swiggy, as they wanted us to do so, so can't tell anything about hygiene or ambiance. The delivery was extremely late. They delivered the food about 1 and half an hour later the order. But the food was very tasty and quantity was enough according to the price. 
Next time it was a take away, I called them at 9:30 to confirm whether they have steamed momos and crispy chilli baby corn available for next 10 mins. They said it will be available. We reached within 5 mins and on reaching we heard that they have neither momos nor baby corns and to my surprise they completely ignored the fact of giving us wrong informations instead they were trying to make us buy some other dishes. We clearly understood that they refused to inform us so, to make us come there and buy whatever was available as they thought we will hesitate to come back with empty hands. But we did that and try another restaurant that day.
Another time we bought steamed momo, chilli chicken and chicken noodles. Momos were very tasty and juicy. Chillic chicken was extremely spicy so I couldn't eat all. Noodles was good in amount and tasty too.

Ordered in via the App and was left licking my fingers in glee. Brilliant food. Whether it was the manchow soup, momos or the Hakka noodles everything was just superb. I was amazed at the quantity as well. Neatly packed, brilliant in taste and big on quantity it was like a perfect meal. The icing on the cake was the delivery fifteen minutes earlier than promised. Now that's customer service.

Ok...so people will be thinking why am I giving 4 rating to such an ordinary restaurant( categorising as per rating available in zomato only. So let me tell you people am ordering food from there from such a long time, whenever I have a thin purse and have a craving for good simple basic but finger licking Chinese i used to order from them. And trust me they never make me feel disappointed.
This time ordered 2 chicken gravy noodles and 1 schezwan chicken. Very basic yet very fresh food, tasty indeed.
Chicken was with lots of mushrooms but at the same time chicken peices are smaller than the usual one(comparing with other restaurant's, as there pieces are of the same size only).
And noodles was fine. This one is my most fev item from them after their pan fried momo.
And yet the prices are really on the lower side. All of these cost me just around 370(excluding packaging charge)
P. S. Sorry for the photo quality guyz, my ph just had a bath yesterday. :P

Maybe the Pan Fried Ones were a tad too sweet , but the Steamed ones really tickled the taste buds. Looks like a good takeaway choice when the hunger pangs strike :)

Never to order again !!! Disgusted the say the least

Appalled to find a dead fly in my steamed chicken momos last week ! Got the food delivered home via swiggy, only to find the momos to be stale, along with a dead fly. Steam and fried , this goes without saying that its understand able you ll operate from a small space in a crowded area of new alipore , but the least your customers would expect is hygiene and cleaniness ! Never to order again !!! Disgusted the say the least

Yesterday I ordered from this place via swiggy. Never been to this place , so cannot comment about the physical ambience about the restaurant . what i heard about this restaurant , it's a strictly take way joint. 
Now coming back to food , I ordered pan fried chicken momo and mixed fried rice. Momo and fried rice both were good . quantity wise and quality wise. And very pocket friendly. Nicely cooked.

I have had their steamed and pan friend momos more than a couple of times on home delivery. They haven't compromised on taste even once. The pan fried momos are a real treat.

Ordered mixed Chowmein and stir fried mushroom..
Though the Chowmein was bit oily but it was tasty and the quantity was impressive. There were many pieces of shredded chicken and prawns too...all in all the dish was impressive.
The mushroom dish was a bit dry but really tasty...will surely order more from this outlet in future..

After a not too satisfactory experience at blue poppy,my craving for a good plate of steamed momos increased like anything.Hence I looked for new places to try momos via home delivery in swiggy.Steam and fried was there in the list and I saw a many positive reviews about this place in zomato.I've only tried chicken steamed momos from this place.

The momos were quite big and wholesome in terms of size.The filling was full of flavour and juicy.Overall the momos were moist and tasty.
But the coating was bit too thick for my liking.Also I would've liked the sauce to be more spicy and thick.It tasted like ordinary straight out off packet chilli sauce.

This place is a take away joint based in New Alipore. U don't need to search hard to find this place as it is very easy to locate. Just opposite Triangular Park or beside Gupta Brothers. To start with, as it is a take away joint there are not much of place to sit, a few chairs in the pavement.
I ordered few starters from this place :
#Chicken Steam Momo : Not bad but nothing special as I had better momos in many places.
#Pan Fried Chicken: It was tasty with decent quantity. The quality was also good
#Chilli Chicken Dry : I didnt like this item at all. The taste was not good and even it was not looked well. I felt it was burnt a little more.

A decent place for momos and starters. But the quality should be improved.

We ordered through swiggy for our evening snacks.our order was simple.dry chilly chicken,pan fried fish and chicken manchow soup.While the packaging was fine and quantity was also Ok for the price,we were very disappointed with the taste of the food.

The fish was rubbery and lacked any flavour.The chicken was chewy and hard and lacked any punch.But atleast it tasted better than the fish.The soup again was just a soya infused hot broth topped with fried noodles without any distinctive taste whatsoever. 

We are not ordering again

A sudden craving for some momo was what led us to order from this place. And it surely was the best decision I took in the past week. The Momos were delicious in taste and humongous in size. The sauce was perfect in texture and taste.

We ordered a plate of chicken steamed momo and chicken pan fried momo. The pan fried ones surely hit the spot. Way better than a certain momo joint that claims to make you exclaim of out joy after feasting on there offerings. For the price and, taste and size this place deserves a 4, until I try other dishes from them.

Service is a little slow but the food they served was outstanding. It was hard to believe that it came out of that dingy kitchen. Quantity was another plus point, enough to fill me up. They also have home delivery service and serves one of the best momos in the city. Denzong Kitchen, which is nearby have a real competitor now!

I used to regularly pick up food from the take away outlet and used to find that to be good but today for the first time i opted for a home delivery through Swiggy and ordered for 1 portion of Mixed Hakka Noodles + 1 Panfried Fish + 1 Panfried Chicken Momo and i must say that i was impressed. It is the Tastiest Chinese iv ever tasted and from now on-wards i am only going to order from their Delivery Kitchen. Its light years better than the Takeaway.
I highly Recommend the food from the Delivery. Its a must try.

I have tried their steamed momo, mixed hakka noodles and dry chilly chicken and must say all of them were quite good. Another thing that i would like to mention is the quantity which they give is quite good. Overall considering that it is not too costly and the quality of food is good I'd definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a quick Chinese meal.

One of the best momos I evr had so far. It is jst a small street food station but they really can make some delicious momos. Me and my brother visited this place today for some takeaway. We ordered chicken special pan fried momo which was just excellent. Along with this dry chilli chicken and chicken chilly garlic chow mein. Can't complain about any of these items. I recommend everyone to go to this place atleast once and taste their momos.

            2nd review. tried their mixed chowmin as well as chicken chowmin.. both were excellent to taste. but too oily.. quantity was very much impressive.. the chowmin was full of chicken prawns as well as egg.. good quality food served. if they reduce their oil contain . it would make them a better place

Good food and Fast service! Random chairs available for seating but its on a pavement and is void of tables (so hold em or drop them). Momos are a speciality but opt for the special momo in menu; its delicious. Takeaways available with no extra charge. Food quality is better than those available on stalls and small shops. I would say try them if they fit your palette.

A lazy evening and going out alone.. What can be more endearing?? Now where to go?? Denzong.. Umm no!! Already there.. Wow momo.. Umm not again.. Then?? Zomato to the rescue.. Yayyy steam and fried, new alipur.. Done.

Location-- just beside gupta brothers, new alipur triangular park.

Ambiance-- no ambiance. Take away joint. Just some stools and seating at the side walk. Mostly preferred for take aways.

Food -- the momos are quite good. Though i have tasted better momos still this place has decent taste. But one thing. I felt a little dryness in the filling. The covering was a little thick.. But at 50/- this is quite good. Liked it but didn't love it..

Hoped for something better.

I gave experienced steam momos in several place in the city and I found some making perfect steam momos along with the yummy soup beside. But trust me pan fried momos with a good taste I hardly found except this place. I loved their pan fried momo. Thaugh it's a street shop type and u have to sit on the chairs kept outside the shop and hold the plate in ur hand for eating but it's all worth it. Love to visit this place again  and again for pan fried momos.

I gave experienced steam momos in several place in the city and I found some making perfect steam momos along with the yummy soup beside. But trust me pan fried momos with a good taste I hardly found except this place. I loved their pan fried momo. Thaugh it's a street shop type and u have to sit on the chairs kept outside the shop and hold the plate in ur hand for eating but it's all worth it. Love to visit this place again  and again for pan fried momos.

This place is located beside Gupta brothers, an ordinary food stall.
I ordered just a plate of steamed chicken momo. They served immediately. The momos tasted good, soft, juicy and tasty...the sauce was perfect too, spicy. The soup was bit salty but then it tasted nice. I haven't eaten any other food from here..but based on the momo I think they are good.

This momo corner is located near gupta brothers. The veg momos taste excellent(both steam and fried). Takeaways recommended as there is no seating space. Plus standing and eating on the footpath gets congested. If in new alipore and love momos, a must try

I did not know that there is a very good place for Chinese in my locality. The place may looks like a roadside food corner but the quality of the foods are awesome. I visited there in a rainy evening with one of my friend. We tried crispy chicken, Garlic Chicken, sweet and sour chicken, schezwan fried rice, and chicken momos there. The chicken was well cooked and the rice was less oily. Although I have some problem with the unhygienic methods of their food handling but who cares about hygiene while enjoying street food! I would visit the place again.

If we only take the food into consideration, i believe they have amazing food at really really reasonable prices. And are super generous with the quantity. Especially the fried rice. Its absolutely delicious. A plate would cost you around Rs 50, and the meal is good enough for two. But, i dint find the hakka noodles to be very good. It wasnt something extraordinary. Nevertheless, its worth a try. And do have the hot garlic chicken in gravy. The momos are good too

Located at New Alipore , beside Triangular Park , this chinese stall houses lovely Chinese dishes . 

Well , a long time wait to have the momos there , finally , got time to bring them home . 

A plate of steamed momo (chicken) , 5 pieces , Rs.50/- . The size of the momo , with the inner chicken stuffing , tastes awesome . 

The quality goes in hand with the price !

Not really a place to sit and have momos as it is much of a roadside eatery with plastic chairs on the footpath for people to sit and eat. Located in a congested area with a garage next to it and 24x7 traffic infront of the shop. Nevertheless, the chinese items they serve is marvellous. And the momos specially are love. As the name suggests, one should really give it a try.

I had been passing by this joint for a long time but never ate here before, but today while i was passing the lovely aroma of chinese food wafted from the kitchen and i was really hungry.
                   So ordered the Pan Fried Chicken momo.The momo was really good and i being a frequent at Wow Momos found this restaurant serves much better momos at half the price of wow momos.But its only a takeaway joint and you got to sit on a few chairs on the foothpath,so better get your food packed.The momos were really tasty and had a distinct flavour to it.

Steam and fried opened its doors for the people of new alipore in 2010 and i happen to be there first customer and try to visit this place every once in a while . Quality  has been consistent throughout , the service is pretty quick and the food is nice . This is a take-away joint , the pan fried momo is a must try and all the other items are pretty standard .

That day i didnt try much of their items,  but after that i visited them many times....  The dishes are tasty and pocket friendly too.  I love their chicken pan fried momo and dry chilli chicken....

Steam & Fried is just a little chinese food joint.It is located just opposite of Birsa Munda Triangular Park at New Alipore.Today I was very hungry,So I've decided to there,because it is a pocket friendly shop.First I ordered chicken steamed momo,but their staff told me that chicken momo is not available today.So I ordered one plate Egg-chicken Hakka noodles.It served with chilly sauce,taste was very good.Quantity was also very good.Price is cheap.

Was wandering along d lanes of new Alipore with a friend of mine when we decided to momos. Steam n Fried was on my must-try list from quite a long time, so without any hesitation we went there. Located near Gupta brothers, its quite a small shop where the shop is the kitchen n u can sit outside on d plastic tools.
We just orders from veg steam momos, and they were quite impressive. Tender, n had ample filling inside. The sauce was spicy, n d soup also was very tasty. 5/5 for the momos.
Just because the kitchen is open to our eyes, ppl say ki its not a hygienic place, but it isn't a correct notion.
To sum up, a nice experience with great quality momos.

Crispy chilli babycorn was good at taste but not upto the mark as it used to be.. it was very much salty n saugy... 

Pan fried momo was really good. . It was spicy n tasted amazing with schezwan sauce n decorated with green onion..

I was thinking of getting myself some food from this place for quite some time after noticing it in zomato and today when i got the chance to bring some food to my home from here i was very disappointed with this place.
1st of all they were serving only noodles,rice and some chicken preparations..that's it..nothing else..so i had to order only a plate of dry chilli chicken.
2nd I told them to prepare it low spicy but after having it at home I realised that they completely ignored what I said .

I was absolutely starved for some Chinese and didn't wanna go too far from home in the cold , so went to this place to get my food packed. 
Its on the main road so not at all hard to find. Its a very small place , actually its not a PLACE  at all, the whole thing is a  kitchen with two chairs opposite to the shop.
Firstly , I was very disappointed with the people , one man gave me the will-burn-you-into-ashes look when I asked who would take the order and the others simply couldn't understand me I think . Then they said they were not serving fish or soup , both of which I had wanted very much. So I ordered the special pan fried chicken momo , a dry chilli chicken , a pan fried chicken and a chicken fried rice. They cook it in front of you and its not unhygienic and took very less time.
I was not very impressed by the food . The momos were good but I did not quite enjoy the too sweet sauce in both their fan fried dishes. The chilli chicken was good but would have liked it to be hotter and the rice was okay.
The price is not high but so is the taste. U can go there if you are expecting something very good and just need some food but not otherwise.

Location: Adjacent Gupta Brothers (New Alipore Branch). 

This place can be reached by a public conveyance which is either to Taratalla or fro Taratalla. Just ask to be dropped at Gupta Brothers or Triangular Park. You'll find this eatery a couple of shops near Gupta Brothers. 

A review has been long due for a place like this. It's a small eatery or one can say a hole-in-the-wall which is situated at the ground floor of a halted under-construction building and yes, it has been here for years serving people with good quality Tibetan and Chinese cuisine.
About the AMBIANCE, nothing as such, just an eatery with a few plastic seats placed on the sidewalk.

About the FOOD, this place serves quality as well as quantity. Have been here umpteen number of times and have always drooled over its select few which means my order has nearly been the same always! :p

- Steamed Momos (Veg) [6 pieces]
The wrap is a bit thicker than the usual, but, the filling is quite flavorful. Served with clear soup. 
Recommended.

- Hakka Noodles (Veg)
The noodles are perfectly boiled and wok-tossed with veggies along with street-style seasoning but, with a lower oil content. Tastes good, at least better than most of the other places which serve such a style of noodles or should I say Chowmein? :p
Recommended. 

- Lemon Coriander Soup
The right balance of flavors makes it a hit. :)

- Hot and Sour Vegetables
Fresh and juicy veggies tossed with seasoned sauce with its own balance of sourness of vinaigrette and hotness of spices makes it a nice side dish with rice. 

- Schezwan Fried Rice
Did I just say rice? Yes the last dish reminded me of it. Perfectly cooked rice tossed into Schezwan sauce and veggies. Delicious. 

The SERVICE is prompt and the STAFF is polite and friendly.

About the PRICE, a pocket friendly affair.

Overall has always been a good experience. 
- Would keep visiting this place. :)

Small outlet in new alipore area..this place does not provide any dine in facilities. A group of 4-5 people serve really tender,mouth savouring and utterly delicious momos as well as other varieties. Now,momos being my favourite..my first visit yielded me a plate of extremely yummilicious momo. They serve 5 pieces in a plate..a plate would cost around 50 rupees. Some people may think that being a roadside stall 50 rs is a bit more of a price compared to other stalls,but believe me it's worth the price. The momos are filled with soft and mouth melting chicken freshly cooked. I loved being here..i guess this place would add to my growing list of favourite momo outlets in kolkata.

This outlet have earned a lot of appreciation after its inception. It is located in a prime location, nearby new alipore triangular park and adjacent to "Gupta brothers". It is a very small outlet, the total available area is occupied by the kitchen itself. It doesn't have any sitting accommodation, hence take aways are ideal. They mainly offer momos, soups and a wide variety of Chinese cuisines etc; completely delivered with perfection. The quality of their offerings are A-class and sheerly succumbing. The quantity served by them are stuffed and abundant. The biggest plus point about this outlet is the rock bottom prices, which is truly incredible considering the quality and quantity of their offerings. "Steam & Fried" is definitely here to stay for a long long inning.

for a place which is a small window and people cooking behind it, i must say that they have a menu which is pretty good... from manchow soup to lemon coriander... from normal Manchurian to mushrooms and baby corn... this place has it all... from the point of view of the owners this place had opened up as a momo and soup joint but kept expanding on the menu because of the demand...

i hit this place at 2.30 PM on a Saturday and was shocked to see that there were almost 10 people standing in line for food... max were localities (of Course) who placed their order and went away saying they will be back in a  bit... i had to stand there and wait...

my order was simple... 2 veg momos... one manchow soup... and one Veg chowmien (hakka)... 

the momos were nice and the filling was good but the outer layering of dough is way to thick... the manchow soup was packed and they made the mistake of putting the fried noodles inside the soup and then packing it which in the end turned out to be like a gravy noodle kind of thing so it was a waste... but the taste of the same was pretty good... the chowmien this nothing special and is normal like the kinds found around... but the oil they use is lesser which made it a good treat...

all in all this place is a ok visit if you are in the neighborhood... in the sense of we like Anamika Rolls a lot so when we are there we will surely call for some items from this place to add the spice to the meal...

Steam and fried located in alipore near to the gupta brothers outlet is a small shop serving chinesefood.I stopped by here yesterday afternoon after an amazing spiderman show in southcity inox.
We were 2 people and we ordered a schezwan fried rice and manchurian along with veg momos(steamed)
The food like always was amazing especially the veg manchurian.
We were served food in the car and we gorged on it so fast that i forgot to take pics :p
The portions here are huge, and we were so full after our lunch.
Our bill was 200 after a tip to the server and we drove away happily.
Overall a good place for indianchinese style food(there is no seating,either opt for car eating or takeaways)

This place serves heavenly pan fried momos.. Their gravy is really good.. So i think their garlic chicken will also be a good dish to go with on hungry evenings.. I refrain everyone from ordering chowmein which is nothing compared to the momos.. The place outside this stall is also nice and comfortable.. So 4 stars for their pan momos..

The restaurant is located just opposite to the triangular park in new alipore..i discovered this place while just taking a walk..This place is a very cozy one and gathers good number of people..The place serves authentic Chinese momos..Not a pocket friendly option as lot more options are available in the city at cheaper rates..If you are in a hurry and want good fast food then this is the place..but when it comes to the price it sometimes hampers the pocket..
