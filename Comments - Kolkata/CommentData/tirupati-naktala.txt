Food isn't particularly good or bad. They have children working at this place, the staff seems disinterested, and cleanliness is not well maintained.

Situated near the Allahabad Bank, this outlet can cater a maximum of 16-20 people. They have seating arrangements both inside and outside. I ordered a Cheese Masala Dosa and it came in just 5 mins. +1 for their fast service. The Dosa was very crunchy and cheesy from the inside, just the way I like it. But the chutney was a letdown. Could have been better. I visited here quite a few times and I always found this place empty. Other than the chutney, I have no complaints. 

Having said that if you're craving for some South Indian food at a reasonable rate, then this place is your best bet. I'll gladly recommend this to everyone. Give it a try.  :)

The best south indian food at the cheapest price one can get in the city.
I have been visiting this place since my childhood.
And day by day Tirupati is getting better.
Parking available.
Seating available.
Price too cheap.
Food quality at its best. Nothing more to expect.
Enough said.
