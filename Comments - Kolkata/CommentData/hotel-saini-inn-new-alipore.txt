they need to learn how to talk with customers. When they don't have something available from their menu, the person who is handling the order should know the substitute items available in same price. But they directly deny that they don't know what they have. They should be of 1 rating not of 3 even. Worthless service. They only know how to send paper leaflets with daily newspapers and fill up the dustbins

Our office lunches generally come from this hotel. Portion , quality , taste all very generous. Hygenically packed and delivered at the table , which is the USP for us. Â Looking forward to many more years of association , good show Paa ji !!!!

If this blog didn't have a 140 character limit I would sum this place up as . Bad overpriced and difficult to reach.  But it does have a limit so I must write these pointless words . The food is below average tastes of nothing and gives you loose motions . The establishment serves North Indian food and ever more north Indian Chinese food .
