This place is located in jadavpur, near the KPC Hospital. It is quite easy to locate as it is on the main road. The ambience was okayish. We ordered crispy chicken, pan fried fish. The fish was better than the chicken as the latter tasted like babycorn. Then we ordered mixed fried rice, schezuan rice and garlic chicken. The rice was tasty and had a good amount of chicken and prawn in it. The garlic chicken tasted veryy good. Overall I liked the place.

It's not too fancy and quite easy on the wallet. Although their Thai soup has a unique touch , the other dishes were very basic. Opt for it only when you have less cash and need good quantity of food instead of quality.

I had visited this place at the end of the 2017 at 11 PM. Even the other restaurants were closed but this restaurant was not closed and was open with their good discipline. This restaurant is also kids friendly. The decorations of the restaurant was marvellous . I was with my mom and dad. We had ordered :
1: Mixed Fried Rice
2: Chilly Chicken
3: Butter Nan
4: Mutton Do piazza
                    The Chinese recipes was fabulous. The Butter Nan was quite soft and Mutton Do piazza was very creamy and tasty. All of that the not only the quality but also the quantity had impressed me. The decorations was too good. But one disadvantage is that it is located in an odd direction from our direction but according to the restaurant of should get full marks. I would request all to please visit this place and enjoy their superb Chinese Cuisines if you a food lover person.

Really nice food and the perfect ambience for a family dinner. Had Jodhpur chicken & butter nan. The chicken was a bit spicy but incredibly tasty. The naan was the softest I've had in a long time. The staff were courteous as well. The only downside was that the service time was quite high. I would love to revisit.

Do anyone actually knows of a place better than this in our Jadavpur locality, matching its varied range of menus, the so damn pocket friendly price list and the persistently excellent quality and taste control for ages since it was launched? I guess no. It might not b a place for luxury dining but yes it’s the best place to dine out with ur family and friends in the entire area from baghajatin to Dhakuria

Very nice place for students..Quite reasonable rates& authentic Chinese..We Virgin Colada and Chicken in Black pepper sauce as starter..chicken was soft and taste top class..mocktail was fine too..we then had American chopseuy...which was pretty good too..then we had Hakka Chow& Mongolian chicken..Chow was standard..and the chicken was good..with lots of broccoli babycorn in it..only issue with their bonesless chicken was.. pieces were small.. mostly.. Quantity was okayish.. slightly on the lesser side..but the taste made up for it easily..service was prompt enough..a little more quantity and bigger chicken pieces would make this one of the coolest chinese restaurants I went too..But certainly going again..
Quite light on the pocket too..all of the food cost Rs819(with 5% GST  as it is now).

I've visited this place a lot because this is very close from my house. Biryani is very good here, but can't quite say the same about the rest of the items. I've tried a lot of items here, so I'd say the food in this place is strictly average. Though I'd specially like to say the staffs are very polite. Ambience is okay too.

Visited the outlet for dinner on 28th of October. We knew that this place is well known for Mughlai and Indian cuisines apart from Chinese and Bengali fare. We wanted to have something light yet filling for dinner. We ordered Hyderabadi kebab for starters, and had ordered Lahori Murg and butter naan. 
The dishes tasted fine except for the fact that the chicken dish was a bit chewy. The kebabs were fine and the naans were yum. 
I guess the service can be a bit quicker, but considering the fact that it was a busy Saturday night, the delay is acceptable.
The bill came to be a bit more than Rs 750 which is ok. 
A good place to dine without burning a hole in your pockets.

Tried a lot of things from their menu and found nothing to recommend. And the pocket pinch is bit higher in comparison to the quality of the food served.

Located near KPC hospital, Jadavpur , this outlet has become student's favorite coz they serve authentic Chinese delicacy at an affordable price. 
Ambience was very soothing and the music they played goes very well with the decor. They maintained good hygiene. Staffs were well behaved.  Coming to the food, have tasted lahori murgh, seafood fried rice and lemon honey chicken. 
1) Seafood fried rice- it contained good amount of prawn(nothing else). Seafood rice should be named as prawn fried rice. Well, sufficient for two. Tasted nice.
2) Lemon honey chicken- the chicken pieces were cooked with honey . The dish was perfectly flavoured with lemon grass and lemon leaves. The sweetness of the honey was nicely balanced with the dish. Tasted delicious. Highly recommended .
3) Lahori murg- the chicken pieces were hard and chewy. Served with tomato based curry. Nothing special.
Conclusion:
Ambience - 4/5
Staff-4/5
Food-3.5/5
Quantity-4/5
Price-Affordable .
P.s.- A perfect place for students.

Being a resident of Jadavpur,Golden Gate had long been a familiar dine out for me.Its a perfect place for those luxurious family dinners.I had gone there with my family on one occasion and was completely overwhelmed by the grandeur of it all.The interiors are pristine,the staff is courteous too.Coming too the food,I found it quite good.We had ordered two plates of veg fried rice and a plate each of Schezwan chicken and hong kong chicken.These dishes sufficed for 4 of us.We had also taken two scoops of ice cream and all this came to around 750 bucks.I would recommend this place to others too.If you love around the area,do give this place a visit.

This restaurant is located just beside my college,(Kpc medical college and hospital, jadavpur). I regularly visit this place as it is very wallet-friendly and serves really good food. Kudos to the decor.

Chinese dishes are a must-try. Among chinese,Drums of heaven, crispy chicken, chicken mushroom onion fried rice, supreme chicken , mongolian prawn and thai chicken are higly recommendable. 

Among desserts , "Hot Gulab-jamun with vanilla ice-cream" is much loved. 

Indian dishes and the mocktails are also good.

We were pandal hopping on shashthi night, and didn't have dinner. It was 1 am and we were hungry like anything, so I would take this review with a grain of salt. The food was decent, ambiance was comforting, we ordered the egg fried rice and the egg noodles with chicken, munchurian, garlick chicken and chilli chicken, pretty much the usual. The fried rice and the garlick chicken tasted great, the rest were decent at best. The noodles were tad over spicy and lacked flavour, the other two chicken items were also average.

Located near sulekha, jadavpur; this restaurant is visible from the main road towards sulekha if one is coming from KPC medical college. This isn't a very big restaurant but it's neat and clean and the ambience is also nice. Now, the food, we ordered a veg fried rice, a chicken manchurian and a chicken gravy noodles, the manchurian and fried rice were really good. The quantity of chicken gravy chowmein was way too much. The food was undoubtedly very nice. But coming to the staff service, it is a bit disappointing. We had to call the waiters and request them for water, sauce (in between lunch). Apart from that this is a good place with affordable price.

Its an experienced one which serves good food at good prices,which are not pocket holing at all.
Located just beside KPC hospital main gate near Jadavpur 8b bus stand.

Indian and tandoor items are just mouth watering here.
Chinese is also good though.
Quantity served is impressive,one plate is enough to satisfy two hungry souls.

Decor is basic but food is tasty here.

I loved the Kashmiri Naan. It is a sweet preparation of Naan, delicious and is itself very filling.

I had chicken biryani, chicken reshmi kebab, naan and roti and chicken reshmi butter masala. Biryani was a bit spicy. The roti and naan was good. Loved the chicken reshmi kebab and reshmi butter masala. Once i had their(if i am not wrong) tutti frutty which was really yummy. This place is good. The owner is a lovely lady. Will i visit this place again? Maybe

When I visited this place, it was my first time visit to Golden Gate, I ordered Drums of Heaven & Chicken clear soup as starters and they took roughly a long time to deliver it on the table. The taste was average nothing great. Didn't order anything on the main course.

Ambience was really good. Helping quantity was also adequate and most of the dishes we ordered tasted good, other than the Biriyani which smelled intensely of some artificial essence. Avoid Biriyani, otherwise okay.

Finally visited this place which has been in my bookmarked restaurants for a long time. Gold gate is located between Sulekha more and 8B bus stand in Jadavpur.  It's pretty eye catching whenever you pass by this place. The interior impressed me very much.  It's simple yet elegant with warm shades of upholstery. This place is pretty spacious with comfortable seats. Perfect for family get-togethers especially.  My friend and I tried only the tandoori roti, butter naan and paneer butter masala. From whatever little we ordered, I can say the food was really delectable.  The breads were fresh and soft. The paneer butter masala was creamy and well prepared with the right amount of spices and little touch of the sweetness of cherries. The price along with newly applicable GST is not much exorbitant and the service was quick too.

Being the closest to my residence this is a restaurant that sees frequent revisits from me. Most of the time, when it's pretty late and I'm too tired to experiment, I choose to order from Golden Gate or just drop by with a friend. It goes beyond saying that the food quality and quantity, the ambience, the cleanliness, the behaviour of the servers, everything is upto the mark...which are the reasons why I revisit this place often. The review would be ridiculously long  to jot down every single experience... Mostly because all have been positive so far. However, I have a few specials to recommend, oyster prawn is one of my favorites mostly because of the quantity and size of the prawns for the price and ofcourse taste. Others would include crispy conzy lamb and shredded lamb in plum sauce, mutton Rogan josh, mutton keema bhoona gosth, mixed rice noodles, drumsticks. 
It is a cozy and nice place to have a sumptuous meal with the close ones.

This review is based on home delivery only!!..a popular dinning joint, had been a miss from my food map for no particular reason. Hence decided to rectify it. We ordered shahi pulao along with korma. Shahi pulao was really shahi...with innumerable ingredients paneer, beens, peas, kaju, almonds, raisin, watermelon, cherry, etc etc. It was so yumm ..that one can easily give the side dish a miss!! korma tasted great as well though i prefer something more spicy. And yaa...a special mention for the quantity. One plate...and it is good for 2 people....even 3 people with low diet can easily satisfy their hunger with a solitary plate. Thumbs up!! I would definitely like to visit once and give a detailed review about the amvience and other delicacies...

Located near the sukanta setu crossing, this place is quite popular among locals and almost gets a small queue on weekends. I am visiting this place almost after 2 years of time, and that too on a busy crowded weekend night. We wanted a table for two and were immediately given a place. But man, this was some crowd, at the top of their voices, like a peak hour wedding house dinner scene. The décor is normal with tables and sofas placed at adequate spacing. The ac was not much up to the form and was somehow managing to reach us in a mild way. A polite staff took the order for a chicken rice noodles and a supreme chicken and the food arrived in some time. Looked good, tasted good. But nothing wonderful though. Then we asked for the bill and waited almost 15 mins for the supervisor who was frantically running here and there. Would like to revisit again on some quite day.

This Eatery near Sulekha, Jadavpur is definitely anything but professional. I had a horrifyingly bad experience there.
1. The ambience is not good.
2. The staffs are not at all professional.
3. The decord is not worth it.
4. The quality- It was terrible.

Besides these downsides , would like mention two more.
1. When I went there for having lunch, the A/C was not working. So I found it pretty difficult to finish my lunch.
2. I went there with my vegetarian friend, and we ofcourse ordered Veg food. But they ended up serving something which was having egg in it.

I found nothing good about this place.

Just few meters to the right of the Shulekha Bridge towards Jadavpur while you come down from Santoshpur. This restaurant is quite spacious with minimal yet elegant decor and dim lighting.

Food out here tastes really good as had tried this place many a times with my family. The Chicken noodles, mixed fried rice, paneer butter masala, chicken bharta, chilli chicken, biriyanis etc all that we had so far were nicely cooked, presented well and tasted even better. Their kashmiri pulao I simply love with all the delicious toppings.

Prices are pocket friendly.

Staffs very much polite.

Parking available on the roadside.

Home delivery system is fast and good.

Golden Gate, Jadavpur, one of the closest restaurant from my university. Visited this place somedays back with a friend.

As we entered we were welcomed by a dark themed ambience. Atmosphere inside was really comfortable for enjoying good food.On the menu here, you can choose from a variety of south Indian, North Indian & Chinese dishes. I was interested in the last two.Taking our seats we ordered drums of heaven as starter & mutton keema bhuna ghosht with some butter naan & tandoori roti.

They arrived on our plates after around 20 minutes.

I liked the name, drums of heaven. It was good as a starter. 
Mutton keema bhuna ghosht was also delicious. Pieces of tender mutton tasted great with the butter naan & roti.

Food satisfied me. Staffs was helpful. Prices of all the items are pretty reasonable. I was really happy getting around 100 bucks off, being a Jadavpur university student. So, this is a good one among the nearby pocket friendly restaurants.

Have been there for a couple of times, though the food is good I didn't find the staff behaviour good. Food was offered after a decent time and though its a big place but its stuffed with tables which increases the profit and decreases the comfort and privacy of the people. Try Chinese Only. ;) Lastly there is a huge parking problem if you own a car.

The crispy chilli baby corn had the right amount of crisp and I think everyone should also try out the pan fried chilli chicken. Even the oyster chicken. 
For vegetarians, the vegetable manchurian is too good.

The ambience was really good and the staff was pretty responsive. 
The crispy chilli baby corn had the right amount of crisp and I think everyone should also try out the pan fried chilli chicken. Even the oyster chicken. 
For vegetarians, the vegetable manchurian is too good. 

I would love to go to this place again.

A place i am visiting since college days!!it has maintained its standard as usual..ambience is good for fine dining but the staff needs to have more info about the dishes served and be more attentive while taking orders!the order goes like dis seafood fried rice which was loaded with shrimps fish and the oh so lovely smokeyness completely mouthwatering!side dish was lamb n mushroom in plum sauce,the dish was cooked to perfection but not very hapoy in terms of quantity and was more sweet than expected!i have always bowled out by their chinese dishes n will recommend the same for all

This is one restaurant in jadavpur which has really a posh interior. The reception counter is awfully dull and doesn't match the taste. Food food is not bad but predominately of two or three basic taste groups. Quantity normal. Pricing doesn't match the quality and quantity of the food. Some people pay premium to get nice cutlery and comfortable sofa. But the kinds like me only care about the food. And I have been repeatedly disappointed.

Was quite happy with the food, menu, ambience, price all of it. Ordered Chicken Hyderabadi kabab which was spicy and delicious. Then went on to chicken biryani which was very well flavoured. Had butter naan which was huge and Shahjahani chicken that had a very different flavour than usual Indian curries. Ended with tutti fruity which came in a good quantity and was pretty tasty too. The bill came to 1050 or so.

When a restaurant offers 4-5 types of cuisine, i generally tends to keep my distance from it. Because often times quality degrades with overwhelming size of the menu. But in case of this restaurant that is not the case. 
Although the menu is vast but the quality of the food is pretty good. Price is also affordable. But the main problem is the quantity of the food, especially starters. 
I recommend their Chinese dishes.

If dining in a dark and gloomy place is what you like then Golden Gtae is the place. The interior of this restaurant is so dark that you might have to turn on your torch to check the menus. Jokes apart, the ambiance is good but it is a bit dark though.

The service is good, the people are friendly and the food is also good. The best things are the starters. Both the tandoor and chinese starters are very good. The fish preparations are very good. The most favorite of all is pan fried fish. I often take it for my home. My parents and my wife really like this item.

Coming to the main course, the Chinese foods are the one you should try. It's not that the Indian items are bad but I liked the Chinese more in here. It's a multi cuisine restaurant so like most of the other multi cuisine restaurants they are good at something and way better on another. So there's an inconsistency in preparations.

But still I would suggest this place, for it's starters and Chinese preparations only.

Food was good but that was not enough to balance the disappointments!
We ordered thai soup which was good, pan fried chicken and crispy conjee lamb. The chicken lost its tenderness due to deep fry. The lamb was tasty.
But, quantity very low, had to wait too long and is a tad bit overpriced.

Had booked the voucher available for lunch Chinese combo nonveg. It started with blue lagoon beverage. It was pathetic. Or maybe , not our taste. Then came chicken clear soup. It was fine.very  Soothing in this winter season . Then it was pepper chicken , a starter. It tasted very fine. But the quantity was sooo very less. -_-  then the main courses.. some chowmein and some rice .. the rice tasted good. The chowmein was average. They had garlic chicken as a side. It was fair to taste. In desert , we got vanilla ice cream in chocolate sause. It was fine as well. Over all , the voucher price was worth it. :)

The dish was prepared well but the chicken pieces were not fresh. ambience is good. situated near jadavpur 8b...easy to locate on the main road. Another time it was the thai soup, pan fried chicken and the shredded lambs...the lambs were well cooked and tender.  the chicken was okayish.  the service is a bit late though.

Its just an Okay place to dine out if you're not quite planning to spend a lot for your taste buds, yet not disheartening them regarding the taste. I tried out the North Indian cuisine over here, Mutton Biriyani amd Tandoor items, but the biriyani was very greasy and the piece of mutton was small. But they maintained the flavour. Tandoori items like Kebabs were good (I tasted Tengri Kebab and Reshmi Kabab). Average ambience, not so decorative, yet spacious. Service is average and wait time also around 30mins.

I had gone there approx 5 years ago during Durga Puja,for lunch,with my friends. The service was very good. We ordered Chinese dishes which I am sorry to say I don't remember. Quantity is good enough and pocket pinch is reasonable. Golden Gate has only grown with time.

In the Pre Christmas celebration mood visited this restaurant with my sister for having lunch. After entering firstly the ambiance and the interior impressed us with properly arranged, large dining space. We had a nearbuy coupon for non-veg Chinese lunch pricing 379 Rs. The menu was already fixed by the voucher. So we just got seated and waited for the foods to be served. The service was quite prompt. Firstly they served the chicken clear soup which was decent in taste. Next the chilli pepper chicken was served and it has a perfect crispness with spicy flavour. In the main course we had chicken hakka noodles which was the perfect dish of the day with ample of chicken and egg. The schezwan chicken fried rice was also good. Garlic chicken was served with 6 pieces of boneless chicken in a sweetish spicy gravy which I liked the most. Ofcourse I loved the blue lagoon and the ice cream too. The foods served in decent quantity for feeding two girls perfectly. So overall it was a good experience.

Visited there a lots of time since 2010. They are like a saviour on the busy weekends when the other restaurants have a long waiting queue. This restaurant have a large sitting arrangement so the waiting time is not so long. The waiters are quite courteous.
I have tried almost every dish there and each one of those was quite delectable except biriyanis. The portion size is also enough for two people. My favorite dishes are crispy chili babycorn, roasted chili chicken, mixed mushroom onion fried rice, lat me kai.
Previously they used to arrange a complementary birthday cake if you are celebrating there. Also on 20th July they used to serve a dessert on the house as it's their opening anniversary day.Not sure if they are maintaining this practice till date as now we usually order for home delivery.
Overall it's always a dependable choice in midrange eateries.

Had tried their hakka noodles, chicken singapore noodles, schezwan rice, veg manchurian and chilli chicken. Schezwan rice is highly recommended. Absolutely loved it! Singapore and hakka noodles could have been better.

Located just next stoppage of the KMC Hospital on the left while going towards Sulekha on the main road. Visited this eatery on a Saturday evening to try out some light snacls. Ordered chicken garlic soup, chilli mutton, fried lobsters - all of them tasted good, though the gravy  tossed in with mutton and lobster almost tasted the same. I would recommend the food lovers to try out the mutton chilli which was the best among all the dishes. Mutton was well cooked - soft and chewable. Rates are reasonable and ambience is good. Service was okish  - requested to switch on their ACs as it was too stuffy but no one cared to do so. Behavior of Sr staff was so so.

This restaurant is very near to my place and I cross it almost every other day on my way to office but never had the opportunity to get down and take a seat inside.
So home delivery is the only option for foodies like me who is always on the look out for good food.

I have ordered twice from here. My funda is to start with basic simple dishes whenever I try out new places. This way you get to know the cooking behavior of the restaurant/joint before you try out complex and costly dishes.

I had ordered Mix fried rice, chilli chicken, chicken gravy noodles and chilli pepper chicken. Well, I loved the chilli chicken cuz it was very tasty and the chicken pieces were big and no flour coating was there. Rice was equally good. The gravy noodles also tasted awesome but just one little flaw, I thought since they provided a bowl full of gravy, the boiled noodles provided alongside was very low in quantity. The chilli pepper chicken was good again but those chicken pieces were a little overcooked but that was still edible.

I was impressed with this restaurant and hopefully was willing to try out other cuisines from here but that took a serious hit when yesterday I tried their Indian cuisine by ordering Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chaap. There was no aroma in the biriyani, just brown bland rice. I found egg shells in the chicken chaap gravy. Absolutely disappointed. 

Initially I rated 3.5 but after yesterday, unapologetic-ally I am reducing it to 2.5. Their chinese is good but Indian cuisine needs a lot of work.

The chilli pepper chicken was good again but those chicken pieces were a little overcooked but that was still edible.

I was impressed with this restaurant and hopefully was willing to try out other cuisines from here but that took a serious hit when yesterday I tried their Indian cuisine by ordering Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chaap. There was no aroma in the biriyani, just brown bland rice. I found egg shells in the chicken chaap gravy. Absolutely disappointed. 

Initially I rated 3.5 but after yesterday, unapologetic-ally I am reducing it to 2.5. Their chinese is good but Indian cuisine needs a lot of work.

A small place just before 8B bus stand...It won't catch your eye but once you enter, you will be shocked to see the pretty restaurant inside. The food is very tasty and not very expensive. Good place to go if you want to eat Tibetan around the area.

Ordered through Zomato - chicken tandoori and Kasturi Kebab. The tandoori was deep roasted while the Kasturi Kebab was just perfect. In the assortments they gave a bowl of chopped carrots and no chutney. Mixed reactions!!!

We visited on Laksmi puja and they still had their special Durga puja menu which neither had any soup or other good food. It was overprized and food quality was at all not good. 
I was highly disappointed with the type of food they served.
In Manchurian fish they served poor quality fish, which was neither bhetki nor basa.

I agree with all the bad reviews here. Its too overpriced for the food they served. Its just bad, everything from biriyani, to their kabab and even the chinese, which can'tgo much wrong. Ambience is good and the only thing good about the place.
But nothing makes up for bland food.

I'hv visited this place with 4 friend today. Restaurant is good. Interior is nice. Service is good. We have ordered chicken lolypop, dry chilly paneer then we have palaced chicken biriyani and tikka masala. 

Lolypop n paneer was good taste.
Biriyani is too oily.
Chicken tikka masala is excellent.

Price is bit high. According to price quantity is less.
Its better trip in hatari restaurant.

Golden gate is a shop..preferably i dont want call it a restaurant because of the quality of the food they had served yesterday.I ordered for chicken lollypop and asked to parcel among with two mix hakka noodles and a mix fried rice with a chicken manchurian. Jist because i had ordered atake away..they took the chance to make me fool by delivering chicken pakora kind of fried pieces instead of lollypop. They did not think that their visit again can become NEVER VISIT AGAIN. If they are going to continue like this. More over if a restaurant is not capable to cope up with crowd and ultimately had to opt for degradation of quality of food..should mandatorily shut down their cheating business

Ordered for 13 portions of Peas Pulao, order was taken by Mr. Ujjwal for home delivery. The occasion was my son's birthday on 01/10/2016, I have always been a fan of Golden Gate but this time the Peas Pulao was dissapointing as the quality of rice was bad we don't even make pulao with this type of rice in our home. When the foil pack was opened it had a musty smell and oil was floating at the bottom. Plz improve your product or else we have to look for better options...

To me, Golden Gate has always been a decent enough place to go for some dinner or order for home delivery. I've tried their chinese as well as their North Indian dishes, and I would definitely recommend the latter.  The array of flavors in their peas polao, kashmiri polao, chicken reshmi butter masala, paneer butter masala, plain nan and chicken tandoori is quite nice and satisfactory. The chinese on the other hand is average. But all in all, Golden Gate will always be one of my preferred mid-range eateries.

A good pocket friendly restaurant which is a very convenient place to go to for the college students in the nearby area since they offer discounts specially for Kpc. We are regular customers and both Chinese and Indian are quite good. We ordered the Thai soup and chilli pepper chicken as well as chicken lat ma kai for starters. The soup was excellent...light as well as wholesome and slightly spicy. It had mushrooms and chicken with a small amount of chilli oil on top. Chilli pepper chicken was succulent and delicious. Lat ma kai was also tasty but paled slightly in comparison to the chilli pepper chicken. Next we ordered chicken meifoon which is rice noodles and garlic chicken. Both were quite tasty. However special mention goes to the Jaipuri murg which has eight pieces in a spicy tangy gravy. Since we are frequent visitors we will surely be able to elaborate other dishes in future. Ohh and the bill was only 1046 for 6 people... student discount included of course.
P.S. An update on their South Indian dishes. Some of the tastiest dosas and idlis within a very pocket friendly range. The dhania dosa and paper plain dosa are amazing as is the masala idly. They serve it dissected and it will remind you of the fried masala bread which I'm sure many have eaten at home.

Looks like a Chinese eatery from the outside, but actually is a pretty decent multi cuisine restaurant. The Bengali cuisine was surprisingly pretty good. The Bhapa Ilish and the Chingri Malaicurry were stand outs.

Very conveniently located - walking distance from 8B, decent ambience and pocket friendly as well. A full meal for 2 shouldn't cost more that 800 !!

All foods were nice,I would like to mention this while talking and eating our tandoori,our biriyani went cold,so one of the server came to us and reheated the biriyani,it was a nice gesture.

I dont know how to start the review of this place...
It is located at sulekha more in Jadavpur..
Place was spacious but not maintained.

Server had no knowledge about their menus. Even they cannot write down properly.

#Mocktails
"Blue lagoon" had too much of vanilla syrup and soda had no fizz. That means old. Taste was too sugary.
"Mohito" yes they have written Mohito instead of Mojito. So it was basically same as lagoon but in transparent color. We had to add salt in it for blending the extra sugar..
In one word "CRAP".

#Starters
Chilli garlic pepper chicken.....
I dont know how to explain.. they are charging 200 INR for this item and serving flour coated with bone chicken only 6 pc??? I mean which restaurant serves with bone item nowadays....

#Main course
Mixed Mushroom onion Fried rice was poor taste. Even roadside snacks parlor can make better.

#Red Chilli fish
Fish used on that dish was no "Basa" or "Bhetki" it was different, in my guess it was "Aar bhetki" cheaper than other two.
Stinky smell and bad taste. I leftover the dish and paid the bill..
My horrible experience lasted only 40 mins...
I will never visit again.....

We had gone here a couple of weeks back having purchased a coupon on the nearbuy app. It's a regular joint, not too good, not too bad. The staff is courteous. The food was great, especially the Hakka noodles and veg Manchurian. The fresh lime soda deserves a special mention too because it was great but not better than that of Woodstock 1969. They cooked their crispy chilli baby corn in the same utensil in which they cooked a fish preparation though and that was a turn off since my lady, who is a pure vegetarian, couldn't enjoy it. Since we had bought the coupon on nearbuy, we decided not to trouble them much and didn't complain about that, but do be aware of it. Apart from that, the experience was quite pleasant

Location-This place is really close to the 8b bus stand.You need to walk towards sulekha more after crossing the KPC medical college, the restaurant is on your left.

Ambiance-The place has a nice decor and soothing lights.

Service-The waiters are really courteous and they suggested us the best items according to our need. 

Food- We ordered as suggested by the waiter,Special Tengri kabab along with Blue Lagoon to sip through.
Chicken legs were stuffed with keema and roasted outside as well.It was really delicious.

Then in the main course we ordered  "Pan Fried Noodles" and "Mixed Hakka Noodles" along with "Shredded lamb and mushroom in chili plum sauce". Both were really good.

Verdict- Really nice place to visit with both family and friends without making a hole in the pocket.
But i would expect a little quicker service the next time i visit.

Located at the heart of South Kolkata, opposite to 8B Bus Stand, Jadavpur. This is a Multi-cuisine restaurant i have been visiting for the past 6 years. I have never been disappointed. The food and service is too good. and now thanks to Zomato app, I can order online and avail home delivery through it.

There specialities are North Indian and Chinese cuisines. The food is full of taste and less on oil. There north Indian preparations are always a delight. In all these years that i have been going to this restaurant, I have never seen a decline in their standard and quality.

In dessert, The Tutti fruity is a must try.. Rich with ice cream and fruits with various jams.. Iits mouth watering finish to a wonderful meal. Give it a Try... You'll love it.

Location-This place is really close to the 8b bus stand.You need to walk towards sulekha more after crossing the KPC medical college, the restaurant is on your left.

Ambiance-The place has a nice decor and soothing lights.

Service-The waiters are really courteous and they suggested us the best items according to our need. 

Food- We ordered as suggested by the waiter,Special Tengri kabab along with Blue Lagoon to sip through.
Chicken legs were stuffed with keema and roasted outside as well.It was really delicious.

Then in the main course we ordered  "Pan Fried Noodles" and "Mixed Hakka Noodles" along with "Shredded lamb and mushroom in chili plum sauce". Both were really good.

Verdict- Really nice place to visit with both family and friends without making a hole in the pocket.
But i would expect a little quicker service the next time i visit.

Visited this place quite a number of times. This rating is based on the overall experience I gathered. Best part is that Golden Gate is very much pocket friendly. Food and portions are decent too. Overall not a bad place to dine out in case you are feeling lazy to cook at home, or if you are running short of cash at the end of the month. :)

This place being so close to my home has always been the go to joint for me and my family, whether it be the durga puja rush or any other kind of festivity, they handle the customers well without causing them much hassle. After being freed from the domination of a certain person, went there for a pleasant lunch and was utterly rejuvenated, i had ordered for the mutton rogan josh and tandoori roti, the service is prompt, the servers are hospitable, the food is good and every morsel will surely bring back memories.

We took a parcel last night from this place. Of all the items that we ordered the chicken bharta was a flop. It was  in shredded pieces and we could find only 2 pieces and they made the gravy thick. Even after looking for some more pieces in the gravy nothing was there. This is very unsatisfactory and I want the concern should provide an answer to this.

Located close to 8b bus stand, this place is one of the few options to choose from in that particular area. Decorated nicely, the ambiance is appealing. The dry chilli chicken, pan fried fish is really good here. Pocket pinch is super reasonable and having a full course meal won't burn a hole in your pocket (which is great!) However I was let down by the service. It was slow and the person attending us was extremely disinterested and rude to say the least. This place really deserves better. I'd urge the management to look into the matter.

I had been to this place many times. Ambience is fine. Food quality depends on the dish. Few are good but few are not up to the mark at all. But their behavior has deteriorated considerably. They will be very good to you on a normal day but in weekends or any special holidays when the crowd is relatively on the higher side, They seem to be unable to handle situation. Behavior becomes an issue some times then. Even their manager does not address issues properly. Had a bitter experience few months back on a public holiday evening. Never visited this place again. Will never suggest anyone ether.

Amazing food. That's all that matter. Golden gate served delicious meal, from starters to dessert. We bought both Chinese and Indian coupons and were not disappointed.

Situated on the road, GG serves one of the best Indian and Chinese food in the Jadavpur area. My favorites were Reshami kababs, lemon-coriender soup and Gulab Jamun. It was probably the best I ever had. We even complimented the management.

Everything rest, crispy chicken, chicken tikka butter masala, fried rice, Hakka chow, chicken Manchurian, makhani dal, tandoori roti and ice cream that we had was top notch. So rare do we find a place that serves everything of the best quality. Food was all fresh. I read some negative reviews but I guess we got to the restaurant on their best days. We enjoyed everything we were served.

We got 2 coupons for 4 for just Rs. 748. As for improvements, the interior was too red, dull and dark. We would prefer if the surroundings looked easy on the eyes rather than a vibrant reddish look. Air conditioning had some problems. We did complain but the staffs said they couldn't fix it.

It was a fantastic day, my parent's 31st marriage anniversary and of course a reason to dine out. We opted for golden gate as it was a multi cuisine restaurant and close to our place. We ordered (just hold your breath) carribean drumsticks as starter. Then main dish: mutton biryani, cheese nun, shahjahani murg, tandoori roti, akbari gost, American chopsuey, Chinese chopsuey, plain rice, dhokar dalna and ilish bhapa. That's why we needed a multi cuisine restaurant. Anyway, d food was superb. Delicious and yummy. Service was prompt and cooperative. Interior was quite good. The only problem was the ac. I think it was not working properly. Or may b the rush made us sweat. Or else overall very nice experience.

They gave 2 fresh lime soda, 2 lemon coriander soup(chicken), 1 plate crispy chicken, 1 chicken manchurian (6 pcs), 1 plate egg chicken rice, 1 plate egg chicken noodles & 2 scoops of ice cream. The food was good in terms of taste and quantity was sufficient for two people. The service & behaviour of the staffs are very good. I would like to visit here again.

We have been there to taste their Chinese cuisine for the first time and we had chicken lemon coriander soup, crispy chicken, chicken Hakka noodle, chicken fried rice, garlic chicken and manchurian chicken followed by the desert as vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and fresh lime soda... Well the soup was good, it tastes perfect and filled with good amount of chicken, chicken hakka noodle was worth trying for everyone, it was very good and tasty, chicken fried rice and manchurian and garlic chicken was also delicious although  we don't like their fresh lime soda, it was too less in quantity and ice cream was tasty but that too was very less in quantity but other than that the decoration of the restaurant was very nice but the one thing that they must have to  improve was the ambience of the staffs, the should be more polite to customers and need to learn more hospitality

The place serves decent food, though nothing extra ordinary, nothing to talk down upon either. Over time the place has grown in popularity and for rightful reasons too. The service is much better than what it used to be seven to eight years ago. Waiters hardly knew what was on the menu, let alone suggest the house specials. This is not at all the case now. Pleased there.

One item, I always make a point to order when I visit Golden Gate is the pan fried fish. I find a certain comfort in how the crispy fried golden fish spheres amalgamate beautifully with the sauce. While the exterior is still slightly crisp, the fish inside is soft and melts in the mouth. 

While I do like the Chinese served by Golden gate, my family is a bit inclined towards the Indian delicacies. Hence, there is a bit of everything for everyone to dine on.

Golden Gate has a red door. Food tastes OK. The same type of menu, just like Bawarchi or Calcutta Bistro. The usual Jadavpur crowd. We settled for Chinese. Chili Prawn Dry was a good starter. Honey Lemon Chicken, Egg fried rice and Crispy Chicken for mains. The rice and crispy chicken tasted good. The lemon honey chicken was just about OK.

Located very near to where i live, this place is one cosy and the interior is just fine. I had gone for a North Indian dinner for a change and it was a good decision to select Golden Gate. 

The food, we ordered plain Naan, Chicken Tarka and Punjabi Aloo Dum. The Chicken bharta could be much better. I have tried a lot better than that. The Aloo Dum was something that i really liked. It was medium spicy and tasty aloo dum. Plus points, the potatoes weren't sweet. 

The food was nice and the service was great. I didn't had to wait for my food. The restaurant is clean and everything is well maintained. Golden gate is worth visiting for a nice family dinner or a get together. Pocket friendly and good food. Isn't that what the foodies need? 

Thank you.

Location- beside KPC hospital near 8b
 We ordered tikka kabab, reshmi kabab, naan, tandoori roti, mutton rogan josh, mixed veg and chicken lemon coriander soup..
The soup was tangy and smooth with generous amt of chicken pieces. The kababs were the biggest attraction..the chicken pieces were well cooked and succulent, the pudina chutney enhanced the flavours. 
The mixed veg.  had generous pieces of paneer 
The mutton pieces were well cooked and soft though the gravy was bit spicy..
The impeccable service was also a highlight

On the eve of poila boishakh(bengali happy new year) my 2 friends & i visited this place for dinner. Since it was an auspicious day for us,so as expected the waiting list was too long & we had to wait for 30mins approx. So after waiting for sometime,we finally managed to get in.

The place is very spacious with 2 floors of sitting. The place was bustling with crowd & so as expected the staff were delaying it a bit to take the orders. Still we managed to order the following items:-

1. Chicken kasturi kebab- 6 pieces of mild herby kebabs served with chutney & salad. The taste was superb & the chicken was cooked to perfection & it was too soft to eat. Recommended

2. Chicken hyderabadi kebab- 6pcs of spicy masala coated kebabs which gave a different taste after having the kasturi kebab. This was also served with chutney & salad. Again a recommended starter.

3. Chicken schezwan rice- We had 2 plates of it. The quantity was very good indeed & was just perfectly to fill the tummy of 3 us.

4. Thai chicken- Shredded chicken dish made with mushrooms,bell peppers & brocoli in green paste. The taste was mild & we didnt like it that much as it didnt compliment with our main course.

5. Hot garlic fish- 8pcs of fish cubes served in garlic gravy. The dish wasnt that hot as expected to be. The fish cubes as well wasnt fried that well since the outer batter was a bit undercooked.

6. Mixed lime water soda

7. Soda shikanji

The place is pocket friendly since our bill came to arouns 1850. Taxes are separately charged. The service was slow as expected due to huge rush & our bill even had an error since we were charged 3 extra soda shikanjis which they rectified it without any problem. This place is an ok place.

As evident in the reviews here at Zomato, there is mostly a mixed response about the quality they maintain for the food, and I believe it is right so, as my experience too wasn't a good one. Located conveniently between Sulekha Petrol Pump and 8B Bus stand, somewhere close to Wow Momo and Koshe Kosha, this is one of the most frequented joints by the local.

One fine evening, as I was walking to 8B Bus Stand to board my usual bus, I decided to walk-in and have light food to satisfy my hunger. As soon as I entered, I found the place to be slightly low in lights. The ambiance isn't bad, but mostly portrays something similar to a bar. The lights are mostly kept low, something perfect for couples. :-)I decided to grab a seat and ordered for my usual Chicken Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken. The food took some time to come. The Rice was fresh and properly cooked. It wasn't hard and the chicken pieces were tender. The disappointing dish of the day was Chilly Chicken. The Chicken was simply hard to tear through. Although the preparation wasn't tad-bad, it didn't represent the likes of being classified as Chilly Chicken. The Chicken wasn't crisp but rather very moist. Perhaps a clear indications of either reheating the dish or the Chicken being cooked in a partial-frozen state leading to the stiffness.

I was in a hurry and didn't complain while eating. Grabbing all that I could with the onions and the gravy, I asked for the bill. This is when, the person who came up to hand over the bill, I told him about the state of the Chilly Chicken. While he agreed that the dish may not have been to my expectation, by comparing the hard chicken, he wished if I could have had bring it to his notice earlier, so as something could have been done something about.

Personally, I would have had done so, but seeing the sorry state of affair of the Chicken dish, I actually didn't bother to make an unnecessary cry about this. I quickly paid off the bill and made my way towards my destination.

Note:- The bill offered me a 10% or 20% concession for dining in. I am not sure if it is a regular discount provided to their customers or if it was given specially to me to compensate for the not-so-good Chilly Chicken. Even though, I may consider it to be a good gesture, it doesn't negate the fact, that cooking was below-par. The money is not an issue here. What matters most, is the quality of food. I wasn't astonished to see, a similar concern being voiced by many people here. Strangely enough, one such review here is followed by a reply, probably from one of the management airing a snobbish attitude which does no good but more harm to the reputation of the restaurant. I hope to go back sometime soon, with an expectation that the flaw will be worked upon and the quality of the cooking would be notched up higher.

Wonderful ambiance. Music was loud. But food was good and tasty. Tried kashmiri polao, jaipuri murg. Service was cordial. Also tried moctail and ice cream with gulab jamun. Looking for another chance.

This place, being near to my home, I have eaten here many times. It is located on the way from Sulekha to Jadavpur on the right. The service is very good and professional. And the food is delicious too. Last time I went there, we ordered Reshmi kebab, chicken fried rice and another chicken dish.All the dishes tasted good but the Reshmi kebab was in a class of its own. It was marvellous. Though the pricing was a bit more than I would have liked, but its totally worth the good food. Hope to visit soon.

Located at a prime location in Jadavpur..and being near my house I wanted to try out one day...and the food experience was bad..
The ambiance and the staff are good but when it comes to the main thing..the food ..its highly disappointing....We had ordered garlic fish...mixed fried rice...some chicken dish..i forgot the name...and mixed gravy chowmein...the fish was stinking...and the fish and chicken gravy all tasted the same...the rice was okay and the mixed gravy noodles was very average....
Though the price and quantity is fine but am scared to go back.....!!

The place and ambience is nice , however the quality of food is way too bad ... My order was drums of heaven, polau and kadhai chicken (waiter's recommendation). The quantity was good enough but when it comes to the quality I was highly disappointed, the kadhai chicken was the worst.. 
I would prefer Calcutta Bistro more than this one ..

This is my second time writing a review for this place. First time i went there i was really dissatisfied and upon expressing my dislike, the person who manages their account on zomato claimed that nothing like that had happened. So today i got the chance to visit this place again with my friends to see if anything had changed for the good. And what an experience it was. The food quality has degraded, not that it was any good in the first place. everything was too oily and tasted horrible. When i complained, they explained by saying that they have many cooks so this sort of problem may occur which is a really stupid answer in the first place. And the big finale came when i found shreds of really sharp plastic in the noodles. (pic of which has been attached). And they did not have any explanation for that. So this is me talking directly to the management of Golden Gate. You have established a horrible restaurant with repulsive quality food. And you should be ashamed of the fact that shreds of plastic are present in your dishes. Last time you said that nothing had happened, but this time, I have handed over the proof. Either learn to run your restaurant in a better way or close it down. Dont risk the health of innocent people for money. I will never set a foot in your restaurant again and i urge the readers of my review to do the same. moreover, I will make sure you lose business from all my friends at KPC. 
Have a good day...

On the evening of the 14th, me and my valentine decided to try some good Chinese cuisine for dinner.

We initially planned and headed to Fiesta, but we changed due to the distance we had to cover to and fro.

Well, around 8:15 we entered, this a red color schemed restaurant. Dim light with properly arranged interior. Greeted by a lady at the reception, we waited for a couple of minutes before we were shown our table at first floor.

Staffs were courteous, calmly described what we wanted to know.

Coming to the food, we ordered Reshmi Kabab for starters. It was good, tender pieces of chicken, cooked properly. Chutney was sweeter to taste which I skipped.

Main items were of course Chinese. We had Chicken Mushroom onion fried rice and Supreme Chicken. Both tasted great. Quantity was good for two of us.

Special mention for Supreme Chicken is a must. Large chicken pieces crispy crunchy fried in black sauce. Awesome. Will definitely try again.

Overall, good experience. Pocket pinch was normal and well within budget.

Definitely recommended.

Among the order there was slat and pepper fish. What they sent is a dried Chilli fish. Order date:5.2.16 time around 8.. And in the name of S Das.  I ordered the same s/p fish many times before..

Impressive interior with accommodation for 2, 4 or even bigger groups. Music being played was a bit loud. I ordered Kashmiri pulao and Murg butter masala. Two items billed together 395 INR including vat and service tax. Pulao tasted good, though I would say the rice should have been finer. Chicken was a little bit spicy. It was not boneless dish, but looks like they picked chicken pieces with big bones in them. Quantity wise, no complaint. Unless u r a foodie and can really eat full stomach, u may struggle to finish one plate of pulao on ur own, which I did by the way..

I will keep this review very short as there is nothing much to write. Food quality is very average. We ordered crispy chicken, salt and pepper chicken,szechwan chicken,chicken with tomato and capsicum, along with chicken hakka noodles and coriander fried rice. Except for salt and pepper chicken everything had similar flavour. Szechwan chicken was anything but szechwan. Even the service was poor. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Been here couple of times, once for Chinese and once for Indian. Personally I think their Indian is better then their Chinese. We ordered three different types of flat breads when we visited the place for Indian - Garlic Naan, Tandoori Roti and Paneer Kulcha. Among the three the Garlic Naan the best and it tasted great with the Chicken Bharta. We also ordered Chicken Butter Masala which was also good but the Garlic Naan with Chicken Bharta combo was the best. The interior is nice and cozy, each table has a lucky bamboo plant on it. Food is also not expensive and the quantity is also good.

It is one if the most dependable restaurant in the neighborhood. You can trust on them when there are guests coming as well as when you are planning for a quick and affordable dinner. I order at least once every month and the taste,  quality and quantity is very consistent. The place is very conveniently located and has some very well behaved staffs. I love their chicken in oyster sauce as it has the right blend of sauce. The fried rice or noodles are always loaded with loads of chicken,  egg etc. It's a very good option for people in and around jadavpur.

This restaurant is situated at a distance less than 2 km from my house. I've been here for the first time in 2009 and since then, have been drawn to its scrumptious food for n number of times! Pocket friendly with a family ambience, the hot picks of this restaurant, according to me are Chinese dishes like Gravy Chowmein, American Chopsuey, Schezwan Chicken. If you try the gravy chowmein, you won't go anywhere. In Indian Cuisine, try all the Kadai dishes, Kadhai Chicken, Kadhai Paneer, Kadhai Prawn, Dal Fry, Naan. The taste of these lip smacking dishes will stay on your taste buds for sure. :)

The main attraction of a restaurant will always be food quality as well as quantity.
Golden Gate satisfies both.
The menu have changed now. But still...
When I first visited this place my first reaction was "nice and comfy". 
Lovely red and yellow and wood combo.
Coming to food, I had mixed F. Rice, Schezwan Chicken, Cantonese Chicken (as far as I remember), some fish item (forgot the name), drumsticks and soup as starters, and blue lagoon.
I was surprised at the quantity they provide. After Hatari, this place tops the list.
Moderate service.
Will visit soon.

Been here many times.. The restuarant is quite average.. the prices have increased and the quality has smwhat faded away. Located 5 mins away frm KPC medical cllge at 8b towards shulekha.
Ambience- there are two floors..dimly lit ambience.nice decor..the ground floor is big nd is well mantained...the 1st floor is small and preety conjested. Overall a nice warm feeling on entering. Good ambience.
Food-ordered for dal makhani, paneer makhani,navaratna veg pulao,tandoori roti,mixed fried rice and jaipuri murg.
Mixed fried rice was average..it tasted a bit bland..had decent amount of chicken egg and prawn..
Veg pulao was also just average...with few scattered cottage cheese(paneer), nd veggies..it tasted bland too..
Paneer makhani or paneer butter masala was good..the gravy was spicy and tasty and the quality of paneer ws decent..not rubbery or chewy..rather it ws soft nd tasted fresh.
Dal makhani was good..made with black daal..it had good amount of ghee nd cream or malai..it complemented the tandoori roti very well..
Jaipuri chicken was another averagely good dish..it was normal spicy chicken gravy with chunks of tomatoes and capsicum..8 pieces of chicken with thick spicy red gravy. Pieces of chicken cud have been a bit moist or atleast smoked a bit..it was rather plain and dry..
Quantity wise it was decent..quality wise average or above average by a small margin..
Prices are reasonable..
Do give it a try.. i wud hv rated it 3.5 or evn 4 (2 yrs back) but the fading quality nd taste deserves the deduction of 0.5..

Been here many times and it is one of my most favourite food stations in kolkata. The ambience and the staffs make it a homely place for me. North indian or chinese items are really good and so are the bengali dishes. Specially chicken tandoori, kebabs and gravy noodles. They are famous for the home delivery as well. Love this plabe.

Trying out new place every weekend seems to be my new addiction. This Sunday was this places' turn. Have heard many good reviews from my friends, and decided to get in.
The ambiance was an average one, with not so good interior. Yet the dim light and soothing music and such spacious area seemed quite comfortable. The staff was good, and the orders were served quickly in spite of the heavy rush on Sunday evening.
Now coming to the food quality, its simply awesome. I have never tasted such mouth-watering Thai Soup. The light aroma of the lemon added great taste and made it unique one. Ordered Schezuan noodle and Hong Kong chicken. All were too good. Had such great quality food after a long time in an unknown place. Successful experiment! Though got hints from friends, yet was worth visiting it.
Next time will taste fish items, which have great fame within my foodie group.

Visited This Restaurant with my sweetheart...I can say that it was simply superb!!!
Great Ambiance, Food Quality & Quantity superb (jio Kaka!!!) Pricing V. V transparent..Menu is updated and latest in Zomato Site. 
The waiters were patient, listened to your needs and also suggested dishes within your budget (if you choose to mention that)...this was a pleasant surprise.
As usual, earnest request to the management, if Possible please print the menu with all inclusive prices, however as of now for price sensitive customers (like me)
Please add 20% i.e (5.6 % S.Tax+14.5% V.A.T) to the displayed bill so that you can get the amount in actual that you shall be paying to them. 
If you choose to pack your food then be ready to shell out another 6% packing  charge on the bill. Overall " Khub Bhalo"  (V. Good)

One of the better restaurants at Jadavpur. Its very close to Jadavpur University and was a frequent visitor here during my JU days. Food is decent enough and price is also reasonable. Most of the time the place is filled with people and has a nice energetic and lively feel to it. The only problem is that it doesnt have any car parking place and since it is located right by the very busy road at Jadavpur it is very difficult to find a place to park your car safely. Overall, a decent place to drop in if you happen to be near Jadavpur.

Well i have been visiting this place for the last 7 years or so.. So one can understand this particular place has made me visit them again and again for various reasons.
Ambience is nice.. Simple not flashy at all so one can have a quite lunch or dinner .

Food Quality and variety is really nice. They have lots on the offering..they do serve Indian, Chinese and Bengali..so a lot of options.
Crispy crunchy crab and Stirfried crab in Hosin Sauce are really good.
Bengali dishes are also very well made..

There is a Take Away LUNCH BOX facility..both veg n nonveg which are quite well made and its just ₹75-80 for a nonveg lunch box.. Containing pulao ,chicken masala 2pcs, dal...

So its worth a try.

Visited the place with two of my friends for lunch on a weekday. It's located near the sulekha crossing opposite the petrol pump. The ambiance can be a little dark with a reddish tinge because of the choice of lighting. Low reddish light with a soft and sober music. The waiters are also quite cordial, and know well about the dishes in case you ask them to suggest.I ordered Mutton Biriyani and chicken dishes. The Biriyani which they serve were not so hot. The chicken items were good. The place is known more for its Chinese. The place is ok enough the food is also ok, nothing that good that makes me feel to visit again. The place is overpriced. You can give just average marks. Its taste are not up to its prices...

crispy chicken,dry chilli chicken,hot garlic chicken,schezuan chicken.
Oh god..such a long list..but these r really yummy.

Among north indian dishes they serve good biriyani,butter naan,masala kulcha,murgh tikka butter masala,nurani murgh..these r pretty good too.

But I prefer having Chinese dishes here more..

We had already planned from before that we were going to have crabs! Without wasting any time in seeing the menu, we just ordered crispy crunchy crab. I won't say that it was heavenly! In simple words, it was just OK. Lat ma kai was the second thing  we ordered, which tasted like any other chilli chicken! The visit was not that satisfactory at all!

The Mushroom soup is nice, pan fried momo is a delight (love it) and the lamb chops dipped in Thai sauce is just mouth watering and clearly crispy. Well I must admit their service is really top of the class. And the food is served in such perfect fashion you will be willful to pay for it. A blind date - check in here without a doubt! :)

A very nice family restaurant with a very resonable menu if you're not looking for some very renowned restaurant in some posh locality... the food is very delicious and  to be put it perfectly offers a very high value for money.. i mean yes you'd get better in more expensive restaurants but that'd cost you more.. so value for money wise its very good.. a very retro interior with dim lighting which makes the ambiance very delightful.. well it doesn't specialises in any cuisine as such but try the chineese and north indian here its good.. the staff is very very cordial,, and food is delivered on time.. so if you're looking for a fullcourse meal within say 800 bucks for two.. try this out.. the best in that area.

Visited the place with two of my friends for lunch. Its located near the sulekha crossing opposite the petrol pump.
Ambience: Nice and cozy with good decor and polite staffs. Nothing special to mention.
Food: We had ordered 2 chkn rice, 1 chkn noodles, 1 garlic chkn and a lemon honey chkn. The food was of ok quantity as we had to order the 2nd rice plate. Quality is ok. Didn't like their Honey and lemon chkn. The honey flavor aas missing and lemon flavour was overpowering. Dinally we ordered the soda sikanji, which was not good atall.
Nothing great about this place. I would rather go to calcutta bistro located on the other side of the road. I may not visit the place again keeping the steep competition in the area in mind.

This is my first review for Zomato and what better restaurant to start with than "Golden Gate". 
This restaurant is situated just beside KPC Medical College and Hospital, in Jadavpur area. On the main road so absolutely no difficulty locating.
The restaurant is has two floors. The first floor is quite spacious and can accommodate a lot of people. The second floor is a mere extension of the first so it is quite small. 

Now the food. I have tried both Indian and Chinese dishes but, Chinese stands out for me. 
The chicken egg fried rice is so flavourful that it can be a meal in itself. 
The pan fried soya noodles are the BEST ! Broccoli, mushrooms, zucchini, chicken and the gravy is adequate. 
Dry Chilli Chicken, Pan Fried Fish and Garlic Chicken are slightly similar tasting but their proportions are adequate and not conflour coated. 
The tutti fruity is a delight ! 
When the bill comes, make sure to mention you are student of KPC Medical College and Hospital or Jadavpur University then the vat is off ! 
The servers are helpful and tend to you well.. 
Not recommended for fine dining but a meal with friends or family, definitely !

Tried the place after 2 years. Still nice and maintaining the standard. Had masala kulcha, chicken drumsticks, mutton kadai, chicken bharta, salt and pepper fish. 

Very close to the 8B Bus stop in Jadabpur, Golden Gate is a very popular Chinese and North Indian restaurant. It is pocket friendly and does a very decent job in dishing out sumptuous meals. The ambience is decent and staff is courteous . I always prefer their Chinese to North Indian delicacies, with the exception of the Chicken drumsticks , drums of heaven and the reshmi kebabs . I also like their selection of soups... You wont go wrong with their gravy and hakka chowmein and the chinese non veg dishes. I would surely recommend it for a quick family lunch or dinner.

A place very near to the university and happens to be one of the popular places among students. Though the service is very slow , they serve good food. Personal favourite: crispy conzy lamb

For starters we ordered chicken sweet corn soup which was good, Lat ma kai (a chicken starter) which was very delicious , chicken lollypop which was average and so was the pan fried chili fish. Coming to the main course we went for mixed fried rice and Cantonese noodles. The rice was better. As a side dish we made the mistake of ordering honey lemon chicken and it was just very bad. i would advice not to order it at all. Coming to the ambiance and service it was fairly average. To sum it up, a reasonable restaurant with above average food.

I have no count of how many times i have been to this restaurant and got their food home delivered at my place..
The food is sumptuous, whether from chinese cuisine or indian, served in generous quantities and on time..
The waiters are also quite cordial, and know well about the dishes incase you ask them to suggest.. The rates are reasonable as compared to the food served by them..
Also, orders for home deliveries are taken till quite late, which is an added perk..
Nice place to be with friends and family..

Frequented this restaurant a couple of years back, I can vouch for the fact that it has successfully lived up to the "multi cuisine" tag! From the kebabs (the tandoori chicken is delicious!) to the chinese fares, everything scores high on taste! Reasonably priced, Golden Gate is perfect for a budget family dinner!

The restaurant is just opposite sulekha,  jadavpur.  The ambience is good and i just love the Chinese they serve.  The hakka noodles of any variety is just great.  I treated my friends here on my birthday and they too loved the Chinese they served.  The staff is helpful and the happy birthday song at the background while cutting the cake made my day. The tuti futi in their menu is a must have.  Its totally yummm....

Also if u go anytime after 3, theres a chance u ll get reheated food. Still chicken in coriander sauce s a must try as well as their malai kebab. Best thing s u get both Chinese n indian under same roof

The place has been a hit since it has been revamped. I love the place so much that i even threw a birthday treat here last year. They are always warm in receiving us and the food is of a good quantity and tastes great. No complaints that i can think of. Keep it up guys!

This used to be a popular hangout amongst my friends when we were in college. Even now when we have a get together, this is one of the most common choices for venue. The last time we went there we were a group of 4.

The ambiance in the evenings can be a little dark with a reddish tinge because of the choice of lighting. So dont think of taking small children, as they may find this place to be a little intimidating.

We ordered Manchow soup and a Chicken Clear soup. The Manchow was decent enough, but the Chicken clear soup could have a couple of shreds of chicken in it. For starters, we had Pan Fried Chilli Fish and Salt and Pepper Chicken. The portions were good enough but the pace of service could have been a little faster. We would finish one starter and then wait for 5-10 minutes before the next one came. Both the fish and chicken were nice with the right mix of spices and seasoning. For main course, we took Hongkong Chicken and Shanghai Chicken with Veg Gravy noodles. And of course there was so sweet lime soda. I personally ordered a Salt lime soda but was given a Sweet and Salt lime soda.
Overall the food was 4 out of 5. The reason I chose to give a 3.5 is because of the ambiance and the speed of service.

Actually, I wanted to rate this restaurant a 3.8. But there is no such provision here, so I stuck to 3.5.
I visited this place first time as far as I remember, long back around 2007. And I do not remember anything of that visit that can influence this review. After 8 years, when I visited today, it was a fresh page to me.
It was a lazy afternoon when I entered slightly hungry. The ambiance gave me an immediate soothing feeling that I liked. Low reddish light with a soft and sober music. Odd time it was, so except few tables all were vacant. I took a small table, well decorated with mats, spoon, fork, glass etc. The menu card contains many items that come under the Chinese and Indian cuisine. I ordered only one portion of Shredded chicken in coriander sauce. Service was on expected time. I liked the dish. Aroma of coriander dominated the flavour. Chicken pieces were well cut, well cooked and tender. Combination of bell peppers, black peppers, onions and scallions went well with the treatment. Typical Indianised Chinese but the taste was nice. Quality was good. Price is slightly on higher side with respect to the quantity.
After finishing my meal, I talked to one of the staffs. Came to know they deliver at home only within 3 kms. When asked a bit detailing of the recipe I just ate, the staff answered quite confidently - seems they are very well aware of those details! Appreciable. In the same conversation I came to know - they use MSG by default and they don't only if one requests specifically. Would like to bring this into the attention of the management - MSG has nothing good to do with fine food and cooking. It is as bad as an extremely tasty poison. Please stop using it. It is a very important awareness that needs to be brought in to Indian Chinese cooking practice.
As a whole, nice experience. Would look forward to order a five course dinner for taking delivery to home or to dine in depending on mood as it is quite near to my home.

I went to meet a friend of mine who resides at Jadavpur and we decided to go to Golden Gate for Dinner being the nearest one around. The place is nice with comfortable seating. There was a pleasant red light in the restaurant giving it a different look. The place is known for its Chinese offerings but I wanted to have a simple vegetarian food. So I ordered for Crispy Baby corn as starters and Coconut Chana Dal, Sukta and Steamed Rice for myself in the main course. 

The baby corn was really very crisp and delicious. Sukta, which is a famous bengali delicacy made of all the vegetables in a coconut milk tasted genuine and was not bitter at all. The Chana dal was very tasty. I liked the food. 

I thought it was a bit pricey for the food it offered. The staff was couteous and happily suggesting the menu. All in all a descent place for dinner.

Visited this place a couple of times. The first visit was quite a good experience. The soups were great... And the schezwan pomfret was quite good. However the second visit was a dampener. The starters.. Especially the crispyconzy babycorn could break a few teeth without any effort whatsoever. 
On the plus side... The ambience is amazing. The food is generous in quantity and the staff are well mannered.

Golden Gate is one of the better restaurants in the Jadavpur area.Once you go inside you will find that the restaurant is big enough and has a nice ambiance.Ordered a variety of food items.The best was Chicken Kalmi Kabab (Big chicken pieces with keema stuffed in it,delicious stuff),the Shanghai Chicken and the Lemon Honey Chicken.However felt that the Chinese was better than the Indian items although the Biriyani is good enough!The food was very tasty,and the quantity was satisfactory.The only downside is maybe the lack of parking space.But go give it a try!

Had been to this  place a few times in the past and had their food home delivered too on a few occasions, but today's dinner here compels me to post this very positive review about Golden Gate, the cozy 'n' neat restaurant in-between jadavpur and sukanta setu that has become quite popular with both the locals and the people from the neighbouring areas with a considerably wide radius. Eight of us shared between us quite a variety of items from the chinese and indian sections, but the ones that need special mention and are the reason why I am so elated are chicken kalmi kebab (chicken keema stuffed inside chicken leg pieces, a plate of which has four pieces, one being large enough for one person), shanghai chicken (delectable!) and lemon honey chicken (the variety of lemon used was gandharaj, accounting for the lovely aroma and fine balance of sweetness and sourness). My companions reported that the special mutton biriyani was quite good too. Overall a satisfying dinner experience.

Food: I tried the Chinese section. Quantity is sufficient and quality is good but not extra-ordinary. That's what makes it unworthy of the considerably high rates. However, must try out the fish dishes and the mushroom Manchurian. I rate it 3.5/5.

Ambience: I liked the lighting and the decor. Music is so-so. Seating is good... Pretty spacious it is. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: Waiters look a bit confused in rush hours. Speed is medium. Overall well behaved staff. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Higher than standard rates and not totally worth it.

Well tries out parcel from here, food we had were as follows :1. Fish Punjabee--the best of all the items ordered, pieces were so succulent and almost melted in the mouth.2. Chilly prawn-- taste was ok--nothing to complain about it.3. Mixed fried rice-this was also satisfactory, the rice quality could have been a bit better.4. Hakka noodles--this was below average--the noodles were not properly cooked--appeared to be boiling chowmein without much cooked, though the materials inside were adequate.5. Garlic chicken--the taste of garlic was less and much on the sweeter side--may be we can call it sweet and sour chicken rather than garlic chicken.So mixed feeling about this place and hence 3.5

Golden Gate is probably the best restaurant choice if you are near the Jadavpur 8B area. A multicuisine option that not only serves Chinese and Continental, but also decent Bengali fare. This presents as quite a novelty in terms of the "multicuisine" concept n my book. My workplace is in Jadavpur 8B, so I have lost count of how many times we have eaten here or have ad food delivered. Delivery is quite prompt and packaging is decent. The ambiance inside the restaurant is serene, done in red accents with soft instrumental music playing. There is ample seating and the tables are well spaced. Seating is comfortable. over time, they have extended the seating area upstairs, which is very well suited for private parties also. 
Coming to the food, its average. Nothing tastes outstanding and at the same time nothing tastes below par. Kebabs are good. So is the Murgh Tawa masala in the indian fare. In the Bengali section, Sarshe Ilish, Bhapa betki and Amtele Pabda tastes good. They used to serve a Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup whis was really good but isn't there on the menu anymore. The burnt garlic soup is also good. Pan fried Chili fish is a good chinese starter option. So is the Prawn Pakora. Golden Gate Special chicken is another option to try. Chinese main course are decent and there is no risk factors involved. I liked the Stir fired chicken and Boccoli in Oyester Sacuce because it's light and somewhat different. You can also try the Chili Garlic Pepper Noddle if you want to experience the spicy. 
Like other joints around Jadavpur 8B, prices are very reasonable. It seems to be economical since quantity is pretty good. 
Golden Gate remains my top choice if we want to dine out in the area owing to its variety of cuisines and affordability mixed with slight upscale vibe.

Being one of the popular restaurants in the 8B-Jadavpur area, Golden Gate had been in  my wishlist for quite some time. A lunch with AB was due and being short of cash, we promptly went in as per Zomato's reviews. 
We ordered simple Chinese fare - Fried rice and Hongkong Chicken. Both of them were average (slightly disappointing for me actually). Quantity in one plate of both, was enough for the two of us. The ambiance was soothing and service was quick.
Lets hope that the North Indian cuisine is better. :)

A beautiful place near jadavpur 8b bus stand. I went there on a Sunday afternoon and luckily got place without waiting. The ambiance is calm and soothing and it is suitable for a family get together and for a couple hang out as well. It was my first visit to this place and I liked it. There was a descent music being played in the background which increased the classiness of the rest to. The decor was good enough. We ordered mixed fried rice, schezuan chicken and then a masala cold drink. The quantity was sufficient for a couple if they order one plate of each. The chicken was really good. I will visit this place again to taste their fish items as I heard those are good. 
Pocket pinch: 600-700 for a couple

Went to this place with a few friends hoping for a delicious meal but was left disappointed. The starters(salt and pepper chicken,crispy chilli mushroom and babycorn) were nice. The main courses were bland and underwhelming. The schezwan fried rice was chewy and the hong kong chicken wasn't spicy enough. The schezwan fish was smelly and the taste was abysmal.
Staff and service were great though so its not all bad I guess. Decent ambiance as well.Disappointed with the food.

The main courses were bland and underwhelming. The schezwan fried rice was chewy and the hong kong chicken wasn't spicy enough. The schezwan fish was smelly and the taste was abysmal.
Staff and service were great though so its not all bad I guess. Decent ambiance as well.Disappointed with the food.

I haven't tasted the chinese but tasted the indian food thrice! It's too good. Just finger licking! Ambience is also good. The chicken reshmi masala is one the best dishes they made!

Tried 3 things precisely. Crispy Chicken as starter, Veg fried rice and Hongkong Chicken as main course. Tried to keep it simple. Loved crispy chicken, literally loved it. but, afterwards, the veg rice was not at all up to the mark. So that was the disgusting part of it. Still, the hongkong chicken was the savior. The ambiance was quite nice. The service was good but could be better.

went for dinner.there r 2 restaurants next to next .thought of trying this one..the ambience z really good.The Ac was not on.I was feelling hot so had  to ask them to switch on theac. They switch on. For soup we tried the chicken sweet corn soup..It was not so good as i expected.Felt it had more arrowroot!!!...dont know...wronte based on my feeling. NExt the starters we thought of trying some other dish other than chilli chkn dry and red pepper chkn..we asked the waiter..each item we asked him he told was ok.On asking his opinion he suggested "LAT MA KAI"...which was not good at all. I really idnt like that. Wht i meant is that it was not tasting chinese. The smell of fried  fennel seeds was all that  i was getting. never try this dish!!...dont know if this dish is prepared this way...have to taste  froma a diff restaurant.. and also had chilli garlic pepper noodles which was also average...nothigh special...the onli good thing u would notice about this place is that it has good ambience...try somthing other than this if you visit...It might turn out to be good.. cost me Rs. 550/-...not worth it for me!

This place was a great find for me this Durga Puja when we were starving and just wanted a place with no queues ! What I liked a lot about this place was that we never felt hurried even though we spent hours here just gossiping away....yes, meeting up with school friends after a long time does that to you ! :)

Coming to the food, for starers we ordered the Drums Of Heaven and the Crispy Chilli Babycorn along with glasses of coke. The food arrived quite fast and was simply wonderful. The drums of Heaven were good quantity wise and perfectly spicy....you know, the kind when you cant wait to take the next bite ! Amazing.....

For main course we went for the Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Hakka Noodles along with Chicken Manchurian. Everything tasted good.....and I liked the subtle taste of the rice and noodles after the spicy starters. Quantity was again pretty commendable. Overall, a great value for money place with good Chinese food ! Had a lovely time....recommended ! :)

This puja went there with my friends.  We were five people.  The ambiance was good.  We went there on Sosti for lunch. Regular days menu were missing.  They gave us the menu of puja special where most of the dishes were missing.  Like there was no soup in the menu.  N every item just have only 2/3 choices given.  Prices were much higher than quantity n quality.  When we asked for the regular menu they said they can't take d orders from regular menu on puja. We ordered pan fried chicken in starter which was tasteless n d chicken was so hard. ... very disappointing. ...

been visiting this place from its very early days...it has gone down a bit in quality recently but still offers some very authentic food mostly Indian dishes...had almost everything apart from the Bengali spread my personal pick wud b their kebabs...the hariali n reshmi being favourites, murg rimjhim and kashmiri pulao...I must tell they make one of the best kashmiri pulaos in town...Chinese items are decent...the staff are courteous, the service is mostly prompt, and its very much pocket friendly being situated in a healthy location like jadavpur...overall a big thumbs up...

I had been here too many times with friends and family. It's easily accessible and affordable. Last Saturday I visited the place for a family dinner. The kashmiri pulao here is quite delicious and the Indian chicken preparations are more or less better than their Chinese ones. Recently tried their hot garlic prawn and it was a nice discovery. Loved the sweet and tangy combination of the flavors. Will keep on visiting as always.

Really great place and everything in budget. I have Been there more than 10 times . The atmosphere is great with soft light . I have been going there since 2009 and still the quality of food haven't wavered a bit . great for family and friend gatherings .

Most importantly price is quite moderate compared to other restores also food quantity always fulfill your demand .

If you want to enjoy your meal this is the place your looking for , just simply awesome.
they have exultant Sizzler, superb cheese kebab, stuffed tengri .
I had a lot of Sundays in this place and the quality never dwindled . The quantity and food quality are most favorable.

Today we visited the place for lunch. The ambience was good. We ordered two Biryani, two chicken chap and dessert. The Biryani was fine but the chap was horrible. It had a strong pungent smell of Coconut oil. The taste was yakk... In spite of being hungry, we were not able to bring it to our mouth. The restaurant staff denied to accept the reality. It is my humble request to all of you, please don't ever ask for chap........it will be worst than a slap.

Damn!! This is one of my favourite places in Calcutta. Never tried Indian or Bengali but the Chinese is good.

If you are an avid eater you will love this place except for that music that can put anyone to sleep!!

My girl also loves this place. Been there multiple times on date. Try the Singapore chicken, chicken sizzler and their very own Golden Gate Special Chicken; just one word awesome!! However, for a joint that serves Chinese they don't serve beef and pork and that is the only one reason I did not rate them 5.

The staffs are good and ambience awesome. The quantity served is hige so do ask for the excess food to be packed to take back home

Few years back the ambience used to be very classy and the staffs too were pretty awesome, right now the service has become below average due to the change in staffs and even the food is pretty average these days. Hope when i go next time out there, i cherish my moments because i celebrated my 20th birthday here and many more occasions when we used to stay at garia.

They are incredibly poor when it comes to puja times in Bengal...I heard from trustworthy sources which belongs to their cooking officials that they prepare the gravies for all the chilli/schezwan/Manchurian/Garlic Chicken as a common and below average manner...it is not at all recommended, ordered thrice masala kulcha, butter nun, lachhadar paratha, chilli chicken and cucumber salad from them during puja and normal times around the year, they just tend to be classy by even ignoring the clients who are ordering more than a grand or so...lol...we have got better alternatives than them around jadavpur, moreover I personally have heard they mix beef with mutton and lamb...so I apologize in advance and recommend that please make a good inspection before you intake the food as it may not be worthwhile enough. P.S. They are pretty good during non occasional seasons except the mere receptionists just don't know how to give a bluff to a Government recognized food inspector like my elder sister, as they only seem to judge people by their verses and nothing else. ;)

i have developed a keen taste for mughlai & north indian dishes. this restaurant could satisfy my taste with their biriyani (which was a blend & explosion of flavors with right use of tamarind, though it didnot feel well when a tamarind seed directly hits your bud, because it's biriyani & not a chatpata churmur) the biriyani was usual & fairly delicious the other times also. but some of their north indian dishes were a misery to me. the cuisines seemed way too raw & the taste not okay at all - particularly murg butter masala & murg mirch ki salan. the kebabs were overcooked & salty. may be i was unfortunate. another time i tried mutton bhuna gosht - it was tasty but with a raw smell. hereafter i have not tried much of their other dishes (despite being it a 'para' restaurant to my jadavpur residence - & have no idea about their chinese section. later i went for home delivery for biriyani and golden mutton. don't know if they got a better cook but frankly those cuisines made me repel since then.

GOLDEN GATE..!!!

Location:

It is located in close proximity to the KPC Medical College & Hospital in Jadavpur, much towards the Sulekha side (and almost bang opposite the Jadavpur-Purbachal Mini Bus Stand). The moderately large red-colored gate opens to a relatively spacious restaurant.

Decor:

This food joint is neatly decorated and centrally air-conditioned. The restaurant is embellished with factitious plants bordering the walls; the wall-glasses have floral designs on them. Therefore, sitting on one of the tables close to the walls will allow a lovely view of the both. Furthermore, the interior of the restaurant is kept scented by fragrance of incensed sticks. The white plates on the tables are neatly arranged with red pieces of cloth (to be used as napkins) adding the necessary sophisticated touch.

Dishes Ordered:

(1) Singapore Rice

(2) Chicken Fried Rice

(3) Crispy Crunchy Crab

(4) Lemon Honey Chicken

The sizes of the bowls in which the dishes came speak a lot about the quantity. The Chicken Fried Rice was average. Singapore Rice came with a film of fried egg spread over it. It contained cashews nuts, slices of pineapple, capsicum & tomato (and, obviously, chicken and egg) blended with the right proportion of spices. The Crab dish was crunchy enough to satiate one's gustatory senses. The Lemon Honey Chicken, besides bearing an uniquely pungent flavour, melted in the tongue when savoured hot. However, the pieces of the chicken started getting a tad tougher to gnash later on as the dish began to cool down.

Summary: 

Decor: 4/5 (Floral Patterns & Incensed Sticks)

Hospitality: 4/5 (Pretty Urbane Staffs)

Food Quantity: 4/5

Food Quality: 3/5

Taste: 3/5

Value for Money: 3/5

Conclusion:

The prices are not that heavy on the wallet. The dining experience will be satisfying for all the three types of foodies: gourmets, gourmands and gluttons.

Although situated at an odd location, it has the ability to attract customers because of its food quality. I have been there quite a few times and have had both Chinese and Indian dishes. They make both the cuisines equally good at a very reasonable price. So if anyone wants to have a tasty meal in Jadavpur area, they should definitely try this place.

Just came back. Am absolutely mad at them. I had pre-ordered and was there to take away the parcel. After a few minutes I saw a staff walk up which seemed to be my parcel, curious I asked him what it was. To which he replied FOOD.

Damn! People from the service industry talking this way to a customer, he had the attitude as if he was the owner of the place.

I'm going in tomorrow to officially complain against such behaviour to the Manager - Anand Mukherjee.

Anyone going to this place should not have high hopes with the customer service. Food is rated 10 but Customer service is a big 0.

I have been to this area a number of times but everytime i entered into another restuarant (named 'Red Chopstix') just adjacent to this one ...:) and thought next time would pay a visit to Golden Gate for sure ...but that 'next time' never came until a few days back when finally i decided 'ok today i have to pay a visit to The Golden Gate' .... :)
Being a first time visitor, i asked the waiter for its special starter dish if any .... and immediately we were referred to The Caribbean Drumstick ..... it tasted quite good and different ...i liked it .... Then we ordered mixed fried rice and some side dishes .... taste is quite good i should say ..... infact its good value for money as prices are quite cheap specially considering its location ..... 
Ambience is good inside ...... if u r unlucky and its crowded,u might have a problem outside with car parking as the space is limited ....
Overall i would recommend this place to anyone if u r looking for some decent dining experience but not expecting anything out of the ordinary .....  coz there are no special mouth watering dishes (like Konjee Crispy Lamb or Lat Me Kai in Tandoor Park, or mutton hanglabari in Hanglatherium, or even drumstick in Red Chopstix) which will drive me all the way from Baguiati to this far .... :)

Comforting, elegant surroundings, moderately priced food (considering the decor). Waiters were polite. But i ordered Chicken Mushroom Soup and it turned turned out to be Cream of Mushroom soup! Now I am lactose intolerant, and had to forgo this item because this was inadequately tagged.  My friend enjoyed it though, so I guess it was nice enough. Salt and Pepper Fish was delicious. Oyster Chicken turned out to be more like Manchurian Chicken! Tasted fine as Manchurian chicken :-D 
All in all a nice restro, a bit disappointed though. I would call it a family restaurant, good for 'adda' and nice food.

I went there for dinner with one of my acquaintances. She had visited the restaurant once before and had had Biriyani, Chicken reshmi kabab and Chicken kadhai masala. Since she was fairly satisfied with the food, I decided to check it out with her. This time too we had ordered Indian i.e. Mutton Keema pulao, Hyderabadi kabab & Lahori chicken. The last two items were tasty, but the pulao was not up to our expectation. The keema was undercooked, and the rice did not have any distinct taste or aroma. However, the portions were generous and could easily be shared by 2-3 persons. The ambience was nice, the service of the waiters courteous, and the waiting period just 10-15 mins. I had also ordered Mixed Hakka noodles for takeaway because I wanted to see how they fared in terms of Chinese cuisine…it was light and quite good.

We walked in here today afternoon. The restaurant was empty with just 2 tables occupied at 2 pm in the afternoon on a Sunday. 
My friend, brother and I settled. 
The place was dimly lit with music in the background- extremely cozy. I didn't quite like the sofa seats as they were too soft and I felt really sucked by it, hence I changed my seat to the opposite chair and it was firm and comfortable enough. 

We ordered for crispy chilli babycorn (courtesy my brother's and friend's babycorn madness), veg fried rice, noodles and customized the exotic veg in mustard sauce to hot garlic sauce. 

The food arrived in 10 minutes and we started hogging immediately. 
The babycorn was crispy and it tasted good.. Nothing special. Same with the noodles, even though I had a little problem with it since it was smelling of eggs. 
The rice and the exotic veg, on the other hand, were nothing short of amazing. 
I literally licked clean my plate as well as the leftovers from my friend's plate. That's how amazing it was. Infact, my rating is solely based on those both dishes. 
We were stuffed by the end and hence we gave desserts a miss. 

A funny thing happened with the service though. While the waiter was serving the noodles, I asked him to give me half of what he was serving, to which he replied, "
Kha lijiyega na".
It was rather funny. 

The bill for it came for ₹621. 
Reasonable enough. Certainly coming back :D

Really good.Dimly lit that give u d feel of a romantic ambience with soothing instrumental played in d background...staffs are always very courteous.Food is served within 20 minutes of placing order. 
Food:-
I have tried their mughlai and Chinese cuisine, n really fond of that. 
Mutton biryani and chicken biryani, both I love, pieces were succulent and rice were perfectly balanced with spices and ghee. 
Chicken chap, mutton roganjosh, murg rimjhim,spicy mutton curry snd kashmiri pulao is my fav.
In Chinese genre, chilly chicken, mixed fried rice,mixed hakka noodles, manchurian chicken are my staple one and they won't disappoint you too.
Quantity n quality is decent.overall rating is 3.5/5.

It was my uncle and aunt's anniversary celebration and for that occasion I have been Golden Gate, it a two floored restaurant we were 8 people altogether as it was a family occasion we were sent to the 1st floor which was way too small just 3 to 4 tables just a small space :-( We initially ordered Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Green Pepper Soup as starters the soup was good and the baby corn was usual. Next as the main meal we ordered dal makhani and some veg stuff where on the other hand we ordered Chicken Friedrice and Chicken Tomato Capsium (something like that dish not mentioned in zomato) but believe me guys never ever order for this chicken dish it's simply horrible we were 4 but still could finish it, it was absolutely a night-mare. WIth the absolute shock from the main meal we didn't had the courage to go for the deserts. That was the night out we had and returned home and my aunt made some dishes at home. I gave 2 for the soup and the corn as the appetizer and the stuff's behaviour was good but the food quality was poor certainly will not be looking forward to head here.

I have been to his restaurant a couple of times, not because there is something extraordinary about this place, but because it is near my house and one would always find empty seats no matter whatever time of the noon, evening or night it is (before midnight of course). You will even get to find seats during the Durga Pujo while other restaurants would have lines. I don't know if that is good or bad thing, I quite liked the fact. 

Coming to the food served, it is pretty much average. There is hardly any difference between their green salad and cucumber salad. But I must mention that they provide quite a large amount for one plate of Biriyani. Taste wise, average again. I have never tried their Bengali cuisines but the availability of desserts is a luck game. I have been disappointed twice. 

They make good chili chicken, a little high on the spicy side, which I liked. The momos served are made nicely and light. The veg pakoras does not taste any better than the ones they serve on roadside stalls. The restaurant needs to work a little on that. The tandoor items are good and the rotis are just the way they are at every restaurant.

The servers are polite and will make sure you are absolutely comfortable. It takes a little more time for the orders and food to come up, if you are planning to sit on the first floor by choice. Overall, you can try this restaurant if you are near Jadavpu- Sulekha- KPC area and are hungry.

I find the place strictly average. Once again it's proximity to my house that has brought me here quite a few times. 
The service takes time, and the food for its quality seems slightly overpriced. 
It's just a middling place where, when you are alone in the house and feel like eating something from the outside at night, you come here. Maybe order a couple of naans and chicken butter masala (which I find pretty good here) and bring it to your house and eat.

Visited this place on a sunday early afternoon. Space is moderate, ambiance decent, staffs young yet helpful.
Was in a mood for some light snacks, so ordered kebabs and some main course in Chinese. 
Food was served after 15-20 minutes, and it was good enough.
Price will not burn your pocket, so overall satisfied with the experience.

The restaurant deserves a 4.0 for its Chinese Cuisine for both Veg & Non veg dishes & variety. However, the Indian cuisine is just average. Prices match the other restaurants of the area. Ambiance can be rated as an average but they have a decent space to accommodate @least 50 + guests at a time.  Nothing special about the service or the servers though they were polite & trained. Its close proximity to Jadhavpur-8B is an advantage.

One of the few restaurants in Jadavpur where you will be really experience the feel good factor and relish your food to the very core. Welcome to "Golden Gate" restaurant a stone throw away from KPC hospital main gate at Sulekha. As the name suggests, its more of a Chinese restaurant which serves Bengali and north Indian cuisine for the yound and old residing in the close proximity of Jadavpur. The decor and ambience is top class with decorated bamboo leaves salt and pepper holders in each table, the lighting also suits the nature of the restaurant. The waiters and management staff are well mannered and always ready to help the children and elderly with good behaviour. The Biriyani be it chicken or mutton is just awesome and the Chinese food is also mouth watering. Bengali dishes like seasonal hilsa and chingri are well prepared by good qualiy and educated chefs. The home delivery option is also good for this restaurant. They deliver orders upto Kalikapur without any hesitation. Overall a good and wonderful restaurant to have in jadavpur to match the standards of Tangra.

The worst possible thing I do is that I always have a bad affinity towards Biriyani, even going to this non-authentic place for Biriyani I ordered it. amount was good, taste was quiet avarage. Now the Chineses were way better. I wont talk about the ambience,  as taste is the primary choice of mine always. little bit overpriced,  else, go for it.

it is a decent food joint at Jadavpur.  The Chinese Dishes were of good taste but tasty bite starters could have been much better as it was bit more oily and not so crispy.  The place remains crowded most of the time as it is located on the main road. It is  a pocket friendly  joint too.  The decor is nice. it is a decent hang out place with family and friends.

This is THE BEST restaurant in Kolkata. Whenever I go there, the flavors of the Chinese dishes always seem new to me. North Indian dishes are also as good which taste very fresh and very urban. All the dishes taste very sophisticated. Hospitality is almost 5 star like and yet the price is within young professionals' range. And the best thing: you can pick your dishes with your eyes closed, because all the dishes are exceptionally good yet different by their own rights!

Me and five of my friends decided to visit golden gate today and our choice ended with satisfaction. its situated just beside KPC medical college in jadavpur, i saw the restaurant many times before but after entering it i realized that its dining area is very big and almost all the tables were filled then, must be very popular with local people.. we ordered only chinese, sweet corn soup, chicken fried rice, seczwan chicken, chilly fish, manchurian prawns, service was relatively quick despite huge rush, quality and quantity of food was good, specially liked the fish item, price is very pocket friendly, ambience is good, staffs are well trained and well behaved what else can anyone expect from a restaurant? overall had a very satisfactory time there..

This restaurant just beyond Jadavpur 8B bus stand on the way to Sulekha More is more than you'd expect. At a neighborhood which looks shoddy at best, filled with godowns and garages transformed into shops and eateries, Golden Gate restaurant provides a sudden dash of much needed class. The air conditioned interior, soft interior and decorative furniture, although reeking of typicality in any middle level cuisine restaurant today, still seems nice after coming in from the rag tag outside. Prices are okay if you do not venture down the menu too much. Service is fine. The mocktails
Food is delicious and worth remembering. Chinese is their forte.The menu doesn't have anything new to offer in the noodles, rice, chicken, starters, soup or momo categories. I liked the Pan fried Soya noodles, a relatively unseen dish elsewhere. 1 thing to definitely try is the fish. The array of authentic chinese fish dishes such as the Fish in Hoisin Sauce and the Pomfret Schezwan are heavenly. Other items are also unique and delectable.
The Indian section is nondescrpit and worth turning over with grossly overpriced items.
The Bengali section is heads and shoulders above the rest. The items are mouth watering, unique, true to tradition and all at a very reasonable rate. The Ruhi posto and Bhapa Murala are wow.

Chakraborty Tip : Try a bengali fish dish along with a chinese one. You'd be surprised how well they go together. :)

exploring Chinese food destinations near my locality is coming towards termination.Today we have visited Golden Gate. Location wise its very much approachable just 3 mins walking distance from Jadavpur 8b bus stand.Parking will be a problem i think as this is situated with no space left in front.
Ambiance is so so,typical of any other Chinese restaurant with black and red colour combo,wooden coaster,dim light and instrumentals.No special attraction was seen in ambiance.

Food was good no doubt.We took chicken host and sour soup and dry garlic fish as starters.Both were good though i found the soup little bit more tangy than other restaurant.Fish item was very good ,crispy and delicious.In main course we had mixed gravy noodles and hong kong chicken.The noodles were thick but they made the dish tasty and the chicken preparation was also very  much satisfactory with generous amount of chicken pieces with a tasty gravy garnished with cashew nuts.Though they have mughlai and bengali items also in their menu,we didnt try those.One couple just seated in front of us took biriyani and i saw the portions were very much generous.

Though the service was fast i found them sometimes busy in chatting with themselves and we had to find and call them loudly to take the orders and to provide bill.Perhaps due to the lack of customers at that time they became somewhat inattentive(we went their at 5:45pm)

Price is cheap in comparison to food and rate in other Chinese restaurants.

This place is just next to our college hence I am frequent visitor. (They also give discounts to the students from our.college).The food here is good,well above average.
They dont have any speciality and are more like the Jack of All Trades.
They also have a traditional bengali section to their menu which includes a number of bengali dishes from alu posto to shukto and many more.
The interiors are good and the staff is friendly.
Upon entering the resraurant you'll be able to notice the transition between the hustle bustle of the road and the classy,calm and warm interiors.
The onions served along with the chillies and pickles are really cute and small, they fascinate me everytime I go there. You can pop in an onion at a time.

When i go out with my friends we usually have chinese food, but as there was only 2 of us we decided to have indian dishes; paratha pudina & murg dahi the 2 really went well with each other & was very tasty :) the murg dahi is definitely not a bland dish though it may deceptively looks so, it was well spiced & tasted really good

Enter Golden Gate to appease your hunger! 

What else do you want when you can get to eat scrumptious meal at nominal rates! I'm sure nothing is more pleasing than the mere feel of spending a few hundred rupees for a wholesome and filling meal. Among a very few restaurants in Kolkata that offer lip smacking food at pocket-friendly rates, Golden Gate, according to my opinion, occupies the highest position. Whether it's the cozy ambience, plush decor or good food, I bet you'll like everything here. If you are a Jadavpur University student, then this is best and most nearby place to hang out with friends.  It is not at all difficult to find this restaurant since it is located on the main road (100, Block C, Raja SC Mullick Road, Jadavpur, Kolkata).

What I like most is the gestures of the staff that make you feel important and pampered. On entering the restaurant I was greeted by their courteous manager and a friendly waiter showed me my place. Of course, I was here with my eight friends and we were shown a table, particularly arranged for eight people. The lavish interiors of Golden Gate restaurant attracted our attention. I liked the cozy ambience of this restaurant and the cool air from the air conditioners soothed our nerves, dried our sweat. After ordering some Mango Blossom (mock tails), we paid careful attention in selecting our menu for the day. 

Golden Gate offers Chinese, north Indian and Bengali cuisine. After a lot of discussion, we unanimously agreed to have Chinese food. We had some lemon coriander soup with black pepper mushroom, prawn in Hoisin sauce and sweet and spicy lamb. Our main course consisted of Szechwan fried rice (chicken), HongKong rice, Singapore noodles chicken, American Chopsuey, Oyester Chicken, Kuong Pao chicken and garlic prawn. Each item tasted awesome! The chef knew how to use the right spices and herbs to make each dish taste delectable. We were hungry and our hunger was satiated after eating such tasty food. After a hearty meal lip smacking gulab jamuns with ice creams made our day. Come to this place if you want to dig into tasty food at affordable rates!

I have only been here twice,but I really like this place.
Their chinese food,especially the starters are scrumptious,as are the desserts and mocktails.I have no idea about the Indian food here,except the biriyani(which was quite good).The best dish for me was the Chinese Chicken Salad..Its the perfect combination of sweet ,tangy,and spicy,and comes with a beautiful presentation in a generous amount.Also worth trying is the Pan Fried Chilli Fish.The Chicken Sizzler left much to be desired though.Although it had a spectacular entrance,with the fire alarm going off due to the smoke,it was pretty bland.The french fries accompanying it were boring,and it was just two pieces of chicken on a bed of fried rice.LAME.
The service is thik-thak,neither excellent nor below average...we went during lunchtime,around 1pm.
Overall , its a good place to come with your family or friends.

The food is nice. Both Indian and chinese cuisines are good. They also have bengali cuisines in their menu, but I have not tasted them yet. Located in Jadavpur it faces tough competition from the numerous other options over there. The problem with golden gate is that they do not have much of anything to differentiate it from the others. But that is true for all restaurants in the area. To establish its identity it needs to excel in at least one kind of cuisines in that area. Jadavpur is an area filled with multi cuisine restaurants and no specialists. Golden gate is no exception.

Almost every recipes are available.Try the "Handi special Mutton" & " murgh Mirch". Worth The price..We all Went there with a cake ,for a friends b'day celebration, the first thing which i liked the most was they took the initiative, of arranging everything, even they placed the cake on a nice plate, gave a knife, and arranged candles for him. So Now you guys can imagine the kind of service these people provide. I Simply love this place.

Average mid range restro

Dishes are ok. Some authenticity is lost... mayb tweaking em to the local flavours may the reason. e.g hyderabadi biryani has low oil n has curry leaf flavour but i guess i found no diff with the ubiquitous lucknow style biriyani tht calcutta favours so much... pretty much same flavours.
or a mutton rogan josh which is supposed to a 'dum' dish.... the curry was watery n pieces of mutton was bad.. in short mutton curry which amateur hands wud create.

n yes my dad found a small wooden piece in his soup... !!! although dish was replaced.. but wat was it doin in the first place

so nothing out of the world. kinda ok... if only u are left wid no options at all

If you can overlook the congestion and the space crunch especially during dinner time, this is a nice place to hang out with friends and family. Along with my family, around 8 members, I went there for dinner yesterday. I had only 'take away' from here prior to that. The food was good especially the starters. We loved the 'drums of heaven' and the soup. The Kebab was okay sorts. We had a Kashmiri pulao, chicken tikka butter masala, resmi masala, mutton rogan josh and mutton jhol. The mutton served here was of good quality and the dish prepared also tasted nice. The service is quite good over here. Recommended for a visit.

Golden Gate is simply waste of time. I had gone over there with my parents when it opened to try their menu items as some of my friends told me that this place offers great food at affordable rate. To my despair I found out that only the price is low, the standard of the food is really poor. I had ordered Crispy Chiken to start with, but it was nothing like that. I felt like chewing some rubber in my mouth. Anyone thinking about spending quality time with family in this place must reconsider their plan. The owner of this place must think to improve the standards or else the sale chart would hit rock bottom.
