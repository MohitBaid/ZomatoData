After a tiring shopping evening with my girlfriend (tiring 'only' for me), we were in mood for an authentic pizza. Brickwood being the nearest place, we decided to hop in (later to emerge delighted)! its a small place with hardly 3-4 tables (if you wish to sit indoors, which i would suggest since the ambiance, though basic and simple has a positive vibe)We ordered a Brownie Milkshake to start with and we loved it. We had earlier decided to share but my girlfriend loved the taste and did a bottoms up, so well...we had to order another one. It may even be because of the fact that we were tired. But, the next item, 'Pollo Di Brickwood' pizza was definitely a perfect choice. The Roquette leaves and Feta Cheese combination was a treat to the taste buds. The next item however, deserves a standing ovation, the 'Velluto Rosso Fondant'. This delicacy is pure bliss! Its actually a perfectly made red velvet lava cake served with vanilla ice cream, but the texture and taste is such that one would get overwhelmed with gluttony )someone having a sweet tooth of course! If not, then keep away from this piece of heaven)Moral: We felt refreshed and to this day, my girlfriend mentions the fondant (& her desire to have it again), every time we are on Park Street!

An awesome place to visit. Love the freaky shake which is large enough for two. The pizza is cooked in brick fire and is one of the best pizzas to have. You can also enjoy the steak out there which is the on e of the best food out there.

To be honest, my only reason to visit this place was their freakshake.. & I'm glad I visited there because it was awesome.. topped with lava cake, cookies & cakes, it looks good as well as tastes good..

Appetiser- we ordered Loaded fries with chicken bit it was not available so they suggested us to try Spanish chicken.. wo don't regret trying that.. It was neither too good nor bad.. I was something different with unique taste & I some what liked that..

Pulled cheesy garlic bread was good.. beard was soft and fresh and cheesy

Stuffed chicken steak-  juicy chicken breast usually stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, but we asked them not to stuff mushrooms( we don't like mushrooms) and they agreed.. steak was ok.. French fries n salad was good..

Velluto Rosso fondant- hot red velvet lava cake served vanilla icecream (nice combination)  sweetness was perfect..

Overall food was good

Giving some extra rating for the staffs.. They were friendly and service was good..

Will visit again to try their pizza

Everything thing on the menu is worth trying. For first visit pick their specials because you don't want to miss them. It's affordable, a must visit for pizza lovers and a lovely place for a mid week date. Personally brownie lava burst is a repeat every visit.  Love it! Love brickwood! I take all my people there!

It's a quite small place in camac street. The food is good but the service is a little lacking. We had to wait almost an hour before we got served 2 dishes. So definitely not the place for fast food. Visit if you have some time to spend or want to catch up with a friend.

I personally visited this place to have their famous chocolate Freakshake which was really amazing! The shake was itself is a heavy dish with one chocolate cake in top and other elements like plain cookies in it! The one thing which I  would like to refer them that the fish needs a relief from the sweetness of chocolate! They must introduce a fresh and salty element to cut through the sweetness of the dish..otherwise it was yummy!

We ordered the Loaded Fries, Pulled Cheese Garlic Bread, Corn and Spinach Cannelloni and the Chocolate Freakshake.

The taste is great no doubt, but the quantity is measly. Based on the quantity, the price is exorbitant. The service is also very slow. Each dish took at least 20 minutes to arrive. The restaurant was also very stuffy and hot.

For 2018 's 1st lunch I chose Brickwood.. I was misinformed by their staff about the location so I went otherside of wood street unnecessarily...After a long search finally managed to reach there.. Place was empty and I was surprised to see that.. 2-3 customer visited when we r there...
We ordered: 
1. Pulled garlic bread (3 / 5 ) : I thought it more cheesy ... There's no cheese stuffing in the bread.. U can feel the gread more than cheese but bread was fresh and soft
2. Spinach and corn canolini add Chicken ( 4.5/ 5) :
 Preperation is no doubt very tasty.. Pasta sheets were very soft.. Creamy stuffing in feeling with chucnks of chicken sausages... Sauceade with tomato but not that sweet well balanced... But 3 medium size pcs cost u around 400... Chicken cost u 95 extra i.e. around 495 which I think is very costly if we compare the quantity and quality of it....

3. Chicken mushroom cilantro pizza ( 3.5/5) : 
Though Thin crust pizza but not at all crispy... Dominos  delivers crispy thin crust even at home with distance of 20min but still taste remains great.. Here toppings taste is also very bland, chicken pcs tasted as almost boiled.. Amount of Cheese was less.. I didnt get any spl taste of wood fire pizza rather places like cafe mezzuna, spagetti kitchen, even chillys,tgi etc served nice thin crust pizza... Though they took it and tried to make it crisp and better as I wanted to take away rest of the 6 slices.. But they cudn't do much to it...

I wanted to try Stuffed Chicken Stake.. But they said chicken is not ready and it will take huge time to make it even for the fish steak as its frozen.. I wonder why things were not ready at 3pm even in a spl day... Every item took min 15/20 min each to serve on my table one after another..
What I found that places is over rated as compared to its quality and price of the food...But the lady staff was very cordial...

The sole purpose of visiting this cafe to be very honest was to try their Freakshake. We took the Strawberry Velvet Freakshake. It was thick, creamy strawberry flavoured. It had cookie crumble and was sweet to the right amount. It was topped with Velutto Rosso, the warm red lava was delightful and vanilla cookies, whipped cream and sprinkles.
We also took Moroccan Chicken, I was a little disappointed with the amount compared to the price they charged. The taste of the spices were good, but the pita bread had a strange texture, not the usual moist and soft bread we expect.
The cafe has a nice ambiencebut runs low on maintenance,it needs a lot more improvement to deserve a higher rating in my opinion.
the service was fine enough.

The concept of Wood Fired Pizzas is nothing new. Pizzas are being prepared in wood fired ovens across the world since time immemorial. However, in a scene dominated by Dominos and Pizza Hut, wood fired pizzas have remained quite the hidden gem in the food scene of Kolkata. BRICKWOOD, located in the heart of Camac Street, Kolkata, has been around for a while now and has been slowly but steadily introducing the hip gourmet food loving crowd to the beauty that is a wood fired pizza. Unlike what we are normally used to seeing being served as pizza, a wood fired pizza is made or unmade by its dough. Toppings take second place to the dough in this case, though they are a very important part too. With all the new pizza concepts popping up everywhere, like pizza in a tiny cone which you can hold with one hand, I feel like this idea of maintaining the authenticity of pizza by making it in a wood fired oven is quite an amazing idea.

From their signature THE BRICKWOOD, which consisted of freshly made tomato sauce blended with sun dried tomatoes, black olives, Roquette leaves and topped with imported feta, I knew this place was gonna blow me away. The dough too, was clearly a winner here as it was perfectly made and perfectly cooked. This was quite easily the best vegetarian  pizza I’d ever tasted.

Fear not, meat lovers, they even have options for you. I got to try their PESTO CHICKEN PIZZA, which consisted of Roast Chicken, sun dried tomatoes and fresh basil pesto to top it off. This was an amazing choice too though I’d have to go with the signature BRICKWOOD as the clear winner here, being a hard core non vegetarian as myself.Like any other pizzeria, this is not all they have to offer. The PULLED CHEESY GARLIC BREAD is another favorite. Home-made bread is baked with mozzarella to cheesy perfection and has always been a crowd pleaser here and quite obviously given how delicious it was.Never had I thought, I’d go to a pizzeria and fall in love with pasta the way I did here. The CREAMY CORN & SPINACH CANNELLONI is truly a work of art and was the dish of the day for me. Handmade pasta sheets are filled with creamy corn and spinach filling and then baked to perfection in tomato sauce and mozzarella giving birth to one of my favorite pasta dishes ever. I will certainly go back to Brickwood for this one. Cannelloni is truly a gem and deserves so much more recognition in this market dominated by Penne and Spaghetti and I certainly hope more people are exposed to this gem that is Cannelloni.One cannot end a great meal such as this without something sweet. This is where Brickwood introduces FREAKSHAKES to the city of joy. While normally one would be put off at the sight of something as large as a Freakshake which looks like a huge bundle of sweetness, they have managed to balance the Freakshakes to a very impressive point where it is no longer too sweet and makes for a great dessert and one that satisfies your parched throat too. These come in Strawberry and Chocolate options and are amazingly delicious. Order one Freakshake and you will be ordering a lot of desserts at once. Definitely another reason to visit this hidden gem of a place.

Wood Fired Pizzas and Freakshakes aside, the pasta should  be the reason for one to visit this hidden gem of a place. There is nothing I could fault with the food here really. Next time you are around Park Street and plan to visit a pizzeria, you know where to go.

NOTE: Brickwood also gives a 15% discount to students, making it easier to access for them.

Located adjacent to wow momo, on camac street, it's a small place, with both outdoor and indoor seating. 
Went there on the Christmas eve, the staff greeted us nicely. The service wasn't very quick. 
Wanted to order for a Lebanese shawarma platter, but it was unavailable. Hence, ordered a freak shake and a Moroccan chicken with pita bread. 

Freak shake is to die for, for all the chocolate lovers. It's the epitome of all chocolate shakes. There's 2 cookies, choco chips, whipped cream, brownie shake and a choco lava cake to complete it. 
But we were disappointed with Moroccan chicken. The quantity wasn't worth the price they charged for it. We would have left totally and utterly disappointed had it not been for the freak shake, which made our mood. 
Hence a 3.5, solely for the shake and staff.

They serve one of the best pizzas in town.
Usually pizzas are made in microwaves but here in brickwood they make pizzas in a traditional way i.e., in a tandoor namely brickwood.
Seatings are both available in indoors and outdoors.
Cheese Garlic bread is one hell of a experience, do make sure you have one.
Service is quick and no complaints.

I have been reading a lot of articles that were mentioning the "Freakshake" so being a good foodie i decided to try it.

We ordered:
1. Farm Chicken Pizza
2. Chocolate Freakshake

Farm Chicken was okayish.

But a pro tip for freakshake: Share it with your friend or someone. Because as you proceed it starts becoming a little too much sweet. And also its quite big so finishing that alone is a very difficult task.

Possible if you take only the shake. But i would recommend taking something salty or spicy with it because of all the sweet.

The place has both indoor and outdoor seating. Though quite a small indoor seating area.

It's a cozy place. The ambience is good and so is the service. Food quality is good but the portion size is too little for what price they charge. 
The pulled cheesy garlic bread is a star. It's delicious. 
The Non veg loaded fries was disappointing because it didn't have the ingredients mentioned.
The Greek chicken was disappointing too since it had 5 tiny pieces which wasn't even filling.
The spaghetti aglio olio too wasn't up to the mark. It wasn't prepared the way it should have been.

This is a small outlet in Wood street. It has both indoor and outdoor seating. Although the indoor area has limited seating. The decor of the place is quite simple and the ambience is nice. Coming to the food we ordered The Garden Fresh Pizza. The pizzas over here are made in wood fired ovens. The pizza was delicious. We also ordered The Pulled Cheesy Garlic Bread. I found it to quite average. I would give this place extra points for the service. Our server was really friendly and helpful and I can't wait to go back to try their Freakshakes!

Not too long ago I stumbled upon an article on a social media site which grabbed my attention with the phrase "freak shakes". The very next thing that I did was to open zomato.

This little restaurant is located near Camac Street Pizza hut outlet and  primarily serves Italian cuisine. 
Brickwood has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement. The restaurant itself is quite small and has a very cozy, calm vibe going for it. 
Smiling faces greeting you on your way in always sets up the tone for a good evening and Brickwood gets full marks on that front. 
We visited the restaurant last Saturday evening. The restaurant was quite empty around that time with just one more table occupied besides us.
Wood fired pizzas are not a common sight here in Kolkata so I was quite hyped for that. So of course one of these was always going to be on my order. We ordered
🍕 The Brickwood Pizza
🍖 Chicken Steak
🍓 Strawberry Fondant


🍕 The Brickwood Pizza is a thin crust veg pizza with sun dried tomatoes and olives. I don't usually order veg pizza but I was just blown away. It had everything going for it. The Feta cheese was delightful. If I had to pick out one fault with the pizza it would be the over garnishing with Roquette leaves. But otherwise this is a top dish. I would say that this is the best veg pizza that I've tried till date. This dish gets (4/5) from me.


🍖 Coming to the chicken steak, it was medium done, the meat retained moisture , was extremely delicious and the sauce just added to the wow factor of it. The French fries were added bonus. The dish presented a good portion of meat on the plate and was perfect according to me. (5/5)


🍓 Strawberry Fondant or the strawberry freak shake.  This was the star of the show. Our whole visit was centered around this monster in the first place. I can't compare it to anything else because I've never tasted something quite like this. It was rich, it was heavy and it was extremely tasty. The strawberry cheesecake just melted in your mouth. I would highly recommend this item and this deserves 5/5 rating.

The service also deserves a kudos. 

This was certainly a very delicious visit. I would highly recommend this restaurant. It might just be Kolkata's next big thing. Highly Recommend!! :)

I visited this place twice within a week, I had plans to go for the third time as well, but then plans changed. The place is located opposite Pizza Hut on Camac Street, they share a common wall with the Wow! Momo Wood street outlet. 

Coming to the outlet, the place is a small outlet with some seating outdoor, some on the ground floor and some seating on their mezzanine flooring. Their food menu items are plentiful but are dominated by Cafe items such as Pasta, Pizzas and Garlic Breads. Their forte is the Wood fired Pizza but I was disappointed with that. One could try those pizzas but I am not sure they're the best Pizzas on offer given the Dominos and the Pizza Huts. What pleasantly surprised me was their Garlic Bread. It's called the Loaded Pulled Cheesy Garlic Bread. Their bread is baked in house and is stuffed with Mozzarella Cheese. Their Garlic Bread is the best one I've had in recent times. Simply the best. I also tried their Veg Loaded Pulled Garlic Bread and to my surprise, even that was too good! Be it the taste, the quantity or the cheesyness of it. I also tried their Penne Arrabiata Pasta which was also good, not the best but very decent. Their prices are reasonable, not the ones that will burn a hole in your pocket. A meal for two would come to around 800. They also accept payments via DineOut and Paytm for the tech savvy users. 

Summing up, I would love to go to this place again and again, not for their Brick fired pizzas, but for their Loaded Pulled Cheesy Garlic Bread.

The cafe serves heavenly dishes. I had their pulled cheesy garlic bread and the brownie lava burst. Trust me they are as delicious as they look in menu card. I have not tried out their pizzas so no comments regarding that..but the freeshake...I bet you can never forget in your life.
But yes they are seriously overpriced and have a quite small cabin. Otherwise staff, ambiance and food ...nothing could be better. 
My personal thanks to brickwood..coz after putting their food pics in my status many of my old friends pinged me and i really loved to talk to them after long time.. Thanks
I promise to visit soon.....

After reading on social media of some new entrants in the menu, I decided to opt for this place which is very close to my office. Have tried their pizza before which is rather good. But the dishes newly added is not at all tasty. I had Turkish Chicken as a starter and Chicken Steak as the main. Horrible taste, was overloaded with too much salt, the Turkish Chicken tasted of raw egg. And the worst part was that they served Steak on a small side dish plate. How could the presentation of a dish so well famous be such inferior. And all the dishes are so hugely priced..............Not worth even a single visit. 
No decor, no presentation of food, food tastes yuck, compromised completely on quality and quantity  and sky touching price...Completely disastrous.

Brickwood is the only wood-fired Pizza outlet in Kolkata and that's the only reason I went there at the time of Afternoon.

Located at the Opposite of Pizza Hut Camac St. Place has seating arrangements divided in ground floor, outside and as well as small in 1st Floor.

I ordered Hot Chocolate Delight and Strawberry Cheesecake Shake and I must admit that strawberry cheesecake shake was one of the best I had in all life. Although the hot chocolate is not bad as all.

From the appetizer I tried Spanish chicken which was kinda bland to me and quantity was not that much.

Country chicken was the Pizza I tasted there and it was quite good but I didn't find any difference.

Service was good and the staff were friendly. Will try some items from there again.

Bang opposite 22,Camac street building this place is small and just has a basic decor. Nothing too fancy or delightful, the bare minimum. 

Coming to the food, we weren’t much hungry so we ordered the pulled cheesy garlic bread. It was tasty, with a generous helping of cheese but quite overpriced. 
Now their shake, we ordered the strawberry freakshake. It had a red velvet fondant with flowey  filling inside. And probably the only good thing about that shake. However, the filling was way too eggy. The sprinkles that came with the shake were completely off and ruined the taste of the shake. The shakes are definitely not served the way they’re picturised. There’s hardly any whipped cream, and the cake is about to sink inside the shake, which in itself is completely melting, the cream that’s suppose to be near the rim of the mug, horribly melted its way to the base at the time of being served itself and also overflowed into the plate. 
The presentation of their food is dismal, they won’t accept swipe cards Coz of some perpetual issue while settling with banks (though we are still issued magnetic strip cards by banks). 
All in all, wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.

After planning for really long, we finally went to Brickwood on a winter evening and sat out by the road. The vibe is just very laid back. And of course, our primary reason was because Brickwood is one of the few places making pizza in a brick oven. 
We ordered a pulled cheesy garlic bread as recommended by Zomato, and it was almost the softest garlic bread we’ve had in the city. 
For dinner we got a pollo funghi cilantro pizza. The crust was as authentic as it could get- thin by soft, the mushrooms were aromatic and dominated the taste over chicken. I did find the cilantro a bit too strong or maybe I’m just used to having basil on pizza. I wonder what this would taste like with basil instead of cilantro. 
We also got hot cocoa which was amazing, and some fresh lime sodas. 

On a whole, a great place and I’d love to try more of their food.

Brickwood is popular for its wood-fired hand-rolled pizzas. But what drew me towards Brickwood is not their pizzas but their newly introduced Freak Shakes. There was quite a buzz in social media about their Freak Shakes and when I saw the pictures I just couldn’t resist myself.
It is a small joint in Camac Street with seating arrangement in two floors. They have outdoor seating as well. The ambiance is nice with minimal simplistic decor. The service is prompt. There is a bell system in every table to call the waiter, which is definitely very convenient.

Brickwood is popular for their Italian delights, and of course their amazing melt-in-the-mouth wood-fired pizzas.
They have arrangements for outdoor (chairs and tables under umbrellas) as well as indoor seating, with a live kitchen downstairs.
When we visited the upstair seats were packed so we hung out cosily downstairs.
The earth-toned brick walls, modern art, box of cookies stacked neatly in a corner are notable of the interior decor.
Ordered The Brickwood Pizza (veg; there's also a non-veg version), one of their exclusive bestselling pies and a hot favourite among guests.
The thin-crust pizza, of 8 slices, was served fresh from the oven. The fine crisp base had freshly made tomato sauce blended with homemade sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, garnished with fresh roquette leaves and topped with imported feta cheese. The oregano and chilli flakes would contribute to an added flavour and zing to the slices.
Defintely a winner, the pizza is marvellous to taste, way better than many other thin-crust pizzas available in the city, as far as my personal experience goes. Also do try their other outstanding pizzas, including the Fungi which I'm yet to try, and their newly introduced freakshakes.
Paper napkins and straws are avaialble in a corner and not on the tables so one can help themselves by fetching if need. The prices of the items are inclusive of taxes so need for paying any extra amount. All payments are to be done outside at the counter.
A small place but a hidden gem for pizza fans, an absolute MUST visit if one swears by the Italian pie. :)

Brickwood is located in a camac street in brickwood road beside fan's club.. its a small cafe type which has both indoor and outdoor sitting.. 
Heard a lot about the new freak shake which got introduced in this place.. So thought of trying it out with my frend.. 
So ordered the same BROWNIE LAVA SHAKE nd also apart frm it orderd their signature dish i.e HOT CHOCOLATE

If i talk abt the shake trust me it tasted really heavenly nd upto my expectation.. but i didnt lyk the taste of hot chocolate.. it has no sugar in it nd it was smelling too.. may be coz of their cocoa nd pure chocolate content is too high.. but watever it is i didnt lyked.. 
But the management was friendly nd ambience was also nice

Visited the place to try out the freak shake and it was Awesome. Just too good. The ambience is decent and the staff is really well behaved. Also tried the farm chicken pizza and Italian fish steak. The fish steak was good to taste and the creamy sauce over it was nice. The pizza was also good with a lot of chicken. Overall a nice place to hangout with friends with an outdoor seating arrangement.

This place serves authentic Wood-fire oven pizza. The oven can be seen from outside the restraunt. The dining area has 2 floors. The upper floor is cosy and has natural light.
We ordered the recommended pollo fungi cilantro. The base was nice, thin, crispy, with a light burnt flavour. The pizza also had adequate chicken and mushroom toppings. But I didn't like the flavour of cilantro sauce, it tasted very bland. So overall, the pizza fell sort of flat.
For dessert we ordered the chocolate brownie freakshake. The dessert looked like a dream, exactly like the adverts on social media. The chocolate lava cake on top is one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever tasted. But boy, is this thing heavy! Despite of being sugar junkies, we struggled to finish this.

Kolkata is a place where you can find heritage, culture and various types of foods at every twist and turn. This small joint is a hidden gem around camac street area. It's situated within 10 min walking distance from maidan Metro station. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. The name "BRICKWOOD" itself will give you a concept of freshly made pizzas. This small café serves amazing hand rolled wood-fried pizzas..... This place is paradise for every pizza lover and the main attraction of this place is their all new freakshakes.
1. Country chicken pizza: A thin crust pizza loaded with lots of colorful veggies like sweet corn, onions, capsicum and rosemary infused chicken and mozzarella cheese.
2. Brownie Lava Burst Freakshake : A signature creation of this place. It seems like a war of chocolates right above the milkshake. A dense chocolate milkshake inside the mason jar topped with whipped cream, homemade butter cookies, two layers of brownie , a choco lava cake and lots of dark choco chips. Your ultimate mouth sensation will be just YUM!
Staffs were very nice... Overall This place is a worth visiting 😊😊

The concept of firewood pizza is yet to be properly introduced in Kolkata. Bringing this charred version of pizza and trending it in Kolkata is Brickwood with its unique way of baking pizza in a fire oven, taking pizza a node higher in the authenticity quotient.
From THE BRICKWOOD signature pizza made with freshly blended tomato sauce, sun dried tomatoes, olives, roquette and imported feta to the newly introduced Pesto and chicken pizza Brickwood has worked hard to stand out in its genre.
This is not just another quaint pizzeria and pizzas are not their only area of expertise, the original pulled cheese garlic bread which is a cheesy affair of house baked bread with loads of mozzarella is a major hit. The Cannelloni is something that I believe deserves a lot more exposure than it already has.
This is probably one of the most fascinating pasta I have ever come across. Corn and spinach rolled in handmade pasta sheets to give you one brilliant plate of cannelloni is a must try every time you find yourself in the pizzeria.

To end it on a sweet note I need to take a special mention of the newly introduced FREAKSHAKES.
With an assemblage of the best in house desserts the freak shakes come in two basic flavors of chocolate and strawberry. Apart from being a visual treat it is a treat for all dessert parched souls!

The location of brickwood is hard to miss, and missing brickwood means missing out on the best freak shake in Kolkata. It's a must visit.
We ordered Cheesy Pizza, and Chocolate Freak shake 3 of us were full to the brim after gulping down 5 slices, and 1/2 of shake. 
What I liked about pizza was the authenticity of cheese. I had never had such creamy cheese ever!
Similarly, the freak shake was showered liberally with loads of biscuits, cream, and above all hot chocolava cake!
Coming to ambience, we have an option to sit either in open area, which definitely needs more maintenance. The inner area is beautiful. The light music played by stereo speakers keep the mood going. 
The servers were excellent. Right from the time we stay till the time we left the place, they catered to us seamlessly. Furthermore, never ever did they keep lurking around us, to indicate that we must leave early. Nothing is better than having a peaceful, satisfying meal on wood street crossing. 
Suggestion- please clean the open area more frequently, at regular intervals.

This is an amazing place. I’ve had the pulled chese garlic bread. You can feel the cheese with every bite and it’s a must try. Be warned though, it gets kinda bland pretty soon! Since this is after all a pizzaria, had to try their signature misto di carne, which was filled with juicy meat. But the cherry on top is the velluto rosso fondant. That’s a red velvet cupcake, with a ball of ice cream on the side. It’s just delicious! You have to have it.
As for the staff, they were really friendly. Also the menu items are tax included, so that’s a plus.

It was today we visited this place, it is right next to our college. The experience was horrible. Like really horrible. Tbh, we all had our exams and went to chill and eat. But the food was bad. We had ordered a veg lasagne which was cold and also the pizza was really soggy in the middle like the dough was uncooked. The freakshake was watery. Horrible experience overall. Really wished for some great food. Will never be visiting this place again. The reason we were given for such food was it is rush time. Seriously didnt expect that due to rush restauranta of such good quality lack on the quality they present. Also the service was really slow. They took nearly 45-60 mins to bring us our food and it was still cold.

If you are in excess of money do visit this place. Neither the ambience nor the portions nor the taste justify the prices they charge. Juicy fried chicken is anything but juicy. Three pieces of small cutlets at Rs 230/-. U get seven yummy pieces at Golden Joy at the same price. Thin crust pizza cost Rs 600/- with little meat and cheese.

Brick and Wood both are so important to build, rather conquer something. And if you combine these two things (e.g. Brick & Wood) it’ll become one single word BRICKWOOD that is enough to kill the Hunger Monster in you. Wood Street in Kolkata is famous for so many food joints and shopping hub mainly.

Kolkata a place where you can find various types of food stalls to the restaurant. every part of the corner there is a restaurant or street food joint where you can actually enjoy lip-smacking food at a reasonable price.” Brickwood” a small hidden gem in the city of joy, located very near to Camac Street Area, walking distance from Maidan Metro Station. a few months back during my first visit to this place, I found that this place is not very much spacious, it has a capacity of 16-20 on the indoor and around 10-12 in the outdoor. well decorated place, with some good ambiance. varieties of dishes you can choose from the menu,

This two year old quiant pizzeria situated at #WoodStreet opp Pizza Hut is a paradise for any pizza lover.. It is one of the very few places in Kolkata where the bread and the dough is prepared fresh inhouse and a combination of gas & wood is used to get the texture right for an authentic #woodfirepizza.. We enjoyed #THEBRICKWOOD (thier signature creation - freshly made tomato sauce blended with sundried 🍅, black olives, fresh Roqquette leaves toppped with imported Feta cheese - a sureshot winner - had no clue that a veg pizza can taste that amazing).. We were then served the #CHICKENPESTOPIZZA (what a delight it was to bite into the creamy layer of oven roast chicken, sundried 🍅 and fresh basil pesto on that thin crust - heavenly stuff).. And if you thought that they were only about 🍕, allow me to correct that misconception. #PULLEDPORKGARLICBREAD is one of thier hot selling favourites - it's soft and a super yummy porky affair.. #CREAMYCORNSPINACHCANNELLONI is yet another veg dish that blows your mind away - made with fresh homemade pasta filled with cheesy corn & spinach baked in tomato sauce & oodles of Mozzarella cheese - the taste simply can't be described in words.. After that grand meal, one certainly needed desserts to end on a high and man - they arrived like the most royal #freakshakes ever!! For the first time - i simply didn't want to dig in to them bcz somehow, i was transfixed by thier looks and resisted spoiling that for as long as possible - 😂😂.. First one was #STRAWBERRYVELVET #FREAKSHAKE - whipped cream, strawberry fondant, strawberry cheesecake with sprinkles and homemade 🍪.. Next in line was #BROWNIELAVABURST #FREAKSHAKE - 🍫 fondant, whipped cream, brownie shake with chocolate 🍪.. Both the shakes were out of the 🌎 in terms of taste, thickness and ingredients.. 
Thanks a ton

Don't let the small pizza cafe at 10 Wood street fool you. This place has the most amazing wood fired pizza and delicious freak shakes in town. 
This was my first time at the pizzeria and I was not disappointed. 

Garlic cheese bread 4.5/5 - Brickwood makes it's own bread which is what sets them apart from all the other restaurants in the city. The cheesy garlic bread was oozing with cheese and the bread was so soft. 

Spinach and Cheese cannelloni 5/5 - had rolled pasta topped with cheese and stuffed with spinach was the best cannelloni I have ever had. 

Pesto chicken pizza also known as the Brickwood pizza 5/5 - the pizza was cooked to perfection, a dish inspired by the owners travels to Australia. 

Freak Shakes ! 
 Strawberry Velvet Freak shake 4.5/5-
the freak shakes was made of Strawberry Cheesecake served in a huge mug with a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkles, topped with vanilla cookies and Strawberry fondant. 

Chocolate Brownie freak shake 5/5 - a must try for all chocolate lovers. A dense chocolate shake served with a dollop of whipped cream, dark chocolate chips, double layer brownies, chocolate cookies and chocolate fondant. 

Brickwood is a value for money cafe with delicious food, fast service.

We visited Brickwood for lunch this afternoon. Located centrally in Wood Street, it is our go to place for authentic wood fired pizzas. 

Handcooked and fresh out of the oven, the food here is delicious. Our scrumptious meal started with the house favourite - pulled cheese garlic bread. Perfectly baked and seasoned, this cheesy delicacy simply melted in our mouth. 

Next up for the spinach and corn cannelloni. This dish was the star of the meal. The perfect balance of cheese and sauces with their self prepared pasta resulted in the most delicious dish ever. We couldn't get enough of this classic dish. 

For the pizzas we ordered two varieties. First up was the in house special Brickwood Pizza. Sun-dried tomatoes, fresh olives in a bed of Creamy tomato suace topped with feta is undoubtedly the best combination and Brickwood does full justice to this pizza. The second pick was pesto chicken pizza which looked equally tempting. Also, this is one of the few places I've heard about this combination. Non-vegetarians, you will love this one! 

Then, we were served the freakshakes! 

First was the strawberry Velvet. It was a combination of Cheesecake and home made cookies topped with sprinklers and the vello Rosso fondant. It was not over sweet and left an amazing after taste. Next we had the Brownie Lava Burst. Choco fudge, choco chips and choco lava cake - it tasted as dreamy as it sounds. 


Special mention to the owner and chef who were present through out to ensure each of our needs were taken care of.

#FunFact: Brickwood bakes their own breads! Also, if you're diet concious, yet craving a pizza, their multi grain ones are perfect for you. Light and nice, this is one of the few places that serves this healthy option!

It's pizza time!!!! Well, a fanatic of pizza as I am, how could I not try the pizza place that's so close to my college... Brickwood surely goes down in my list of the best pizzerias I have ever been to. The ambience is what stole my heart at the first go with Pink Floyd ruling the show with "Wish u were here" in the background... Obviously the eatery is small to be true but it's obviously not a crammed one and is intelligently spaced.
Coming to the food, all we had was a pizza recommended by the staff which goes by the name of Misto di Pollo... It was woodfire pizza at its best to say the least. The toppings were sufficient with ample amounts of roasted chicken and rosemary infused chicken and chicken sausages which were the clear show stealer. The crust was what won our hearts, lightly burned but flaky at the same time exuding the woodfire aroma brilliantly... It was thin and after quite a few slices of this pizza, I still did not feel heavy with a burst of cheese. The staff is utterly helpful and courteous.
The only criticism would be that the place lacks a washroom or a place where we could wash our hands which obviously needs a washing after it has been fumbling with cheese... Other than that... Brilliant experience sums up brickwood for me... Definitely looking forward to coming here again and trying other delicacies as soon as I can.

Brickwood. Great name for a pizza place. The name itself brings the smell of freshly made pizza waft in the air. But can it live up to the taste of the wood fired pizzas?

Sadly not this one. 
In clear words, the pizza I ordered was not that good. 

I ordered a  home  delivery  for  a mushroom topped pizza through Zomato. Came under an hour. 

The first bite and I was disappointed. The pizza was very cold. I mean I just got the pizza and it was the first bite. How can it be cold? Maybe they don't have a sophisticated delivery system where pizzas remain hot. 
The taste was also ordinary. Crust was thin, there was a flavour in it but not that much that makes you go wow. After the third piece, finishing the pizza was an exercise as it had become ice cold and chewy. 
Also for a big Pizza, there was only one sachet of seasoning provided. It barely covered two pieces. 

Not cool. 

Will I order it again from this place? I don't think so.

Ambience: nice cozy eatery, calm lighting, soothing music and a genuine exposed brick wall. Also has a choice of outdoor seating. 

Food: had a pulled cheesy garlic bread. It was good and would be better if it was served hotter. Next had a spinach and corn cannelloni which was also good but not WOW. Decided to have desert elsewhere. 

Service: was a bit lacking. The waiter was not interested in serving I guess.

I had ordered from Zomato. You get a Persian Rose water free! Pollo Fungi Cilantro (Chicken Mushroom Dhania) Pizza!

True to its name. The base paste of tomato was top quality. Chicken and Mushroom were full. Taste was awesome. The cheese was mozzarella. Fresh and not the rubber formation you find mostly in other pizza outlets. Price wise this one is what the best money can get. And yes the bake was top class. Not burnt, not too hard, not too thin and crispy. Just Right!

Persian Rose Water is basically Chia Seeds in Rose Water. Light Sweet. It is excellent for your digestion!

Worth every buck!

Had a 🍕 Original Brickwood vegetarian pizza 🍕 for takeaway.It was fantastic.I loved the sour feta and the bitter rocket leaves combination.Although, I did find some of the tomatoes to be flavorless while the rest were smoky yet juicy. The crust was cooked to perfection. I would definitely try it once more at their place. Also ordered a 🍝Spaghetti Pomodoro🍝.It was good , spicy but I expected it to be a bit more flavorful.
On the downside, I had a 🍹Virgin Mojito🍹 there and it was way too sweet.That overpowered the mint and lime flavors in it.

Tasty food. Great ambience. The decor and service is perfect. Tried Chicken steak, Brickwood pizza and Garden fresh pizza. Located in camac street this place is a perfect yes for both friends and family. Both outdoor and indoor dining available.

I ordered via Zomato, and I was told by somebody from Brickwood, my order would be delivered within 45 minutes. It took almost an hour and a half. 
Also, the chicken was burnt. Not a great first experience.

Location:Just opposite Pizza Hut,Camac Street.

Ambience:The floor space is less but they've done a wonderful job with what was available.The rustic brick walls contrasting with the sleek furniture and the outdoor seating add to the overall charm.

Food:We were three people and we ordered the following-

PULLED CHEESY GARLIC BREAD(4/5)-The eponymous bestseller of this place, just that it tastes better than it looks.One of the very few times when the freshness & taste of the bread gets more brownie points than the ooey,goeey,stringy cheese itself.

POLLO PICANTE(4/5)-A chicken starter with juicy chunks of chicken probably grilled with a roasted tomato marinade.The crisp arugula and creamy feta on top adds textural contrast but the taste of the feta went unnoticed among the other bolder flavours.

VEGGIE BLAST PIZZA(3.75/5)-A beautifully done thin-crust ,wood fired pizza with beautiful toppings.The toppings were ample and fresh,the base tasted out of the world and nothing was over the top.

HOT COCOA(4.5/5)-Decadent and sinful,it's like a hug in a mug.A dash of milk in rich chocolate ganache(contrary to popular belief authentic hot chocolate does require a dash of milk in it) topped with a spoonful of cream,it induces a warm,fuzzy feeling inside.

CHILLED COCOA(5/5)-Probably one of the best iced chocolate drinks out there.Being a regular t2 reader,I ordered this because team t2 apparently swears by this and I wasn't disappointed at all.Must-have.

Prices-Money charged is pretty exorbitant considering the portion sizes.

Service-Seamless.The staff was amazing.

Verdict-Drop in if you're nearby.A good place to chill over some decent food.

amazing pizza's. perfect mix of cheeze and chicken and veggies. the costing is good too. the cheesy pull over garlic bread is simply tempting and mouth watering tasty. the desserts are good too.must try all in all. but the chicken steak ordered here wasnt up to the mark. didnt match the standard of the pizza or garlic bread they serve.

Went there on Navami night with high expectations after reading the reviews on Zomato. Was highly disappointed with the experience. We ordered Pulled cheese garlic bread, Pollo Di Brickwood Pizza and chilled cocoa as that was the only drink that was on offer apart from the milkshakes. I wanted to try the lemon grass cooler but could not get it. Pizza was a big disappointment. Very less cheese and chicken was also very less as a topping. Garlic bread was soggy and cold. Cocoa drink was okay. Nothing fancy to talk about. Service was average. Decor is okay okay..overall a bad experience.

Have been a frequent visitor to this place. Much has been said about this place and I am here to add a few. My very first experience of brickwood baked pizza was in Naples and let me tell you that in Calcutta this place bakes them deliciously. I am a fan of their pulled cheese garlic bread. The original one though. Today while I checked their menu I saw a new variation to it. Loaded pulled cheese garlic bread with chicken. So immediately I ordered one but sadly I was quite disappointed cause they have reduced the quantity of cheese. Earlier their pulled cheese garlic bread used to have tonnes of cheese inside like one bite and you could feel the cheese melt in your mouth. But sadly today that was not the case. Could hardly find any cheese in the bread. So experience was kinda disappointing. The drink we ordered was rose flavoured water with ice and chia seeds which was very refreshing. a suggestion please try and maintain the standard that you have set up for loyal customers like us for us to keep coming back over and over again.

It was my first visit to Brickwood. I have never been to this place before. The place has very little space, the upper part was full so we had to sit downstairs. The ambience was pleasent though not calm. I liked the food and the beverages. In total I had a very good experience and would like to suggest this place to all my foodie friends out there.

The first time I had their pulled garlic bread it was amazing but I've tried it 2 times after that and both times I've been majorly let down. It was dry, not cheesy enough and on one occasion, burnt! The pasta salad was too pungent and tasted a bit off. The pizzas are nothing great either and quite dry  Would not recommend.

Brickwood has a nice, fresh ambience. The pull apart cheesy garlic bread is a must try. The mocktails are good. However, the pasta and pizza need to improve. Keep in mind that the place isn't really cheap, before coming here. Looking forward for a more tasty add ons to the menu.

The pizza was worth waiting. But 50 minutes was little too much for a pizza and a milkshake. The milkshake was just cold Bournvita with some froth. Temperature was high in the upper floor seating as there was AC only for the ground floor seating.

This is one of my favourite restaurants especially because of the Chef Dasarath Kirtaniya. Staff behaviour is very good. They are cheaper than 'Dominoes' and 'Pizza Hut' and that's why I'm a regular at it. Keep the prices lower and enjoy a higher footfall. They make exotic thin crust pizza 🍕 with exotic toppings. The crust is so crispy. If you are a meat lover try the 'Misto di Carne'. They also serve an unlimited Coke which they refer as 'Bottomless'. It's a must go for every pizza lover.

Thanks to

Entered a weekday evening with a friend and my girlfriend and ordered a Pulled Cheese Garlic Bread and a Misto Di Carne. The first one was fantastic. We were scrambling and fumbling to devour all that gooey fresh mozzarella amongst valleys of garlic bread. But the pizza was a bit of a letdown. It was a bit dry and hence needed ketchup ( which I absolutely hate). The minced lamb was dry too, diminishing the experience further still.

The ambience was okay. It can be expected that with a wonderful kitchen like this, they would upgrade their serving room for the future.

Would like to visit again to confirm my doubts or reaffirm my faith.

Been hearing a lot about Brickwood on Zomato and from other folks too so thought of trying this place out. It's located on wood street near Vardan Market. It has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Though the weather was nice and cool but a downpour was imminent so we sat inside. The inside of the restaurant is small and does not accommodate too many people. A little more space would have been lovely though. One of the most interesting thing was they had this bell sort of thing on each table to call the waitress which sure was fascinating!
The ambience was not very appealing. But the service was great. They did not take much time and the waitress was more than helpful and cooperative.
So we ordered pull apart cheesy garlic bread, yuzu elderflower (a drink), cheese balls, pesto spaghetti, vegie blast pizza.
All the dishes were quite good though I was not entirely satisfied with it. The cheese balls and pulled cheese were great and is recommended.

It's a small casual dining place. Even on a Saturday night, there were tables available. 

The service is average. We sat opposite the kitchen so a couple of times we grabbed the food ourselves since it was lying on the counter. 

I feasted on - 
1. A cup of hot mint tea - The flavour was great. Served hot with a teeny cookie. 
2. Stuffed mushroom- looked and tasted very ordinary. Unlike the picture in the menu where it's garnished, loaded with cheese and baked well. 
3. The Brickwood pizza - Marvellous! We asked it to be a crispy since I noticed the other pizzas served weren't crispy enough for my taste. 
4. Penne Paprika - Good flavour but no vegetables in the dish. 

The prices are pocket friendly. Can't wait to try more dishes from the menu. 

I was on the look out for great pizzas in Kolkata. And I can say that I found it last night 😊

Brickwood is a cute little pizza place located in Wood Street, just opposite to Pizza Hut. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement. The interior sitting capacity is limited though and the ceiling is pretty low. Service is quick and the staffs are courteous and friendly. We were a group of 4 friends. 3 of us opted for the buffet while one went for the a la carte. To start I had the Lemongrass Cooler. It was quite refreshing. In buffet we had Napoli Lamb Pizza, Misto di Pollo, Misto di Carne, Pollo Fungi Cilantro, Pollo di Brickwood, Cheesy Cheese Pizza and Moroccan Chicken. All were 6 inches. The pizza crust was thin. All the pizzas tasted great except the Pollo Fungi Cilantro. Didn't like it that much. The best was Cheesy Cheese Pizza, according to me. We were also served complimentary desserts as a part of the buffet. We had Ice cream sundae with dark chocolate. While the dark chocolate tasted more bitter than normal, the vanilla part was just perfect. Would love to drop by sometime soon and try their pastas and other appetisers.

Behind Pantaloons on Camac street, Brickwood was one of the pioneers in bringing wood fire pizza in the city. It is a small place which can hold probably upto 30 people at a time. The food is good and easy on the pocket. Order the garlic bread and spinach and corn cannelloni. Coolers were almost at par with each other and thus no specific suggestions on that.

Well, this is an amazing place located at the wood street. Behind Pantaloons camac street. The place is small and a bit cozy. Being a veggie I tried the Pulled apart Cheese garlic bread and The cheesy cheese pizza! 

To be honest they serve the best garlic bread in the town! It's absolutely amazing and lip smacking! The garlic bread is filled with loads of cheese which tastes amazing!
The Cheesy cheese pizza was amazing too. It was thin crust and perfectly baked. It tasted like heaven. 

I would recommend everyone to have the Pulled apart Cheese garlic bread. That's the best thing I've ever had!
A place worth visiting and having the best pizzas and garlic bread in town!

Had three of their pizzas. The crust is thin and beautifully soft, the cheese is just right . The toppings on the pizza are well cooked and go well with the combination you order. The ingredients are very authentic. The lemongrass cooler I ordered was made without sugar for me and had a   Lovely taste. The mixed sauce pasta was creamy and delicious . The servers are very friendly and take good care of you. Would definitely recommend this place to everybody.

Being a small place, there is no room for making it appealing. Hence there is nothing to comment on it's ambience. We ordered paprika pasta and pulled cheesy garlic bread and both the dishes were average. Next thing up was veggie blast and not being a great fan of thin crust pizza I didn't feel that it had anything great to attract my buds. Overall experience: nothing great.

They make authentic wood fire pizza which will make you cry out for more and more.
We had the Pollo Fungi Cilantro and its a must try.
Along with that we had garlic bread, chicken sausage and hot chocolate.
The garlic bread was pretty cheesy and yummy.
The hot chocolate, you got to try it out yourself to know how good it was.
And finally for dessert choco lava cake... It was beyond words!!!
All the prices are tax inclusive and the expense is moderate.
Would surely love to revisit soon!

Located at 10, wood street, camac street area this place is an ideal place for college students to hangout. Not too spacious but cosy and well lit. The staff were warm and friendly. However we had to wait for quite some time for the food. We had the cucumber fizz and lemongrass coolers which were refreshing and light. We had stuffed mushrooms which was nothing fancy. We ordered a pizza and the chicken steak was beautifully done, the veggies were well seasoned. For dessert we had death by chocolate which was beautiful not only in how it looked but it was an actual beauty in taste. I would definitely come back for their desserts as well as to try out their burgers.

I've been living in Kolkata for over a year now and this is one of my favorite restaurants in the city! It's a cozy small restaurant in Wood Street (Close to Camac Street) which may fool you by the size, but the quality of food makes up for everything!

- The price is fair for the amount of food and the quality;

- Food is homemade fresh, very good quality ingredients;

- Wood fire thin crust pizza; 

- Cozy, cute restaurant where you can have a business, family or friends meeting and will suit just fine.

About my favorites:

- BEST CHEESY GARLIC BREAD EVER and I love the mushrooms;

- Amazing pizzas

I tried almost every single pizza there and I have to say that I love the crust they have, the cheese they have (real cheese, thank God). My favorites are the Fungi, Pollo and the Chicken & Garlic;

- Juicy burgers (My favorites are the Creamy Chicken);

- Desserts 

My FAV DESSERT IN TOWN! Great ice cream and real delicious chocolate cake/sauce! This wonderful is called Brickwood Sundae (Which is the Choco fudge cake with ice cream)

Anyway, I recommend trying out their food! With delivery or going there

It's totally worth it :)

If you haven't tasted wood-fired pizza yet, this is certainly NOT a place to try it out and if you have tasted it, this place is still a big NO...Let's see
Food: It was wood fired indeed but it was dry... Not tasty at all... So not cheesy.. Nothing special about their special tomato spread... We had unlimited pizza.. So we tasted every pizza...most of them were similar with different fancy names.
Service: Super-late and slow.. As the seating is upstairs.. One has to look down and ask other customers to look for waiters..
Ambience : It was different... The songs were Italian I guess (cuz it wasn't English or hindi or any other Indian language) but then they played English songs..
Overall : So not recommended.
Still it gets 2 cuz the waiters were nice and the decor was good as it complemented the restaurant name..
I remember ordering one cheesy cheese pizza which lacked cheese.. There was no
feta or mozzarella. .. Even the desserts were not nice..

Loved this place.. Had been here for a friend's birthday.. We took the seating on the outside.. We ordered the strawberry spritzer which was great, the lemongrass cooler which was not so great and bottomless coke.. The first order was the brickwood legend I.e the pulled cheesy garlic bread.. It's definitely a legendary platter.. We ordered the loaded cheesy potatoes and the stuffed mushrooms next.. Potatoes were splendid but the mushrooms were so so.. However what took out hearts away were the pizzas.. We ordered the Napoli lamb pizza and the cheesy cheese pizza.. Their crust and the topings compliment each other so well.. And the cheese is just delicious.. The presentation of the food is classic.. I would strongly recommend this place and especially outdoor seating..

This is the first time I've ordered and unfortunately it was a weird experience. This is how I received my pizza. It was a Chicken & Garlic pizza and arrived in the form of a pizza-slice-pile. Kills the mood. The toppings were all mixed up.
The taste was that of a typical American Pizza with ingredients' flavor mildly coming out.
Overall an okayish experience.

Read about the place while looking for places that serve pizza after midnight. Had always passed this but never thought of trying it out,today me and my brother went to check it out. We had the unlimited pizza thing for lunch,which had options for be vegetarian and non vegetarian pizzas,served with one iced tea. They served four kinds of thin crust,6 inch pizzas and all of them were scrumptious.
For beverages,we had the iced tea and virgin mojito. Virgin Mojito was below par and the iced tea was just alright, it's taste grew on you. 
Recommended.

Amazing place. One of the very less and great pizzerias in Kolkata. Even the sides are amazing. The best thing- quite pocket friendly. Value for money. Definitely a place to visit for your pizza cravings.

A friend took me to this place saying he heard good reviews. And we were ravenous by that moment so we entered.

Ambience (3.5/5): It's a small little cozy place. Seats are very less so in evenings by 7:30, it's cramped up. Place is right above the kitchen. You can see them making the pizza in woodoven and they don't mind. 

Food (4/5): We ordered Lemongrass coolers, The Brickwood pizza and Penne Paprika.
Lemongrass cooler was very fresh and refreshing. A must have for summers.
Brickwood pizza was again very yummy and the ingredients like sun dried tomatoes and sour cream was able to satiate the taste buds. Quantity of the pizza is a damper though. Made me feel like I'm eating a 10-inch wide paratha with toppings. Yummy but not enough for 2 hungry stomachs. So I'll suggest you to add an extra crust.
Pasta was the star of the day. Perfectly cooked with just the right balance of spices, cream and cheese. Not for people who're on a diet of course.

Services (4/5): Not much to say here. Time they take is moderate. They have very less table so they may request you to shift at times to another table to make space for maximum people. All that before serving food only, of course.

This place is not that famous only because of its location and tiny outlook. In bylanes of Camac Street, surrounded by all those glitter glamour of other restaurants, this place which is actually serving great food gets a bit hidden. Must check this out when you crave for original woodoven pizzas in the city. Very few of them serve that.

Wood oven made pizzas with a moderate price range. Indoors not well decorated and sitting capacity quite less but food quality is good. Italian cuisine is good.

Brickwood is a pizzeria joint located at 10, Wood Street, Camac street  area and which mainly serves Italian dishes. They have facilities like dine in, outdoor seating, home delivery, take away, free WiFi etc. They make their own dips, sauces etc i.e, homemade . They use high quality ingriedients and do not use artificial flavour.😃

Ambience -  Nice ambience though moderately spaced but with comfy seating arrangements, dim lighting , western music etc. The staffs are well trained and service was nice too.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting session and had the following - 

Refreshments - 

1)Lemongrass cooler – fresh lemongrass juice blended with lime , a fizzy and super refreshing drink.

2)Cucumber fizz – Well presented and a  very soothing drink 

3)Persian rose water – a perfect summer cooler prepared with classic rose water topped with Chia seeds , and is a perfect coolant and beauty drink.

4)Sparkling cranberry lemonade – Cranberry cooler topped with Chia seeds was again an another refreshing drink and a perfect coolant for summer.

5)Strawberry spritzer – Very refreshing drink.

Foods - 

1)Pulled cheesy garlic bread – home made garlic bread topped with imported mozzarella baked to a cheesy perfection and was served hot. This dish is highly recommended !!

2)Veggie blast pizza – Thin crust pizza  topped with different types of toppings like American corn, tomato, onion , bell pepper, olives and condiments. It was super yummy.

3)Verdure burger – a veg burger loaded with cheese, coleslaw, potato,mushroom, Brocolli,, bell pepper, olives etc . It was served with a dip and potato wedges and was yummy.

4)Creamy chicken burger –  chicken chunks topped with homemade sun dried tomatoes and served on a bed of lettuce was super yummy. It was served with crispy potato wedges and coleslaw. A must try !!

5)Chicken steak –Chicken fried steak is an American breaded cutlet dish consisting of a piece of steak coated with seasoned flour and pan-fried, served with sauteed veggies  & roasted potato wedges with pepper sauce. It was lip smacking and juicy.

6)The hash chicken steak –  chicken patty prepared with minced chicken , oven roasted  with sauteed veggies.It was served with mushroom sauce.It was soft and well prepared. A must try !!

Dessert :

1)Death by chocolate –  Dark chocolate cake & ice cream which was topped with chocolate sauce ,chocolate syrup,honey,nuts and whipped cream. Very enjoyable....!! My favourite...!!

2)Hot chocolate drink- yummy and chocolatey .

3)Cold chocolate – Again thick and chocolatey .

So don't miss this place , this is indeed a great pizza joint on town , spend quality time with your friends & family and relish.

Thanks to the management for their warm reception & hospitality.

Not a very big place but quite comfy for 4-5 people group. Interiors are good with mild lighting. Tried the unlimited pizza lunch buffet. Each pizza is of 6 inches. There were four choices of non-veg pizza out of which chicken and garlic pizza was the best. The pollo de brickwood was not at all good so was the complimentary iced tea. The serving was a bit slow as the pizza was being made in a wood-fired oven. Overall a good place to hangout.

First order in kolkatta, saw good reviews so decided to order in Brickwood, first o called them after placing order they assured about delivery, got delivery but once opened box I was dissapointed with collopsd pizza, second dissapointed with the taste , it's cold, I have to reheat with oven,
the pulled cheese garlic bread not impressed me it's average bread which become black because of over heat,it doesn't own any value for money 

Only good thing was coffee with reusable glass bottle, sure I will not repeat the order here

This restaurant used to be good, but not good any more. We visited this one last saturday We ordered Lemongrass Cooler, Roast Chicken Sausages and Chicken Cheese Burger. Lettuce served with sausages was not fresh. Burgers were totally tasteless, buns seemed to be at least couple of days old they were hard and cold. Even they also showed their carelessness. I asked them something and they served something else...when we told them all these problems their behavior was so weird that time...full off negligence. I think I will not visit this place again.

Ordered food from this road side shop and it was probably much much worse than road side food!
Food was delivered over an hour late.
Was as cold as a corpse, tasted worse than anything you might have ever had. Mushrooms on the pizza tasted like they've been plucked out of toxic waste and who's ever heard of a pizza with bones in the chicken!?

Hey
We visited Brickwood last night.Ordered a Three Bell Pepper Cilantro Pizza and your Signature Veg Verdure Burger along with a Heavenly serving of home made choco cake served with ice cream,forgetting the name of the desert.

Everything except the Burger was amazing.

I personally feel that the stuffing in the burger should have been fully loaded,as there was no patty .There is a dryness in the end because of the Bread and missing Patty.

I hope to get an improvised version next time.

Thanks

Brickwood is everything an ideal restaurant should be. I hardly write reviews, but this is something worth reviewing. Brickwood sets the bar and should be followed by other restaurants because of the following reasons : 
1) prices in menu is true reflection of the amount you need to pay, no scary inflation in prices due to taxes/ service charge blah blah. (All inclusive price menu)
2) No service charge and "no tipping expected" 
3) compliment filtered water without any condescending looks from the waiting staff( it's a small thing, but it makes the overall experience much better.
4) Excellent waiting staff. Kudos to the owner for paying  attention to these small details.
5) amazing authentic food. I kid you not, the best hot chocolate in town.

Keep it up. Will be visiting more often for sure.

I had been to Brickwood in the first week I had moved to Calcutta, a couple of months ago. While I had found the ambience lacking in certain respects, and the washroom facilities to be quite frankly deplorable, I had a positive culinary experience largely thanks to their Pulled Cheese Garlic Bread, which was excellent. 

Today, based on my past experience with the restaurant, I decided to opt for home delivery of the Pulled Cheese Garlic Bread. My friend and I were extremely disappointed with the dish. Not only was the bread burnt on the outside and rock hard, the garlic bread had hardly any garlic butter within it, and a few sorry lumps of cheese.

Arguably the most important characteristic of a restaurant is its consistency in quality. I would have been all right with receiving a lukewarm dish, given that I opted for home delivery, but to receive this poor excuse for Pulled Cheese Garlic Bread was just unacceptable. Pull your socks up, Brickwood, and start paying attention to your quality control.

Lamp pizza was superb. Very tasty. 🍕 r very different from which we usually taste in Domino's or pizza hut or similars. But the choco fudge cake was dubious. It's mentioned choco fudge made of pure white and dark chocolate, but what I got was a pink fudge ( I think it was red velvet ) with molten chocolate poured from above.
4.5 point to pizza
2.5 to choco fudge

24/5/17- 
I had ordered brickwood pizza and choco cake. I was so eager to taste other pizza s when I had lamb pizza last week. Today meal was total waste of money as well as taste buds.brickwood pizza was cold and hard. Choco fudge has awful smell of egg. I'm so disappointed. I won't even rate today's food. We couldn't even eat half of our stuff.

Ambiance: 3/5
Price: 3/5
Food: 3/5 (They serve authentic Italian, well this may be biased as it was not to my liking, but there's an extra brownie point for the Death By Chocolate)
Service: 4/5 (The ever smiling lady who took our order was very welcoming, sadly some dishes we wanted to order were unavailable, so 😕 )

#DeathByChocolate is literally to die for here. Hands down one of the best ones i've ever had.

Other dishes ordered were: 
#RedSaucePasta (pretty average), 
#VegPizza (below average) and #CheesyPulledGarlicBread is highly #Recommended as it's something new that i've never had before.

The food is actually bland and definitely needs to be worked upon.
(Update: The place is an authentic Italian Restaurant, so the food is supposed to be low on spices)

I have visited this place a couple of times just for the burgers they serve which i consider to be the best burgers in town.
The burgers they serve are huge with potato wedges and this creamy dip which is super tasty.
The ones that i have tried out here is the veg burger and the chicken burger.
Will visit this place again and again just for the burger they serve.
Its pocket friendly and worth the money spent.

A nice quaint little cafe. We ordered baked cheese potatoes, pizza, their lime cooler original and a hot coffee. Wood Fire Pizza and hot chocolate was really drool worthy. Special mention for hot chocolate with 55% cocoa, it is one of the best I had in the city and trust you me I have had a lotttt of them. Potatoes were good but a little on the greasier side. However, the lime cooler original was a sheer disappointment. Staff is courteous but the service is slow and the decor is on the average side.

Will go again for their pizza and hot chocolate only.

Well, although I enjoyed my visit here, the service and food were not living up to the hype.It's an open air pizzeria/eatery located  near Pantaloons. They also have proper seating arrangements but we chose to sit outside. You are allowed to smoke here which a plus point.My first issue is that they did not have cold drinks that day. Pizza without cold drinks sound like a terrible idea and this was a huge deterrent. They did however allow us to buy it from a nearby shop and consume on their premises.  We had Chicken Chermoulla and Napoli Lamb Pizza.The chicken chermoulli was a disaster even though the lady at the counter suggested it. It was dry, the pieces were  hard and the overall taste was terrible. Would not recommend.Now, the pizza on the other hand was delicious. Yes, it did take a little too long to serve, but the wait was worth it. It was spicy and the topping was generous. The pizzas here are to die for I had heard and the Napoli lamb pizza proved that.Would come here just for the pizzas and for a place to hangout at.But please improve on the mentioned points.

Nothing much to say about the decor, pretty basic. The pizzas are thin crust but not as great as the reviews claim. Nice cheese pull though. Very less quantity for the spaghetti. What stole my heart, however, was the BURGER. Jumbo burger with a thick, juicy patty and so creamy. Absolutely recommend it.

Just opposite camac street pantaloons and westside this small eatery has got a wide range of food to offer but mostly specialising in pizzas. 
The strawberry spritzer was average. Not that great. 
The pulled cheese bread was really yummy. But what really impressed me was the BRICKWOOD pizza. Soft, cheesy and damn yummy with that right amount of burnt flavour. 
Service was fast for the drinks and the appetiser. Pizza took a bit of time. Prices are tax inclusive. 
They also had a poster outside stating from monday to friday in the afternoon students can avail a discount of 15% but when i enquired they said its only for thursday and we went on a Friday . Weird. 
But will i visit again? Surely. 
Pizza lovers dont miss this.

Went to this place yesterday with friends. It has the tastiest pasta in town and there isn't a doubt in it. We ordered Penne Paprika. Their signature drink Lemongrass cooler was refreshing on a hot day. Pulled cheese garlic bread was the cheesiest garlic bread I ever had. We ordered a simple Margherita pizza which was ordinary. It was too thin and tasted a little bland.. But I will definitely visit the next time for the pasta.. Service of the staff was decent.

This place is near my office. Went their with a bunch of friends and we weren't disappointed. A small cozy place, we ordered:
Lemongrass cooler: very refreshing and cool. 
Pulled cheesy garlic bread : oh boy! Never ever I have had so much cheese at a time. Cheese lover inside me woke up as soon as I pulled out the first bite. So much cheese 😀😀
Moroccan chicken pizza : pizza was okay-ish. Although I liked the texture. 
Good Food.

Heard a lot about this place and after reading a lot of good reviews decided to visit. Located just opposite to pizza hut camac street, a  small joint with decent sitting arrangement. They even have an option of outdoor sitting. Coming to the food we ordered strawberry spritzers, pulled cheesy garlic bread, garlic and chicken pizza, velluto rosso fondant. Strawberry spritzer was okay, nothing extra ordinary. The pizza and the dessert was quite good bu the star was the pulled cheesy garlic bread. A must have all cheese lovers. I would love to go back and  have that again :P. The staffs can be a bit more attentive towards the guests.

The pizza was pretty good. But the service not so much. On zomato they say they are open till 12, when we called they said last order at 10:45, when we reached at 10:30 they said last order. They were on too much of a hurry to shut down. We ordered, and even before our pizza came they were wrapping up the other tables, even took away the umbrella there was over our table, yes the very table we were sitting at. And while moving their chairs and tables to shut down, they twice bumped into our seats. What a horrible dining experience.

Brickwood has everything in its kitty from an outdoor seating set-up to a small room and an extended mezzanine floor, a Brickwood oven(as the name suggests) and a specialised menu curated with Italian cuisine, but for some reason, not everything falls in its place.
We had the following-

Pulled Cheese Garlic Bread- Eye-catching. Loaded with heavy dose of cheese. Plain.

Ginger Beer- Paid Rs250 for an Imported Australian beverage which tastes nothing more than the Vicks Cough drops(ginger flavored) diluted in water.

Brickwood Pizza- I rarely vouch for thin crust pizzas but this baby was just fine. It comes with limited toppings but is definitely a "must try"

Spaghetti Aglio E Olio- Spicy. Didn't quite enjoyed the flavour.

To sum it up, the staff was very polite and warm. Food was good but not quite upto the mark as I had been planning to visit Brickwood for quite some time and the accumulated excitement took toll over me.
The prices are a bit high, but who would mind a few extra bucks for a sizzling Brickwood Pizza.

The cocoa milkshake was okay, tasted nothing more than the cocoa powder in milk (super basic stuff)! Small cute place one must visit to try out the garlic bread. It was mind blowing ! Loved the quantity of cheese in it.. yum yum yum 😊

The pizza's are wood fired and has a unique smoky flavour to it. Each of the ingredients taste was quite distinguishable unlike the usual pizzas which all tastes literally the same. We also had the Pasta arabiata in white sauce and it was lip smacking. Loved it. Apart from that we had creamy chicken burger which was also good. The staff were also  cooperative. Although the place it small, the space is quite well utilized by creating two floors and doesn't felel clumsy. Food was also served within 10-15mins. Overall it is quite a decent food joint to try out if you loved Italian food.

Wow, quite a change from the generic pizza places around the city and definitely a welcome one. We ate our way through a Margherita pizza which was just the right amount of crust, the right amount of acidity from the marinara and the combo of mozzarella with some sprinkle of fresh feta. The property is a small one so there's a slight wait for a table if you happen to be around during mealtimes.

We also tried the Cheesy Pull Apart Bread and I have to concede to

We ordered the most recommended pulled garlic cheese bread and it was simply delicious. The cheese is literally pulled as you slice and it's not rubbery as you'd fearfully expect. I could live on bread if it's this beauty.
The pizza was okayish. It was a chicken and garlic pizza, nothing fancy or as wowing as the bread. Taste is very subjective so depends on your preference for toppings.
The chicken and cheese burger was the iceberg that sunk the ship. It was not what I expected. The filling was not properly thought over. Patty was not what it should taste like. It was a let down after such a glorious starter.

Eating here comes with a bag of emotions. This is a rather small cafe experience, but it is pretty. Food is good.

 We had  the Loaded Cheesy Potatoes, which to be fair, was a bit bland. The cheese did not have a distinct taste to it, and I would have loved it had it been a little spicier. The dip that came with it imparted a nice taste to the roasted potatoes. 

The Pollo Di Brickwood pizza that was ordered next had a homely feeling to it. It had a good lip smacking taste thanks to the feta cheese, and the most surprising part of the pizza was its crust! I implore the Zomatians to try it out if you are near St. Xavier's College.

Went to this place for the third and the last time. Horrible service. Couldn't get us a simple pizza since 25 minutes. We were not even given a glass of water. The waiter's attitude needs to change.
When we asked for our order and said its been so long we got a reply from him sayin-"i know"
I mean what kind of a service is this?
Really disappointed.
Never coming back.

This cafe is small and cute. The drinks are not that good but food is good. Especially there pizza and garlic bread(which we tried). Their garlic bread is one of the best that I ever had in Kolkata, cheesy with crisp garlic bread.

Open air seating and wood fired pizzas make this place a perfect one!
For mind-melting wood fired pizzas, Brickwood definitely tops my list. They have this signature Brickwood pizza – go for this if you can’t choose. Other than that, they’ve got so much variety that you’ll be spoilt for choice!
They even have wood fired burgers!
If you're planning to go for something light, the herb crusted potatoes or the veg canneloni would be great choices.
Pocket pinch - around 600+tax for one.

Finally the concept of woodfired pizza is spreading, especially in Kolkata.
Brickwood is just bang opposite the 22, Camac street building, wood street side. 
The mushroom pizza is amazing, and the garlic bread and cheese is amazing. 

Food is good 
Service is good
A must try!

This place is located in Camac street..just next to wow momo. It has both inhouse and open seating arrangement.We ordered  chicken burger and chilled cocoa..well can't say that the food was extra ordinary or out of the world but it satisfied our taste buds decent enough. The entire menu looked promising but wud definitely like to try firewood pizza next time.

Visited this place on a weekday evening.  Located opposite Pizza Hut on Camac Street.  Small place but nice ambiance. We ordered Tomato Basil Soup,  which was served piping hot and was delicious. 
Next up was crostini and cheese potatoes.  Crostini was good potatoes average. Then we ordered Veg Burger and Pizza.  Burger was good but Pizza was excellent. Brick oven fired was thin with fresh toppings. Simply lived the Pizza. 
All in all a good experience

The place is very easy to locate, right beside Wow Momo opposite Pantaloons back gate. The place has limited seating options inside as well as outside.
I went to try their much hyped VELLUTO ROSSO FONDANT aka Red Velvet molten cake served with fresh bean vanilla ice cream. It looked nothing like the picture in the menu and taste was just horrible. The ice cream was little bit better than red velvet cake.
The service was very poor.

Brickwood is a congested place with great food and horrible service.

Located on wood street, Brickwood serves wood fired pizza claiming it to be their core. The place has few seats on ground floor beside the kitchen and few tables on the mezzanine. It's well lit and welcoming but feels congested inside. The staff is polite but it's a struggle to catch attention of a waiter if you sit upstairs and they don't care as such to check up on you by themselves. 

Coming to food, I thought prices were decent considering the food and portions. Pulled garlic cheese bread is a lovely sight but tastes average. Loved the aglio olio pizza which seemed innovative and was the star of my dinner here. Spaghetti aglio olio was decent too alongside a well prepared mojito.

I think this place to be a must try for pizza lovers.

This place can be easily located in Camac Street and one get to explore with the finest pizzas here. The inner ambience is decent however I would suggest to sit outside amidst the red seats and the red shades because they serve you really fast since their kitchen is outside whereas they forget customers sitting inside. Funny case! Moreover sitting outside can make you see them cook Live!!
If you are coke lover I would suggest to take bottomless coke since they refill your glass uncountable times. However Strawberry cooler can also be a good choice. It's very refreshing and soothing made with real strawberries.
I personally love thin crust pizza and I think they bake it best with lots of cheese and toppings without filling up the dough. Cheese garlic bread is a must order, it's not greasy and tastes splendid. What I dint like was the Mushroom platter since Mushrooms were not roasted well.
Staffs are welcoming, friendly and cooperating. They will sing song if it's your birthday, will bear with customers tantrums, click pictures for you with smile.
Thumbs-up for Brickwood 👍😊

An overpriced place for the given ambience, space and for the service they provide. Very poor service. Nobody cares to climb up the stairs to ask if a customer needs anything. The lemongrass cooler was pathetic contrary to the advice by zomato to order it bcz it's one of the best. The brickwork pizza also suggested by zomato was way too bad. Only the red velvet dessert lived up to the expectations nd the cannelloni was good.

Brickwood,the newly opened pizzeria located in 10 wood street,a casual dining resturant with sitting arrangements inside and outside.
At first we started with Strawberry Mojito and Elder Flower Iced Tea.Both were so refreshing.
After that Brickwood burger and Chicken cheese burger.Nicely cooked and both taste delisious.
Now it's time for pizza which is Brickwood's speciality.The signature dish - The Brickwood Pizza.Freashly made pizza blended with tomato sauce with mint and cilantro sauce.
We also had Four Pepper Cilantro and Pollo Fungi Cilantro.
Then the anather mouth watering dish - Chicken Meatball,topped with mozzarella cheese.
Last but not the least the dessert Velluto Rosso Fondant.The molten chocolate cake made by the ocean of pure chocolate.
A special thanks to Rajdeep Bhattacharya and Panchphoron for the invitation and thanks Shashank Arora for the wonderful hospitality.

The place is quite small but the food is really good. I ordered the spaghetti, the cheesy garlic bread, chicken meatballs and stuffed cheesy mushroom. All the dishes tastes amazing but they should take it down a bit with the cheese. The main problem was that it took a lot of time for every dish to come. I waited almost 20 minutes for the meatballs. The ambience can be better. I also ordered a pizza which had a smoky flavor (the wood oven). I ordered a lava cake as well and we got a complimentary panna cotta.

So was the pizza. Much better than the one opposite this restaurant.  Awesome cheesy garlic bread. Superb mojito.  A hidden treasure opposite 22 camac street! Keep it up !

I went there today for breakfast. Their menu had a breakfast platter option and it looked good and I thought to explore it. I wish I had not. I went there at around 11am. The restaurant was not yet fully open. When asked for will they open soon, there was an affirmative reply. But the staff told me they are not serving breakfast anymore as they are opening now a days at 10.30am. He didnt even bother to offer me any kind of substitution. And if they have ceased the breakfast menu, I wonder why it is still there on their menu in Zomato. Very bad customer handling skills.

Located next to Wow Momos opposite Pantaloons back gate. Bit congested.
Order-
Veggie Blast Pizza- It was good but felt there was nothing that special abt *woodfire* pizza.
Cannelloni- Recommended. Was really delicious and cheesy.
Cheesy garlic bread- Didn't taste as good as it looked. Would have been great had there been some filling along with cheese. 
Red Velvet Fondue- Absolutely amazing!! Don't think twice before ordering this. Did total justice to the hype it has created. 
Food overall is good but service is pathetic. The waiter forgot to get 2 orders, and on top of that those 2 orders were included in the final bill amount. Luckily, we checked the bill items and told the waiter of the mistake.

Brickwood, the newly opened pizzeria located in 10 Wood street, it’s a Casual dining restaurant with limited sitting arrangements inside and outside. It's open 8am to 11pm, every day. The restaurant offers authentic wood fired pizza.

The innings started with Strawberry Mojito and Elderflower Iced Tea. Both the beverages were really refreshing. 

After the beverages it’s time for burger and we had The Brickwood Burger and Chicken n Cheese Burger, served with  Potato wedges and creamy dip, nicely cooked and loaded with cheese and juicy chicken both taste just wow!!  

Now come to the pizza section for which Brickwood is famous. We had The Brickwood Pizza it’s the signature dish of Brickwood, freshly Made Pizza blended with Tomato Sauce with Mint and Cilantro sauce. Sundried Tomato, Black Olives and fresh Roquette leaves in toppings. We also had Four pepper Cilantro and Pollo Fungi Cilantro. Both pizzas were freshly toasted, nicely decorated and mouth-watering.

And then another mouth-watering preparation came, the Chicken Meatballs which was mixed in a tomato-cream sauce & topped with tons of mozzarella cheese.

In desserts we had Velluto Rosso Fondan. It’s the Molten Chocolate cake made by 55% pure chocolate just made my day. One piece of cake inundated you the river of chocolate flow.

If you really need to taste the authentic Italian food like pizza, pasta etc. this the place you want to be. A plentiful menu items made with quality and imported (most of them) ingredients. The staffs are courteous and pretty helpful. A perfect place for hangout with friends and family. 

A special thanks to

Gist : A average sized place with good crispy thin crust pizza, pricing are good w.r.t. quantity and great w.r.t. quality (ingredients are imported).

I visited this place on 22.1.17 at 11.00AM. Easy to locate. Place has outdoor seating option (4*4) & inside they having two floors to seat (Ground Floor- 4*2, 1st Floor 4*3) but of average size. They do have a toilet but that is outside also. No washbasin is there but they offer hand sanitizer which is good. Staff are cordial but should us help better to select items. Ordered Pollo Di Brickwood, Pollo Fungi Cilantro, Stuffed Mushroom. W.r.t. preparating time serving time is good. All items tasted good even when this is the first time for me to have thin crust pizza. Stuffed mushroom felt great. Great experience overall.

Went there yesterday. Located just opposite pizza hut in camac street. 
This place has a wood fire oven in which the pizzas are cooked. i was very eager to try their pizzas. 

We ordered misto di pollo: a thin crust pizza loaded with chicken sausages, sundried tomato pesto and roasted chicken. It was yummy though nothing extraordinary. We had no option to choose the size of the pizza or the crust. Which i think should be included in the menu.

Strawberry mojito: mojito was nicely made. Served chilled. Had a few berry slices. Must try for berry lovers.

Chicken steak with cilantro crème: it was a decent piece of steak. The chicken was tough but tasted okay. Vegetables were crunchy.  The crème was again decent. 

Service was a little delayed, even though there wasn't too much crowd. I also found the place a little overpriced. Don't know if i would visit again.

"There’s no better feeling in the world than a warm pizza box on your lap" - Kevin James 

Casual dining restaurant and pizzeria offering seasonal, all-natural menu items made with quality ingredients, for lunch, dinner and sometimes Sunday Special BBQ. It has created a plentiful menu that blends classic Italian favorites like sharable appetizers, bountiful salads, house made pasta dishes, and hand-tossed pizzas made in wood oven. A small outlet with limited seating options outside surrounded by few big giants in competition. The staffs are courteous and pretty helpful. Now let's come to Hunger Zone and have a ride.

Beverages :
Strawberry Mojito - The classic Mojito with real Strawberry slices.
Elderflower Iced Tea - A new kid on the block. A winter iced tea perfectly balanced with Elderberry Syrup.

Both the beverages were really refreshing. Presentation was pretty cool.

Burger :
The Brickwood Burger - Sun dried Tomato Marinated chicken with Roquette leaves and Feta Cheese. Cooked with love, served with Potato wedges and creamy dip.
Chicken n Cheese Burger - Thumbs up to this juicy chicken burger loaded with lots of yummy cheese. Served with roasted potato wedges and coleslaw.

Appetizers :
Pollo Piccante - Chicken Chunks marinated in fire roasted tomatoes topped with Arugula and Feta. A Mouthwatering preperations.
Stuffed Mushrooms - One more new kid on the block. Had an yummy mushroom dish after long time. Fresh mushrooms blended with premium cheese. Served hot with love.

Pasta :
Penne Paprika - Another new kid on the block. Penne Pasta in Paprika sauce with perfect balance of smoke and spice. A really amazing experience of creamy yummy pasta.
Creamy Corn & Spinach Cannelloni - Famous dish from kitchen. Made with homemade pasta. Filled with cheesy mix of corn and spinach. Baked with Tomato sauce and topped with premium mozzarella.
Pizza :
The Brickwood Pizza - Signature dish and the hot favorite for the Foodies. Freshly Made Pizza blended with Tomato Sauce with Mint and Cilantro. Sundried Tomato , Black Olives and fresh Roquette leaves in toppings. An wining combo really made our day.
Four pepper Cilantro - Freshly toasted pizza with Cilantro sauce. Decked with Tri-Coloured peppers and Jalapeno. A colourful pizza with lot to deliver for the Tickling stomach.
Pollo Fungi Cilantro - Crunchy Pizza, Cilantro Sauce blended with oven roasted Tomato Sauce with topping of Chicken and Mushroom all over it.

Carne :
Chicken Meatballs - It is time for All meat. Extra juicy Chicken Meatballs just freshness overloaded in every bite. So soft and tender hard to fork them. Baked in fresh tomato sauce and cheese. Served with a slice of Burn Butter Toast.

Desserts :
Velluto Rosso Fondant - A beauty served on plate. Amazing colour and twist of imagination. Very much their recipe and concept. Red Velvet molten cake served with Vanilla Ice cream. Dig it out of the cover.

Perfect pizzas. Quite a variety. They don't need to advertise. 
The creative combination of tastes along with a super thin and tasty crust combine for wonderful dining experience.
In a world of fast cheap cardboard pizza places, this Wood Fired pizza is a welcomed change. This place is great!!

Thanks Rajdeep Bhattacharjee for the invitation.
Thanks Shashank Arora for the wonderful hospitality.

Good place to have different PIZZA, different in terms of usual taste and presentation. Had a burger, PIZZA and unlimited Coke and a Virgin Mojito. Food was OK but it was different than the conventional PIZZA joints like Dominos & Pizza Hut. But I was expecting more, had similar wood fire PIZZA at Pondichery & Goa, they were better. But this was one good to. Overall happy to taste something different.

The perfect place for a winter lunch or supper. Lovely outdoor seating makes it worth it to just sit and chat while you enjoy the thin crust brickwood pizzas. The restaurant interior is cozy as well. The staff is very cheerful and give great suggestions while selecting the menu. They have a lovely breakfast menu which I am yet to try. The hot chocolate is super..Not at all jaggery sweet unlike most places. Pizzas are great with generous portions. Pricing is just fine. Have had 4 visits till date. Waiting to try the burgers next!😋

The outlet though small with some limited seating options outside and inside gives competition to nearby top 2 giants. The staff is courteous and helpfull. Just loved everything we ordered from pulled cheesey garlic bread to pizza. Pulled cheesy garlic bread just expand with cheese with every pull. Orderd their signature pizza 'The brickwood' which was unique in itself and not like any other pizza I have ever had.

Comming to the drinks yuzu elderf flower cooler was good but lemon grass cooler stole the show. Was even offered a complimentary desert which was also decent.

Went there yesterday. Located just opposite pizza hut in camac street. 
This place has a wood fire oven in which the pizzas are cooked. i was very eager to try their pizzas. 

We ordered misto di pollo: a thin crust pizza loaded with chicken sausages, sundried tomato pesto and roasted chicken. It was yummy though nothing extraordinary. We had no option to choose the size of the pizza or the crust. Which i think should be included in the menu.

Strawberry mojito: mojito was nicely made. Served chilled. Had a few berry slices. Must try for berry lovers.

Chicken steak with cilantro crème: it was a decent piece of steak. The chicken was tough but tasted okay. Vegetables were crunchy.  The crème was again decent.

For long i had been searching for a decent place that serves real american style burgers and the nught ordered from brickwood, i realised that i had found the right place! The burger was amazing and so was the apple crumble pie. The best part is the cost of food here. Its very very budget friendly, wont burn the pocket. They have kept the prices really cheap compared to the quality and quantity of food they serve. They are doing a great job! Highly recommended...especially for burger lovers..

Loaded potatoes was nothing great. One can try the pulled cheesy garlic bread. The outside seating arrangement is good. The staff is courteous. :)

A few days ago we were approached by Brickwood co-owner Mr. Shashank Arora, who had asked us whether we would be interested in coming down to their outlet some day and taste some of their specialties.. And without much reluctance we agreed to his invite as we were eager to visit this place ourselves.

I absolutely loved the place.The best thing was the
 customer service and satisfaction that one gets.The pizza was crisp,equally cheesy and full of veggies as suggested.The White Penne pasta was juicy and creamy.The only disappointment was the Cold Chocolate that tasted like milk mixed with bournvita.


Well guys I am about to share my experience in the third visit and I want to label it as best of my life.The hospitality, the dessert and the buffet options are amazing. I loved the girl who served us,she knew a lot about the menu and helped us enjoy to the fullest.That is why I have increased my rating to 5.

I liked the open air sitting , perfect for winter days to enjoy some thin crust pizzas ,mocktails and smoke. The ground floor houses the kitchen and two tables for four indoor , seating option is extended to the mezzaine floor as well.

Mixed experience as far as food is concerned.

Ordered one POLLO PICCANTA , it was one oversalted dish, enough to get discarded , we got our portions served and just after the first bite i complained, the server said he could have replaced the dish if undistributed. That makes a point to sample a spoonfull before sharing the dish , i am sorry to say this was the stupidest excuse i have ever heard . He went to the kitchen asking "arrey kitna namak dala" and gave us a 200ml coke complimentary for three of us which supposedly meant eat that anyhow ! Coming to the dish completely sunk under gigantic argula leaves , the portion was so meagre.

The PULLED CHEESY GARLIC BREAD was a bun loaded with lots of molten cheese. Nothing beyond this.

The LEMONGRASS COOLER was a refreshing drink.

We ordered a POLLO DI BRICKWOOD pizza , while they cleared our starter plates , which they didnot take note of , after like 40 minutes on enquiry we had to reorder. The pizza was one real good stuff, perfectly baked thin crust loaded with toppings as promised , overloaded and infact entirely covered with bunch of roquete leaves which was unexpected. If you are here at brickwood , better stick to pizzas thats what i personally recommend.

Before even starting our meal, i asked the staff if the red velvet fondant was available as i would be ordering one at the end , i so wanted to try this and made sure they don't run out of it. So finally when i asked for it , the server gave another dumb reply , whichever dessert you order will take more than half an hour . Why? Just with half of the tables occupied !!

Had to skip it. The manager arrived while paying , he asked me how the food was , before i could say anything he said to convey through whatsapp or facebook . So courteous indeed!
I eat ,i pay and in case i have a complain, i have to whatsapp them again , i mean why would i have to put so much of labour? If one manager can't look after, hire another.

Throughout the entire duration , i noticed the Staff had such a cold behavior and laid back attitude. Though nowhere near to a full house, they took a lot of time to deliver each course. They attend you only when u give them a call, that too it was difficult to grab an attention of any one of them . The rating goes down for the service at brickwood. Very dissapointed.

If its pizza it has to be baked in wood fired oven if you belive in it as well then this is the place to be...

They have some great variety of pizza and other mains in their menu, something for everyones liking... Had tried their Roast chicken trio, pulled cheesy garlic bread, pollo fungi cilantro, fresco and the brickwood pizza...

Their pulled cheesy garlic bread is a speciality something which you would not have tried anywhere else and a must try...

The pizza out here are amazing and obviously brownie points for it being cooked in wood fired owen...

The roast chicken trio was not that great it was just roasted chicken tossed with some veggies, the sauce and use of spices in the cooking was not adequate...

A must go place for any pizza lover, and a must try place for someone who has never had wood fired owen pizza...

Had a really bad experience here. Ordered one of their Brickwood special pizzas, and the waiter served it in literally 4 minutes! The pizza seemed reheated (we've all reheated dominos, and we know the difference between a fresh pizza and a reheated one) Upon asking him how could a wood fired pizza be prepared in just four minutes, he mumbled that "orders are running". Upon asking again, he replied that it was someone else's order which got cancelled. This made me furious. We got the order changed. 

We then had Penne Paprika which was very average, a four cheese pizza which was a letdown. Even the famed pulled cheese garlic bread seemed reheated, not fresh. The ambience is..not much, because they don't have much space. Only saving grace, perhaps, was the Cold Cocoa which was well done.

Disappointed.

I think any new ordinary place in Kolkata that has something different about it gets extremely over hyped for the first year, after that it gets SHUT!! Same is more than true for Brickwood! From ambience to service to servicemen to food quality to pricing, everything is pathetic about the place.

Service:-
I went there yesterday with my family and sat upstairs. Nobody attended until my wife went down to call after 10 minutes of sitting patiently! We were then handed over a form to choose the items required, just shows it is understaffed and they feel a form can be a substitute for a waiter. The form was incomplete as it did not have an option to put down the vegetables for the pasta as it comes without anything apart from the spaghetti and sauce. The  staff were unaware of preparations and said they are just servicemen and can't help about quality, shortage of staff etc.

2. Food quality : The place has limited options for food as it is a pretty small cafe. However, they did not have the Small Pizza nor the 3 ingredients for the Verdure  Pizza that they have on the Menu. They substituted the ingredients on their own without informing!
They have a Bottomless Coke where they serve unlimited Coke without share, but that is discouraged by their waiters by saying it lacks Fizz in order to promote their other cocktails which are served in plastic glass !! 

3. Pricing: Most of the main courses are priced around Rs.400, extremely high for the portion Size and quality of food. The pizza looked as if it would have costed them 20 bucks for which they are charging 400 bucks, 20x ??

4. Portion Size: If you have a decent appetite, it would cost you about 800 bucks per head easily as the portion Size is pretty minimal.

BOTTOMLINE: The owner, Mr
Siddharth to whom I talked to over the phone after the meal, has just put a fancy pizza warming brick dome and feels he can continue charging a Super Premium for very average food. Should not cost more than 500 for 2 for meals at such places! 

Kolkata people are generally very tolerating towards poor service and attitude and hence such places continue to last longer than they should!!

Brickwood is a pizza joint located across Pizza Hut beside Wow Momo on Camac street. We had heard so much about their pizzas and garlic breads that we decided to go and try it out. We were 7 and went there on a weekday. We were not quite happy with the little seating area they have. We decided to sit on the mezzanine floor and things were not very comfortable. We decided to start with a couple of beverages which they suggested. One was a ginger beer from Australia and the other was some lemonade from France. Both were just okay and there wasn't anything special about them. We then decided to start with Tuscan roasted potatoes and cheesy garlic bread. Roasted potatoes were not at all good. It hardly had any Tuscan flavour. Cheesy garlic bread was superbly amazing - the whole thing was cooked so perfectly that it just melted in the mouth. We decided to try one of their wood fired pizzas as well. They suggested to for their signature dish - The Brickwood pizza. Again a letdown compared to the expectations I had visited this place with. May be will go another time and try out their other pizzas. 3/5 only for their hospitality, quick service and garlic bread.

Got to know about this place from one of the friend and so finally tried there pizza. There interiors are good and time which they took was quick to serve out food. Ordered garlic bread ,some drinks and four cheese pizza. Garlic bread was okayish, drink could have been better and moving to pizza it was very salty which made it inedible and not that cheesy. My rating is only for there ambiance and a bit quickness in there service. They don't have that many varieties of pizza topng in veg and since vegetarian can't comment on non veg options.

I have been to many eateries near camac Street but never came across this small continental joint at wood Street. My friend had heard about this place and urged me to visit the same. They seem to have definitely taken the name too seriously as the first thing that catches your attention is the brick wall. The place is really small but they have the option of outdoor dining. We had ordered Pollo di brickwood, roasted rosemary chicken, chicken and spinach casselloni, limegrass cooler and cookie sundae. Well, the order may seem a bit monstrous but the portions are a bit small and we had gone for lunch. But kudos to the staff for the fantastic plating! I would add an extra 0.5 just for the plating. I hated myself for ruining the decoration to satiate my taste bud!! Coming to the food I was not very impressed with the pizza, but the casselloni simply blew me over. The dessert was also great. This place is a must try for all.

Being on my go-to list for quite a long, finally went to this place to have a breakfast. Two floors, modest seating capacity and decent interiors. They have an open kitchen. Service was a bit slow as they were the same people who were cooking and also serving. We ordered virgin mojito, hot chocolate and latte. Mojito was very average. Latte was good. Hot chocolate was   above all, thick and creamy and not so sweet. We ordered the oven toasted sandwich with pesto mayo, which was nice in taste but the breads were too hard and crisp rusks, which is not something I would drool for in a sandwich. Waffles with honey and chocolate sauce was good. Pulled cheesy garlic bread was amazing. Spaghetti in cilantro creme was something very different and I liked this unconventional flavour. And at the last, the pizza. We ordered for pizza verdure with added golden corn which was good. Properly flattened and evenly cooked. Pizza gets a thumbs up.

Tried the Pollo di Brickwood, which is a specialty here. Chicken, feta and roquette. Tasted amazing! It's a self help restaurant and serves authentic Italian cuisine. Next time shall have more of the food. And the location is very good too, right opposite 22 Camac Street - Wood Street opening.

Bad food.
Coffee felt like water and pizza was burnt.
Cheese of the pizza felt like it was rotten, it had a smell to it and the whole crust was jet black.

Absolutely lovely pizzas here. It is a small outlet, a 20-25 odd seater on the ground and mezzanine floors. The only restaurant which serves rolls out pizzas from a wood fired oven, their pizzas are pretty good. Thin crust with excellent toppings. 
The highlight of the evening was pulled cheese garlic bread. We pulled the cheese for good. 
Drinks didn't make it that far. They didn't taste that good. They've this awesome ginger beer from Australia. Try it. It's superb. 
Good place to hangout.

Was there today to grab a quick bite as I was intrigued to try it being the first wood fried pizza joint in Kolkata. I ordered their speciality "Red Brickwood" pizza and the mojito. It was toasted to perfection and tasted remarkbly well, although the price was a little on the higher side. Morever I was waited on well and their breakfast menu within a formidable range is really making me want to go there and try it out asap. Will surely be there and try an expand to Sector V.

I had the quaddro formaggi pizza and the pulled cheese garlic bread. Both were okay. The pizza was not as thin as I had expected and was quite salty. It was a four cheese pizza and had feta also in it and it was saltier than expected. Coming to the garlic bread, there was too much cheese and the flavour of garlic was hardly noticeable. Hopefully , the next time the pizza will be good.

Tiny joint opposite to Pizza Hut. Was on my wish list how some time. Visited on a Monday evening and ordered a pull apart cheesy garlic bread and brickwood pizza. I was informed that brickwood is not available. It was a bit surprising because it is their signature pizza. Ordered a fungi pizza. The garlic bread was cheesy enough but lacked taste. The pizza was decent. Two of us were unable to finish the food ordered so got it packed. The portion size was good. Overall an average experience.

Had been to this place yesterday after having heard a lot about it's fire wood hand rolled pizzas. And it pretty much lived up to it's expectations. We'd ordered the pulled cheesy garlic bread, Pollo di brickwood chicken Pizza and a spaghetti pasta in mixed sauce and a cookie sundae. The garlic bread was really cheesy and tasted good. The thin crust pizza was also very yummy with chunks of chicken in almost every bite. The dessert was very creamy and the cookie very tasty.
The only disappointment was the pasta which was firstly prepared in red sauce and not mixed as ordered. And secondly there was a weird herb taste which was not at all pleasing to the taste buds.
But overall, my experience was really nice. I'd recommend people to go visit this place.

Brick wood is right opposite my house. I have visited it 2-3 times. Their pizzas are good. But I didn't like their pastas. Tried the spaghetti in red pesto, it wasn't good at all. It was bland and was drenched in butter. I also had the lemon grass cooler, it tasted great at first but after a few sips I couldn't drink it anymore. Moreover I find the place very pricy for the quality of food they serve.

Location-opposite pantaloons backgate,camac street.

This place had been in my wishlist since it opened.Its a newly established pizza joint which serves wood-fired hand-rolled pizza.On sides they serve garlic bread,pasta,dessert and many more dishes.They had sitting area of two storey as well as outside the restaurant.And all the preparation for the dishes are made in front of your eyes.

AMBIANCE-This place has got a soothing and calm ambiance.The interirs are good and Its a place where you can visit with your family as well as friends.

SERVICE-The service is commendable at this place.The working staff is very friendly and guides you very well to choose the right dish.And the food service is very fast.

FOOD-The main part which cover other faults(if any) of any food place.This place has got mouth watering food.The smell of the wood fire in almost every dish is like an "icing on the cake".We had-

1.Pulled cheesy garlic bread-Just got an excellent taste,and presentation was also excellent.

2.Verdure pizza-Had a regular size of this pizza and taste was very good.

3.Velluto rosso fondant-Their speciality in dessert.This dessert will not be liked by every one as it has a very different taste.But is a must try.

Service-5/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Food-4.5/5

This place is a must visit and one must try its pulled cheesy garlic bread.☺☺

Brickwood please pull up your socks!! You guys started off soooo well 😃 and then you became complacent and started slipping 😑
I kept coming back for the Quattro Fromaggi pizza, out of this world pizza!
Today a friend and I dropped in for lunch again and swore never to come back 😥
We ordered the oven roasted chicken sausage, the description was so delicious - we salivated, but what came was shocking! 8 tiny pieces of a dry sausage with an overdose of spices...
Then we ordered the Misto di Carne pizza, the bad run continued, there were barely any toppings and it was unbelievably bland....
Cmon guys, you can do better... Please!!

Probably the best affordable Wood-fired pizza in town with authentic Feta cheese. And they give bottomless coke. Also tried a Chicken side dish which they will make it into a salad if you need. 
Be prepared for the pizza to take some time to prepare as its wood fired...but closest to Italian that you can get in these parts.
Its bang opposite Pizza Hut of Camac Street and it's miles ahead in taste. 
Got to check out the break fast next time.

Strive your weekday blues by visiting this interesting pizzeria located in Camac Street , right opposite Pantaloons.Its a pizzeria that serves wook fired pizzas along with other delicious side dishes as well.Its a must visit place for all the pizza lovers and for all of them who are bored of Dominoes and Pizza hut pizzas..

It has indoor and outdoor seating arrangements and is a small cosy joint which has efficient service , well mannered staff and  food is reasonable priced.

The ambience is quiet unique specially the  brick looked walls and the wooden plates served as the dinner plate.As soon as you enter, you would find an open area kitchen with a colourful attractive wooden oven for pizzas.

The food is well cooked and delicious and is  totally worth the price charged.We ordered for the pulled cheesy garlic bread which was extremely delicious and well cooked and very fluffy and cheesy .You surely would’nt just resist one plate if you are good number of people.


We then quickly ordered for the special Brickwood Pizzas which was the signature dish of the house.It was well baked and the crust was finely thin and crisp.All the toppings looked fresh and feta cheese surely made it taste even better…yes, I do love feta cheese…..It makes me have my pizzas with more and more love…This pizza is like a must mustt dish to order…You just cannot miss this dish!

 freshly baked topped with feta cheese and roquette leaves Brickwood Pizzza
 

The last sumptous addition in our meal was creamy corn and spinach Canneloni which was another house speciality dish and was well baked .The portion is sufficient for two to  three  people .The dish was creamy and well baked.


As you would surely need some drinks with this kinda food, we tried something new and ordered for Ginger beer which was non alcoholic and Lemongrass cooler which was surely the drink of the night.

Both the drinks were worth trying.Ginger Beer was quiet soothing and lemon grass cooler was perfect soda based drink.

My meal just cant get over without deserts , specially when the desert menu looks so tempting.We ordered for Nutella Creme crumble .It is a must order dish for all Nutella Lovers.I simply love Nutella and I can team it up with any thing and everything.This sweet dish was worth trying and added perfect sweetness to our taste buds.It was a perfect blend of crumbles with the sweetness of Nutella.I am surely going for this dish again….

 

We were told that Red velvet  fondant is the signature dish of the pizzeria but was unfortunately not available so could not taste it.The description of the desert looked quiet good and is in my menu list in my next visit soon!
 

I am sure all the pizzas looked good and you can try any of the dishes if you love italian kinda food.

Get your weekdays interesting and bump into this place soon.

Mark it, this place shuts by 10-10.30 so get in early so that you sit for long and try as many dishes possible.

One word for this place : FABULOUS!! 
This is a wonderful place situated Opposite the Pizza Hut on Camac Street. It's a small place with indoor as well as outdoor seating. I was lucky to sit beside the window which was really comfortable and cozy. The ambience is really warm and is an epitome of simplicity. I felt like I was in a whole different quiet corner of the world where there is good music (felt like I was in Italy) and peace and quiet. 

Coming to the food, I ordered the Lemongrass Cooler, Misto di Carne and Velluto Rosso Fondant. 

The Lemongrass Cooler was really refreshing and made me feel really good. It was really well made with the right amount of sweetness. 

The Pizza was phenomenal. There were 8 slices of perfect thin crust pizza with lots of chicken and balsamic lamb and cheese. The price of just Rs 300 was completely justified! 

The Fondant was the star of the meal! It was absolutely beautiful! There was oozing red deliciousness from the first slice! The Vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect accompaniment. 

The food served here is of top notch quality. The ambience was simply perfect as far as I am concerned. I have fallen in love with this place and am sure I will be back soon. 

I strongly recommend this place to all of you! Do not miss out on this beautiful experience! 

Happy Dining!

While other pizzerias are the conventional overly marketed food chains, Brickwood overshines them with their authentic Italian flavour and fire oven taste.

This is a new pizza joint in the city with an absolutely innovative concept of fire wood pizza. This place is a paradise for pizza lovers. As the name suggests, the décor of this pizzeria is pretty cool with bricks on the walls, dim lights and lovely music at the backdrop. Nearest landmark of this joint would be pantaloons. Coming to their menu they do have a wide range of choices. We had ordered lemon grass cooler, pollo con mais pizza and velluto rosso fondant. Each and every dish of this joint has amazed me. Velluto rosso fondant is a must try guys.

Brickwood, the first fire wood pizza to arrive in Kolkata, has contributed to the already massive evolution in the city's food scene. While other pizzerias are the conventional overly marketed food chains, Brickwood overshines them with their authentic Italian flavour and fire oven taste.

Located on Wood Street is a small place in red and white called Brickwood. Camac Street's West Side and Pantaloons would act as perfect landmarks to pinpoint your destination.

Brickwood has three sets of sitting arrangement. While there is an outside eatery section that gives you a view of a busy street, there are sitting arrangements inside too. The downstairs section is small adjusting only two tables, giving a sighting of an open kitchen, the upstairs section is no less either. The café on a busy day can adjust fifty people at a time. With red bricks working as the design of the wall, and high ceiling with hanging LED lights, Brickwood takes us to the aromatic lanes of Posillipo. In addition to this, the selection of Italian playlist also adds to the mood.

Coming down to business, Brickwood has some delicious range of pizzas. But the good news don't stop here. Their breakfast menu has a selection of beautiful items that each costs 100 bucks (inclusive of all taxes).

*Oven Baked Omelette with Any Two Toppings Served with One Piece Toasted Bread: A golden yellow omelette served with toppings of your choice (I chose mushrooms and chicken) complimented with a toast. Omelette here is deliciously light and fluffy, with minimal spices. (3/5)

*Pollo Con Mais: Hand tossed pizza, oven baked to perfection. The thinnest of crusts with spicy chicken sausages, mind you, they were not much spicy; and corn. The corn added a fun pop of subtle sweetness to the already protein packed, savory item. But what must not be overlooked at any cost is the beautiful stringy cheese. You won't get pizzas like this in your excessively commercialized pizzeria chains. The cheese adds an extra one point to Pollo Con Mais. (3.5/5)

*Baked on Toast with Creamy Mushroom: Served in a baking pan, this toast is everything you'd want it to be. Thick, stringy, creamy cheese topped on a crunchy toast with deliciously baked mushrooms. Again, minimal spices which brings authenticity to the dish. (3/5)

Brickwood with its promise of authentic Italian wood fire oven baked pizzas was on my wishlist for a long long time. When I finally managed to visit this place the other day it certainly did not disappoint.

Located on the back side of Camac street Pantaloons in one of the posh areas of the city Brickwood definitely offers something classy. The place though rather small is divided into three sections. One outdoors and two indoor sections in two floors. The wood fire oven used for baking the pizzas is adjacent to the outdoor seating area and the section on the ground floor. The idea of getting to see your food getting ready is an interesting and popular one too. But in spite of this we seated ourselves in the section on the first floor which was more like a traditional quaint restaurant.

Since we had come mainly for their signature thin crust wood fire oven baked pizzas, we ordered two regular size pizzas. My friend ordered the Pollo Di Brickwood while I settled for the Pollo Fungi Cilantro. Both the pizzas arrived in decent time. They were both extremely well made and the crust incredibly thin. The toppings were generous in amount and one could make out that the ingredients used were really fresh. The quality of the cheese used was top notch. The dollop of feta cheese on the Pollo Di Brickwood deserves a special mention. We were both satisfied and for that matter full with our respective regular size pizzas. I had the Lemongrass cooler along with my pizza and it was nice and refreshing too.

The staff was nice and cordial. The service was quite swift. The prices I felt were nice and reasonable considering the quality and also the fact that many more popular pizza joints charge more for much inferior quality stuff. 

All in all we were really satisfied with our meal here and I look forward to visiting this place again to try the other options in their menu. I was also informed by the staff that they have an attractive offer running for breakfast at 100 bucks which again I would look to avail some time soon. I hope they keep up the good work.
Enjoy! 
Cheers! :)

This place is located in the lane just behind the Camac Street Pantaloons. We had ordered Misto Di Pollo pizza. It was good,loaded with chicken but the center of the the pizza was too soft because of which while taking a slice of the pizza, the toppings were falling down. Apart from that the taste was good. We had also ordered Chilled Cocoa and Lemongrass Cooler which was pretty decent. I liked the brick effect on their walls. A bit of improvement is needed, not much and please increase the variety of the beverages. Overall it was a good experience :)

Saturday afternoon- needed a quick filling lunch and we entered brickwood. The ground floor is cosy with the brick wall background overlooking the kitchen. Loved the mezzanine menu cards and the kitsch work on the grill. We moved upstairs after ordering. 
Order- Regular sized Fresco pizza. 
The pizza was AMAZING.
Fully loaded with veggies, the pizza came out real quick. Evenly baked, it was wonderfully cheesy and it didn't overpower the freshness of the veggies. Really enjoyed! 
Plus point- the prices on the menu are inclusive of all taxes. What you see is what you pay!

This has to probably be one of the most awaited visits of mine and needless to mention I had a lot of expectations. The place is quaint and very well-decorated and a simple yet smart way of placing the orders was one of the many things that stood out. 
 Coming to the food, they delivered what they promised - delicious wood-fired pizzas. We ordered the Misto di Pollo and Balsamic Lamb pizzas and the Velluto Rosso Fondant and Duo Choco Cake Sundae for desserts. The pizzas were delicious with a thin yet not overly crisp crust and ample toppings loaded with cheese. The Misto di Pollo would have to be the better of the two.
 The desserts were presented beautifully and were rich and decadent when tasted along with the ice cream that provided a relief to the overriding sweetness. However in general, both the fondant and the duo choco cake missed the mark for being a bit too sweet for the palate. Would be expecting better desserts the next time around.

A much delayed visit to this cosy little Italian restaurant did not disappoint one bit. We had the pulled cheesy garlic bread which lived to it's name and is definitely something i would order again! The spaghetti in a pomodoro sauce was perfectly cooked pasta... Al dente.. The way pasta is meant to be.. And the sauce was great as well. We tried 2 pizzas.. The Brickwood and Fungi. While both were great,  i preferred the Brickwood so if you love rocket and feta that's the one you should order. Desserts i would suggest order the velluto rosso fondant which is a red velvet bomb in simpler words.. Crusty outer with a liquid centre without being overly sweet.  The duo chocolate cake can be given a miss as it was too sweet for our liking! All in all.. A place to be frequented, with good food and service.

This is a cozy place. Right behind the camac street pantaloons. Has both open air and conditioned sitting arrangements. 

Coming to the food, it's freshly prepared. Their pizza deserves a special mention for its authentic taste due to the wood baking process. All baked items are prepared on a brick oven with wood fire. Traditional style baking. The serving time is pretty quick. 
The taste is satisfactory. There won't be much to complain about regarding the food or drink. 

The cost is reasonable. some items are mildly expensive. 

The overall experience is well enjoyable.

Stationed in one of the posh corners of a Camac Street lane, Brickwood delivers what it promises : really tasty, thin crust, wood fire baked pizza. There is an outdoor eating arrangement, and two on the inside (one on each floor). The service is fast and the prices are inclusive of taxes.  Literally all the pizzas on the menu are worth trying. The standard mocktails, breads,  pastas and desserts abound too but pizza is what you will go there for. And it won't disappoint.

Had visited brickwood when this place had opened a few months back. The idea of fire oven pizzas is relatively new in the city and only high end pizzerias use this technique of baking a pie.
So with a fresh concept, this place was a sure shot hit. But wait, not for me.
6 college friends were meeting for our monthly Adda session, so we chose thus place.
The restaurant looks very good from the outside and inside with decent interiors. The kitchen is out in the front deck and looks straight out of an american pizzeria.
The place is divided in three seating sections- the outside foyer, inside seating which was too compact and the first level seating which is relatively better and we settled for it.
I had already prechecked the menu for suggestions so we went for their garlic bread since it is seemed interesting ti try pullout ones.
What came was disappointing. It was so small that it wasn't sufficient for one. So we naturally ordered 2 more portions if the same side:/ it tasted decent.
The pizza we ordered was their "brickwood" and it seemed to be pretty decent in taste but the size was disappointing. Again 2 orders were repeated.
We had a spinach cannelloni which was not very good. I have had much better ones from non-authentic places even. Again 2 each of the cannelloni came.
The servers only serve once.

Naturally we paid more than we had thought and didn't feel quite content with our growling tummy nor taste buds.
We headed over to a nearby cafe to finish an unfinished business with our tummies.

Since, then I have avoided this place and do not recommend it at the moment. Ps- no pics since I was disappointed with the experience.

We went for lunch today. The service left lot to be desired. We were only customers and yet once seated we didn't get glasses for water, plates and napkins until we reminded them twice. For the cheque, we had to almost ask 4 times. Quite disappointed with service

Brickwood offers the most needed thin crusted wood oven baked pizzas to Calcutta. A nice cozy place for those evening hangouts with friends. Lovely wood oven baked pizzas and cheesy garlic breads and freshly baked cakes with ice cream to end it all. Brickwood is definitely a thumbs up. Quality of food is really nice, staffs are cooperative.. you can sit here for hours!

Have visited Brickwood 3-4 times in the last couple of months. Like the nice cosy setting and the simplicity. Love 'The Brickwood' pizza. Mushroom pizza and garlic bread are good too. Found all coolers to be refreshing and service efficient.

Contrary to what is commonly said about this place, I find the pizzas to be well priced.

An honest place I'll keep visiting everytime I'd like to have a pizza.

It's a small joint, cosily decorated with hanging warm lights, a snug mezzanine floor and brilliant Italian music playing the background. The smell of the brick oven pizza floats through the air. We had pasta and pizza which my short termed memory does not remember the name of but they were both dripping in cheese and meat and was absolute deliciousness.

Unhygienic!! Was making pizza and salad with bare hands (seriously!??). We ordered a pizza, a salad and 2 soft drinks. Drinks were average and the pizza was alright, but the salad was substandard. The salad had no flavour whatsoever (plain cheese, raw walnuts, pomegranate and chopped leaves with balsamic - totally bland). We asked the salad to be cancelled after the first taste, but only after much argument did our waiter agreed to refund the money (since they had taken advance payment). There were no quarter plates available on request - how are you supposed to share??

Overall, I totally regret the visit and would not recommend this place to anyone. Guys, either get your act straight or shut shops.

Finally had time to visit this place. Just opposite Camac Street Pantaloons and beside a Wow Momo outlet. 

Ambiance and decor : 4 
Have to appreciate how they managed and utilized the limited amount of space. The decor is nice and seating is comfortable even in the small place.

Service : 2.5 
One thing bothered that they said upstairs is full while only 3 people were there. I didn't didn't even try to go upstairs as I wanted the view of the kitchen. Service is slow but they make up for that in taste. 
And they seem to ask how the food is only when the customer's mouth is full. 

Food : 3.7

Small sized Fresco : 3.5 
Ordered a small one. A veg pizza which was definitely in need to be a lot more generous with toppings. Seriously. 


Regular sized Misto Di Carne : 4 
Amount of toppings was satisfactory. The base was crispy all over except in the middle. 

They haven't kept an option for regular soft drinks. Only bottomless soft drink which they priced at 100 bucks. What if someone doesn't want that much? Their menu needs improvement. 

Their fans may disagree, but for someone like myself, this place was worth one visit only. 

Nevertheless, they do deserve credit for managing things in the small place.

This is a small pizzeria located opposite the Westside/ Pantaloons complex. Went there for lunch today, and totally loved it. They serve the food on wooden plates to keep up to its name. We had a mushroom pizza which was one of the best pizzas I have had. It was crispy and not too crispy. The toppings were also well made. The pulled out garlic bread and the cannelloni were also good preparations. Warm and cheesy. For drinks we had lemon cooler and a lemongrass cooler which was refreshing and nice. A little high on the price, but overall a good experience.

A small outlet located near St. Xavier's college. It is in the same building where jalapeno is. It is a small and cosy place with self service.
They have a very limited menu. We ordered Fungi Pizza, Garlic Bread and Cannelloni. We also ordered Lemon Coolers and Lemongrass drink. Talking about the food, it was amazing. The pizza was great, absolutely amazing.
I din like the fact that they don't have plates, that is a draw back. The waiters are courteous.
Overall it is a nice place, I guess they should expand their menu and they should have plates and all. It is a little expensive when compared to the kind of service they give.
But overall i would say they serve really good food.

Not so big restaurant. Located near camac street. Though I don't have much experience on pizza but still it tastes a little bit different comparing to dominos or pizza hut.
Ordered THE BRICKWOOD (A VEG PIZZA) and POLLO CON AGLIO (A NON VEG PIZZA) and coke.
Tastes are good but a glass of coke is not worth rupees 100.

Feta cheese was also of good quality . Only it was burnt from one side . Would visit the outlet to have the pizza once, if its perfect would give 5 out of 5

Very fancy pizza names and it ends there.  I ordered a lamb pizza, their signature veg pizza and garlic bread.  

The pizza topping was dried out and the thin crust base had a  burnt flavor in some places.  My jaws literally started paining eating a dried out , burnt pizza . Not to mention an overdose of roquette leaves. Rarely do i feel so bovine.the garlic bread had small garlic chunks which i personally don't like.

Smallest little joint, next to wow momo in wood street .

Tried out the place and it was an instant hit. Got good food , food quantity good for a single person and if you are sharing then  you get to order more things from the menu. Also 

All the pizzas are good and very different . They actually have wood fire pizza oven in the kitchen and the place is owned by three hostel goers .

We ordered the brickwood pizza ,  mushroom pizza. Also the garlic bread is good try . Tastes a bit different , hopefully they maintain the taste .

Aptly located in Wood Street, Brickwood is a small yet popular destination for pizza lovers such as Yours Truly. After coming across wonderful reviews of the restaurant, I decided to check out this place with an equally pizza loving friend of mine, and we had a good time gorging on pizzas and drinking hot chocolate!

First of all, Brickwood is a novice concept in the City of Joy, and hence, the menu, as well as the seating area, is quite limited as of now. The interiors are quite small and moderately comfortable. The seating area constitutes of the ground floor, first floor and outside seating. I am assuming this would change once the restaurant achieves the requisite popularity. 

Second, location-wise, Brickwood is situated in quite a convenient place in Camac Street, though it was a bit difficult for us to get a cab on our way back from the diner. 

Third, Brickwood has only self-service. After you choose your menu item, you have to pay the cheque and get seated till you are asked to take the respective order from the kitchen counter. Don’t worry, you don’t have to step inside the kitchen! :P 

Fourth, coming to the most awaited part of the review, let me tell you that the food here is not marvellous, but it is quite good. Just keep an open mind and you would be sure to relish the foodstuff. 

My orders:
(1)The Brickwood
(2) Pollo Fungi Cilantro
(3) Hot Chocolate with Whipped Cream and Strawberries

Brickwood’s signature dish, The Brickwood contained wood fired pizza topped with sun dried tomatoes, olives, roquette leaves and Greek feta cheese.
                                          ...

Might be my bad luck but when I stepped in here the air conditioning system was dysfunctional. So I had to sit out side in open dining space. The interiors looked comfy. The thin crust pizza was great. Though I wanted to try their lasagna it was not available. Due to hunger I couldn't click pic of food but the pic of restro might suffice.

Visited Brickwood sometime back and found the food to be superb. The Tomato Basil soup (since discontinued) was one of the best I've had. Pulled Garlic cheesy bread was mouthwatering. I could have had a meal of just the two and come back happy.
We ordered the margherita pizza and the brick wood. both were excellent. I personally liked the brickwood more. Also ordered the spinach cannelloni which while great i felt had a little too much olive oil for my liking. 

Lemongrass cooler to wash it all down gave a very different flavour combination. Unfortunately though the cooler and the italian food did not really go well together though the cooler itself was great. The desserts were a disappointment and chocolate souffle while baked well just did not hit the right notes. I would have loved for it to be more chocolatey as they served it it was quite milk chocolatey.

However given that my ranking is 4.5 as of that visit. Recently my brother visited and informed that the soup is no longer available. I hope it is a seasonal removal for it was definitely one of the highlights of my meal. If it is a permanent removal I would certainly drop the rating down to a 3.5 maybe 4.0.

I had been really excited about Brickwood but it was a let down of epic proportions. 

The pizzas (both veg Fungi and the non-veg version) WERE great, no doubt about that but it couldn't make me ignore all the other things that went terribly wrong. 

1. The pastas are really overpriced. For Rs. 400 you expect something a bit more worth it's cost. It didn't taste bad. Just very average. Rs. 400 is a lot to pay for average pasta that doesn't serve more than 2 people.

2. The service is frankly terrible. And this is the main problem with the place. There were 5 of us, when we took a seat in the top floor, they asked us to sit downstairs because apparently the table would prove to be too tiny for all our dishes. That was fine until we realised that the table downstairs was just as tiny if not tinier, so that excuse was clearly not true. Moreover, we had to bring our own food, keep our dishes on the counter once we were finished with them, bring our cutlery, napkins, straws and everything else without any help from the waiters. They were polite, no doubt, but they weren't really doing ANYTHING at all. We had to keep reminding them to give us something as fundamental as glasses for the water. 

It was a really disappointing experience overall. We were forced to sit right in front of the door even though all the other tables were unoccupied upstairs. 

I have no plans on revisiting the place. The pizzas are worth it, for some I guess. But nothing else is. 

P.S. the pulled cheese garlic bread is genuinely good. It was a shame that they burnt our red velvet fondue. I was really looking forward to that.

We ordered a few pizzas and a cannelloni for delivery through swiggy and we think being it our first experience with this restaurant "they should not tie up with any such deliveries". The pizzas were soggy and inedible.  

The cannelloni is smelling and seems stale. Its extremely sour and pungent including its filling.

This pizzeria located in Camac Street, next to wow momos, is a self service joint and is very different from any standard Pizza joint.
This place lacks variety and also I don't think it's suited for dinner. No matter how much you eat, pizzas here will not satisfy your hunger and you'll feel ravenous not long after you're done eating.
To save ourselves from the trouble of going to collect our order we sat upstairs. Yeah right, they also have a mezzanine floor. Pizzas weren't that great and in some case they were BURNT on edges. We ordered the following :
-THE BRICKWOOD: Their signature Pizza isn't so good. Roquette leaves as topping doesn't go along.
-Fresco: one of their bests.
-MargheritA: Good

Seating capacity is very low and I'd prefer to sit out, if I visit this place again.

This is a nice little pizzeria located just beside the camac street pantaloons. It has provisions for outdoor seating as well.

Decor and Ambience (3/5)
Simplistic decor. Really brings out the theme 'brickwood'. The large pizza oven downstairs looks like a huge pepperoni dome. You have to pay downstairs while they'll deliver the food.

Food (3.5/5)
We took the Pizza (first on the menu. Roasted chicken and garlic butter). It was made in thin crust with ample amounts of Chicken. But somewhere I couldn't taste the flavor I was expecting. A bit more cheese maybe, a lil more spice would hav done the trick. Although my friend said It was great.
We took the Bottomless coke (take as many refills as you want) too with it. Now you would expect the coke flavor to remain same. But I felt the coke and water were in the wrong proportion in the drink.
I really wanted to try their famous red velvet dessert, but I was full. Will come by again just for their dessert only.
The price is very pocket friendly. The dessert is a bit costly though.

This new pizzeria at camac street with their special wood-burn thin crust pizzas is a delightful and quite a welcome change from the time-tested, formulaic pizzas of dominoes and pizza hut..which have quite frankly, become clichéd. Add to that the very generous toppings of roast chicken, spicy chicken sausage, balsalmic lamb with all its meaty goodness and you know what 'real' pizza should taste like!! We also ordered pulled cheesy garlic bread..with delicious molten cheese oozing out of the soft bread. But the clear winner was the Red Velvet Fondant served with vanilla bean ice cream- a recipe so unique and heavenly that you can't help but crave for a second helping (which is exactly what we did) !! Also, the cookie sundae was another sumptuous addition to the meal..and it looked as lovely as it tasted!! The prices on the menu are tax inclusive and are really affordable. Can't wait for another visit to my new favourite pizza place in town!! :)

I was very excited at the idea of a new pizza place in the city. Brickwood promised plenty but didn't really deliver. 
The sauce is a problem - the recipe needs to be reworked. Too much acidity coming from the tomatoes. The toppings were decent - chicken and mushrooms was just about passable. You'll find better toppings for a cheaper price at Don Giovannis. 
The crust was again just about passable. Not highly recommended.

With all the hype around their 'wood fire pizzas' I finally decided to try Brickwood one evening and to be very honest the experience was just about ok. While i loved the pizzas and found them to be delicious, what disappointed me was the cannelloni which tasted quite awkward and was served in the smallest portion you can think of. In fact, the quantity served for each item, in general is quite small and you'll need to order quite a bit to fill your tummy. What I loved the most was their concept of 'bottomless coke' where you could have unlimited soft drinks for one person for ₹100. But then again, you had to move out of the restaurant to fill your glass everytime. Overall I feel there is scope for much improvement and I hope they do get better with time.:)!

Dear 30 mins Pizza; maybe you should take longer. Love, Brickwood.
Brickwood has a wood fire oven installed in the kitchen. If your idea of pizza is the crap that is cooked and delivers in “30 minutes” by leading international pizza chains; then my friend, I am judging you. The joys of fresh pizza made in a wood fire oven is something that can only be experienced. Without a doubt good pizza can be made in electrical ovens but a wood fire oven cannot be beat.

Fire and Ice may have ruled the roost for a bit. There have been others who claim good fresh pizza. It is exciting to see new places that deliver wood fire pizza that fares well.

A craving for pizza and disinclination towards going to my usual hubs (serafina, fire and ice namely) brought me to Brickwood. The modest eatery has a short but not disappointing menu on which everyone could find a pizza to suit their palate. Being a group of only two but wanting to taste several dishes we asked to have a half-half pizza. All pizza places I have visited till date are happy to give you two varieties in one pizza but this place didn't which was a disappointment. We ordered The Brickwood, their signature pizza, being fairly empty, our order didn't take much time. Although, given that the restaurant was almost empty, it should have taken a lesser amount of time. The pizza was good. It lacked something to cut through the bitterness of the roquette but I would not classify it as bad pizza. I'm sure the other options on the menu would be fantastic. I also ordered a lemongrass cooler. The taste was intense with an perhaps an excessive amount of ginger and lemongrass to some palates. I personally did not mind the pungent flavour. Overall, with a relaxed ambiance, the place is great for a quick pizza fix. And I am thrilled to now have found another potential purlieu.

I will keep this review short and sweet, just like the menu of this place. Small little place with warm interiors. We ordered a Margherita Pizza and a garlic bread. Well I would say that they make very flavourful food. The thin crust pizzas were topped with fresh herbs and light fluffy cheese (probably buffalo) and the garlic bread,a portion for two, was also non-conventional. It was a full bun cut across and filled with cheese and seasoning. Very palatable. It would say a very refreshing change to age old domino's and pizza hut.

After hearing about the place finally dropped in for a quick bite, but was extremely disappointing. With this being a pizza place they should have their focus on Pizzas and make sure they provide some amazing taste, but they failed to deliver. We ordered The Brickwood Special & Pulled Cheese Garlic Bread, the garlic bread was average as it had no seasoning & herbs and the pizza was something i had never had in my life, with burnt crust it destroyed our hunger completely. The only good thing is the look of the small place at first look.

I went here today after the foodie in me suddenly gave a roar for pizza. Cute place. Minimalist decor. I liked the walls in particular. They were showing TLC on a large screen which made the wait for the pizza more fulfilling.
I had ordered a chicken mushroom Cannelloni along with a regular drink.
The crust was made perfectly. It tasted heavenly. All I added was sauce and oregano. They had given the toppings generously and the pizza can be shared among two unless you have starved yourself for the last few days. 
Very happy and satisfied. The pocket pinch was justified.
Highly recommended.

Went to this small pizzeria, it's clean, small, no frills,but nice ambience.
The pizza we tried was very good, though I am not much of a pizza lover. The garlic bread was also quite delicious. Something much much better than the plasticky pizzas served at domino, s & pizza Hut.
Definitely would like to go back. 
Went back, the pizzas were even better & flavourful, however if they increase the price even more, then customers might give it a second thought.

Love the concept of unlimited coke for 100 bucks. Full marks for the BrickWood pizza. One star less because its a small joint and self service makes one climb up and down the stairs to serve one self. Overall, new concept, should be hit :)

Went twice, once when we were not even hungry, just to have their "Brickwood Pizza'. They are amazing, authentic & very different from the pizza's I have had so far. 

The tiny place, its decor & the music are all amazing & makes you feel you are not in Kolkata! Sadly I have seen this place emptier than it deserves, maybe because of self service even though there are so many employees around.

Will visit again to try other things.

This place has been on my go-to list sinc it's inception in town...the name itself was a welcome factor for me - brickwood! I was expecting some fresh wood oven pizza,straight from d furnace....finally wen I arrived here,it was straight out of wat I'd expected it to be.! Yes,the pizzas are amazing....v v authentic....jus the way they Shud be.we had ordered for their signature Brickwood Pizza, cheesy pull apart garlic bread and the very comforting tomato basil soup! It was all v v soul satisfying.Yes, it's a self service cool joint,but they do serve on d mezzanine level,once the order is personally served at d counter. Overall fab experience,I wud say ,next best to serafina & fire n ice in terms of authenticity.

It's quite a small place.. With very limited menu.. Indulged in cannelloni, garlic bread , funghi pizza and red velvet dessert. So it's a self service joint which is good but then the multiple order wasn't prepared together or in order.. They kept the fountain coke immediately and by the time the food came it had no fizz left. Then came the garlic bread which was yumm! Followed by pizza and then after 15 mins wait came the cannelloni and finally the dessert so basically you keep getting up to fetch your food unlike most other self service joint where your entire meal is to be collected at once. The garlic pods in the funghi pizza was cooked fantastically.. Cannelloni was a bit sweet. Over all a nice pizza place but the dessert made up for all flaws! Big thumps up to the red velvet bomb.. It stole the show! Surely going back for that!

I came across this restaurant today suddenly while looking for other cafe. Its an Italian restaurant which serve pizza and pasta . We ordered for a pollo con chipola pizza and a red velvet fondant with vanilla ice cream. The pizza was freshly oven baked, crispy . The show stealer is the dessert. A must try. Will be visiting it again. :)

A nice place to come to if you really love your pizzas, that remains pretty busy during lunchtime. The only two complaints I have are that the pizzas were a wee bit burnt at the edges and that the serving of cannelloni is little for it's price. Loved the Pizza with chicken, spinach and caramelized onions; the Pizza with chicken and mushroom in cilantro pesto and the Red Velvet Fondant the most. :)

P.S. More pictures to be uploaded as and when edited.

A new pizza joint is always welcome,this one especially because they have wood fired pizzas. This is a self service joint where you pay at the counter in advance and then take your seat. They have three seating areas....one outside withe plastic chairs and tables and umbrellas to protect against the sun. The second one is on the ground floor while the third is on mezzanine floor. It is only on the mezzanine floor that they serve. It is a very small place so when more people drop in it becomes congested. We ordered the margeritta pizza. It was a thin crust pizza....very good..,I iked it a lot. The dessert was just awesome...red velvet cake with a liquid filling which oozed out when you tuck in with a spoon .This was accompanied by vanilla bean ice cream. Yum. Loved it. It is a nice place with simple but innovative decor.Their walls are not plastered or painted but kept in such a way that bricks can be seen

Ok experience. Nothing extraordinary or very authentic about it. The restaurant is small but neatly done up. Tables downstairs are self service, while they serve the tables upstairs. The thought of a wood fired oven is always great for a foodie especially one which is very visible to the naked eye. They have an open kitchen with the oven as the centre of attraction. A limited pizza centric menu. We like the garlic bread as well as the chocolate pudding. However, the pizza was a let downer. I didnt find anything really nice about it. It was not bad but then failed to meet my expectations. Have had better pizza in fire n ice or in Mezzuna. For a place that boasts of a wood fired oven, the pizzas ought to be better.

The garlic bread is awesome. Lime & Lemongrass coolers and the cannelloni were good too. Personally preferred the lime cooler more than the lemongrass. Didn't quite like the pizzas though. All the pizzas tasted the same in my opinion and had too much mushroom flavor.The desert hot souffle duet with ice cream scoop was decent.

This is the best Pizza Joint in Kolkata right now. Its on a different level when you compare it with the likes of Pizza Hut and Dominos. 

The smoky chicken and the caramelized onions give you a lipsmacking experience. I would recommend Pizza lovers to try this joint. 

And not to forget their heavenly desserts. The Red velvet cake dish is amazing. 

Overall a great experience.

The pizza taste wise wasn't anything great. Though the thin crust was really good. 
The cheesy garlic bread didn't taste like garlic at all. If this gets fixed, it will taste brilliant.

Loved the decor and the lighting.Service was very fast and courteous(although self service if you sit upstairs they serve you) .Had ordered for the classic chicken pizza with extra cheese. The toppings and the cheese were both generous and loved the smoky flavour of the pizza. Wish they start serving more varieties of non veg pizzas.

Fungi didn't disappoint. Nothing like Fire and Ice Pizzeria though. Yet, mouth watering.

I was feeling a craving for pizza since days and so were the kids.Pizza these days translates to the stereotypical fast food-chain store pizza;something which I am personally not very fond of. Thus in search of the original Italian Pizza,the original thin crust-hand tossed pizza,we reached:. Brickwood-Upstairs

Brickwood is a good place to hang out at if you get a table. Food wise, we tried all the pizzas they had on the menu. While they are all good, fresco is the best of the lot. The hot chocolate and garlic breads are good too. May be in time they will add more options to the menu and tables to the restaurant. Friendly people, good ambience, great start.

Been eyeing this place since it opened. Finally visited. Based on reviews. Ordered the cheesy garlic bread. And brickwood pizza with added pepperoni. Which was unfortunately not available. So asked for chicken instead. Along with lime soda. The cheesy garlic bread was very cheesy though lacked the garlicky taste as well as flavour in general. The pizza was delicious. Although the chicken was a bit dry and chewy. The menu is limited but considering its a new joint. It has time to add items. Still based on the service and the atmosphere in general have good hopes for this place. Will be going back and recommend pthers as well

Fantastic for thin crust wood fired Pizzas. I have been couple of times due to close proximity to my office. In the Menu among what all I have tried I like the Brickwood pizza, the Aglio olio pizza, cannelloni and the hot chocolate. They have outdoor seating comprising around 4 tables seating 12-16 people and have a 2 level indoor seating comprising around 4 tables seating 16-20 people. A definite must try for those who like these kind of pizzas. Easy casual place to eat with decent pricing as well.

Brickwood is easy to locate. It's just opposite to the back gate of Westside in Wood Street. They have outdoor seating as well, and inside there are 3 tables on the ground floor and 3 tables on the first floor! Ordered the Quatro Formaggi pizza, Pollo Con Cilantro, a Lime Cooler and a Lemongrass Cooler! The pizzas were amazing. I liked the Lemongrass Cooler as well. I felt that they can increase the quantity of the toppings a bit. :P Anyway, I loved it overall. Service is fast and the pricing is okay! Go, give it a try. This place is here to stay :D

A casual visit to this place during lunch time left me and my friends pleasantly surprised. The place serves really great thin crust pizza, a little low on the cheese (a personal choice) but great pizza nonetheless.
We had their garlic bread too, which was a revelation as it was cheesy without being too much of it. The cookie crumble sundae was also a great dessert. Eventually, we ended up ordering three different pizzas and they were all superb.
The added ambience of the whole brick-wood thing makes it better. Definitely a place to visit...

Brickwood is the new Italian restaurant on the block and it is SMASHING! Everyone was talking about it, so my friend and I decided to try it out today. We ordered The Brickwood pizza with extra mushrooms and shared a lime cooler . 
The lime cooler was pretty good but one isn't enough to share, but we knew that! 
Now for the pizza ... It was so good and so yum and absolutely brilliant! I loved it as much as I love mezzuna pizzas or fire and ice and at half the price ! They gave a lot of mushrooms and black olives and sundried tomatoes. There was flavour in every bite <3! 
There's literally no con I can think of for Brickwood! 
I loved it so much and I'm definitely going back again to try each and every option on their menu.
And the best thing was that prices are inclusive of vat and service tax! 
The pizza + mushrooms+ lime cooler came to 470 bucks only! Positively a 5/5!

It's a small and nice place in Wood Street opposite Pizza Hut behind Westside in Camac Street.!

They have an open kitchen and small crew of wonderful people and there speciality is there woodburn pizza.!

The place looks pretty good from the inside too and you can sit there with your friends for a chat.

We had their pizza 'The Brickwood' which they said was their speciality and we loved it and a  'Lemongrass Cooler' which was not very great but the flavour was distinct and something new as a concoction.!

They also have Cannelloni which I would be having on my subsequent visits.
The prices in the menu are inclusive of all taxes and service charge.!

I had wanted to visit this place since it opened, solely for Wood Fired Oven baked Pizzas. We went to this small cozy place for dinner. We ordered the tomato basil soup, pulled cheesy garlic bread, canelloni and The Woodbrick Pizza. The food is too good. They serve authentic Italian fare. The food is a 5 on 5. What I didn't like about the overall experience was that the portions were too small, especially the canelloni. It renders the place a bit on the expensive side. Also, even though they served the food very quickly, we were served the soup after dinner which was a bit unusual. All in all, this place is a must visit for its food but be prepared to shell out extra bucks if you plan on going for a heavy meal.

Nothing but praises for this new Italian place in town. Classic thin crusted, wood baked pizzas, traditional Italian garlic breads, i love how they serve olive oil along with the pizza. That's how it's done. The management has clearly done their homework, and not just done, they have excelled at it. Love the food, love the ambiance, love everything about it. I'm not from calcutta but i swear I'm not gonna waste my money on fine dine italian on my next visit, coz brickwood slays them all.

So I checked out this place last night with a bunch of friends. Still very new so beware of the service. The brick oven pizzas lack flavor. Most of the food tastes like home made stuff so I do no see why one would visit this place. Great for students as it is price friendly and it is self service. Please stop adding tons of mushroom in every dish. Will really help. You guys really need to work hard and get some more staff. The earlier reviews are by people for whom the world of pizza ends at dominos and pizza hut and thus they do not know what gourmet pizzas are so do not bother with them. Once the winter is over, the indoor section is not worth being seated at. Have this pizza but at home. Then its not too bad.

Move over Dominos and Pizza Hut; your monopoly is about to end as places like Brickwood and other speciality pizza joints come up in the city. A sudden craving for pizza landed me and a friend to this quaint little eatery on Wood Street, bang opposite Camac Street Pantaloons and right beside Nosh and Bytes. Nice minimalistic decor, they have an outdoor sitting arrangement which will can be great on Spring and Autumn evenings. 
Ordered for a Quattro Formaggi with chicken and Pollo Fungi Cilantro. The pollo fungi cilantro is a pesto sauce based pizza (thankfully someone decided to give us a break from tomato sauce) with chicken and mushrooms. Tasted lovely, but the clear winner was the Quattro Formaggi, their version of the 4 cheese pizza. Though I couldn't specifically discern the different tastes of mozzarella, cheddar and Parmesan, the sharp taste of feta stood out with every single bite. Drizzle a bit of olive oil and you will possibly have the best 4 cheese pizza in this part of the world. All their pizzas are done in on wood-fire that lends them a nice smoky taste. The pizzas are thin crust, so you Dnt end up feeling heavy like a dominos or Pizza Hut would make you feel. In short, this is miles ahead of dominos and Pizza Hut when it comes to savoury pizzas and should be tried Atleast once. I, for certain, would be going back to Brickwood whenever I'm closeby. Another nicety is they Dnt charge taxes and it's a self-service joint, which worked fine for me atleast.

Quaint little place. Loved their outdoor seating arrangement. Had ordered pulled garlic bread which was average. Lemon grass cooler was nice. Cannelloni was the best available in kolkata. Pizzas were also good. Their tomato sauce is very fresh. Wanted the warm chocolate duet but they only serve that for dinners, so settled for cookie sundae which was also good. The cream was very fresh. All in all, a good place. Cheers

It's actually a wonderful thing that the monopoly of Pizza Hut and Dominos are over and we have small places serving really tasty and well made pizzas. Brick Wood Pizza, a very small joint has perfected the art of thin crusted hand-rolled pizza ( cooked in a wood oven). We ordered a Brickwood Pizza with chicken topping ( I was slightly disappointed when they couldn't give us pepperoni topping), there was abundance of feta cheese and rockets on the pizza and with a drizzle of olive oil it tasted heavenly. We also ordered a Lemongrass cooler, which was very refreshing and a Hot chocolate Delight, which tasted very chocolaty ( and not too milky or Milo like) with a twist of strawberries topped with whipped cream. 
Hope to visit this place again,soon, just hoping that they expand the menu a bit more and include a few more non-veg options by then.

Saw This place while crossing and it looked good, seeing the outdoor seating.
Extremely Small menu, but what they serve is excellent.

 We ordered Margerita Pizza and a corn spinach Cannelloni and both were excellent.

Specially The cannelloni was the best I've ever had. The pizza was also excellent, but had i had lil more sauce would have been better.

Ordered a lemongrass cooler, which was bad. 

The open seating in this weather added to the overall experience.

for the quality of food they serve this place is rightly priced !!!!

Worth the visit for all the foodies, with the food here being it's USP.
About the service, it needs to improve a hell lot as the staff has to be called upon to take orders. They have no idea about the items on the menu, instead you have to go and ask the chef himself.
About the place, it's small and compact with very limited seating space.
About the food, the only drawback is the linited list of items on the menu. I'd expect a few more items to be added.
We'd ordered for a Fresco Pizza, which was one of the finest I've had in a long time; and Hot Chocolate, which was again highly satisfying. 😇

Paying another visit soon!

Located on wood street next to nosh and bytes this quaint little place is a welcome addition to the eateries in the area. The place delivers wood fire oven pizzas, a fairly new concept for people in this part of the world.

The staff is polite and helpful. The seating was comfortable and service was prompt.

We ordered for the Fresco pizza, pulled garlic bread, hot chocolate and the chocolate pizza.

The garlic bread and the fresco pizza were really tasty. The hot chocolate was one of the nicest i have had in a long time. The same though cannot be said about the chocolate pizza. The idea behind it is right but they have to add a bit more chocolate on the pizza to make it yummy. The strawberries topping on it goes well and blends the taste. 

A definite repeat visit to try their non veg pizzas. Must continue the good work. Cheers !

Excellent food only problem was that the owner needs to be a little more courteous...my parents found a smell coming in the soup so we just brought it to their notice that maybe the cup was wiped with stale cloth....he did change the soup but went on smelling the rest of the cups along with his fellow mates and commented where is the smell what do they want a perfumed cup.....totally an unacceptable form of behaviour I would say

To be honest I was never a great fan of pizza but then Brickwood came.. Truly authentic and traditional obviously.. But u guys stole my heart away with the awesome food.
And kudos to the hospitality and the ambience as well. The slogans on the board kept me seated with my curiosity intact. And from the wooden trays to the olive oil, everything has been minutely taken care of.
A totally impressive place and worth recommending..

Totally impressed with the food,hospitality and the ambience..the 4 cheese pizza was to die for..
The blackboard was an absolute show stealer. It kept me hooked while waiting for the pizza. My impatience got rewarded with such delectable food and am glad I gave this place a try..

Nice little hangout place located just beside wood street java with both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. We tried the pulled cheesy garlic bread, oven roasted chicken pizza and the chicken and mushroom canneloni. All three dishes were decent. Although this place does not have too much variety to offer yet but it still can be tried for catching up sessions with friends once in a while.

Opened less than a month back, this place looks as authentic as the name... Self service n outdoor,indoor seating gives this place the feel of an Italian roadside corner pizzeria.
The menu is limited with around 5-6 veg and only 2 non veg pizza choices. Balance it out,please.
Now for the pizza.
Had authentic wood fire pizza 1st time in Kolkata!!!! Thank u guys. Pizza hut and domino's has spoiled our concept of pizza with those thick doughy overpriced "indianised pizza"! I hope brickwood continues to be the welcoming change. 
Quick pointers:
1. If y can, stay away from the non veg pizzas. The topping qty is a little disappointing..  try the brickwood pizza instead. It will blow ur mind.
2. Try the cannelloni. Tastes amazing. Just remember the last lasagna u had. This is 10 times better.
@team brickwood. Amazing start! Please sustain. And more meat options please please please!

Brickwood has the peppiness a newly opened place should, and I was transported back to Mumbai with the kind of seating arrangement they have! You have outdoor, and indoor, AND they have managed a tiny floor Inside too. Cute! 
We ordered for pullout garlic bread (should have had more cheese- was a little dry), pizza (where the thin crust was bang on!), hot chocolate(YUM) and chocolate pizza(uh..I really think you can spend your 200 bucks on something better), can of thumbsup, and I loved the whole procedure where you order at the counter and they get the food to your table. 
The chill factor of the place is high, wherein you can hangout with friends and have a good time and simultaneously keep your pocket happy. 
 @brickwood, you could keep a few things in mind, like having tissues and cutlery on the tables in the elevated seating area and staff that's not so stressed all the time, and then you're game on! :D

Hatsoff to the owner who had the dare to stand this opposite of Pizza hut..but not good at all in taste and even in quantities. And was a good expectation for garlic cheese bread,but people!! "expectations always hurt.:()but one thing which was really good,but I can't remember the name and I can't get back into the menu cause my review will be vanished and again I hv to write it!So,I feel no need to go back and u please feel the same and don't dare to go there..

If u r a pizza lover or an Italian Buff  then this is the Place for u. 
The Pizzas here are so thin and crisp and delicious specially the Brickwood Special Pizza which is a must try! 
The cannelloni and Garlic Bread is also a treat! 
However there are very less options! 
The lemongrass Cooler is a Must- Have! ❤️

Visited this much hyped small wood-fire pizza outlet last sunday..the location is good..interiors are nicely done..apart from the pizza,,they hardly have anything else on the menu..its a casual dining outlet agreed..you have to place your order yourself okay..but no tissue papers on the tables,,,no cutlery..and on top of that there are no waiters around..so it causes you quite a lot of trouble that ways.
Coming to the food.. I tried their signature veg pizza..trust me..its nothing extraordinary..infact you get much much much better pizzas at that price (rs 350) elsewhere..with that being signature pizza I did expect something special but was served with quite an ordinary one with olives and tomato being the only toppings,besides lettuce which made it even worse.. I also had their lemongrass cooler which was also quite ordinary..
All I can say is you get many times better food in that area at that price..jalapenos still remains our all time favourite in that lane..

Very nice small cozy place. The menu is short and crisp but we ordered two kinds of veg pizzas and the garlic bread. Garlic bread is definitely something which will make me return to this place. And the owners are a sweet bunch of people for sure! Thumbs up for this place!!!!

Decent place. Small cozy feel, and has outdoor seating as well. As for the pizza - it's from a woodburning oven but I wasn't overly impressed. However, the Nutella pizza desert was pretty delicious. 

I asked about delivery and the owners have plans to start delivering to nearby locations soon. 

All in all decent place for a quick bite

Newly opened this Pizza joint serves wood burn pizzas. Located just bang opposite Camac Street Pantaloons and beside Aqua Java of Wood Street, the place is ubercool. I visited the place on 25th of December, as I wanted to hv Pizzas badly, and Pizza Hut was too crowded. I ordered for a Pollo Fungi Cilantro.. A nonveg Pizza with Chicken Mushroom with their inhouse Cilantro Pesto. I quite liked it. Alongwith that had a Pulled Cheesy Garlic Bread, and it was delectable. We sat outside, in the open-air section, and it was chilly..so opted for a Café Latte..it was just average. Overall, this new place can definitely be tried out for trying out the wood burn pizzas which they offer.

Pizzas were very delectable and so was the pulled cheesy garlic bread. If you had enough of pizzas served at dominoes, pizza hut and want to try an authentic wood oven pizza, this is the place to be. Pollo fungi cilantro was heavenly and so was the Italian margarita. Service is very important to any new business and they didn't even disappoint when it came to that. Serving with a smile and doesn't break your bank as well. How can I forget, sweet ambience coupled with Italian music.
