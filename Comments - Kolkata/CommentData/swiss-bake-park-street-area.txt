Tried their chocolate pudding via delivery at home. The packaging is nice and food came in packed neatly. Have never visited this place in person though. Last time, had tried their veg patties and pineapple pastry. Both were decent.
Coming back to my current order, whatever I had was tasty, though wasnt anything like a pudding! 
It had a bottom of cake topped with a chocolate thick layer. A pudding has layers and soft spongy cake but this was more like a brownie with a thick firm layer or chocolate slice. 
Overall, was decent to taste.
Prices are reasonable and this place is worth a try.

Very bad... Stay away... Most of the time items are not fresh and they don't pick up the phone to take delivery orders! Brought chocolate mousse yesterday and it tasted very bad... Items there look a day old...

got myself delivered some stuff from this place through swiggy. it was a blind hit 2 order from here coz i was extremely hungry & wanted to munch something not to heavy yet light to my stomach. well...i ordered- tai chi paneer wrap, paneer patties & dark chocolate pastry...all for 140/- including the delivery charge from swiggy. I am very happy with my "blind hit" order this time. looooved d patties & tai chi paneer wrap. thou i m not fond of paneer that much.... but there stuff is seriously awesome and extrmely pocket friendly. the wrap was big in size, the stuffing was very much satisfying yet super tasty, nd the same goes for the patties. tangy, fresh & wholesome. the pastry was nothing extra-ordinary but quite good. no complaints at all. highly recommended.

I came to know their existence by today as I am a regular visitor on that building and never seen it. 

Located at the opposite of West Bengal Board of Secondary  Education office and ICICI bank park st. Branch.

Shop is very tiny but very clean and decorated.

Staff was polite and guided me with their available items.

Bought 5 items.
Dark Fantasy was very good among them, I particularly the cream was very good.

Black forest was also a good try.

Lemon tart comes with a average taste.

Mango treat pastry was just excellent.

I placed an online order  from Swiss Bake. I must say this place is bit under rated and deserves more reviews.
Chicken Patties: 3.5/5
Chocolate Pudding: 3.5/5
Lemon Tart: 4/5
Chicken Hot Dog: 3.5/5

For some items, prices are little on the higher side.
