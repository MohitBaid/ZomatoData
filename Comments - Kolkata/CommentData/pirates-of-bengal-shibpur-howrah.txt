The ambience of the resturant is good, but the service and the food are atrocious. We had to wait for god knows how long to order and then for the food. We ordered chicken cheese kebab, schezwan chicken fried rice and garlic chicken. Only the kebab was good. Who gives star anish in a Chinese rice dish and were was the spicy taste of schezwan? And from when does garlic chicken tasted like honey dipped chicken?? You should get a good chef and good waiters.

The quality & quantity of food is really appreciable, can give good competition to many Kolkata restaurants. It may become a status symbol for Howrah in near future.

Okay! So i ordered food from this place quite a few times and the amount is like XXL. For example from one Hakka noodles two people can easily feast on it. The food is tasty, and they use good quality products. Have eaten more than 5 times but once the chilli chicken was on the saltier side. Thats it but the food is pretty good over here! Cheers :D

The newest addition to Mandirtala's food joints. It looks quite amazing from outside. Also well decorated from inside. "Pirates of the Caribbean" themed restaurant stands out in decorations, services but it does lack the most important thing which is food.
The food quality and quantity both is terrible here. We ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Handi, Chicken Manchurian. Each n every preparation were below average quality. Rice grains were still unboiled, all the gravy dishes weren't cooked properly.
The quantity was also very less as compared to the price charged per item.
Too much overpriced as compared to the quality and quantity of the food being served.
Need to improve badly!!
Never gonna visit again in future.

I got really disappointed after visiting the place. I entered the restaurant 1st time on Sasthi evening (26/09/2017). As per ambience it was too good. When we checked the menu card found most on the items were not available. We took it positively since the festive season is going on. But the realty came to us after serving our 1st order that was Chicken Tandoori. It was so stiff n hard. Onions smelled wrongly. We also ordered Mix rice & Chilly Chicken. Mix Rice was so so. But Chilly Chicken was TOO MUCH CHILLY. Also chickens were not in good quality. On the soul of Mandirtala it was really a big disappointing restaurant. Please try to improve yourself in a drastic manner.

I visited this place first time during Durga Puja, and I totally understand the pressure of managing a huge crowd. But I was very disappointed with their amateur order management and serving procedure. we had to repeat our order thrice since they kept forgetting. Ambiance was really good. I liked the interior and the mocktail was pretty good. very polite stuff members. We ordered Tikka Kabab which was dripping with oil hence wasn't impressed with quality. Quantity was sufficient and little over priced. I'd suggest people to check this place out off season if that makes any difference.

A delight to eyes for "Pirates of Caribbean" lovers! the entire interior is inspired from the movie series - so ambience wise, it five star from my side! It is within walkable distance from Mandirtala bus stand. I am glad to have visited such a theme-based restaurant in Shibpur.
The staff are very cordial. 
Coming to food, I absolutely loved the Masala kulcha, Butter naan and Kadai chicken. We all ended up craving for more! We had Reshmi kabab as well which was well-prepared and very soft.
However, I did not like the mocktails and it can be improved. Prices are reasonable. 
Definitely a must-go place for all food lovers!

A sudden visit to Shibpur Mandirtala area was on fate and even visiting this place was on my luck. I cannot exactly tell you the location as i was too new to the place but you can follow the address and Google map.¬†
The entire ambiance and getup of this restaurant is adapted from the Movie "Pirates of the Caribbean". From the Main door to the sittings, interiors and exteriors are being made to give you the feel of the movie. Dim lights and quite environment makes the meal more peaceful here.¬†
Tried their Paneer Reshmi Butter Masala and Butter Nan and in the Dessert we had Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Syrup.

Paneer Reshmi Butter Masala- Served really hot and smelling amazing. The creamy texture was mouth watering so was the lip smacking hot paneer in it. Tasted buttery and yummy. No complaints with the quality of the Paneer used. Gravy was sufficient for two person. Recommended.

Butter Nan - Usually we find butter nan divided into two big pieces but they did it into three. We had two butter Nan which completely filled our stomach with its softness and taste of butter. Complemented the Butter Paneer very well.

Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Syrup - Full marks for the presentation. Three or four scoops of vanilla ice cream being served with chocolate syrup over it. Nothing to explain it much rather than the good presentation.

A satisfactory visit. Pocket Pinch is on a little high side. Service is prompt.

A much needed family food joint around mandirtala area, Howrah , this place opened up with a lot of promotion and publicity all around the area. But unfortunately it has not been able to totally stand up to it's expectations. The decor is ambitious but frankly falls flat on its face to imitate the pirates of Caribbean look. And I pray that Jonny Depp never has to see his mannequin in this restaurant. 
But with all that said, the food was pretty good. We ordered cheese kebabs, chicken stir fry, and a mix noodles.  The quantity was copious and the taste praiseworthy. 
Everything on the menu wasn't available but the waiters were well behaved.

Not so good experience on my first visit. Though I asked for a parcel but love to dine here for its extra ordinary ambience. They have a good location. But not so good on their services. The service personnel need to be more trained I believe instead of being rude. Presenting of hand written manual bill is not at all expected. Last but not the least, they took much more time for billing rather than cooking. Though the prawns are smelling rotten, I finally finished my dinner by keeping them aside from my mix fried rice. I hope to see these place better on my next visit.

This place serves the worst possible fish you will ever find. They served us with fish that was rotten and stinked. The smell was so awful that it can make anyone sick. When we complained they would not acknowledge the fact and told that the fish is fresh. When we asked to see the raw fish they brought two pieces of fried fish. My mom literally puked tasting it. The owner even though being present in the restaurant would not come upfront. We were made to pay for the fish that we did not eat and were reimbursed with a four piece chilly chicken parcel. If they can pass rotten fish as fresh then imagine what would have happened if we ordered prawn. Rotten prawn can easily cause food poisoning. So please reconsider before visiting this place.

If you live in howrah, you should definitely try this place. It is less than a minute away from mandirtala, located opposite of the mandirtala cycle stand.

The place is nice. The interior decorations are very unique and it is the first theme based restaurant in Howrah. The name justifies the decoration with full of Pirates and likely stuffs around.

The food is also very good. Specially the Kababs and the Biriyani is quite good. The service is also very good. Prices are quite reasonable and tax is included in the menu price.

P.S. - If you live in kolkata, it is very easy to reach this place. Just cross the Vidyasagar Setu and you are there. Maximum 20 minutes from Exide. A place you will love after visiting for sure ‚ù§

Liked their food, environment, decor all..¬†
But what disappoint us the most is their service.. the Staffs need to be much serious and a bit professional..
My low rating is based upon their service..

lets discuss in details..

this is probably the 1st self owned Theme Restaurant in Howrah,..
yes.. there is Machan, but that belongs to a chain.. this one is unique..
they've decorated the interior like Pirates Ship, with the models of the characters from the "Pirates of the Carabian" movie series.. they also have a mocktail counter.. comfortable seating..
overall a good look n feel..

the cuisines are not based upon the theme,.. but good and tasty food..
they serve regular Indian and Chinese dishes.. we tried the both, and we liked it...
portions are also good.. we were 4, 1 fried rice, 3 nans and two side dishes 1 chicken and one mutton was good enough for us..

but the most important thing, they need to really work on their service..
the Staffs are not helpful and very slow.. it have taken a bit more time to prepare our order, and after that they've forgot to serve the Indian section of our order, we had to remind them, same thing repeated at the time of billing..
We've asked for billing, one of them confirmed, again all gone out of their mind.. they all were busy chatting together, after a long waiting we again remind them, then our bill finally came..
they meke us late of near about 30 minutes in total..

So apart from service our allover experience was good..

I have rated this place a 3 because of the interior decoration. A fan of the movie series" pirates of the Caribbean" will surely plump for this place. and why not!! The Jack Sparrow clay model is quite recognizable ;) but Only the decor cannot alone save the place. The food that we ordered were not that tasty, especially the biriyani and the tandoori chicken, luckily for me, the chinese items were better. The price when quality is considered I Felt was a bit high

Nevertheless a once visit is not a big deal.....

We had one schezwan chicken, one mixed gravy noodles, one mixed fried rice and one chicken sweet and sour. Food is good and price is moderate. We were four in number and had to pay 1060.

A nice theme restaurant inspired on the film Pirates of the Carrabian.... Ambience is good ans Staffs are cordial. Quality of food is very good as compared to other restaurants at Howrah...
I ordered :
1. Hot and Sour Chicken Soup [ 4.5 /5] : Well made , good at taste , with chunks of mushroom in it...
2. Fish Finger [2.5 /5 ] : 6 satisfactory pcs of fingers with a mayo dip but the quality of fish was not up to the mark , as¬† some part of that fish was smelly.. I would like to suggest them to use at least Basa fish as a substitute of Vekti...
3. Chicken Cheese Kebab [ 3.5 / 5 ] : Quantity is good but the taste have been better if the chicken was marinated and cooked properly... Chicken was chewy and under cooked...
4. Mix Meifoon [ 5/5 ] :¬† Good quantity and superior quality toppings like prawns and chicken was there in it... Tasted excellent...
5. Garlic Chicken [ 4 /5 ] : Six pcs. of chicken perfectly cooked in mild garlic gravy...
Best part of this restaurant is that they didn't add VAT and S. Taxes in our bill...¬† Price is pocket friendly...

24 th Nov 17 we ordered lunch delivered on time... Quantity served was good...and packing charge taken Rs 13..
We ordered:
1. Paneer tikka (2/5) : Tasteless not well marinated ...
2. Crispy chilly Babycorn (3/5): Not that spicy and crispy.
3. Devils Chicken (4/5) : Shredded chicken ,good at taste ,would have been better if served hot.
4. Zombie Fish (3/5): Bit sweet in taste which i didnt like and soft.. As it was packed instantly Tomato sauce in it was smelling...
5. Mix Meifoon (4/5) : Good at taste as well as quantity...
6. Egg veg Sechzwan fried rice (2.5/5) : Blant in taste , lacks both saltiness and spice...
Bill was around Rs. 1400 including Rs.64 GST..

Dine-In :
1.Ordered Chicken Cheese Kebabs and Butter Roti
2.Chicken Cheese Kebabs were very good but chicken was a little undercooked
3.Butter Roti was good
4.Fresh Lime Soda was good as well
5.Cost was quite reasonable
6.Many items like crab and biriyani were not available and I was told to cancel my order of Masala Kulcha because it would take around 40 mins to make as the Masala was not prepared.
Overall, it is the best multi-cuisine restaurant in this locality at this price range.

Newly opened, pocket friendly restaurant with a good decor and ambience located near mandirtala.. we went there on a Sunday evening.. We ordered fish zombie, chicken cheese kebab which is so yummy and overloaded with cheese, chicken special biriyani, chicken kasa special, mango shake and kitkat shake.. Chicken cheese kebab is a must try dish. Quantity and quality is good. Keep the good work up guys.. :)

Very unsatisfied. I tasted Chinese foods. The gravys are all same dipped in cornflower. The chicken and fish was preserved. Chowmien had a disgusting slimy  feeling . Worse in a word. The butter nun was slightly better than all . So I won't recommend it for Chinese food lovers at all.

Good food and a unique ambience for a place like Howrah. Happy to finally see a good restaurant opened in Howrah. We ordered drums of heaven for starters which was good. Main course we ordered chicken bharta, mix veg and paneer butter masala. All the dishes were good. But the tandoori roti was fully made of maida and was too strechy.  So thats where the points go down. Wish they keep the roti authentic by using whole wheat flour too.

Howrah Shibpur hasn‚Äôt had much option when it comes to dining out in a proper restaurant (baring the options available at Avani Mall). A couple of food joints have rightly taken this opportunity to dig in their place into the food lover‚Äôs mind. ‚ÄòPirates of Bengal‚Äô is one of them.

¬† ¬† Come down to Mandirtala by Vidyasagar Setu. It will be on your left, just adjacent to the Mandirtala Taxi stand. They operate from noon 12:30 till 10:30 in the night. It‚Äôs a themed restaurant, as the name suggests. Nice decorations, helpful & cordial staffs (to some extent), comfortable seating arrangements will score some points before you start to gulp down the food. 

¬† ¬† We (me & my wife) opted for Chinese & started off with soup & a starter item. The Chicken Hot & Sour soup was a usual one, the ingredients were proper & the flavors were just standard and nothing special. We liked the Hot Garlic Chicken as starter though. The Garlic flavor was proper & it was indeed hot. It tickled our taste buds to the right proportion and it was indeed a good option to choose as starter. Now, coming down to mains, we opted for Mixed Meifoon & Prawn-A-Prince (They claimed it to be their signature dish).  The meifoon was descent. The chunks of chicken, egg & prawns were apt in proportion (If not high). I personally felt it a bit bland in flavor & I had to add a pinch salt & pepper to suit to my palate. Now, their signature dish was indeed different but frankly speaking it was a spoiler to order it with Meifoon. This item was kind of a fusion of Bengali, Chinese & Continental flavors. The prawn was wrapped with Chinese flavored seasoning and cooked in a mixture of coconut milk, cream ¬†& cashew paste, topped with pieces of cherries. It was kind of oxymoron for my taste buds. Finally, not to forget, we did order Blue Lagoon as Mocktail.  It was suitably made & presented; it tasted quite nice to our liking. 

¬† ¬† But in overall, the quantity served was good for all the items. The ingredients were fresh & filling. The pocket pinch also was not high. And, one more important information is the food prices shown in the menu are inclusive of Tax. Again, considering the available the food options here in Shibpur, Howrah; this place is indeed a good buy. We would like to come down again to taste their North Indian delicacies.

Ambience is great, the theme being true to its name. The hospitality is good. 
I went there with two of my friends on a Friday evening. Initially at 7pm, there were not much people, but slowly, people started filling in. By the time we left at around 9pm, most of the tables were occupied. 
We had Chicken Sweet Corn Soup in the beginning, followed by Plain Naan, Reshmi Chicken Masala and Drums Of Heaven. Finally, two of us had Oreo Crunch Shake while the other one had Dairy Milk Shake. 
The food is just so tasty, soft and delicious. The quantity was sufficient for 2 people per plate. The shakes to the food were like cherry on the cake. 
I would really recommend all to go and check out this awesome restaurant.

Went here on this poila boishakh evening for dinner. Though the place was completely packed, we luckily got a table in just 15 mins of waiting. We ordered chicken reshmi kabab, chicken tikka masala and butter nun. They served the food as prompt as they could have on such a busy evening. Though we noticed some customers were complaining that they were waiting for their order eversince and it took forever to arrive.(few of them complained of waiting for more than 1 hour after ordering the food). So clearly the restaurant failed to manage the crowd and should have been better prepared on a day of an occasion. Anyway coming to the food, the kabab was somewhat average. But the chicken tikka masala was good. And butter nun was quite regular. The place is quite spacious. The ambience and decor was good. And the staff attending us was also very polite. All over Pirates of Bengal is worth a visit in a regular day.

I have drop by this place for the first time. Honestly I had a great expectation from this place. But I am disheartened badly. The decor is good obviously,but the food is very average. I have ordered chicken noodles and schezwan chicken. Instead of noodles they brought fried rice. The chicken clear soup is the worst in this lot. 

Decor- 4/5   
Food- 2/5
Quantity- 3.5/5

Overall it was not a pleasant experience of being there. I would preferably circumvent this place in the coming days. Thank you.

Save the ones at the Avani Mall, truly speaking there were no decent dining places in Howrah, at least South Howrah. This restaurant makes a valiant effort to counter the trend. Pirates of Bengal with its decent ambiance and great decor, pocket friendly pricing and helpful staff is the place to be for a family outing.
Food is good but there is scope for improvement. Surely worth a visit as we did yesterday evening.
Worth a 3.5 rating, by Howrah standard.

Last Monday I was there with my family. Food quality and amount is very good. Priceing is very pocket friendly. We ordered dry chilli chicken as starter and in main course Hydrabadi murg, masala kulcha, cheese kulcha, Chicken hot and sour, chicken hakka nuddles. Masala kulcha was just okay okay but other dishes are quite good. Sitting arrangements and interior decorations are very nice based upon pirates of Caribbean. Attendance & management is  bit poor. Overall good place to hangout with friends and family without worrying about expenses.
