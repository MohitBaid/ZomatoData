It was our go to place. But recently their service was very bad. Price was very high where quality of food was not up to the mark. They used to deliver food for free if the order was above 300 rs. But recently they behaved very badly and refused to deliver and demanded 100 rs charge because my order was less than 1000 rs.

Food is not bad, however the staffs are not at all cordial. We went there at 9:30pm in a normal day, they said their kitchen closes at 10:00pm so we had ordered both starter and main course togather. However it is difficult to order Roti all togather unless you start eating. We had asked for 2/3 roties later which they couldn't serve. The staff said we already told you the kitchen closes at 10:00pm. I went to so many restaurants, but never faced such situations. Even after kitchen closing time, we generally get roti or some common things. Horrible experience.

An average restaurant but a go to restaurant in the area when you are too lazy to cook food at home. The range of food is quite extensive covering Chinese, North Indian and bengali cuisine. The price is also reasonable but the quality and taste is nothing to be wowed by. The pocket pinch is the usp but the taste is a let down. Ambience is also average.

 I visited this place last week. First of all they did not allow us to sit on the sofa and the reason was that they cannot allow two person to sit on a six seater , although the whole restaurant was empty. Not a single customer was there but they were behaving as if the customers were flooding and jumping out of the window. 
Food was also not good at all. Please avoid this restaurant. Absolutely useless!

I had biriyani many a time and other dishes also . For a small friends party it is the ideal place to hang out and the iteams are pocket friendly as a school going teenager can also give treats to his or her friends , located at gorabazar .

I tasted almost every food here! My favorites are tooty-frooty , cold coffee, pan cake, kebabs, Chinese.... üíû

But my most favourite is Mixed Fried Rice and Red Cook Chicken üíú

A place where you can celebrate any of your friend's Birthday and can take a good meal from him/her. ü§ò
Can go with your partner or children. It's a place for everyone and specially a perfect place to go for a lunch/dinner with FAMILY. ‚ò∫

The place is a nostalgia for the people of dum dum as maybe it was the first multi cuisine restaurant in dum dum. The place is also quite nice and stuffs are also professional but the food standard is slowly degrading in years while the price is increasing gradually.

A sober and good place to dine out with family in this neighbourhood. In spite of it's location in the middle of busy and chaotic market-place of Gorabazar, the ambience is peaceful. The food is not that great but of standard quality and the menu is the usual varieties of Chinese, Mughal and Indian. The price is a bit high compared to other eateries in the locality but I personally feel it is worth it, given the quality of food and service.

Undoubtedly one of the best bar cum restaurant in dumdum/cantonment area. Located within a 2 mins walking distance from catonment rail station. Debonair is a 2 storeyed building where ground floor is dedicated to general bar and family bar and the 1st floor is only for family dining. Rate of food and alcohol are very nominal. Smoking is allowed in the washroom site in both the floors. Food quality is awesome - you can go for chinese,indian and whatever you want, Debonair won't disapoint you.

I happen to visit there bar it is PATHETIC,UNPROFESSIONAL AND TIPS HUNGRY WAITERS. actually I would like to mention a event that happened with me .I was sharing the table with another person after getting my seat I ordered for drinks and chilly chicken they bought the drink and after around 15 mins the person next to me gave the waiter a tip of Rs 100 and ordered for chilly chicken as parcel after another 15 mins his parcel is brought to his table and I was kept waiting ,then I protested as I have ordered early ,the waiter kept quite and argued with me that he is a preferential customer then I cancelled by chilly chicken.i simply asked for the bill I paid the amount in cash in the bill folder the waiter got it paid and returned to my table.i took the bill out and did not keep any change .He again came back to check the folder for tips he again started asking for the bill I told after being paid it is my property he aging started a argument.
Lastly I won't advise any one to visit the bar the worst in the cantonment area I would rather advise to go to pleasure but instead better professionally managed.

There was a time while growing up when Debonair was the 2nd 'multi-cuisine restaurant' in Gora Bazar area after Pleasure Hut. From that time we would go there and have family lunches and dinner and that would be a special occasion for us kids. At that time at-least a decade back, noodles used to be around 60 bucks and a plate of steamed momo came at 40-45 bucks with good seating and service in an air conditioned restaurant. The reason I write this is because this was a part of growing up and learning what a restaurant meant. After many years and eating in multitude of place in india and abroad, my parents always order that plate of steamed momo when I am back in Kolkata. Trust me the taste has not changed a bit. I see my younger cousins still going and spending fun time in the restaurant. Debonair has come a long way and still holds a lion share of restaurant business in the area and rightfully so. People who used to order 10-15 yrs back are still loyal. Now they have a bar and deliver food as well. 
I have had almost all dishes in the menu for sure. Even the horrible pineapple chicken my first GF used to love so much. Biriyani, dry chilli chicken , Hakka noodles , Fish finger with tartar sauce are all great. Please try the steamed momos if you happen to visit.
That said I can confidently say Debonair does not need a food review to do business but maybe writing a review would familiarise it with people visiting the Cantonment area.
The place was fav and will always be. Debonair will always be the most famous rest in Gorabazar and very rightfuly so.

Food is good, ambiance and seating is great and you can see the bustling market below.
Will visit or order momos always from Debonair even if Tibetan people come and setup a stall here. I am rating it 4 star but adding that being consistently there for years is what matters in my book.

Thanks for years of great service to the people of Cantonment. Kudos to you guys.

When the place first opened, it was better than a city restaurant with its glitzy interiors, live band and delicious multicuisine food. However, after the passage of the years it's become a tad downmarket. The food is still great and other debonair products have cropped up near the restaurant, like a confectionery, takeaway, etc. It is a good place Still to have a meal out in the suburbs of dum dum. It has made a name for itself in the area. It is a hallmark dum dum brand in the food scenario.

Debonair is a great restaurant located in Gorabazar Area... They have a huge menu card and they make a lot of items... I love their hot and sour soup... One of the best in Calcutta... The quantity is great and the prices are reasonably good... It's a nostalgic place for me... It was around when there were very less restaurants in our locality and they made delicious food...

Go to option for the sudden dinner plans.
Located a steps off Dum Dum Cantonment railway station.
The restaurant is located on the first floor. The decor is okayish, nothing fancy.
Staff is cooperative. 
But the food is amazing at those prices.
Recommended: Mixed Fried Rice, Chinese Chicken dishes, Chicken Sizzler, Chopsuey and Indian Mutton items.
Prices are decent as well. Won't burn a hole in your pocket.

Ordered a plate of Kashmiri Badam Pulao and Chilly Chicken. The chilly chicken was more or less okay. No complaints. The pulao was better. Good quality rice was used. The ambience is nice. Staffs are slow on their feet. Took ages to serve the food. After calling for the waiter thrice, he came to take our order.

Well, to begin with this is the restaurant where you will find me hanging out with my family every now and then. Been visiting the restaurant since my childhood days and till date nothing has changed. Now that's a good thing because the food is affordable as it always was, the ambience inside is good( not great) and the waiters are very cordial. Try their Fried fish and Mixed Hakka Noodles.

It's a local restaurant near my place. 
We r there to enjoy some family moments.. 
But they make it worst...  Ohh its just horrible.. 
Momo is hard like hell.. 
No difference between ghee rice and biriyani.. 
Noodles is tasteless...  And most horrible  part is they claim betki in fish Manchurian but its not by taste ..

On the family restaurant me we some of friends celebrated  a party for our success in an online game named CLASH OF CLANS.üòÇüòÅ. We had biriyani, fried rice, chilli chicken, Hunan chicken, n some Indian chicken dishes. Food was good both in quality n quantity. Later I visited the bar with a friend. The bar is clumpsy, not well decorated n the waitors here lack manners. Still the fish fingers n dry chilli chicken I ordered were so tasty.. That's y I m giving it a high score.

A friend who lives in the locality had taken me to this restaurant for a small treat. We'd had chicken biryani and mutton masala accompanied with cucumber salad as per my friend's choice. The biryani had been plain normal. Mutton too had been decent enough. As far as ambiance, interior, or North Indian food go, this place is just okay. If one expects upscale avant garde cuisines then one would be disappointed.

A pretty good restaurant at Dum Dum Cantonment, considering no other such place is available nearby.
This place opened up in the late 90's, and we literally grew up going to Debonair for all occasions. Be it birthdays or Durga pujas, or a reunion of cousins.
In the beginning, a mixed fried rice would cost something like Rs. 75, so prices haven't gone up that much after 20 years.
Quite decent food and good portions. Though not authentic, the Chinese dishes used to be, and still are the best compared to everything else.
The pizzeria that opened up some years back is not up to the mark though.
This place is quite popular with locals, and they also have special menus on occasions.

A small restaurant near my place. Debonair serves Chinese & North Indian dishes. But I like their Chinese items better. 2 days back we went for dinner. The honey glazed chicken in starter was really very good. Mixed fried rice was nice. Their red cook chicken is very spicy, sweet & sour chicken is also good, so as hot garlic chicken. Previously tried their Indian items, all were decent. They play live music which is bit loud. For a sudden lunch or dinner plan this place is the best one in my locality.

Very spacious floor,good for small parties and outing with family. The food here is failsafe, nothing to blow your mind nothing to break your heart.

My recommendations here:-
Sweet and sour soup 
Keema biryani
Red cook chicken
Chilly mutton 
*Chilly mutton is not in the menu any more but thy still cook it for old and loyal customers like me.

Limited parking space is available here.

They also have a bar and a off shop in the ground floor, the restaurant is in second floor. Though I opt for the lower floor options more I know the food here very well as thy have one  kitchen for both.

I have had loads of things. Biryani to Chicken dishes and trust me, they're all good. Really good. They take a bit of time to serve but it's worth it. So if you leave nearby, do visit.

Come here countless times, order home deliveries, used to buy pizza and sandwiches from their live takeaway counter (they closed that one down, sigh!). The servers are friendly, the management staff courteous, their delivery is Prompt with a CAPITAL 'P'. In short, for me, they are life savers. Their fish fries are really great. They offer a large variety of dishes and the quality of the ingredients are good. The taste, however, is average to good. They have recently increased the price of the dishes, but compared to other restaurants that charge similarly, their portions are a bit less. Still, it would not have been a problem if their dishes stood out. But, sadly, they come to the threshold, but never manage to go the rest of the way. I would have given a 3.5, but the ambience of the place could have been better. They have kept the tacky devour that they had used when they opened the place many years ago. Its big time they change it and bring in some tasteful stuff. There is a live band on weekends, but they are at times loud and discourage conversation. Some relaxing and soothing instrumental tracks would really be great and I would happily give them a 4.0.

Great place for a place to eat with friends and family. The prices before was nearly pocket friendly but now the revised prices are high for the quality they serve. I have been eating here for many years and i have to say that the quality has deteriorated. And i would advise everyone to not visit here during the busy days like in the pujas or holidays where the crowds are lining up in front of the restaurant. The foods are not quite up to the mark those days.
I remember some years back i visited this place and i ordered a mutton roganjosh and butter nun. And i have to say the mutton roganjosh was amazing that day. I literally cleared up the plate, it was so good.

The food is okay - they have a decent amount of options but the cost is very high with respect to the quality of the food.

We got our food delivered, so I cannot talk about ambiance and stuff - their ordering was simple and no hassles.

The quality for the price is however the choke point in my view.

Deboniar is the one of the best family restaurant near dumdum area.where you will get varities types of food.My parents Wedding anniversary celebrated here 2004-2011.Every year my father treated us in Deboniar.I tasted here all items.Their chinese items are better than north indian,mughlai foods.Their mixed fried rice,lemon chicken,mixed chowmein,chicken manchurian are very good taste.The quantity of their food is good.service is slow.waiters are polite & helpful.lots of seating arrangements are here.price is also moderate.

Have been visiting this place seen i was only 5-6 years old..this place has really seen me growing up! Some of the waiters has been replaced..but some old are serving today also with utmost care and love for their old as well as new customers. The decor is nothing special..decent and like any other local restaurant. Now coming to the food..to be honest 'debonair' has lost it's quality of food. May be the owner now-a-days is trying to make more profit by serving customers with as minimum quality as possible. The chicken..be it chinese or indian or anything..doesn't seem freshly cooked at all..rather tastes stale. Moreover..what meat am i talking about..they hardly give any meat in their dishes now! It's 95% bones and 5% meat..and in their so called boneless chicken i find other stuff more than chicken meat. You have to literally scrounge through the dishes to find the least amount of meat. Now i really don't feel like coming back to this place unless it's an emergency. Now the only thing i loved that is left with good repute here is the russian salad and mixed fried rice. Both are mouth savouring and extremely delicious. This is the only thing left here which attracts me sometimes. Other than that..this place has lost it's value!

I and my wife had recently availed the restaurant's 'special bengali cuisine' during Durga pujas. The food was very good, though being not too spicy and along with the thirteen items including unlimited fried rice/pulao helpings, it was more than one could ask within a reasonable pocket pinch. We look forward to what 'Noboborsho platter' has to offer and expect the restaurant to organise more such mouth watering events for the bengalis

I and my family have been a regular here since a long time, i have been going to this restaurant ever since i was a little kid.¬† Among the two restaurants in DumDum this has to be my personal favorite.

The Interiors of the hotel is really very nice and clean, theres a very decent spread of tables with some comfortable sofas as well, enough to accomodate large family get-togethers easily. There's a live band playing in the evenings, they play all the new bollywood numbers mostly and are quite good in their work.

The staff's behaviour is warm and welcoming, with always a smile on their face. They really treat one like a family, and on being regulars they even remember your regular choices. The staff are very well trained and hardly ever mess up their work they are prompt at their service as well.

Their home delivery service is also really appreciatable as they always deliver piping hot food that too within a very short time even on rainy days.

About the food, they have a large variety of dishes and different cuisines to choose from. Their food is quiet impressive and will never let you down. From the non veg spread to the veg they maintain the quality of the food and their servings are quite ample in nature.

Over all the food is tasty,delicious,wont dissapoint and is a good value for money.

I have had the opportunity to go to this place quite a number of times. Though the location is not really appealing, but once you enter the restaurant, be assured that your meal will be good. Among the soups they offer, my personal favorite is debonair special soup. I specifically like the chicken in hot garlic sauce and Cantonese chicken. The sizzler is also good. Schezuan style fried rice is good. I never had experience in trying out the Indian dishes. I once tried their spl. pizza and liked quite a bit. Their quantity of food is not bad. The live orchestra facilitates the ambiance. However, sometimes it becomes too noisy because of the fellow customers. Considering the price you pay, its a quite good deal.

Used to be a regular here during childhood days when i visited my aunt who resides in DumDum. It was a craze back then. I remember going to Debonair for the first time to see the place is crowded by enthusiastic foodies who were more than excited to welcome a good eating joint in their locality for the first time. As kids we loved eating chinese and always ordered our favourite chilly chicken and chowmein. it was after years that i visited Debonair the other day with my aunt and uncle again and i was excited to see the place again. We ordered fried rice, steam rice and chilly chicken and fish. The food tasted the same still. it was a trip down memeory lane actually and a nostalgic experience.

Though I had to travel a long distance to reach this place, but I must say it is a decent place to hang out with friends especially when your budget is on the lower side. Food is good, Alcohol is cheap, Ambience is ok,Waiters are well behaved,Service is on time,No delays.
In short this place is going to be on my list towards month ends when I have a crunch with funds.

I have been hearing a lot about this please from a long long time back but i have never been able to go here. Recently when my friend shifted near by, it gave me a chance to eat here. 
  Debonair located in the interiors of dumdum. The decor is very pretty. And I have heard there are live musicians who play in the evening but i haven't seen them myself. The seating arrangement is good as there are quite a few numbers tables and this place is quite clean and beautifully decorated. I wanted to order a side dish with an Indian bread but I was told they had no bread during that hour so we changed our minds. They were two of us so we ordered for a mutton biryani and chicken garlic chowmein (hakka) for ourselves. And ask them to pack a vegetable fried rice and chilli chicken dry for is to take back. This service is very slow it took them a long time to serve us our food. When it came the biryani looked good and so did the chowmein. The biryani tasted good and even the mutton was quite wholesome so was the potato. On the other hand the chowmein was very spicy but very good to taste, I can eat very hot food so it was good for me but others would find this chowmein extremely spicy so that was a draw back. By the time we finished our meals our take away was ready. The staff was well behaved and courteous and swift when it came to taking the order or serving us the bill etc. Are total rounded up to rs 500 which i consider as pocket friendly. The food was also worth its value and tasted quite good. Though I had very less time at and that is why i couldn't try anything else. They have a lot on their menu si next time I will have to have something more than there usuals. All in all not a bad place at all and its definately worth coming. Happy eating.

I would definitely had rated this place zero but a courteous behaviour from the guy behind the bar saved my mood a little. I was in area for some reason and it started raining. So my friend suggested wr grab a bite and a drink.  So we went to this place. It was dark and smelled like a drunken alley but since I was hungry so ordered Chinese thinking it as a safe option. I mean what can go wrong in fried rice and chilli chicken. My friend ordered a paneer tikka too. Well it took like an hour for the order to arrive and the paneer was missing. Meanwhile I was enjoying my scotch and a good conversation. Twenty more minutes and the paneer arrived. I had just a few spoonful of rice and a portion of a chilli chicken and it was so bad that I had to gulp down another glass of scotch just to remove the taste of the chicken. My friend tried lifting the paneer tikka and it broke into tiny pieces. The guy behind the bar saw my disgust and told me he was very sorry for the inconvenience. The said he shall replace the order but I had no intention of torturing myself again. So paid the check and left. If you just need a drink and no food and can survive the dark and smelly bar then you might try or else just stay away.

I have lost count of how many times I've been to this place with my family. Two minutes walk from Gorabazar auto stand, Debonair has never let me down. It has a homely ambience, the service is good, the food is amazing and it's not hard on the pocket as well. Even after so many years, they have still maintained their quality, and I really hope they do it in the future as well.
I've tried almost everything on their menu, which in itself, is a Herculean task since Debonair has a lot of varitey. But Garlic Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice and American Chop suey will always be a favorite.

I have been to this place since my childhood and I can definitely say it's one the best restaurant in my area. Reasonable prices and good seating facility. Recently I organised my parent's anniversary there with a private party. And was really helped by them. The staff was quite decent. One of the positive things about this place is that it is located at very proper area. My favourites from this place are Mixed Fried rice and Chicken Wringlet then my fav Chicken Manchurian. You can also try the different desserts that they have. They are quite good.

this place is located in gorabazar with little or no options it is regarded the best in  the area
about the stall 
i had the best chicken sandwich ever ..in this place .it has pine apple in it which really gives a great taste boost and the sauce they serve with is so unbelievably extraordinarily fantastic 
the burgers are no good but i did like the pizza its fairly nice
now coming to the main restaurant
i have never been to the restaurant at peak time 
we friends always used to go in the afternoon so that we get good seats 
the waiters are very rude .. they have this air of superiority which really drives me mad 
but no complaining about the food 
they have a fairly versatile  menu the chinese , the north indian all are the usual tasty ......they have a good variety of fried rice and i quite like them all 
but the star of the party is their american chop suey it is really good 
overall good ambiance 
price is okay .....

hope this place maintains its good quality over time

Debonair was one of the two big restaurants Gorabazar first acknowledged, the other being Pleasure Hut. holding this important position, Debonair served awesome food on the first few years of its opening, but now the food quality has deteriorated. But still, Debonair shines high for their service. 
The food quality is good, if not great, and the ambiance is nice. The waiters are homely, and they are good with opinions when you are in a dilemma over some particular dishes. You'll never be turned down on any item, its praiseworthy, that they are always ready with each item on the menu. The price is good, way too cheap compared to other places. The quantity is plenty.
Over the years we have ordered almost everything , because being a resident of Cantonment, Debonair was the only option for every occasions, be it birthdays or a simple Puja day lunch. Their soups are very good, and the rice preparations also. The Chinese is better to be avoided, and so are the Thai dishes. their Veg Pulao and Chicken Bharta are awesome. The Paneer Tikka and Naans are worth a try. The Sizzlers are mouthwatering,and the way they serve them is nice. Ice creams and the Dessert options are also good. 
I have no idea about the Bar downstairs, but the Delivery counter has good food, the Pizzas being one.
During the four days of Durga Puja, Debonair offers a lunch plan(Bangalee food) for each day, whcih is good too.
Overall, Debonair is a good place with homely atmosphere, and its great for hungry shopaholics of the Gorabazar.

Its a few minutes walk from my residence..... it was good enough during its initial phase.... and in a locality which lacks good restaurants it excelled business wise to some extent.... but during my recent visit it dissappointed me alot.... not only the quality of the food which has degraded but also the homely feel of it.... the prices are still reasonable and it can be regarded as an option only when you have no other choice left.... located in the heart of gorabazar it gets overcrowded during the peak seasons..... i would like to see it back to its initial form again..... best of luck.....

I have seen the up and down of this restaurant. The quality, quantity and service has definitely deteriorated over the past few years. Sometimes during fastive occasions it becomes a bit irritating to paying them good amount of money for a average to poor quality of food. It's a multi cuisine restaurant where only the Indonesian cuisine are really good. The Biryani and other Indian cusines has surely average but still it stands as one of the best in the the locality.

Not very famous restaurant but when you reach there and see the variety of food they offer you will be amazed for sure. Quality of food is also very good. Deboniar ambiance is not very bad either. But I have some issues with their tax price. Take away service is very good in this restaurant. Highly recommended for the food quality and variety.

Debonair was one of the two big restaurants Gorabazar first acknowledged, the other being Pleasure Hut. holding this important position, Debonair served awesome food on the first few years of its opening, but now the food quality has deteriorated. But still, Debonair shines high for their service. 
The food quality is good, if not great, and the ambiance is nice. The waiters are homely, and they are good with opinions when you are in a dilemma over some particular dishes. You'll never be turned down on any item, its praiseworthy, that they are always ready with each item on the menu. The price is good, way too cheap compared to other places. The quantity is plenty.
Over the years we have ordered almost everything , because being a resident of Cantonment, Debonair was the only option for every occasions, be it birthdays or a simple Puja day lunch. Their soups are very good, and the rice preparations also. The Chinese is better to be avoided, and so are the Thai dishes. their Veg Pulao and Chicken Bharta are awesome. The Paneer Tikka and Naans are worth a try. The Sizzlers are mouthwatering,and the way they serve them is nice. Ice creams and the Dessert options are also good. 
I have no idea about the Bar downstairs, but the Delivery counter has good food, the Pizzas being one.

It is located in the busy locality of Gorabazaar, occupying a part of the Ground Floor & the 1st Floor of a Residential cum commercial complex.It serves multicuisine and the food prepared & served deserves a rating of 3.5 on a scale of 5.Overall rating that I have given is based on the negative factors like locale & ambience(it is too noisy at times!).They also  have live instumental music being played in the evening on week ends.A separate section for take-aways  is always  busy with customers!I like  some of their  preparations like Fish Roll with Potato Fingers & Salad., Chicken Wings ,Debonair Special Soup, Zaffran Pulao  &  Keema Matar in particular.They also make good Biryani, better than most available in the locality or vicinity of Dum Dum/Jessore Road.During the festive season they come up with special  Buffet and serve exotic Bengali Preparations which is very smartly priced.

I am very happy to have a few of my relatives in north kolkata,and the only good thing they've done to me is to take me to this place for dinner whenever i am invited. They have quite a few confectionary outlets here and there but the restaurant is located in the crowded Gora bazar. The ambience is nice,i particularly like it during puja when they get an orchestra. The food now,the north Indian and Chinese cuisine are equally tasty. This is the best restaurant in that area!

Debonair is the best restaurant in this locality in terms of food quality, service, ambiance and affordability. It is a multi cuisine restaurant and it is a good place to have dinner or lunch with family. Every year during Durga Puja they arrange a special Bengali lunch menu for 5 days which is awesome. Parking is a real problem but not a big issue though.

this is a very nice restaurant in the bye lanes of Gorabazar. the food is awesome at this location and the ambience is also very nice. they have an extremely elaborate menu and do sufficient justice to the taste buds.the parking is a serious problem and its better to not go on a four wheeler.

Situated in the heart of Dumdum Gorabazar, this place is good for a family visit. Food items are all reasonably priced and ambience is also good. Since this one is situated in more of a residential area, it is a favourite for regular diners in the locality
                    
Visited once more time on 16-Oct-2017 and found the prices to have increased. But the food quality is consistent and quite good. We had dry chill chicken, plan naan, mixed noodles and baby corn and mushroom in schezwan sauce. Needless to say, the last item was quite spicy but taste was good. For the noodles, both taste and quantity were good. So, overall it was a very satisfactory experience and consistent with their standards

A personal local favourite. A restaurant with a spacious appeal and an ambiance worth of a visit. And if you are lucky you are to get a treat of live orchestra. I enjoy this place and the food too. This restaurant specializes in Indonesian cuisine and the items are lip-smackingly good. The Chinese items on offer are often hastily prepared but that is mostly expected to be a rare case. A very good restaurant for a dine in with your family, friends or your loved one, and it's sure to leave a smile on your face and pocket once you leave.

Its a spacious restro with good ambience and quality food...mainly like 2 of their prepration very much..nasegoreng (indonesian prepration of rice with 2 sticks of kebab & prawn chips) and patani ( somewhat like boneless mutton chilli)...prices are reasonable and staffs are well behaved...but car parking is a problem out here since the roads are narrow and over crowded
