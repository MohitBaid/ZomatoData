Had a lovely dinner here at Oceanic. There is a lavish spread boasting of a huge variety of dishes to try.
There is a live phuchka counter where you make your own phuchka. There was chaat as well.
In the main course I had Chilli Garlic noodles, Schezwan Fish, Aloo Dum, Dal Fry, Pulao with Mutton amd Paneer butter Masala.The Roasted chicken was a completely new item I tried and I fell in love with it. There were other items on the menu but I had to save room for the desserts as well.
For the desserts I had Lemon tart which was superb. I also had Sweet Curd(Misti doi), Goja, Nolen gurer sandesh, Kiwi Lamington and Malpua.
It was quite a pleasant experience and I would look forward to visit this place again.

Located at the heart of Kolkata i.e Dharmatala ,this place is a delight as they serve some amazing food with great hospitality. Currently they are providing some best Al a carte menu for the New Year party from appetizers to wholesome main course to delicious desserts. 

Honestly you will be spoilt for a choice to choose what to eat and what not as all are equally stumptouous. Some of the items that I tried there- Phuckha , Alu Kabli , Dahi vada, roasted chicken, paneer butter masala, noodles, mutton pulao, chicken chap, kiwi lanington, honey and ginger pudding, chocolate cake, nolen gurer sandesh.


Oceanic is holding back the culture of Kolkata by adding Kolkata's patent street foods like Phuchka and Alu Kabli. It was a pleasant experience dining over there. The staffs were courteous. So do drop in by the Oceanic this December or January to try their amazing Al a carte menu.
Happy eating.

What a pleasant experience at Oceanic - the Peerless Inn with Team Panch Phoron this festive season. Their a la carte menu is something to must try. From phuchka - chaat stall to main course to assorted delectable desserts.. we had one amazing evening spent here amidst the well hospitality of the restaurant and cordial ambiance. Coming to the food , let me start from the appetizers -
° There was an adorable Phuchka parlour at one corner , playfully decorated with vibrant colors, you simply can't miss it! All spices and condiments arranged in pots and plates. Phuchkas, aloo kaabli, chaat etc were available.

° Then we moved to the main course -
• Vegetable Biryani - Delectably prepared with seasonal vegetables and spices. Full of flavours.
• Paneer butter masala - again, very nicely done. Paneer pieces in buttery gravy.
• Aloo dum - Spicy potatoes well cooked, goes well with biryani.
• Masaledar Arvi
• Bhindi do Piaza - I really liked this dish. So well cooked I must say. Ladies finger roasted and smeared in spices and gravy. Bhindi lovers' delight.
•Hakka noodles
•Seasonal vegetables in baked bean sauce
• Potato Douphinoise - Baked potatoes in white gravy with cheesy garnishing and herbs on top. It was okay in taste though. Nothing special.
• Vegetable Hot Pot - Mixed seasonable vegetables well sauteed.
• Raita
•Curd rice

°Coming to the favourite part, the area that caught everyone's attention from the inception - the desserts !
• Malpua - Warm malpua dipped in sugar syrup. Yummy like anything.
• Ginger and honey cakes - warm cakes out of ginger and honey. I really liked them. Perfect for winter dessert.
• Chocolate gateaux- The star of the evening. So delicious,we had more and more of it.
• Goja
•Kiwi lemington
•Lemon Tart
• Dahi vada - sweet , tangy and yummy.
• Sweet curd

There were a miscellany of other dishes wgich I was too full to even try but eyed on nevertheless. Do try out the splendid a la carte menu at Oceanic and you would not be let down. :)
Bon appetite.

Oceanic, The Peerless Inn Kolkata is one such restaurant in kolkata that always tries to re-invent itself with its all new food and hospitality. Apart from having a wonderful staff that looks after your staycation at the Hotel, it also hosts several food festivals that go on throughout the year. Team Panch Phoron got an opportunity to experience one such food festival at Oceanic, The Peerless Inn, Kolkata this week known as “Jash-e-Hyderabadi”.

The Peerless Inn's Oceanic is mainly for the grand buffet offerings. I visited the place during their Hyderabadi food festival and it was an experience. 

Jashn-E-Hyderabad, as it was named, was offering a full course of meal - full of chicken, ghosht, prawn. However I found that their Hyderabadi biriyani lacked that touch of aroma and spicey. It was bit dull - may be due to the fact there are many guests from overseas.

Ambience wise Oceanic is great, but many would count Rs 1695 for lunch/dinner buffet a bit costly while similar experiences can be found at Rs 800-1000.

 Although I am not a big fan of vegetarian food, yet I loved all of their veg inclusions in this special buffet alongwith their Gosht Biriyani Dum ka Murgh and Machhi Methi Masala. The succulent pieces of mutton just melted in the mouth giving me ample amount of reason to have more of it. This Hyderabadi food festival will continue till the 26th of November, so if you are a fan of Hyderabadi cuisine, you must visit Oceanic for these mouthwatering dishes and you can thank me later for it.

India is full of different culture and tradition! Different culture means different way of expression in terms of colour, love and food. And when it comes about Biryani, the name of Hyderabad and Lucknow comes in everyone's mind. But Hyderabad is not about only Biryani, it has its own food culture.

To celebrate that food culture from the Capital of Bengal, The Peerless Inn, Kolkata celebrating Jashan-E-Hydrabad, Hyderabadi food festival at its own multicuisine restaurant, The Oceanic.

Team Munching Monks was invited their for the Bloggers' meet to celebrate this festival. Thank you Ms. Soumi Sarkar for the invitation & such lovely hosting.
Special thanks to Team Peerless INN for such warm hospitality.

Now come to those special Hyderabadi dishes, that were introduced to us. The dishes were -

1. Khatti Dal
- Little bit of tangy flavoured dal, which goes perfect with steamed rice.

2. Bhagara Baigan
- Frankly, I'm not a big fan of eggplant, but the well cooked curry makes me fan of 
it.

3. Paneer Lababdar
- This one is the heaven for the paneer lover. Small cube sized Paneer war cooked in fingerlicking grevy. Perfect item with indian bread.

4. Subz Kofta in Palak Gravy
- I don't tried this item, so can't say about it.

5. Macchi Methi Masala
- In bengal, fish curry means fish with curry made of mustard and poppy seeds but when it comes about Hyderabad style, they added methi in the curry. Lite in taste but feels good.

6. Dum Ka Murgh -
Chicken dish with less spicy curry. The chicken pieces were soft, juicy in nature. Perfect accompanied with Biriyani or Indian bread.

7. Vegetable Dum Biriyani
- Veg Biriyani with aroma of natural spices and ingredients. You will not get the traditional smell but if you are a Vag foodie, you will surely love it.

8. Kacchi Gosht Ka Biriyani
- Crush for every Non veg lover. Soft tender mutton pieces with yummy flavoured rice makes it a divine one. Not so oily buy the touch of Hyderabadi flavour makes it different from traditional Kolkatan Biriyani. Overall excellent.

Oceanic also has its own buffet menu which also includes some finger licking Starter, main couses and desserts. The menu of the buffet are as follows -

Starters :
-----------------
Orange Surprise
Dahi Vada

Curd Rice
Tandoori Vegetable Salad

Aloo Chaat
Peas & Tomato Salad
