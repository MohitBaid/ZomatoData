This restaurant is near chinar park..I have ordered food couple of times. Food is cheap & about the quality nothing great but I like their seafood preparations, like prawns chilli dry & prawns schezwan. Overall not a bad option when u r hungry & u want home delivery..also, if u stay beyond 2km from this restaurant & still want to order then try swiggy or food panda..they might be of help..

While returning from office last Friday, we stopped over to have some snacks. Looking at the menu we decided to have egg chicken roll. The roll counter is outside and if u opt for a takeaway, they will charge 10 rupees less :)
The paratha was being made and we were staring at the process for the same, the moment the paratha was placed on the oil on the big frying pan, it started to flap like "luchi". Next, while putting the egg on the pan, he didn't use any salt. Finally when he started to pour the pre-made chicken as stuffings inside the roll, we objected and asked him to fry them again.
The roll was finally delivered - Not that mouthgasmic but as we were too hungry, we grabbed it in no time.
Not sure about other items, but by going with the roll only, I wont recommend this place.

the most thirclass restaurant ever .I had ordered 2 sets of chicken rolls and they tell me they only deliver upto 2 kilometers .I told them that i have gotten order from your restaurant .They were rude as hell and told me stating no we cannot deliver at all " it is beyond 2 kilometers of delivery . new rule of the government .Tried to argue back stating they never made delivery once i said they had in the past and hang up the call .I had to get harassed and call zomato to get the order cancelled

We ordered tandoori roti, butter naan and chicken tikka masala for home delivery. The roti was a bit hard but the naan was really soft. The chicken was average. They take a bit of time for delivery.

Saying about this restaurant it is surely a budget restaurant and greatly pocket friendly. A great option for people who want decent food without splurging much. Also being in a prime location near City Centre 2 it can also be an option for people visiting there. Food quality may not be extraordinary but good enough to suit everyone's pallettes. Try out their Chinese cuisine which is worth recommending although along my 3 visits there Chinese was the only thing I tried. Ambience is ordinary with service being one factor that has quite the scope for improvement.

This a good place for ordering to my place. Because it is cheap and enough quantity for me. Ordered 2 times from here. I have satisfied but not overwhelmed. Ordered mutton biriyani and chicken reshmi kabab and mixed fried rice. Believe me their rice preparation is very good but in other hand their other prescription is not up to the mark. Biriyani and fried rice is good but the reshmi kabab is very bad in taste.

They could have gone for some other name cause it sure doesn't sound like an eating place. Just the dhaba word makes it so.

The place looked average and so was everything else from food to service. Good option for ordering in monsoons as delivery is prompt.

I am really surprised by seeing such a low rate for this place in zomato. For now,i am truly satisfied and contented with my first visit here.

We were in search for a pocket friendly restaurant with soothing atmosphere near the chinar park area when zomato served as a saviour and finally we found this place out to satiate our hunger during the late afternoon. Our first preference went to `jiban jamuna' due to their ratings compared to this place but as we went there we found that they are having some electrical problems due to which ac or ceiling fan couldn't be facilitated. So,largely disappointed we headed towards rangeela dhaba and found out the saying "whatever happens,happens for the good" is actually true.

The place has no ambience,it is only a small eatery with small chairs,but still they have managed an ac to comfort their customers. The place can accommodate a maximum of 15-20 people at a time. Small paintings are hung on the walls to enhance the little beauty.
The place is absolutely pocket friendly. We ordered 1 plate chicken momo for starters,1 plate chicken fried rice and 1 plate chicken with baby corn and capsicum. The food took some time to arrive. But as they say...you have to wait for the best...and here was the best! The momos were truly awesome...it came with 8 pieces and all of them were filled with ample amount of mashed chicken and the soup was equally delightful which came with floating spring onions. It had a buttery smell and taste to it. Such flavorful and tasteful momo serving outlets are very rare in the area.
The chicken fried rice had a huge quantity which was enough to be shared. It was also prepared with ample amount of chicken chunks and egg. It was equally tasty and flavorful. The rice was cooked to perfection and the smell itself was very attractive.
The chicken with baby corn and capsicum came with 8 chicken pieces which was really delectable. The chicken pieces were soft and succulent and the taste of the gravy was very pleasant.

All the above 3 items are highly recommended and am sure more visits here by people would really increase their rates because its one of the very rare pocket friendly places which serves really awesome food which encourages your hunger and appetite more. Only increase of serving speed and better ambience would earn them a 5 from my side. Keep up the good work.:-)

Food is above average than what you would get in the nearby area. But only one service staff is present. Ambiance is poor. 

But the deal breaker for me was my inability to eat metal. Cause the dear restaurant had served me small metal wire in my food.

Average food, average service. Nothing special about it. Mostly their chinese dishes are ok. I had tried their chicken reshmi kabab too which I found to be below average. Quantity of dishes are good. Two people can easily share one fried rice or chowmein. They have home delivery service too which i always use.

The Description: Its just before the Chinar park Crossing.
 This Resto have changed its face every year.

The Ambience: Talking about the Ambiance so its a bit small with A.c but nice for a small restaurant.
It was a surprise visit to this place as its near the house. the Owner is really a good person and knows me personally. 
It was just after the summer, in the evening i with my cousin went here for some quick snacks.

The Food: The waiter was quick to follow us. We ordered Mixed Chowmin only.  It took 15 mins for the food to arrive. Coming to the chowmin so they make very good chowmin with decent quantity. Not very much to be expected but they really provide quality in their food. Chowmin was 8/10 according to me. Price are reasonable and affordable with good quantity. They also serve half plate for take away.

The Conclusion: For small treats and unplanned lunch or dinner u can go there, but not for a family dinner or lunch.overall an average restaurant.

A VISIT AGAIN FOR A LUNCH THIS TIME:-----We went there again but this time for Lunch.  we had Mix Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken this time. I had there Fried rice earlier also and they make decent rice here. Rice was good with egg prawn and chicken over the rice but chilly chicken was a disaster.  Really disappointed with it. They need to improve or should get a new chef now.

For the first time, I visited this place for a take away. Opted for Veg Hakka Noodles and Egg Chicken Hakka Noodles. The first one was for my wife. I liked mine for not being oily. But my wife didn't like hers as her one was bland. Pretty clean inside. Very reasonably priced. I have got a request to make to the owner of the restaurant..  Kindly add a little details to your address to enable customers locate your esteemed place easily without making them call you up; add landmarks and direction too. Placing this rating according to my first try, I would definitely love to try other options form your menu and would never mind to upgrade this rating if found really good.


Adding a recent experience with your restaurant; the above review was the very first of mine. Tried yours several times because you are one of the nearest restaurants to my residence. Today for the first time, I dared to try your Egg Chicken Gravy Noodles and Chicken Gravy Noodles. Honestly I never expected to discover coriander leaves inside. Are you experimenting or did any customer asked you to add coriander leaves in? If possible, shun it. And kindly try to improve the taste of these two items; these two carry purely bland taste. It's absolutely my opinion; others might like it.

Rangeela dhaba, according to me is a unique opportunity to gorge in the mouth-watering delicious gourmet while not straining my feeble pockets. Be it Chinese, Mughlai, or Punjabi; Rangeela dhaba excels in all. Service is good. Certainly sitting outside, you can not expect a cozy corner, but trust me a lovely relationship can be developed right there with the dose of food romanticism. I doubt if there's any such eatery in this part of the city which makes your pocket and your taste buds equally satisfied.
