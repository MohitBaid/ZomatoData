Tried Chicken Roll and Roasted Chilli Chicken Dry.
Well the Roll was unique.It was made of Rumali Roti,filled with Chicken Chunks,Capsicum,Onions and Mayonnaise.Though it tasted good but would have given full marks,if the Roll would have served hot.Fast Food must be served hot.But yeah,it was healthy enough as it was oil less.
Now lets focus on the Roasted Chilli Chicken,Dry.
This was packed in a 500ml microwave proof container.Quantity was adequate.Quality was average.
Their service is fast.
This is a small place,located at GangulyBagan more.Its a busy place.
Parking is a serious issue here,two wheeler parking is a great headache.Forget about 4wheelers.Traffic Police knocked us twice,and we were on a scooty.
Summing up,its an economical place.Food is good.But they must provide proper bills.Those are just handwritten,yet we didnt got any bills.
No experience with home delivery service.

Recently opened in Ganguly Bagan this one is small outlet. Gud food and gud customer service.. but I have only one issue. They charged me for the container which is not appreciated. If the case had been of packing of leftover food then I understand d extra charge but then for parcels they shouldn't charge for d container ....And ya what they gave was a handwritten  bill instead of a proper one.

Had ordered for a combo... V got egg noodles, chicken in hot garlic, two chicken Momo. Food yes was gud enough considering money paid for it..
