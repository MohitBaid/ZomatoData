Its a perfect place to have your daily lunch. Light on pocket and hygenicic. The seating is shared by 4 outlets, so u get fast food, south Indian, fresh juice and icecream, all at one place from 4 different brands.

Went in for lunch when I was at my client place nearby. Just loved the cool wallpaper on the walls, the service is very good.

Ordered a pulao which had a fresh raita as complimentary and even served an extra portion when asked, loved it. Recommended to try with some side dish.
Also ordered a masala dosa, which was also fresh and crisp.

Will keep visiting this place for regular lunches. The only complain to the management is to imporve its music taste, who plays 1980-90 tracks in an eatery.
