Nice place !Calm decor!

We ordered crispy chilli babycorn, french fries...the items tasted good ..but they didn't serve tomato ketchup with fries...üòî

For main course, we ordered dal-makhani, paneer tikka masala, garlic naan, masala kulcha, kabuli naan!!Dal-makhani tasted great, paneer tikka tasted good but it was quite oily!!The kabuli naan tastes awesome...must try!üëçüëç

Overall a nice place which serves good food & is budget friendly!‚ò∫Ô∏è

Ordered one special murg biryani it had 2 piece chicken and one egg with two potato
Biryani was unexpectedly turned out to be amazing and oil free
Had half plate tandoori it was a bit stiff wasn't tendered well
And Alongside we  had one chicken tikka masala and 2 tandoori roti
In short food was good and pocket friendly total cost  was 814rs
P.S GST is inclusive no burden of GST
The quality and quantity is sufficient for 3people
Ambiance is average

Chicken fried rice is without chicken :3. Food is quite costly and not up to the mark as the price demands.Service is good but the place is not clean as the other resturants.

Located near Arsalan, Hatibagan, Bagicha is a quite old restaurant in this area. They have both outdoor and indoor seatings, and serves both Chinese and Mughlai delicacies. The portion size is good, tastes amazing, and easy on pocket. A good place to go with friends and family.

Another cozy eatery taking care of dear pockets! We visited here as a group and our orders were kind of Indo-Chinese. We had crispy chicken, pan fried mixed chowmein and hot garlic chicken from the Chinese side and Naan with Chicken Bharta from the Indian side. All the dishes tasted good enough. The service is prompt and the staff is very polite. Recommending this place for future lunch or dining options.

Bagich: The first thing that comes to my mind is the ambiance,very different from other restaurants. There was an artificial fountain I remember, place was very very relaxing. Anyway now talking about the food i liked the their Biriyani more lesser spicy it was. And murg reshmi butter masala was so delicious too. I don't know about the other dishes but these two satisfied me

The place was so romantic once upon a time.. but now it losses it's glory...


The quality of food was not even up to the mark.. I was very disappointed by the quality..


We tried Malai chicken kabab and mutton biriyani.
The preparation malai chicken was good in taste but when it comes to chicken, a big NO. It was not good.

In case of mutton biriyani, the quantity, quality all was good.

Unclean. A lot of things. Even the washroom. But food is brilliant. Moderately priced. One bowl of noodles or rice can feed two people. Same with some chicken items. So the quantity is plenty for the price.

At some point of time, this was a terrific restaurant. It is still good, but needs maintenance. The food is reasonable and tasty. Easily located in the lane of Town school near hatibagan, this restaurant does not have a seating arrangement in the garden any more. Now it is indoors. We had lung Fung, cream of chicken and chicken and sweet corn in soups. All were good. The Kebabs (fish achaari and murg Malai) were good too. The Bagicha special fried rice was tasty and ample in quantity. The hot garlic prawn was decent. The handi Mutton needed to be more soft. Overall, good experience. Would surely visit again.

Three things that disappointed me here are:
1. There was some kind of ceiling disput upon our table and drops of water were continuously pouring down.
2. The piece of chicken they gave in our biriyani is really questionable as I have never seen such piece anywhere.
3. To our surprise, the water jug from which they served us water contained a dead ant.

Although the quality and quantity of food was good there, the decor and ambience is attractive. But for those three reasons staying there and enjoying our lunch there became difficult there.

‚ÄúAmbience of an old Zamindari House‚Äù


We went to the Restaurant with our family friends totalling 6 persons. The location is ideal one in North Kolkata just near Townschool at Hatibagan. The famous eateries like Arsalanm Sutanuti Junction, Ghazab, etc are around. Inside the restaurant we found a cozy atmosphere. The outside was not that encouraging but inside was nicely decorated. The garden was under renovation, so we could not have a look.
We purchased 3 Groupon vouchers for dining. The menu had both Indian, Mughlai and Chinese selections. The service people were friendly and prompt. The quantities offered were more than normal and we ended in packing the leftover for the home. We took kebabs which were huge in quantity and delicious. We also selected chicken dopiaza, paneer butter masala, butter nan, peas pulao and jeera rice out of the choice other than welcome drink and ice cream. Al the items were sumptuous. The price in the menu was very much affordable. We wish to come back again with more family friends.

Please refrain from visiting this place at least during the Pujas. The chicken fried rice was undercooked, so much so that we had to abandon it midway. However, staff were courteous and kind enough to cancel that order and got it replaced with Peas Pulao which was at least better cooked. Side dishes of Schezwan chicken and Chicken bharta was not up to the mark as well. Considering the prices of food, it was not at all value for money rather a bad food experience.

After pandal hopping in North Kolkata, my friends and I decided to quench our hunger at Bagicha. 
We entered and took seat. We ordered. We were four people but we were served the food with one fork and one spoon only. Cool!! 
Now let's come to food. It was cold. We orded fried rice with chilly chicken and schezwan chicken. Chicken was stiff as if it was preserved in refrigerator already. Rice was horrible. Experience is terrific. 
Only thing good about the place is Belgium glasses.

It's very much budget friendly. Highly recommended. Good luck ‚úå

Main course was butter nan, tandoori roti, mutton handi and chicken butter masala. Food was good but staffs were not efficient. The main attraction of this restaurant is a garden that was also closed.

Its truly one of those hidden gems of Kolkata. Located in the narrow lanes of North Calcutta (Hatibagan) the lane in which Arsalan is situated,you just have to walk a few more steps and there you will find Bagicha on your left.

Visited this place yesterday as I've bookmarked it for a long time and truly it didn't dissappoint us.Though you wont probably get the regular menu as its the time of puja and has an extreme rush.This is really a pocket friendly one.

We ordered chicken biryani and its was too good. The quantity is enough with an egg and a piece of potato.Perfect amount of spices and yes to note less oily which I liked the most.Overall my cravings for Biryani was absolutely fulfilled.

Would love to go back to taste other dishes.

This one is truly a hidden gem. The outdoor seating arrangement, which was supposedly the greatest attraction of this place, was not available during my visit. Nevertheless, the interiors were pretty impressive. The restaurant is situated in an age-old North Kolkata house, making it hard to miss the homely feeling of the entire place. Use of huge, antique show pieces, mirrors and chandeliers rightly add to the sophisticated ambience of the restaurant. We had Tandoori Rotis, Butter Naans, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Chicken Kohlapuri. All the items were perfectly cooked and presented. I would love to re-visit and enjoy a lunch in the open back-lawn.

It may not be out of place to mention that the day's I called up were normal working days and on one occasion it was a Saturday. I hope this comment would receive the restaurant's attention and a reply. Thanks Bagicha once again for the good pocket friendly food you serve at the restaurant.

All the lovers of North Indian cuisines and Bengali traditional ambience, your search ends here. Well maybe a little exaggeration. If not completely ends, this needs to be one of your stoppages. Finger licking food with traditional ambience. The mutton handi is superb. I don't have any pictures to post since I was so engrossed in eating the delicious taste bud pleasers served in front of me that I totally forgot to take some quick clicks. Location- Shyambazar. Very affordable. Totally try worthy.

A typical old bengali bonedibari converted into a restaurant..ambience wise good indeed..but flavourwise a setback..overpriced..as per quality..but quantitywise satisfactory..
The cream of chicken soup was worthless..chicken pieces were good..but tastewise..below average..
The chicken sweet corn soup was a horror to taste buds..one of the worst i have tasted..not eager to describe it..
Crispy chicken was average.too crispy to burn out chicken...quantity was good..
Garlic nan was good.so was butter nan..
Murgh haramirch was a delight..gravy was good and so was the chicken..juicy and tender..
The mixed schezwan fried rice was hot and tasty..the mutton kohlapuri was average..however the mutton was chewy and hard..could hav been better..
Overpriced average place...

Service guys are polite and well mannered..
quantity is satisfactory.. pricing is good and service is prompt also..

A typical old bengali bonedibari converted into a restaurant..ambience wise good indeed..but flavourwise a setback..overpriced..as per quality..but quantitywise satisfactory..
The cream of chicken soup was worthless..chicken pieces were good..but tastewise..below average..
The chicken sweet corn soup was a horror to taste buds..one of the worst i have tasted..not eager to describe it..
Crispy chicken was average.too crispy to burn out chicken...quantity was good..
Garlic nan was good.so was butter nan..
Murgh haramirch was a delight..gravy was good and so was the chicken..juicy and tender..
The mixed schezwan fried rice was hot and tasty..the mutton kohlapuri was average..however the mutton was chewy and hard..could hav been better..
Overpriced average place...

Located in the busy Hatibagan area, in the same lane where Arsalan is present. Went there on account of a Birthday treat given by one of my University friends. Ambience not impressive but food is great.
The furniture and decorations are praiseworthy.
The food items included Chicken sweet corn soup, Chicken butter masala, Mutton Biriyani and chocolate ice cream. All food items were delicious in taste and looked spectacular in colour. Can't comment on the price as it was a birthday treat. Nonetheless, this place deserves a 4 star for it's quality of food and exemplary service.

A brilliant restaurant located in the streets of North Calcutta..well it is just a few steps from the arsalan outlet in hatibagan.This place offers a wide range of dishes ranging from Chinese to mughlai to what not..The kababs simply melt in the mouth specially the Fish Haryali Kabab..
We had visited this place long time back and had ordered numerous items and fortunately all items were upto the mark if not above the mark..Coming to the look and feel of the restaurant,Bagicha sports a royal look inside,a lot like Oudh 1590 with chandeliers hung down from the ceiling and huge mirrors gaping at you while you have your piece of tandooriüòÇ.They also have an outdoor banquet section for parties,etc which has a lawn..Even this arrangement is cool for lovers indulged in each other..
The staff are very courteous and offer quick service.
Prices are more or less reasonable for the quality and quantity provided..
Overall a big thumbs up to Bagicha!!!
Will definitely visit again in future...

The ambience and decor was great giving the feel and look of old zamindar houses. The food was average in taste but quantity was quite large. Ordered  Chicken tikka kebab. The chicken pieces were hard and difficult to chew. Then ordered mixed gravy chowmein, bagicha special fried rice and fish tikka masala. They were not something to brag about. Overall an average eatout with cheap prices.

After a very hectic schedule I went there with a great expectations of amazing food. We ordered murgh tandoori green chili full Nd bagicha special fried rice. Everything was in very adequate quantity. Chicken tandoori was really amazing but I didn't like much the special fried rice. It contains all type of non vegs except Mutton. Much kajus, omlet in it's too Nd decorated with papads but in between these things it somewhere lost it's taste, maybe the name 'special' makes much expectations which it couldn't fulfill.

This restro gives a zamindaari heritage feel once you step inside it. Located in hatibagan this multicuisine restaurant serves equally good chinese and mughlai cuisines. Although I prefer their indianised chinese over biriyani. In my last visit I tried their tandoori chicken, which was tender and yumm! I have also tried mutton biriyani and chicken tikka masala and both these were okayish. The service is prompt and the ambience is also great. A nice economic place to take your family and friends for lunch or dinner.
P.S. they also can help you to arrange birthday party or other small occasions and they do it really well. The interior of the building has a garden and fountains...not a bad decor in the heart of shyambazar. Earlier I had been to this place for my friends birthday party and was not disappointed.

Ordered mixed gravy noodles with schewan chicken and in mughlai we had kababs and biryani with tikka butter masala. The kabas were really tender and well cooked. It tasted awesome. Would like to try it again.

Went for a dinner with few friends. located on the same lane of Hatibagan Arsalan. A Old Building renovated as a Restuarent but still holds that Purano Kolkata charm. This place has a outdoor dining facility at their garden. Decor reflects the tipical  north Calcutta essence which will give you a comfortable experience every time you dine there.
We use to have Chinese every time we visited  but this time planned try Indian.
We ordered 
1.Chicken Tandori: I personally love their Tandori..
2.Chicken Tikka butter masala:  A little  spicy but taste good.
3.Butter Nun.: fleaky Nun with ample of butter on top.

They have a wide Chinese offerings also and their Chinese is really good. 

The quantity they serve worth every penny you spend and service is preety awesome.

Now comes the nosh...I mean cuisine... :)
Quantity and quality both are satisfactory. Tried Mixed Schezwan and Murg Reshmi Butter Masala.

We started with murg tandoori green chili The chicken pieces were marinated with ¬†coriander and green chili paste, it had a unique flavor and taste really good with the green sauce they provide. ¬†For main course we ordered mutton biryani, well its taste ordinary just like normal kolkata type biryani, nothing special.

Bagicha restaurant located in Hatibagan, serves Indian and Indo-Chinese cuisines.
Moderately spaced with decent ambience.
For starters , we had Chicken reshmi kebab which was soft, tender and delicious, chicken hariyali kebab , which was disappointing as it was undercooked. Fresh lime soda was refreshing.
For main course, we had paneer butter masala, malai Kofta, butter naan, masala kulcha, chicken do pyaza, chicken Kolhapuri, veg pulao, jeera rice and green salad.
All food quantity were good.
Malai Kofta , masala kulcha tasted awesome.
Paneer butter masala was average.
Chicken do pyaza was yummy, gone well with veg pulao, jeera rice and chicken Kolhapuri tasted good with nice aroma and being not too oily.
As desserts, we had butterscotch and chocolate ice cream, which was enjoyable.
Pocket pinch is reasonable .

one of the oldest of North kolkata, Bagicha certainly holds the standard of theme based restaurants in this part of the city. Located at the busiest hatibagan area. Though its location is quite awkward still it managed to make some good memories with my brother. 
No sooner had we( me and my brother) entered in that restaurant a waiter came to take our orders along with two glasses of water as a welcome gesture. We ordered "Mutton handi" and "Mutton rara" preceded by veg fried rice as my brother was craving fpr mutton. The serve was pretty quick and decent. The food quality was totally fine and worth spending 300 bucks for each side dish. I am looking forward to come here again.. THANK YOU.

Located at the busiest Hatibagan area. Alley road of Arsalan,hatibagan. The location is quite awkward and quite but this particular place is well known and very old at this point. Wen there for family dinner after long time and chose this place over the Food giant Arsalan.
When entered the entire resto was completely empty as the current cash problem is hitting everywhere. Not to place but have decent sitting arrangement.¬†
When taken our seat Sourav the guy attending our table came quickly with water and was quick on his feets. We ordered Tandoori chicken first up as my brothers were craving for it followed by some Chinese dishes in forms of Chicken Fried rice and Chilly Chicken.
Tandoori chicken was meaty. The spices were well inside and cooked really well. The size of the pieces were satisfactory. Followed by the Main course so the rice was okayish but the chilli chicken was good with the gravy and taste.¬†
Though a mixed experience here. Prices are quite pocket friendly.

It's a very old establishment and what I find most charming is their outdoor garden seating. Winter days are very warm and cosy in the garden area for a sumptuous lunch. The food is always being very standardized. Earlier more than 5 years ago, their chef was meticulous, which I find missing in present day preparations.

Bagicha is one of my old favorite in shyambazar. It's near Town school. U have to walk straight crossing Arsalan and Sutanuti Junction.... U will find Bagicha at your Left hand side. Big chandeliers and giant mirrors added a majestic and royal look to the ambience. Indian and Chinese both cuisine are up to the mark. Yesterday we had chicken tandoori (Rs 300 / full)... Special mutton biryani (250)... Special chicken biryani (230)....
Chicken tikka masla (220) .... Mix Fried Rice (170)... and Salad (40)...
All foods were good n tasty, specially need to mention mutton Biryani which was quite good . nice portion of tender meat but little bit of drier side and the service was real good.

I have visited this place yesterday. Its near to Hatibagan Arsalan. The ambience, set up is like Jamindar mahals of old. They have a garden in the back where you can eat if you wish. I have orderd Crispy chilli baby corn, Red pepper chicken for starter and Tandoori roti, Butter chicken, Chicken with green chilli (Don't remember the name). I would recommend Crispy chilli baby corn which is totally delicious. Overall the place has a nice touch to it & food is value for money.
P.S. - Please note that the price in zomato menu is not updated. It got increased by atleast 50 - 100 rupees.

One of the oldies of North Kolkata , Bagicha holds the standard of fine dining in this part of the city . Long before when the city was not flooded with restaurants , Bagicha and few others were there to fulfill the appetite of ever so hungry bangalis . Everything is so much old school about North Kolkata . The old houses , the narrow lanes and most importantly the old rajbaris . Bagicha is a restaurant which epitomises everything about North Kolkata .

¬∞ Location :- If you are coming from sovabajar sutanuti metro station then you have to reach the hatibagan crossing . Take the left path which leads to shyambajar . There is a walking distance to shyampukur street lane . The lane which also houses arsalan . Take the lane and walk few blocks and you will reach Bagicha on your left .

¬∞ Ambience  ( 4 / 5 ) :-  There are very few restaurants in Kolkata with this old world charm like Bagicha . The restaurant is on the ground floor of an old house . Once you enter you will see the chandeliers and the design which resembles the dining room of zamindars . Only the seating resembles nothing from that age . It has a huge old  mirror , and statues at the corners . There is everything so splendid about the decor . There are no seatings for 2 person . There are mainly 4 seaters . But , can't the same about the washroom. Still , the main restaurant is a treat for the eye .

----------------------------------
¬∞ Food :- Bagicha boasts to provide a multi-cuisine experience . That in this part of the city reflects to mughlai and oriental cuisine . Because the ambience got us in the mood we decided to go for pure mughlai . Therefore , we went for the following dishes :- 

1. Tandoori chicken green chilli ( 4/ 5 ) :- Almost perfect starter dish . We took half plate which costs around 170 . The size of the  2 pieces were satisfactory. The chicken pieces had dhaniya and green chilli paste rubbed over it before grilled in tandoori tawa . The meat tasted absolutely splendid . The green sauce that came with it was yummy . Almost a perfect starter , but I found some little portions of the meat burnt and that is why i am not giving a 5. But this dish is highly recommended .

2. Special mutton biryani ( 4 / 5 ) :- Was really impressed with the biryani they serve . The amount of rice in this dish was huge . It has 2 mutton pieces which had bone but the meat was succulent, tender and tasty . 2 pieces of medium size potato and one egg . The quality is almost similar to that of of their neighbour Arsalan . When the biryani was served burning hot , we were having an experience unlike anything . One the rice became cold it was not that pleasant so have it till it is hot . This dish is heavily recommended .

3. Murgh kolapuri ( 4 / 5 ) :- Suggested by them as we were looking for something spicy with the biryani . This dish has 2 big size chicken pieces cut from breast and wing . The gravy was really tasty similar to the chicken butter masala but more spicy . The orange gravy was too hot to handle. We could feel the heat while having the chicken and we loved it . Able excellent side dish to have with your biryani . This dish is also recommended .

Other than the above mentioned dishes , we also had sweet lime soda and thumbs up . None of the drinks were that impressive but we were still not muh bothered as our appetite was already satisfied by the high voltage mughlai food we had . One important thing to note was that other than ice cream no other desert was available . This was a dissapontment.

------------------------------

Service ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Was a little dissapointed with the service time as for both starter and main course it was longer than 10 minutes but they made up for it with their excellent behaviour and attentiveness . At the end of the meal they provided with finger bowl , and that to our surprise was very generous . Something that is not provided at many restaurants these days .

Verdict :- Bagicha is a must try for people living in all parts of the city . It will be a unique experience for sure at reasonable prices . Highly recommended fir family dinner. Following are the main points :- 

1. Classy old school ambience . The chandeliers and the huge rooms . The huge door at the entrance transform you to a different era .

2. Good quality mughlai food . Oriental also available .

3. Commendable service .

Bagicha should be among the legends with a little bit more attentiveness to details like good drinks and awesome deserts . They deserve so much more . Will go back again to try their oriental spread .

If you are looking for quantity then it's surely not a right place to visit. Been there on 10th of Oct (Nabami).  And its too much expensive respect to the quantity. Though it has a little issue on quality. Apart from veg item the taste was really good for all the non veg and specially chicken items. And the VAT was quite high in comparison to the quantity and number of items we consumed. As we had no other options left at Hati Bagan so we had to move in to this place. Or else It's not a good place for than 2 to 3 people.

Want to know what disappointment feels like?
Disappointment is standing in a que for one whole hour and being served Chilli Chicken below nominal standards.
The Chinese cuisine is more or less average.If you are looking for authentic Chinese,this is not the place.
North Indian is fairly good with a standard Kolkata biryani.
Not recommend if you have a delicate taste and a big time foodie.

U saved us from hunger, rain and the crowd on road. This year Durga Puja was ruined by incessant rainfall and on such a rainy evening I had hit this place with my friends. We ordered chicken tandoori, tandoori Roti, chicken Peshawari and chicken Manchurian. Food was good and tasted better as we were completely drenched. I loved the hot, tender and juicy chicken tandoori. Chicken Peshawari should get a special mention since it is included in the menu during the pujo and tasted great.Price was within reach. Loved the ambience of the garden and thank you for the food.

DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL. 
Visited this saptami, there was a lot of crowd so they took down our names, we needed table for six. Since it was hot and humid that day we skipped street shops so that we can have our lunch in an ac hotel. Waited for an hour then they called our name. They took us inside the hotel where we were just beginning to feel the relief when they brought us out of the ac area and into the open area where they had tables set under shade. But it was already raining throughout the day and then also THEY MADE US SIT OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN where the rain water was hitting us. When we informed them that we want to sit inside they refused and told us we'll have to wait again. On top of that when we pointed out the service tax and charges on the menu and enquired about it they said it applies even if you sit in non ac as well. If we wanted to to sit in hot and humid environment and have our lunch sitting on the streets they we would have had it in any one  of the countless street food corners during puja. This was the first and last time we went to this pathetic hotel. They didn't even have the decency to inform us about the sitting arrangements prior and were not ashamed to charge the service charges even though we were sitting in the rain.

Place is very nice...People of bagicha gave us a warm welcome..But during festivals there is a prblm lyk other places you have enlist your name and thn have to wait outside fr min 1hr...
Now about food..Price is Okay...You must try Kababs and tandoori...its awesome but main course like biriyani is not so good..We order a biriyani ...the quantity was good but it was taste less...
All together so so place to eat ...try to avoid this place  during puja or any festivals..A nice place for kababs and tandoories..

Worst restaurant that I have ever visited. Went there on the day of sashti. Separate menu for Puja with higher price for foods didn't surprise me, but the thing that surprised me was the quantity and quality of food that was served. I ordered mixed fried rice (and a chicken side dish), and to my surprise the quantity of mixed fried rice that was served was exactly half of any other restaurant ( may it be a famous one or a not so famous one). Also I found myself crushing shells of eggs when I was eating the fried rice.
While leaving I told the waiter about all these, the only thing that he could say was "Sir, porer bar erom hobe na". Believe me, "porer bar" will never come for me atleast.
And regarding the ambience, it is nothing more than a room with an AC. Don't be surprised if you find cobwebs in the corner of the walls.
¬†A small bit of advice for the restaurant owners, if you want to cheat your customers, then prepare yourself to close your restaurant.If you want money then work for it, cheating will never bring you success.

The food is average, nuthing tasted special. My local para street shops make better chicken garlic than them.
And dont go there during the puja s, the quantity they are providing is very less. Its almost as if quantity of 2plates is made into 3plates. Moreover all items on the menu are not available.

With the outlook of a rajbari, this place serves all the mainstream Indian and chinese dishes. Decent place, good ambience and polite staff. We were in a group of 11 so i could taste a huge portion of their menu. Really loved their chicken tikka masala, chicken harimirch n chicken kasturi kabab. But the highlight was the bagicha special fried rice served with the toppings of prawn chips. Veg dishes were okayish but the paneer sheekh kabab was a letdown. Lastly a plus one for the vanilla floaters.

This restaurant may not be very famous, but it sure is a good restaurant in this locality. The Indian dishes are specially good here. I visit this place often with my mother and we both just love their tandoori chicken which comes in a massive quantity. It's tough to manage to eat anything else after having a half-a-plate tandoori chickens each. However, we like the masala kulcha and chicken reshmi butter masala. Chinese items, though we have only tried once, are not as good as the Indian items.Ambiance is peaceful and the decor is like a Bengali zamindar house. They have garden area sitting arrangements too. Service is also good, all the staffs are polite, though they mess up with the billing and orders often. So go through the bill closely before paying.

Went yesterday . The location is bit odd. One has to take the road adjacent to Town school. Then go straight. First you you see Sutanuti Junction, Arsalan, Gazab. But keep walking straight and then at the left side there stands Bagicha. The entrance is like ¬†of old ¬†Rajbari's with two waiters standing at the gate. We reached there around 4:30 p.m. The ambiance was classy ¬†as it was decorated with long hanging chandeliers and beautiful showpieces.¬†
We ordered Cream of chicken, Peas polao, Murg Maharani, Afgani Nan and Murg Kolhapuri. The cream of chicken soup just won my heart. It was very tasty. We waited 15 minutes for the next course. But when they came I could ¬†tell just from the smelling how awesome they are going to be. The topping of afgani nan was filled with cherry, sesame seeds, cashew, fennel seeds and sprinkled with sugar. It was very large. The quantity of all dishes were good. Although the peas polao was not very good to the taste as it was made with too much rose water.
The waiters were good in behavior. Overall the experience was satisfying. One must visit this place at least once.

Bagicha is one of the oldest restaurants in North Kolkata. It is located at the same lane of Arsalan and Gazab in the busy Hatibagan market area.It looked like a typical Nort Kolkata building with well decorated inside.seating arrangements were good and they have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements.Yesterday me with my friend went there and tried their North Indian menu.

we Ordered : Chicken Tandoori green chili, Chicken Bharta, Plain naan and Triple Delight.

Tandoori chicken was coated with some green marinade and grilled to perfection.It was spicy, soft and juicy.
Chicken bharta was loaded with small chunks of chicken pieces and topped with a boiled egg.The gravy was very rich with lots of spices and cream and went perfectly
well with the soft naan bread.
For desert we opted for Triple delight which was three scoop of ice cream of your choice topped with wafers,nuts and chocolate sauce.

The quality of the food was really good.Staffs were very polite and well mannered but the service was very slow though.
Overall it was a good place to go with your family¬† and friends........

Coming to the food,we(8 people)ordered hell a lot of items..well i wud say that the food is pretty good be it the mughlai delicacies or the chinese dishes..The prices of kababs are relatively on the cheaper side when compared to the quantity of chicken served..Overall a very nice restaurant to visit in hatibagan!!üòÄ

My mom's birthday party treat was here. So very emotional moment for me and I was literally not in a mood to forget any discrepancies in the food part if something was about to happen. Luckily it didn't.

Starters were finger licking good. The hariyali kebab was fabulous. Exactly how it should be tasted. Had a great hariyali kebab after a long time especially in Kolkata, reminded me of my delhi days or Lucknow visits.

But the malai kebab was equally pitiful. The whole preparation was wrong. Making normal kebabs and  serving it with lots of mayo and cheese is not malai kebeb. Atleast I haven't tasted anything like it.

Nonetheless the main course biriyani was good. Not exceptional but good. Was slightly on the more rich part 

The pulao was great. The best of all I had that day. Must order.

The chicken items were a hit and a miss.
The unexpected ones turned out to be great but the regular ones were pretty plain and bland.


The food ordering was a delight.
I would specifically like to add the courteous behaviour of the staff. Wow that was very nice. 1star extra for that.


The food serving time was pitifully slow.

The bagicha was famous for the bagicha in the backyard. But only seen it from outside as it raining heavily outside.

Overall great experience ,will visit again for sure. Already recommended it to many friends and colleagues.
(Can I discount next time for this.!! Just kiddingüòÇüòÇ)

One of my favourite places , although located a little off track, in the same lane as arsalan and gazab,its easy to find. True to its name bagicha has a big garden which is decked up beautifully during winters and is a pleasure to sit and eat in. Otherwise too it has great interiors with plush seats and a regal feel similar to that of a yesteryear zamindari house.
Tried a lot of there dishes in both Chinese and moghlai and all of them are good to eat and fairly priced and always enough for two. My top favourites are their malai kabab and bagicha special chicken.
Must visit place!

This place is around 5mins away from my Grandmom's place. With my local Shambazar friends I use to visit a lot around 2009-2012. 

Always loved the ambience and decor of this place. They are the makers of beautiful fish fries if you place prior request.

I had many memorable dinner meetings here but recently in 2014 I arranged my parents 25th anniversary out here. We spoke to the owner and he seemed a very well read, well brought up, aristocratic, humble guy. 

We arranged it for around 60 people booking the banquet and the food was fabulous. The set menu was absolutely good and I cannot stop mentioning the lip-smacking fish fries. I like the bengali styled fish preparations more than any chicken/ mutton dish out here. The decor is always a bonus here.

Would love to go back soon!

I visited this restaurant along with my two friends. They were keen on dining at Arsalan. The queue was long at Arsalan as the day was Saptami. So, we three decided to go for Bagicha. It was my very first venture at Bagicha. As mentioned by other reviewers, the place is a little tricky to discover. Once you spot it out and step in, you will get an old world vibe. The serpentine lanes of North Kolkata will make you nostalgic. They even have a backyard. I loved the place. The food was delicious as well. Errrrrm, thumbs up.

Elegant zamindari ambience beckoned us to celebrate this Jamai Sasti at Bagicha.we had crispy chicken and fish malai kabab for starters,and literally I'm floored with the lovely taste of the malai...later on we had butter nan,mutton handi and mixed noodles..and oh,masaallah...what a lajawab mutton dish!..to end the fest,I had the chocolate fudge.. and its just wow!!!though we wanted to have so much more,we so stuffed..with some kabab take-always,we left the place,but surely would return here for more!

Located at the same lane of Ghazab and Arsalan. The restro is quiet a old one of Shyampukur Lane, I have been visiting here since my college days. One of the famous restaurant in North Kolkata. Bagicha has two sections, indoor and outdoor. Chinese is preferable. Foods were very good and tasty, decor was also impressive. Hospitality was very good. I will be visiting soon to try out their Mughlai dishes. Must visit for those foodies who lives in North Calcutta...

Though located a few steps away from the main road... but The outside part looks like a typical old building of north kolkata. Again the inside is well decorated.. wth a yellow brown lighting. 
Food is good with a variety of option. 
It is one of the popular restrnt of north kolkta. 
They rent the place for party and serves well buffet food.

One has to walk deep into the narrow lane, keeping Arsalan on your left and Royal Lebanese on your right from Town School Bidhan Sarani crossing. Shyampukur Lane, you find a old-stereotyped Zamindar House, and that's Bagicha for you. But it's walking distance from my place. So direction is not so tricky for us. It is one of the oldest restaurants in North Kolkata.  In old school days there were only Bagicha, Sutanuti Junction. No Arsalan, no Lebanese junction. Food served here is good. Home delivery is also available here. The ambiance and interior decorations are ok. Quick service and well behaved staff! Recommended outlet for food lovers. A garden in the backyard make this place more beautiful..

Went to this place around a year back when it was undergoing renovation. This place spells the old world charm and that too not a fabricated one . Located in the north Kolkata with a jaw dropping architecture one easily feels like he has a piece of the old Kolkata glory in his pocket. Very reasonably charged mouth watering dishes that too in generous quantities add to its charm further. Well who can blame it, we Bengalis are experimental foodies of majestic make üòâ!

A typical north kolkata rajbari was turned into a restuarant,Bagicha. As the name suggests it is one of those few restuarants in north kolkata which has a pretty outdoor sitting arrangement and has a beautiful ambience. The quality of food is good. Though i like the indian dishes likes kebabs and tandoori more than the chinese dishes. Prices are affordable.  üòä

Bagicha, as the name says is a restaurant with a garden. Along with maintaining the restaurant, they organize parties on other rooms side-by-side. The place includes two small halls, one large hall and one garden, the Bagicha. They organize the parties in one or two of these rooms according to the strength of the guest list and carry on with their usual restaurant in the other rooms. This time I visited the place as a host to a party organized in the large hall and the Bagicha. The hall's architectural designs clearly bring out the heritage of North Kolkata. Big mirrors on either side, long old-fashioned chandeliers hanging from the roof, old sculptures and some classical music playing in the music system, a perfect mood-setting ambience for a family get-together. The garden was also finely decorated with a covered well in a corner, a small waterfall and some garden seats and benches, and all with different colored lights provide a beautiful place to hold parties of a different flavor. No question can arise with the service. They provided with starters and a high supply of soft drinks and mocktails to welcome the guests. Coffee was also there as and when needed. The food menu was already selected by us and as it was a buffet dinner, can't really comment on the quantity of food. Food quality was superb and yummy too. Loved the delicious desserts as well. When the guests love the ambience, the service, the food, nothing more a host can wish for. The cost of the whole package was not too much either. Only thing to complain, there was no space to wash hands near the food stalls and one has to go all the way to the washroom for that. The manager later told us that they are renovating a portion of the garden to accommodate some wash-basins. An overall rating of 9 out of 10 for this eatery. They really know how to greet their customers.

I Have been here many a times because this is in a very convenient place for me.
Situated in an ol building gives a victorian feeling though the decor is not much, having said this the ambience and the crowed over here is nice. Staff is also good
They basically specialize in indian food which i would say is above average , they also serve Chinese though but is not very convincing.
But they dont have much option in deserts.

Being Rgkarian I visited the place so many times during my college days. I like this 'zamidar bari' like place and the interior decoration. They have a garden place also where the ambience is very nice during evening...open air,soft light,sculptures... You have to be lucky enough to get a sit there because most of the people like this place more than the in house sitting.
Now food. Their Chinese dishes are not so good. North Indian dishes are good though biriyani is not up to the mark. Over all food quality is average. Most of the times we ended up with trutty frutty which is nice here.
Price is very reasonable.

This is a heritage restaurant and that is depicted well in the restaurant's architecture. The decor and ambience is really nice. If the crowd is a bit light, do ask to be seated in the garden ara. Its beautiful in the evening with all the twinkling lights and sculptures. The food here is average and so is the service. Its easy on the pockets and serves a good quantity per dish as well.

The restaurant is bit tricky to find out. Just go straight üë£üë£üë£ beside hatibagan arsalan (Town School stoppage) and you ll find the outlet. 

Just you enter the restaurant and you ll feel like ZAMINDAR OF 19TH CENTURY.
The decoration is perfect for shooting of an age old zamindar gharana and its ambience is quite perfect for any mood. Calm and quiet and cool place, very comfortable sitting on a large sofas and the service boys ll attend to u as u r a real zamindar. I would rate this outlet 10 on 10 for its beautiful, palace like ambience. I have added many pics,just see it,u ll understand of its ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶¨‡¶æ‡ßú‡¶ø like decor. ‚úå‚úå‚úå

The restaurant has 2 sections.
1. A beautifully decorated garden where small parties like b'days, marriage days are celebrated.
2. The restaurant is in front and very much neat and clean and the staffs are very cordial. Even I was very confused what to take....Indian or Chinese. First we ordered Indian,then switched to Chinese and readily the service staffs accepted with a broad smile. I liked their behavior and the manager also was very attentive. I would like to rate them right 10 on 10. üëåüëåüëå

Now for food. Not very good Chinese,but I can say IT WAS MORE THAN AVERAGE. We ordered Chicken sweet corn soup, Mixed fried rice, Chicken Manchurian, Fresh lime soda etc. But may be Indian cuisine is much popular,everyone was taking kebabs,tandooris,chicken and mutton items etc. But I liked Chinese also,no regrets. So rating 7 on 10. ‚úå‚úå‚úå

Just go through once,order anything you like and feel the aroma of zamindar. U ll love it. üëçüëçüëç @priyabrata ganguly

** Location = Its location is tad tricky. One has to walk deep into the narrow lane, keeping Arsalan on your left and Royal Lebanese on your right. The lane named as Shyampukur Lane, you find a old-stereotyped Zamindar House, and thats all its Bagicha for you.

**Brief = On a Saptami day,having been visiting pandals since morning rendered us hungry and we decided to try this restaurant at Hatibagan. Depite huge rush and crowd, we were seated within 45 minutes of waiting. Though it does not have outdoor seating mentioned, but for the rush maybe they kept such an option and we readily opted for it.
The staff's behavior was decent considering the crowd management they had to undergo.

**Things tried = Mixed Fried Rice,Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chilly Chicken and sprites.

The quantity was okay. But mixed rice was not upto the mark ,sadly. The noodles taste decent enough.The chilly chicken was nothing special.
Considering the date of my visit I wont review it strictly, but there are many points of improvement that the management should consider.

**Purse Check = Rs.500/- for two people.

**Overall = Would be visiting soon to try out their Indian/Mughlai dishes and write about it. Till then Cheers :)

I would not have come across this eatery if I would have found seats for me and my other friends on nabami at Arsalan. We were badly hungry and I was ecstatic to have finally found seats for all of us at Bagicha. Bagicha is a nicely decorated place with pretty chandeliers and well furnished. The ambience has a bong touch which is appealing to the bong food community. We did not order starters and straight went for the main course. We ordered murgh biriyani, murgh tikka masala, chicken gravy chowmein and tandoori rotis. Biriyani was average. Gravy chowmein was bulk of a dish. One chowmein can suffice two tummies undoubtedly. Chicken tikka masala was good and the chicken chunks were soft. The place is rightly priced and service is prompt. I wont recommend this place as something exceptionally good (when it comes to food) but it wont disappoint you either. Bagicha definitely deserves a visit.

Bagicha is located a little inside from the Arselan. I was there a few months ago with my cousins. My didi suggested this place as she came to this place more than one times. She is fan of Bagicha, so we had our dinner on the day before of diwali. So we ordered chicken tangri kebab in starter and pan fired mixed noodles, mixed rice, sweet honey chicken in main course. All the dishes are average in taste and I really liked their pan fried noodles but I did not like the taste of sweet honey chicken it was toooo much sweet......  Service and staffs are good. 
Over all it's 3.5/5.

Bagicha has become one of my favorite food joints in north kolkata. From the outside to inside decoration it reminds me the gone old zamindar days. The place is perfect for family dine. Well spaced. Mutton biriyani, paneer polao and chicken tikka masala was ordered. Yes they took a bit extra time to serve but the taste and quantity is worth waiting. And the main thing that made a place in my heart is their behavior, service and courtesy. I would like to go there again and again and again.

The ambience,food quality n quantities as per price is quite well n affordable.The manners of the staff r nice too.Much memories attached to this place.The decor is apt as a bengali jamindar house.A perfect family dine in restaurant.Just one suggestion the biriyani last time was quiet dry ... please look into it next time.Will be visitng again soon.

While the main hall is lavishly decorated with the Bengali zamindari mind, the room we were courted to has a strong European touch with its long wooden tables, and high back chairs. Try to catch it when the place isn't full and you'll giggle over your tomato soup and will search for something with garlic in the menu. :D ..the waiters, compared to this ambience, are a collective disaster. One of the more courteous ones took our order while the others stood at a distance, taking turns staring at us the whole time. the soup was passable while the mushroom dish we ordered was rather good compared to their Chinese food which isn't really up to the mark. But I guess, my rating is mostly based on their service which is hardly passable in the restaurant, and simply unacceptable over the phone.

The only negative point is much delay in giving the food... That's it..

The interior decoration and the food quality is the main usp of Bagicha. But the price is more than other comparative restaurants. Except this one i find nothing wrong here..

I didn't understand what's wrong with this place. Seriously! Last when I was in here it was bearable but yesterday it was just unbearable. I went there with one of my friend and probably they thought it was my girl friend or something. So they arranged a seat in a couples room (A room full of couples ). Seriously WTH! & they were playing Kumar sanus songs! Are you kidding me?
Nevertheless we ordered food.Veg rice and chicken kadai.
It was horrible. Rice was dry full of ghee and the chicken was stiff and salty. It was so pathetic we couldn't eat it full.we just wanted to get out of that place.
#Buckle_up maintaining your reputation isn't easy!
Verdict : A big No :(

The first time I went to Bagicha was in November 2013, after watching Thor 2. The next time was with a friend last puja. This time, and most recently, I went there with three friends on Panchami. The food was amazing, to say the least, but the quantity of the rice dishes was sadly almost reduced to half compared to the servings last year. We ordered a chilli chicken, Manchurian chicken, and four plates of mixed fried rice. Earlier, two plates would've been more than enough for 4 people. The price came down approximately to ‚Çπ300/ head, which is more or less reasonable, depending on how you look at it. 

My only complaint is with regards to the restroom. There's only one for the ladies and gents, and it was unclean and filthy. And if we feel like touching up our makeup or simply washing up, definitely don't go there after you've eaten.

To the management, a rating depends on the entire experience. And my otherwise good experience at this place was ruined by this. Please take it into note.

Tucked in one of the bylanes of Shyambazar area, this place will really surprise with the food they serve. The very location and decor of the place starting from building, the tables and chairs remind u of the days gone by. Coming to the food we ordered Chicken Kasturi kebab and Fish Malai kebab which we were told will take some time to prepare, but it was worth the wait. Both the fish and the chicken were cooked to perfection and was very tasty. Its a must try. For the main course we had Dahi chicken, kadai paneer and Garlic nun. Apart from some extra dose of garlic in the nun, the food was quite good and reasonable. Will definitely go back to try their Chinese dishes.

I had been there to treat my friends on my birthday. I had bought Groupon Coupon of 4 course chinese meal. It was just awe-full. I did not expect this from a renowned restaurant of this stature. The fried rice was hard, chilly chicken and spring roll was blatant in taste. Though I was quite impressed with the Tandoori Chicken I had ordered separately. Ambiance is Ok. Overall not ¬†so pleasant experience.

Last night had dinner here. Probably my last one in Kolkata for the next two years. Ordered Tandoori Chicken, Hot n Sour Soup, Navaratna Pulao, Tandoori Roti, Mutton Hundi, Chicken Bagicha Special. The Mutton Hundi was not that good, the taste was off a bit. But that was the only down part of our dinner. From the Tandoori Chicken to everything else the food was excellent!. Tandoori chicken appeared a bit dark and burnt, but man-o-man was it tasty!, I went crazy over them :P. Then came the Bagicha Special Chicken, Tandoori roti and Navaratna Pulao. I loved the Bagicha Special Chicken Item, it went really well with Roti as well as Pulao. The Pulao was sweet in taste, having a sweet tooth which was no problem for me ;) I really liked the smell of the Pulao, makes you remember the good old childhood days of attending family ceremonies and then getting that appetizing smell of Pulao. Was a really good experience. I'm glad that we choose this one for yesterday's dinner. Who knows maybe when I'll return I'll pay it a visit again. Recommend!

Have gone to Bagicha twice. It's a nice place, cool and calm. They have outdoor seating arrangement too. We had hariyali kebab, and pepper fish in starters. Massala kulcha, and one chicken item.
The kebab was juicy , soft and delicious. The pepper fish was also tasty and the kulcha was so soft like a quilt, though the second time it was a bit burnt.. This place can be booked for parties also....

Nice ambience and good place to have chinese and north Indian.

 Bagicha has been around quite a while and it used to be the best place to dine in at shyambazar until Arsalan, aminia, kfc etc opened up. Well bagicha is still number two on my list after arsalan in shyambazar area. Food here is good and cheap, ambience is pretty good! Waiters are friendly. They have a garden with seating arrangements inside the resturant. I feel they should increase their quality more since they are facing stiff competition from the newly opened resturants.

Bagicha has really a small bagicha/garden ? in the backside with some small hut type dining arrangements. I liked it. Servicemen are quit nice. I went there for a little get together with friends and had malai kabab, biriyani, a fish item, nans and some other dishes. We were some 12 or 13 friends and we enjoyed the food, atmosphere and servicing thoroughly. A Big Thumbs up ? for bagicha. It is situated ahead of arsalan hatibagan in the sama lane/row.

Visited this place at pujo time, should have written this earlier. But anyway...
Had to wait about 30 minutes before we could go in but once we did, I wasn't complaining anymore. The interior was eye catching. The service was fast. The food was good and when you're hungry good becomes great. We ordered mixed fried rice, chilli chicken (the usual), chicken biriyani and malai kofta.
Although it was a bit of a mistake perhaps to order Chinese at a primarily Indian restaurant, it wasn't bad. A little too spicy for my taste but okay. The biriyani was pretty good. The malai kofta was amazing! 
This place is very pocket friendly (especially for college kids like me) and the quantity as well as quality of food is good. 
The staff are friendly and helpful as well.
Me gusta! :)

Bagicha is a traditional house turned restaurant in the alleys of shaympukur street,perhaps one of the better restaurant in the vicinity.The interior decor gives you the feel of the old world, heritage and past traditions of north kolkata,those big chandeliers,huge mirrors, something which is getting wiped out with the globalisation.Also they have an outdoor seating arrangement to give you an unique experience..
Coming to the food:
Golden fried Prawn: This tastes well, only issue is that the batter is way to thick to enjoy the prawn inside
Chicken hariyali kebab: It actually tasted better, but could have added to the smokiness,which lacks a bit
¬†Mutton Rara: This is one of their speciality with mutton pieces in a gravy prepared with minced mutton..it tastes better than most other dishes..
Fish Punjabi: Also nicely prepared,with a flavour of ajwain..but seasoning could have been better in the dish..
They also serve a well prepared tutti fruity to wrap up your meal..
Overall quantity is sufficient and pocket pinch is around 1400/- for four people..

Ordered naan and a plate of chicken tikka masala, and it tasted delicious. The naan was extremely soft and the chicken tikka masala was mouth watering. And, it didn't even leave a hole in the pocket.
Portions are sumptuous and a must go if you are tired after shopping around Hati Bagan region and just want to have some good food and return home.

If you are a college-goer and always short of money, this is the place to go. For any college-goer, it is more than a fine dining restaurant. During my college days, this was THE PLACE to go to whenever we were hanging out with friends during Durga Pujo or had a pending Birthday treat or wanted to get kebabs delivered at a friend's home during house party. Nostalgia is what binds me to this place and makes me reminiscence of the good ol' carefree days with friends. More than the food, it was the outside sitting area in the bagicha among the lush green plants that we always used to prefer.

Bagicha defines heritage. The ultimate place in north Kolkata which is known for its ambience and food quality. The garden is so well decorated that is beyond expectations of a first time visitor. Not very pocket friendly though. Attendants are not very well behaved though. But if you get such nice foods and ambience everything becomes secondary.

Nicely hidden this food joint surprised me a lot.
We went there for lunch n we were d only customers.
Decor: Decorated the zamindar style, the place had chandeliers and antique lookin showpieces. Majestic mirrors adorned the walls.
The waiters were polite.
Food: We had ordered murg tandoori, garlic nun, murg tikka masala n mixed raita.
The tandoori were full of flavour, the meat being perfectly charred, juicy n tender. The condiment had the perfect zing to go with the dish. To our surprise, there also came a couple f roasted papads which put huge smiles on our face.
The garlic nun was soft as ever n had perfect garlic aroma. It kinda the bst indian bread I ever had.
Murg tikka had a well balance of all the spices. There were six pieces of absolute delight.
The mixed raita deserves a special mention. The base was cool curd, creamy as ever and had the perfect seasoning. There were plenty of finely chopped cucumber, onion n tomatoes. It also had a cherry on top. And the cherry was depipped to my delight which I didn't find even at best rated placed!
The food was a smashing hit and I would like to go there at every chance I get.
A huge thumbs up for this pocket friendly place.
It also has a lovely outdoor sitting arrangement, n m eager to try it out!

I simply loved the atmosphere of this restaurant. Awesome food and service was great . The quantity was more than enough for two people. And the dim light atmosphere was simply awesome. I will definitely go again. :)

Went there during puja some years back with my friend....i think they have tried a old kolkata interior but things did not work out properly....we ordered kababs, tandoori roti & a chicken side dish....food was good enough....service is okay & price seemed reasonable....

Located near Hatibagan Town School, Bagicha Restaurant serves an assortment of authentic Indian and Indo-Chinese cuisines. The restaurant has two parts in-house and garden section, in-house part was not spacious and can barely handle 25-30 people at a time. Ambiance was decent enough for dine in. We started off with ‚ÄòChicken Reshmi Kebab‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Hariyali Kebab‚Äô and ‚ÄòFresh Lime Soda‚Äô. Chicken Reshmi Kebab was tasty and soft enough to melt in our mouth but Chicken Hariyali Kebab disappointed us, chewy meat and undercooked. Without further experiments we ordered our main course; ‚ÄòPaneer Butter Masala‚Äô, ‚ÄòMalai Kofta‚Äô, ‚ÄòButter Naan‚Äô, ‚ÄòMasala Kulcha‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Do-Peaza‚Äô, ‚ÄòChicken Kolhapuri‚Äô, ‚ÄòVeg Pulao‚Äô, ‚ÄòJeera Rice‚Äô and ‚ÄòGreen Salad‚Äô. The quality of the food was quite good, Masala Kulcha and Malai Kofta tasted awesome whereas I didn't like Paneer Butter Masala that much as its go through just average with Butter Naan. Chicken Do-Peaza tasted delicious and perfect match with Veg Pulao. We tried Jeera Rice with Chicken Kolhapuri and it was also delightful, mouth-watering and very aromatic but too much oily. They used tandoori chicken pieces for making both dishes and I did not liked that at all. Hope in future they use normal pieces of chicken. For dessert we opted for ‚ÄòButterscotch‚Äô & ‚ÄòChocolate‚Äô ice-cream which was also satisfying. The best part is that pocket pinch is almost nothing compared to the quantity of the food.

I visited it after pujo this year and found it to be an interesting place.. An old bonedi zamindar house converted to a restaurant. When we entered we were surprised to see no waiters or servers around only a huge group of people eating... Anyways decided to grab a table, after some 5 mins a server turned up with a menu card which was different from the one in zomato. On inquiring we were told that menu cards have gone for printing.. Anyways we had chicken kosha and chicken reshmi kebab with butter nan. The nan was very soft. The chicken reshmi kebab was quite creamy and delicious but the chicken kasha was not that kosha and it felt that they had added boiled chicken to some gravy. Value for money is good...the portions are adequate.
Overall experience was good... Some nice music would have added some more charm to the environment. the chandeliers and statues and mirrors add to the old world charm of yesteryear.

visited bagicha this year pujo, located in hatibagan, near town school, we had to wt around 40 mint, but its kind a ok during puja rush, watever , we really could not get the time to notice ambience as we are super hungry and tired, so immediately we jumped on the menu, we had biriani , chicken manchurian and fried rice , rice was good, portions were enough but i really love manchurian though it was spicy but really well made , but what disappoint me was biriani, one plate contain one potato, egg and 2 moderate size chicken pieces , but unfortunately is was very dry, not properly flavoured , very upset with that as i am a huge biriani lover, may be for puja rush :( , anyway the pricing is moderate , one plate of each cost around rs-550 (with tax ) . will visit again :)

Bagicha in hindi means garden. When we I was a kid, mom and aunty first took me to this joint and I found this restaurant extremely well decorated. There were different sections done in different ways. And one such section was the outdoor seating arrangement in the "bagicha". This is basically a house, annold bonedi bangali bari, converted into a restro. But yesterday when I went inside , I wanted to sit in the outdoor section,  but I heard that was permanently closed,  so what is the point in keeping this name? Anyway, the decor is quite appealing. Decorated like a raaj bari with antique show pieces, grandfather's clock. The chandeliers add to the look. I just wish they light up the chandeliers every day to make it look even more beautiful. The decor is such that you would feel as if you are sitting at a raja's durbaar. A soft thumri is what was required to add to it. Well no music being played was a strict turn off. Well the world multi cuisine should be curbed off as the menu is too ancient and serves north indian and chinese which is meagrely available at every food joint. But the food quality is commendable.  have had the chicken tandoori some days before, it tasted awesome.  Yesterday we tried to go for the kebab. We went in for the murgh hariyali kebab and well the chicken was soft succulent and awesome to taste. For the main dish we went in for butter naan and mutton rogaan josh. The mutton rogaan josh could have been better.  But the naan was too good. Soft and supple with the right amount of butter. The staffs were however a bit cranky. The staffs were too busy with themselves. Behaved as if they owned the restro and they were treating us for free. This aspect needs to worked upon to upgrade customer satisfaction.  Try to keep to north indian, the chinese here is a bit bland.  But definitely will go back for the kebabs.

a little shift in eatery i would say though not our regular eatery during the ashtami hang out with friends¬†

the ambience well not much to savour though but space is small to my expectation¬†the interior could have bith more catchy i felt..the food part is pretty good though ¬†we ordered mutton biryani chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken tikka kabab while my other friends where eating butter nan and chicken bharta we ate as much as our tummies could load though the biriyani wasnt as entertaining but the reshmi butter masala sure did made up a good side dish and starter as tikka kabab was also excellent the softness juiceness of the chicken say whole story of the the chicken menu along with biryani..the location is bit odd after dropping down at town school more a long walk from there bypassing arsalan into a small street and voila a palacial zamindar house makes you feel a aristocrat bengali babu who is going in there to be eating and enjoy a ravishing zamindari meal restaurant to do some fine dining¬†there !! also heard from some that this one of the finest restaurant in north kolkata region so if by chance anybody missed it they should go in there to eat atleast once..

The most worthless restaurant I have ever been to. They have two different sitting area.If u enter and sit in the first dining area u will find urself sitting at someone's house. little clumsy ..untidy. Plates were not clean .spoons were not washed properly. And the bagicha part was even horrible. I saw a big rat running towards the kitchen area.¬† Now the most important thing...FOOD. I would not suggest any foody person to waste his money here. Probably they were trying out how worst a crispy chicken can be cooked. It was burnt and i hardly found chicken pieces in that dish. it was full of other things. Everything is unnecessarily spicy. I wont visit this place ever in my life. yakkkk!!

Used to be counted in one of the better restaurents in north kolkata. the location is a bit odd, hard to find for unfamiliar people. from hatibagan arsalan, go straight. the interior decoration, arrangements, stuffs are quite appreciable. the best part is the garden area sitting, for which it is named as "Bagicha". I have tried here chicken/mutton biriyani, chicken tikka masala, mutton rogan josh, tandoori chicken, chicken fried rice/chowmein, chicken hong kong, schezwan fish/chicken, garlic fish. all the foods were quite good in taste. so they should deserve 4 - 4.5 for such service.
but the reason of decreasing is my last few visits. they are not at that level of food that they used to be. the biriyani has lost its taste. the indian items are not so good now, in chinese they are still trying to make up. even i visited here once in puja with friends and ordered biriyani. they had shortage of plates and they offered us to share 1 plate for two biriyani.
but still after that i had visited here few more times, because i have seen their better service. so, i would expect them to come up with their service for which they are more popular in the town school trio and i can delete my second paragraph happily...

Dine like a Zamindar in a real palace without spending like one. Head to Bagicha.

I was not exaggerating. The establishment is situated inside the ground floor of a typical North Kolkata mansion. Other than the quite large signboard above the entrance, there's nothing to suggest that it's an eatery in this very residential neighborhood. However, as soon as one crosses the wooden threshold and goes up the marble steps, time starts moving backwards. A short mozaic balcony and a  heavy glass empanelled wooden door later, the clock finally stops somewhere during the period of the British Raj. An opulent, grand room with a vaunting ceiling and statues everywhere you look emerges as the restaurant floor. This had once been the front parlour or drawing room of the house. Apparently that atmosphere had been held as much as possible with original wooden furniture with black laquer finish, crystal chandeliers and soothing yellowish lighting. The top attraction is evidently the two huge belgium glass mirrors on opposite walls which fills the room with a radiant wash of light. The etched glass windows complement this. If you can manage your breath after such a scene, lets move on to the food.

The menu is ostensibly large. The price swings largely between sections but is satisfactorily average as compared to other places. A selection of Tandoor and Mughlai dishes dominate. I admit I was perplexed to find not one authentic bengali item on the menu given the obvious surroundings. Again, it was almost irritating to find a large section devoted to Chinese food with the typical noodles, fried rice and chopsuey. I'd suggest you give it all a miss.
There are soups and appetizers which are not such a rarity. The tandoori section is however a different story. Though quite a bit pricey, it's the top draw replete with excuisite tasting and exotic varieties of Kebabs which these people make with finesse. The Veg, Chicken and Fish sections are also well stocked. They do not serve beef although the mutton section has been titled 'Gosht ka kamaal'. The Biryani's and Polao's are prepared specially in Handis.

We were in a somewhat feisty mood and had ordered Nuns, Tandoori Roti's and a Masala Kulcha. :D These items are nowadays so costly, that it felt like we were going a bit overboard. But they did not disappoint us. The Nuns were large and the tawa flavour seeped through. Kulcha was perfect. The sweet and sour masala mix inside was suppemented with Kaju and spices that made it a veritable bob of flavours. Add to that the warm puffy outer crust of the tawa heated Parattha. The Tandoori Roti's seemed to be priced more than it's worth since the size and texture was disappointing.
We had a Murgh Kolapuri  to accompany that. We loved it as soon as it was plated. The blood red colour of the deep fried sizzling chicken, the spice loaded thick gravy on top and the steaming tawa burnt smell proved a hard to resist combination. The chicken was soft and tender inside. The portions were quite large with two chicken pieces in a dish, a leg and a breast piece with minimum bone. One plate easily serves two. 
The thing which I absolutely adored was the large bowl of lukewarm water with a piece of lime served on the table for washing the hands. This reminded of countless trips to Biye Bari's in earlier years. :) I liked this attention to small details .

The service was quick and the waiters courteous and willing. There's an outdoor seating area in a garden setting which used to be the courtyard of the erstwhile residence. The restrooms require urgent maintanence.

Chakraborty Tips : It's a bit difficult to find. So, I'll be as clear as possible. It's on Shyampukur Street, the road running from Shobhabazaar AV School to Hatibagan. It takes a walk of around 10 minutes to reach it and rickshaws are not readily available. For people from the south of the city and elsewhere, the school is the large building cornering the first road running right when you move northwards on Girish Avenue from Shobhabazaar metro station. If you venture from the Hatibagan side, it's simply a few minutes walk further from the Arsalan outlet.

I liked this place for its ambience. Whenever I entered over here I felt to have entered the house of affluent zamindars. However recently due to lack of maintenance, I hear that they have lost on the ambience part. The food meter however has remained from average to good. The chinese is particularly good over here. If you are residing in north Kolkata which unfortunately has less eating houses when compared to south Kolkata, and have not yet visited this place, then please do so immediately.

Located near hatibagan, the restaurant is located inside an old traditional mansion but the whole initiative is lost by a very mediocre decor and maintenance. The prices are reasonable with pretty generous servings and the food tastes decent so overall its gives you ur money's worth but the place could be so much more !!!

I tried the restaurant recently on a weekday evening. The ceilings are high being an old construction yet the air conditioning was pretty effective. The staff were polite warm though lacked mannerisms one expects from a proper restaurant. I ordered chinese dishes but later on seeing what arrived on others' tables i am very optimistic about their north indian food, more than the chinese food i experienced.

The portions were huge. Crispy chilli babycorn was not crispy and i i felt it was way too oily. I kind of liked the flavours but dint like the dish eventually. Soups were nice. The staff tried to help me place my further orders to their best but they lacked that grip over the menu to succeed as such. I tried the fried rice with veg sweet and sour vegetables. The ingredients were all very good and of good quality. The rice was nice but the side dish was bit too sweet for me. 

Overall i felt the food is nice here but the experience could be better. I felt the north indian food to be their strength in the end and would definitely try it out in future !!

Oh I have made memories here..! This place will always have a very close place in my heart. I've eaten here innumerable times and I pride myself saying that I've tried each and every item that they serve. Their chicken is well-cooked, paneer delicacies will make you lick your fingers and they rule the mushroom dishes. 

The ambience is good. Located close to hatibagan region, it's a great place to stop and eat if one is tired from all the shopping. It has good air-condition and soft lights. If you are more into Nature, they even have an open garden seating arrangement for you. The staff is courteous and well-mannered and many a times they have helped us choose what to order for and we've never ever regretted it. I only have good things to say about this place.

I would certainly suggest people to try it if and when visiting Star theatre or Hatibagan or Shyambazar.

Bagicha is a north-kolkatan eatery, build upon a mansion of yesteryear. Long verandah, big hall, outside lawn comprises the interior. Outside or open area is not always available to dine. It is good option but not well-maintained though.

We went there in various occasions. tried both Indian and chinese cuisine, both are good. Kebab, tandoori is very good here. Same goes for Naan/paratha and gravy(s). Chicken Butter masala is good.

Chinese section noodles and rice both are good. Proportion is right. Pricing is ok too. Mixed fried rice is good as well as the chicken preparations.

It is a good try, not worth mentioning but you can try it out once if you are in the locality.

Bagicha is the place which I'd love to visit again n again n again.....

The best quality and tasty Indian cuisine I've ever had...
The quality and quantity both are too good.. .. ..
 And one thing I must mention that the "Nan" is so soft even after 15 to 20 minutes after serving,
I've never got so soft and tasty "Nun" elsewhere,
believe friends, I'm talking about the "Plain Nan", not with the "Butter" one..

In some reviews I've found that the food is not up to the mark during Puja days, some of my friends also told me so..
I've never visit there on pujas, but I think this is a common complaining factor for many of the restaurants in Kolkata...


So comparing all..
The Traditional look and feel,
Good behavior and service,
and the quality of food

Bagicha will get the positive mark . . .

One of the best dining options in shyambazar-hatibagan area. Visited Bagicha for numerous ocassions.....

Its a standard restaurant in totality. Sitting area is pretty large but I recommnd is there garden area for sitting if available, tell u what- its an amazing xprience. Ambience is cozy. Decor is soothing to d eyes.....

Now for the food, again its a big thumbs up. Menu is sumptious, varity is endless. Try out any of d dishes of ur choice nd rest assured dat u will nt b dissappointd. Rates are nt cheap though bt nt too high also.....

OVERALL- A decent place wid value for money.... Cheers!!!!

Very well behave staffs. The sitting arrangement in the garden is wonderful, only if it's a non rainy day!! Overall good food, good quantity, good quality and pocket friendly. I was never left with disappointment after the numerous times I visited.

We went to bagicha last weekend. Actually we did not have a plan to go there but as arsalan was packed, we opted bagicha for lunch. It is unfortunate that the out-skirt sitting was closed that day. It has a traditional decor, sober ambiance and well behaved staffs. We ordered chicken tabdoori which was very good. As main course we ordered mutton biriyani, chicken kadhai, chicken reshmi butter masala. Biriyani was good also. They give the foods with a large quantity. I loved the biriyani and that's why may be I will go there again. Pocket pinch for two will be within 500 I guess.

I have visited this restaurant thrice and out of those 3times,twice I was really satisfied and once I was disappointed.Located in a small lane from Hatibagan crossing it is quite convenient.From Shyam bazar metro it is about 10 mins walk.The place offers Indian and Chinese cuisine.The Indian items are far better than the Chinese ones.The kebabs,nuns and the main course side dish items are all really good and tasty.The amount of food is decent and the prices are reasonable too.
The place offers both indoor and outdoor seating facility.The ambience is really nice.It lacks the glamour of the restaurant of South Kolkata but it will draw your attention and will impress you.The service is a little on the slower side.
The only time I was disappointed was when I visited this place during Durga pujo.On that occasion,we found the food tasteless and a lot of the items were not available either.But then I guess many restaurants serve food below their normal standard during Durga Pujo.
Overall North Kolkata and more so the shyam bazar area is more renowned for its street food than restaurants.But if you want a good place for dining then this is probably the best option available.For me this is the best among the restaurants in the Shyambazar area.

Bagicha is a hot-favorite. Its highlight is the eating area in an indoor garden with an artificial stone waterfall. Most people vising this restaurant in order to have food while sitting in the indoor garden.. and hence, its packed most of the time. So if you ever get a chance (I got it thrice), make sure you sit in the real Bagicha,

Coming to the food, it's real tasty. Especially the Indian cuisines. I make it a point to sink my teeth into their Tandoori Chicken every time I visit this place. The naans, the tandoori rotis, and the other Indian side-dishes are also worth trying. Don't hesitate to order... you will love it for sure. The Chinese dishes are also good, but the Indian dishes are much better.

Just one word of caution, and I'm taking away 1 star because of it. Avoid this place during the Durga Pujo week. Don't be surprised if you end up with egg shells or prawn shells on your plate. The food also doesn't taste that good during this time of the year. Choose any other week, and you are bound to fall in love with this restaurant.

Here are the outlines of my experience here.
Location: very convenient for me. Straight to the hatibagan crossing and then walking distance through a lane.
Ambience: The place wasn't too crowded the day I went there, so I had a nice time. It isn't too brightly coloured......all in all a serene effect. 
Food: Really good North Indian food. I'd especially recommend the kebabs here. I think we had the Murg hariyali kebab and it tasted great. The remaining items are good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Helpings are standard: one plate of gravy was good enough for the two of us, but we were already a bit full from the kebab.
The prices aren't too high, so it's a good choice. 
Service: The food was brought pretty quick. As long as service is efficient, I don't complain. 
I'm definitely going to visit again soon.

The first thing you will notice about the place is its ambience....u will love it.
The food is good though i tried the Indian cuisine only. The service was satisfactory but it could have been better. Nonetheless, it is one of the best dine-out in north kolkata and you can definitely give it a try.

among the restaurants operating in north kolkata,bagicha is one of the best.it lacks the splendor of plush eateries of south kol,but makes it up with its warmth.its spacious and cordial,the staff are homely and there are both indoor and open air seating arrangements.the food is also extremely good and pocket friendly.chinese preparations are a must try.whenever i visit hatibagan,i try to make it a point of coming here.they also have a music playing to beef up your mood,which is quite soothing

Bagicha has this great positional advantage ,a big open garden restaurant which they can really deck up and make it the best eatery of the area.
Food is good but nothing extra ordinary.
I fell in love with their open garden and how I remember spending at least half an our,thinking if only I could get this place on lease and make it a memorable dine out experience for my kolkatans... Hahahaha.... :)

My rating is mainly based on the open garden restaurant and the old north kolkata charm that this place holds...

The USP of this restaurant is only the its 'bagicha', where you cannot sit during summers! Food is nothing great, and the appetizers are pretty bad. Service is ok but not up to the mark.

The food is awesome here. But the garden needs proper maintenance and a bit of retouch it looks too old not like the way it used to look years back, it lost its shine.I was a frequent visitor then but this time when I went didn't liked to sit at the garden at all it looked kinda messy but the food is still great at reasonable price and its still the best restaurant in that area.

This place is very close to my heart.I like the ambiance pretty much.It is very ethnic and unique. The stuffs re well trained and they serve fast also. They an an awesome lawn ,its quite big though. 

let's talk about food,their tandoori chicken and chicken reshmi butter masala is my favorite dish. Chicken and mutton watever they serve they are properly boiled and soft. Price is very reasonable. Plus their environment is very family friendly,perfect place for family dinner or lunch. I want them to introduce buffet also. 

but only one complain,that their quantity is not constant it varies day by day i don't know why.

I was looking for a new restaurant (which we have not yet tried) in Shyambazar, Hatibagan area to go for a dinner with my wife. I saw this place a few times while passing by and when the Zomato search included this name, we both agreed to give this place a try. 

First the reasons for picking up this place. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a really old, huge North Kolkata house and have a very heritage feel. And I remember once I heard that it have used some old statues and antiques to decorate the place.

The ambiance - The restaurant have one AC dining hall and one open air garden arrangement. We chose the garden. There were a few cement umbrellas, a hut and a separate area surrounded by water channel and a small bridge. The hut and the separate area can accommodate about six people. We chose a table under one small umbrella. The lighting was good, not too much and also not too dark. The music was good and in the right volume. The fountains, water channels and their lights were not operating and we were told that these things are turned on on special occasions like New Year, Durga Puja etc. Will love to visit once then.

Food - Good. This is not a place where you will visit for a specialty, but the food was just plain good. Not awesome, not even bad. We tried Chinese. The cream of mushroom soup was great, the Mixed fried rice and garlic fish was good. The sweet lime soda was good too (I mentioned this because some big restaurants I visited served sweet lime soda which tasted like just plain cold water). The problem was with the golden fried prawns (no spice or salt. And also I didn't expect the besan covering) and the garlic fish had a few bones (4) :) The amount of food was good too.

Price - I liked the pricing. With the ambiance, amount of food and quality, the price is reasonable.

Service - Service was good. 

All in all a good place and I would definitely visit it again with my family. And I would also like to taste their Indian dishes as I think they will be better :P
