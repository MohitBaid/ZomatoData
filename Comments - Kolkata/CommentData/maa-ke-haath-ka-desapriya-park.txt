Amazingly delicious food made right from the warmth of a Mother's kitchen. The Delivery was as promised and so was the quantity and quality of food.
A Must try - Chocolate Naru, known to be their specialty
They also take in bulk orders if ordered 24 hours in advance. Don't forget to try the Coconut Prawn Pulao along with Chicken Kasha Curry (for Non-vegs) or Paneer Chaap (for pure veg) or Punjabi Keema Curry (for the experimental ones looking to try something new), and you will be amazed.
Waiting to try more food of their Bengali Cuisine Menu soon.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!
Quick Tip - Give them a call or drop in a mail before pre-orders to know their SPECIAL OF THE DAY
