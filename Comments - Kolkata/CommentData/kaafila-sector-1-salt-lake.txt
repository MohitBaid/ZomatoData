There are some restaurants where you experience qualities that force you to write a review.
Kaafila is one of them.
Right from the 1st step you put in here, you feel the gripping Afghani ambience promised by its name! It is spacious and there are numerous cubicle-like seaters where your dining privacy won't be encroached on.
The food they serve is equally ambrosial - mainly North Indian, Mughalai and Afghani, and they have a large variety to serve - both food and drinks.
Must try : Machhi Taka Tin, Lababdar Reshmi.
Hospitality is almost polite, can do better. Service is fast.
Somewhat upscale - undoubtedly among the best themed restaurants in the city.

One of my best place to have Indian meals. Well not completely Indian but afgani to be more specific, this place makes complete justice to its name. I have been there a couple of times and starting from its decor to food every thing has an uniqueness.
To start with their Sherbets: I had the ginger ale and pink panther. But I really loved the ginger ale, works great after that heavy meal.
Their Kebabs are mouth smacking, and I would recommend to go for those mutton kebabs like the Kakori Kebab. Its soft and supple and tastes wow. Even the tandoori is quite a delight.
The show stopper here is the Khandaani Naan where the Naan is cooked with nuts and dry fruits which gives it slight  sweet taste, but let me warn you, its very heavy and a single one can be sufficient for  most of us. I generally go for their plain breads because that gives you a chance to enjoy the side preparations. 
Sunhere Murgh is what we had the last time which had a nut based gravy and chickens very tender.
Pocket pinch: around 25k
Among the mushrooming Indian/Mughlai food joints in Kolkata, this definitely stand out to be one of the best.

Oddly enough, I hadn't heard about this popular Afghan restaurant until yesterday. My friend took me there for an impromptu lunch, and I have to say that I am bowled over. It was probably the best Mughlai food I have had, and any adjective I use to describe the food would be insufficient. We had Tandoori Mahi Kebab, Kabuli Tandoori Murgh, Lasooni Naan and Laal Mirchi Paratha and went home with huge tummies and big smiles of satisfaction. Also, service was quick and the decor was soothing, but frankly I was too distracted with the food to notice much. Can't wait to go back and tag friends along to indulge in the delicacy called Kaafila :)

I had heard a lot about Kaafila but did not manage earlier to enjoy this place. But today, 05.01.2018, we went to Kaafila for a office team party and the experience was bang on. 
The decor, ambience and service were very good.
The best part was the food.

Beverage:
1. Blue heaven: tasted really good
2. Marine delight: it tasted mostly like homeopathy tonic.
3. Fresh lime soda: it was good.

Starter: 
4. Galouti kebab: it was tasty but kind of dry. I had tasted Galouti kebab from other places as well. Compared to that this one was just good, not so amazing.
5. Murgh Sunehre kebab: this was awesome. Chicken, spices, nuts made this preparation super tasty.
6. Veg platter: good

Mains:
7. Kandahari Laham: if you come to Kaafila and do not have this, then it will be a great miss. This is a signature dish of this place. The presentation as well as the taste were heavenly.  Recommended.
8. Khandani Naan: it is the best pair with Kandahari Laham. This naan is stuffed with dry fruits and cherry. This one should be taken with some side dish which is very spicey as this naan is sweet in taste. In one plate there were about 7-8 pieces. Recommended.
7. Veg Biryani: I did not taste this. Some vegetarian persons of our team ordered with one with a veg side.

Dessert:
8. Firni: good
9. Baulawnee: this is also very tasty. But this sweet dish is heavy and full of dry fruits and made with clarified butter. If you are a real fan of mughlai heavy food then try this.

Overall I was super impressed by the food of this place. Along with food, they serve a sweet paan at the end which was too go to avoid.
Price is on the higher side but it is fine as Kaafila is placed inside a busy mall of Kolkata and also for the food they serve along with the courteous service.

Kaafila is one of the renowned names in the city. Been there many times, enjoyed each and every visit. Ambience is lavish and classy, one can enjoy being here for hours and hours obviously accompanied with extremely delectable dishes. The inside atmosphere is good and with beautiful interior designing. They have plenty of staff members to take care of your order needs. The food quantity is much more that you will be satisfied to have it , apart from this the quality is quite good and tasty . As far as seating arrangements are concerned, you will have ample of space to accommodate good amount of people comfortably.

Would love to visit again!

Happy Eating!

This place will attract the people for its different ambience. Coming to the food, it Is really tasty. We have ordered, murgh malai tikka ,lasooni naan, registani laal gosht and sabz pilaf. Everything was fresh and juicy. The staffs were attentive and courteous. At the first place , the items may seem expensive but as you see the bill , it is totally worth it, because you don't have to pay high taxes and liquor price is inclusive of taxes no extra charges. This place is ideal for everyone. Recommended

Visited this place during the festive season after reservation.. The place has a rustic ambiance.. Like a village household in some Afghan village. We ordered green fantasy, Shirley temple and Quite tangy. They all had their unique tastes and were quite refreshing.. Then arrived our non veg kabab platter... one pomfret, 2 fish sheekhs, 3 chicken sheekhs, 2 hariyali chkn and 2 red chkn tandoori and 2 pieces of mutton galouti.. The galouti was the winner but the rest were close second.. We loved the platter.. Almost full wth the kababs we ordered cheese nan and plain nan.. one each and had it with Registhani lal maas. It was overwhelmingly tasty.. The mutton soft and succulent. Would love to try their biriyani nxt time. Last but not the least.. had boulawnee as dessert.. a nut halwa ( hot) served with vanilla icecream. Needed seconds but hd to put a lid on our greed due to lack of space in tummy.

The place serves the best north indian food with a calm and peaceful ambience. This is a total family place and the staff serving here are very courteous as they understand the different generations coming down to their restaurants as a family. The prices have been reasonable for a good dinner. I think it's a go-to place when we require the calmness from the fast moving world.

I am sorry but I don't remember the exact name of these items. The biriani  had a whole chicken  in it and the taste was real good.
This is a property  to keep in watch.

I was a bit panicked when I learnt that they have this first-come-first-service on Christmas. Went there with fingers crossed, since I was desperate to try this restaurant. Lady luck smiled on us and we were immediately allocated a table upon our arrival at around 7.30pm. We ordered Tandoori Angar, Cheese Naan, Murgh Sunheri, Murg Sufiyani, the Christmas special dish of Tandoori Batak, Red Mary and Mojito. The food was good, if not great. The best part was we got complimentary cocktail with Tandoori Batak, as per their Christmas offer.

The great part about eating here was Mr.Kajal. I have been to many restaurants and I have come across various friendly staff, but none as him. His smile will just set your mood right. Amazingly enough, he managed to reach our table every time we were looking for someone to place order. My dad and uncle had ordered whiskey. Upon asking to repeat the drink, my dad jokingly told him about how he should refill the chaat as well since it was X-mas. He smiled and actually did that. His positive attitude and innocent smile was just the perfect icing on the cake.
If the restaurant is reading this, please let him know that I am thankful. Keep up the good work.

I was looking to give a negative rating but it will not go down below one.
I went with my family on Christmas dinner and was expecting for a good experience overall but alas we were just denied entry by the concierge and here's why. We confirmed the timing for lunch over phone which was 3:45pm as per the person who answered. Even as per Zomato it was 3:15pm. We reached the restaurant at exactly 2:50pm and while asking for the table they denied saying no vacant table is available. We were ready to wait as it was on a festival day but almost 50 minutes before the actual closing time they denied saying no availability. 
I asked them why we were misinformed about the timing and why the time was not mentioned as 3pm instead of 3:30, but instead of providing a logical reason the staff continued with his irrational argument which was highly unprofessional.
No more try Kaafila and thanks for the pathetic experience.

Multiple things gone wrong with my experience at Kaafila. I ordered the Khandani Naan, which i absolutely hated. It was sweet with Cherry on top (i guess). The dal makhani is called sonething else but was average. Had zomato not screwed up the delivery i would have received the food hot but i have taken that into account in my rating. Looking at the already high rating i will definitely give Kaafila a second try at the restaurant and you too take my review with a pinch of salt.

This restaurant is aptly decked like an afgan household. A 10 year old restaurant in saltlake serves noryh western cusine. The service is prompt even for the busiest of the times. I ordered 

Tandoori murg avadhi: this is well marinated chicken in yogurt pepper lime and cooked perfect in tandoor. I loved it. 

Firni: the star of the show was their dessert. The firni was just mind blowing. 

All in all a really good restaurant is you are craving tandoori food.

I have heard about this restaurant in Cc1 many a times but finally visited it. Review is as follows:
—Ambience, Theme, Staff : Ambience of the restaurant is really nice and very different. It is themed as an Afghani thek where u will find guns, swords then big pots where Afghans used to keep sura and all. Staff are very good and courteous. Also they give advice if u cannot understand what to order or about the taste of the dish which u r going to order.
— Food, Quantity, Price - We ordered for Murgh Malai Tikka, Kandahri Laham in starter; Tandoori Roti , Keema Naan in Breads; Ghost Khada Masala and Murgh Butter Masala in Gravy items. The starter was awesome in taste: Murgh Malai Tikka was very tender, soft n nicely barbecued and Kandhari Laham u will just fall in love if u like mutton. Soft mutton shredded with spices and awesome taste. Also, you will be surprised by seeing the way they serve Kandhari Laham. Keema Naan was very good and soft. The Ghost Khada Masala mind blowing taste and the mutton pieces so big, tasty and juicy and on top of everything very nice cooked and very soft. I just loved the dish. The quantity of each and item is surplus and easily four people can enjoy with these dishes. Price is ok as per the quantity, quality and taste. It is little bit on higher side but once u taste these dishes u will no think twice to spend money.

Over all good experience will visit again.

My Expectation was really high, went to celebrate my moms birthday, we had ordered KANDAHARI LAHAM for starters, this dish was supposed to be whole mutton leg marinated with ginger garlic soaked in yogurt over night and its an Afghan delicacy....but it was utter rubbish, they served a whole bone with no meat attached to it, the meat was separately baked in oven and served with bones as if they were cooked together. It was evident that it was a separate bone and the meat were cooked separately but served together in order to show that they were cooked together, it was served cold. This is cheating and giving false expectations to the customers. I know the taste of this recipe cause I have been traveling all over the world and had this dish before..very sorry to say food was utterly disappointing and not worth the money at all.

Brilliant kebabs. The zabib e murgh tikka is my all time favourite. The stuffing that they do in it is really a delight. Last time I had the murgh k Hari kalmi as well. The quantity was too much for two. Keema nuns, sunehre murgh, kurchans all taste fantastic. For a north-indian food lover like me it is heaven. Wont comment on the desserts because I haven't tried them out yet because it has been a little difficult to move on from starters and main courses. Maybe next time.

Starting of with management !! When i ask to recommend something with parathas he didnt do.
Secondly, the waiter who was serving the food had his own view point. He served biriyani into one plate and paratha in mine
I asked to serve the rest of the biriyani but he denied stating “you eat this first i will serve later “

Really?? When i am telling you to serve u shouldnt give ur opinion which one to eat which not to..
Disgusting!!!

Talking about biriyani : worst ever biriyani i had
. Technically it was not biriyani with dehradun rice which kolkata is famous for.. it was fried rice in yellow color.

Overall experience in this restaurant would be horrible, overrated and not at all up to the mark.
There are far better rest in afghani cuisine.
My bad choice i made!!
I don’t recommend anyone .

Went there for a Sunday lunch. The ambience is good and different from usual places with carpet and guns adoring the wall.
The food was delicious and the helping was also good.
Overall a good experience but service can be improved.

Ambiance good (4 pts)
Good collection of drinks (4 pts)
Food menu is different and unique. Loved the arabic style (4 pts)
Food was delicious (4 pts) Quantity was sufficient too (4 pts)
But, pricing ruined the experience. I didn't expect to pay 3600 for two people. I would have preferred having a lunch buffet in BBQ instead. You really need to work on the price. May be it's okay for some. But still 3600 for two was quite a lot.
But I loved the Arabic style! Should definitely visit for that.

This place is situated in cc1,saltlake,sector1...one of the best places in kolkata try some afgani food..
 
 Ambience of the restaurant is really nice and very different...It is themed as an Afghani cuisine...The walls are covered with guns, swords paintings and all...

                        We took murg malai tikka as a starter...And this dish was really very delicious..each and every bite of this dish was heaven...Six medium size of boneless chicken pieces were there...I highly recommended this...One more thing i would like to add ,the pudina chutny was perfect with this malai tikka...this dish was 5/5

For main course we ordered ghost sikandari,firni,karahi murgh alkaief...I want to give the recommendations for this dishes...And i can surely assure you that u will never disappoint after tasting it...

The ghost sikandari quite unimpressed me...They served raita along with the biriyani...This was 3/5

Karahi murgh filled with 4 large leg pieces...Capsicum,onion were there in the gravy..This was properly cooked...The gravy was medium spicy and creamy..I just loved it so much...This was 5/5 

Now coming to the firni...They served keshar firni...I must say they served this the best...this was 5/5

Staff and hospitality was good enough...I liked it...I wanna visit this place again and again...

It is an almost 10 yrs old restaurant at the Salt Lake City Centre.It serves the north western frontier cuisine.Aptly decked up like the interior of a Afghan household.Love the detailing ( it came into the Kolkata food map at a time when there was hardly any concept of theme restaurant)
The tapestry of woven carpets, the lanterns ,the sackful of whole spices,the pictures,the guns and even the rugged floor and the walls and at once transports you to the land of caravans of camels.
It is good that the restaurant is successfully serving the same good food  almost for a decade. The service is prompt even at peak hours.The waiters clad in traditional Kabuli dresses add some more points to the ambience.
Must tries are:
As appetisers:
Dezaje Mushluque (a  slightly different preparation of chicken tandoori...more succulent and flavourful.) 
Banjara Machhi( grilled pomfret with special herbs and spices)
Irani Machhi Tikka.
Paneer/Murgh Kurchan
For main course:
Daal pakhtooni 
Murgh sufiyani(a must with cheese nun or cottage cheese kulcha)
Ghosht khada masala
Kid - nu -ghosht( this one goes well with plain rice)
For rice :
Murgh sufiyani  is our favourite.
For dessert:
kesaria firni 
Boulawnee,a dry fruit rich pastry topped with with Vanilla ice cream is another must try.

This 7 years old restaurant has been hidden gem, I came to know this place from a friend.
Located at City Center 3rd Floor.

Ambiance was nice and decor was fantastic.

Drinks I had Pink panther which was strawberry based soda drink, quite refreshing.

Appetizers I had 3 types, Irani Machhi Tikka, Murgh Sunhere kebab and Mutton Galouti Kebab.
Sunhere and Galouti Kebab was amazing, Fish kebab was very good.

Main Course I had Gosht Khada Masala - Tasty
Murgh Sufiyana Pasanda -  Very Good
Dal Paktooni was brilliant
Murgh Sufiyani Biryani was good.

In dessert I had Kesaria Firni and it was Very Good.

Service was quite fast and good.

Heard a lot about this place and finally made a visit to this place with all high expectations.
Being a Biryani Lover it always make me curious about how i am going to get the Biryani this time. 
Ambiance is classic, it feels like sitting at a restro somewhere Egypt or Iraq. Even the Servers are very well dressed according to the attire of the place.

We Tried the following food :

In the Starters we had : Irani Macchi Tikha which soft and juicy as it can get.

Main Course : Murgh Sufiyani Pasanada and this just won my heart. it was spicy, tasty and contained all the flavors.
Secondly it was Gosht Sufiyani Birani. Now i was really shocked to see such a great Biryani at such a  great place. Tasted Awesome.
The bread Complemented the Sides really well.
8/10 for the Firni.

Overrated restaurant..!! May b the first one which disappointed me so much..

I ordered murgh malai kabab and murgh sufiyani.

Murgh malai kabab was ok-ish.. nothing so special and the biryani utterly disappointing. It tasted extremely basic..nothing special at all.. I dont know how many people try little roadside shop biryani..bt actually evn a few roadside ones tastes better. Its totally my viewpoint.
The price set and the food served was absolutely no match for me.

Evn the decorations..yes..it is as it is shown in the pics..bt somehow when i went there..didnt seem so very appealing.. didn't look realistic..

Staff were friendly.

May b the price is high because of its location.. bt anyway..it is overrated for sure.

I do hope they improve on their food.

I can come back to this place again & again just to have the super delicious Khandani Naan that they make! If you have a sweet tooth like me (or even if you don't), you will thank me for this recommendation!

Located on the 3rd floor of Block E, City Centre 1, Kaafila is consistently serving great food through the years and excels in the service department too.

The must orders -

Pink Panther
Choco lated
Khandani Naan
Garlic Naan
Daal Pakhtooni
Galouti Kebab
Bharta Chicken

Reasonably priced. Recommended!

I had once read that the word 'Kaafila' is an arabic term describing a convoy..and being very true to the name this restaurant has the feel and the decor of an Afghani origin.. I felt this place looks like it's straight out of a Bollywood movie 'Kabul Express'.. beautiful mesmerising decor consisting of carpets and lanters to ceiling rugs and frills..spices in gunny bags adding to the ambiance..
Now coming to the food..
we ordered mocktails out of which 'quite tangy' was my pick..a refreshing lychee, blackberry and lime based drink served in a tall glass..
Starters were simply one of the best I have ever tasted.. each imparted a rich middle Eastern taste and here is what you should try- mutton galouti kebab, murgh sunerhi kebab and irani machhi tikka..each of them unique and living up to our expectation..
Main course was a bit elaborate we tried both breads and biriyani..murgh sufiyani biriyani( tastes brilliant) with gosht kadha masala..(its very soft and melts in the mouth)dal pakhtooni (black dal cooked to perfection) with garlic naan..
And we ended this pleasurable ordeal on a sweet note with kesaria Firni..it was so good that we were having it almost like a slow motion movie..one spoon and then another
The service was great and the team was cordial enough.. it's one of the best themed restaurants that I have been to.

I am not a big fan of North Indian or Mughlai cuisine. So I choose my restaurants really wisely before I drop in to dine. Kaafila, with its increasing popularity among the people, had to be given a chance.

The first thing you notice about the place is the amount of effort put into the decor - giving an Afghani touch, starting from hanging rugs and clothes on the ceiling, resembling a tent, to putting royal furniture around. I would have appreciated had they served the food in heavy metal utensils, keeping in line with the thematic ambience, but even without it, this place barely gives you scope of complaining.

Starting on with the food, here goes my order:
Choco-Lated: This was a mistake, not because of its taste, but because this isn't the kind of drink you should order at a Mughlai place. Treated independently, the taste was quite good.

Starters:
Galouti Kebab, Murgh Sunehre Kebab, Irani Macchi Tikka : Each of them were excellent! The Galoutis were soft and most importantly, NOT burnt unlike most places, keeping the taste intact. The Murgh Sunehre Kebab had a flavour of peanuts, and since I am not too fond of them, I wasn't eager to try it out. But with the green chutney, it went perfectly, with the chutney's taste overpowering that of the peanut. The Irani Machchi Tikka was well-cooked, soft, and had a pretty different and distinctive taste. I would recommend all of them.

Main Course:
Khurmi Naan, Cheese Kulcha and Lachcha Paratha with Gosht Khada Masala, Murgh Sufiyani Pasanda and Dal Pakhtooni: Yes, we were a big group and naturally the orders just flowed. I have really been attracted to Mughlai food just by their looks, since the dripping oil and all-too-visible spices automatically repel me. However, the moment the Khurmi Naan arrived, I couldn't wait to try it out! It's so good in itself that you barely need any accompaniment. Among the side dishes, my carnivorous self took a backseat as I drooled over the Dal Pakhtooni - IT'S THAT GOOD! You totally need to try it out. The mutton was on the spicier side while the Bharta was not the usual red-gravy one.

Dessert:
Kesaria Firni: It marked a royal finish to the sumptuous meal.

Overall, judging in terms of the ambience, the service, the quality and quantity of food and the value for money - Kaafila is sure to leave a lasting impression. Totally recommended.

Went for a office party for dinner. Nice ambience. Foodwise we loved the kandahari laham. we also had veg and non veg starter platters which were so so. the paneer kebab had no taste of paneer ( not sure from where these restaurants get paneer as nowhere i got good paneer dish). fish kebab had little foul smell, they said since it was bhetki, there is a smell. but that was not the case. i took the left over fish kebab home and grilled them in microwave. after that there was no smell and the kebab tasted better. we also took roti and chicken bharta and palak paneer, which were very ordinary. apart from that i took a spicy arabian which is a vodka cocktail. the quality of vodka was very low. may be i will go there again only to have kandahari laham 😊😊

An authentic Mughal and North West Frontier Province treat !! Mesmerizing ambiance situated in 3rd Floor of CITY CENTER 1, where you indulge yourself to experience the Mughal Empire...The interiors and hospitality makes you feel so.

Unfortunately I couldn't extend my stay as I had a take away order, as neither Zomato nor any Vendor do a delivery to Ecospace where we were supposed to have our Lunch, luckily I could witness the interiors for a while and get an opportunity to interact with the staff members.

We had ordered 2 plates of Tehari Murgh and as described it's it comes from the Lucknowi Kitchen you will get the Nawabi feel when you relish the meal. It's worth it. Trust me, 2 plates is more than sufficient for 7-8 persons meal. Now coming to the dish, it's a full Dumphukt Chicken in a single plate with 4  huge pieces coming with the most perfect amalgamation of spices and icing to the cake are the deep fried potatoes in it. I just fell in love with them. The tenderness of the chicken is Stellar. This comes with Basmati Rice and mutton keema, along with hard boiled eggs, green salad and pickles are complementary. The rice was amazing too. Now I am deducting a point five just for the mutton keema, as it had a fragrance of old goat meat which was weird which all don't like, this could be improved. But overall I am highly satisfied with the dish. Perhaps the best Lucknowi Nawabi food in Town. I recommend this to everyone to experience the dine in service as I liked the service and hospitality of the take away staff members. Everything was top notch. I didn't had to wait much for the take away order, I had called before leaving and got delivery as soon as I reached. The packaging was hygienic and comfortable to carry. The best part of the experience is that I got corporate discount too.. Please try this out guys.

I have really been attracted to Mughlai food just by their looks, since the dripping oil and all-too-visible spices automatically repel me. However, the moment the Khurmi Naan arrived, I couldn't wait to try it out! It's so good in itself that you barely need any accompaniment. Among the side dishes, my carnivorous self took a backseat as I drooled over the Dal Pakhtooni - IT'S THAT GOOD! You totally need to try it out. The mutton was on the spicier side while the Bharta was not the usual red-gravy one.

Dessert:
Kesaria Firni: It marked a royal finish to the sumptuous meal.

Overall, judging in terms of the ambience, the service, the quality and quantity of food and the value for money - Kaafila is sure to leave a lasting impression. Totally recommended.

Went for a office party for dinner. Nice ambience. Foodwise we loved the kandahari laham. we also had veg and non veg starter platters which were so so. the paneer kebab had no taste of paneer ( not sure from where these restaurants get paneer as nowhere i got good paneer dish). fish kebab had little foul smell, they said since it was bhetki, there is a smell. but that was not the case. i took the left over fish kebab home and grilled them in microwave. after that there was no smell and the kebab tasted better. we also took roti and chicken bharta and palak paneer, which were very ordinary. apart from that i took a spicy arabian which is a vodka cocktail. the quality of vodka was very low. may be i will go there again only to have kandahari laham 😊😊

It is not at all a place of 4.3 ratings. We have visited the place on diwali. It was almost empty. Decoration ans staffs  were good. But the food was pathetic. Chicken pieces were all fibres. Masala kulcha was not tasty. Biriyani smells awkward.

An authentic Mughal and North West Frontier Province treat !! Mesmerizing ambiance situated in 3rd Floor of CITY CENTER 1, where you indulge yourself to experience the Mughal Empire...The interiors and hospitality makes you feel so.

Unfortunately I couldn't extend my stay as I had a take away order, as neither Zomato nor any Vendor do a delivery to Ecospace where we were supposed to have our Lunch, luckily I could witness the interiors for a while and get an opportunity to interact with the staff members.

We had ordered 2 plates of Tehari Murgh and as described it's it comes from the Lucknowi Kitchen you will get the Nawabi feel when you relish the meal. It's worth it. Trust me, 2 plates is more than sufficient for 7-8 persons meal. Now coming to the dish, it's a full Dumphukt Chicken in a single plate with 4  huge pieces coming with the most perfect amalgamation of spices and icing to the cake are the deep fried potatoes in it. I just fell in love with them. The tenderness of the chicken is Stellar. This comes with Basmati Rice and mutton keema, along with hard boiled eggs, green salad and pickles are complementary. The rice was amazing too. Now I am deducting a point five just for the mutton keema, as it had a fragrance of old goat meat which was weird which all don't like, this could be improved. But overall I am highly satisfied with the dish. Perhaps the best Lucknowi Nawabi food in Town. I recommend this to everyone to experience the dine in service as I liked the service and hospitality of the take away staff members. Everything was top notch. I didn't had to wait much for the take away order, I had called before leaving and got delivery as soon as I reached. The packaging was hygienic and comfortable to carry. The best part of the experience is that I got corporate discount too.. Please try this out guys.

Overpriced,such quality and taste of food is available at restaurants like  ARSALAN,AMINIA OR SHIRAZ which serves the cuisines at half its prices. I didn't get the reason for what they are charging so much,it might be because it is inside the city centre. I am really disappointed. Overrated,i don't know if reviews are paid ones.
At the same price people can have far better food and enjoy the decor and environment at OUDH 1590.
It was a really very bad experience at KAAFILA.

The reviews about this place was always great. When I visited finally after reading through the reviews, I was in love with the place. The ambience, the service, the food quality and quantity is superb. We were in a group of 4 and tried kandahari laham as starter and Tehari murgh as the main course. The starter was out of the world and the Tehari was also good but I found it a lil over-hyped. However, it was a superb place to dine. I would love to visit the place again.

Ate again (not reviewed by me earlier) at an old favourite - it charms every time. It has the feel and decor of a very clean well maintained North West dhaba and the food of a five star establishment. When our vegetable platter - very generous proportions  - arrived with our nans and khumbani bhare, we fell upon it, and I realised later I had forgotten to take a photo of the grilled goodies. I normally do not rate a place with a perfect grading, but in this case I will, for 2 reasons - the Margarita was excellent and not spoil by ice cube overloading (I had taken the trouble to ask for correct measurements) - and our takeaway of the excess food was properly packed, instead of the hideous way most places remove half for the staff meal, thinking no one will notice. So I give it "high fives" and  a five on five rating.

Located on the 3rd floor of cc1, this place offers both food n drinks alike. We visited it recently and had both chicken and mutton biriyani with Irani macchi kebab and chicken Malai kebab. The biriyani was made better with Coke and Heineken beer to accompany them. The food was awesome with the quantities almost overflowing. The taste was also equally awesome. Special mention is needed for the macchi kebab which was extremely tender and well cooked and became a must have item in our list on our future visits.
Ambience of the place is also very well maintained, with the staff wearing afgani dresses and the walls decorated in afgani pictures and afgani household items. The entire place tries to give an aroma of the afghan delicasy and the afghan household.
Staffs are well versed with the menu and very well mannered. Service is satisfactory. Cash and Carry are both accepted.
Recommended for anyone who wants to try afghani biriyani and other delicasy...

It's my second time at Kaafila. But this time I hv experienced a horrible incident. We have ordered murgi malai tikka and for spicy dish they suggest us sunhere kabab. When we got sunhere kabab me and my elder bro jst wanted to vomit after first bite. Then we have checked all leg pieces and found all are rotten and smell badly. Showed these to management and they have changed this dish. Other dishes are ok especially lababdar chicken and butter nun was awsm. But after that incident total mood was off. They changed our dish but did not apologize for that incident properly. 
I don't know may be for puja items are very few which is not at all expected from kaafila as my first experience was so good.

Had long been waiting to visit this famous eatery. Finally made it a point to eat this prestigious north Indian eatery. We went on a dashami afternoon and did not have much waiting and their normal menu wasn't in offer. 

The curtailed menu provided us with limited options with elaichi rann being the most prominent omission. So we opted for the very much recommended malai murg kebab and the sufiani biryani. 

Decor: Very awadhi. A little cramped up IMO. But nevertheless the dim lights provided for a warm experience. 
Staff: friendly. The services were a little slow, as is expected from the rush Puja hours. 
Food: the malai kebab was great. Six braised pieces of chicken marinaded well and cooked to perfection. Awesome stuff. Next came the biryani. The biryani was a little dry IMO, very different from the regular dam biryani available in and around the city. The most prominent feature being the use of laal mirch powder in the biryani. The dish was light enough and didn't provide any discomfort after eating. The portion was great and came with two decently sized chicken and was served hot in the pot. 

Loved the experience. Will visit again for the Elaichi rann! :p

Kaafila is one of my all time favourite Indian restaurants. Decorated in pathani style with rugs and cushions and sheeshas, this place looks amazing. We went on Dushera, so unfortunately couldn't have the normal menu which is vast and extensive. So I missed out on having favourites like khandaani naan and assorted platter. But whatever dishes we had were perfect. All the dishes available here have been consistently well made. 
A must visit for every Indian food lover.

Visited on a Durga Puja day. Location wise it's good as this is situated inside city centre  (saltlake). The place was quite crowded as it was Durga Puja time and the waiting time was nearly 45 minutes. The decor and ambience are good. We ordered 4 pints of beer,  1 long island iced tea, 1 mocktial, Dezaje masluqe, gosht sikandari Biriyani and kakori kebab. Food was excellent and the quality was good too. One dish was enough for 2 people. The service was prompt and humble. The total bill was around Rs 3330 which is slightly on the higher side! But one can experience the food here atleast once.

Their service is prompt and good..ambience wise gives the afghani feel..we got a warm welcome from the staff..quite unusual during durga pujas..
We ordered murgh makhmali seekh...
The starter was good in quantity..6 solid pcs..juicy well marinated seekh kebabs..too good..the accompaning pudina and garlic soaked onions were the best companions..
The garlic naan was soft..good..they did not overdo anything..simplicity is the key...
The murgh methi malai was amazing..smooth creamy gravy..loved it thoroughly..
Murgh sufiyani biriyani was above average..the raita was excellent..
The chicken was a bit tough both in biriyani and the gravy..
The food was a bit overpriced..but overall experience was good..loved my first visit..

Located in the 3rd floor of event centric City Centre 1, this place will give you a sheer rusty experience of mughal cuisine. As already said the ambience is very rustic propped with guns, lanterns, bricks etc., the ambience will please people according to their taste. So we went there to try out what they specialise for i.e, mughlai cuinise & settled for,
⚱️Green Island: a combination of different juices with khush syrup, as it was pleasant to the eye it tasted also really good. Recommended.
⚱️Tandoori Murgh Awadhi: typical tandoori kebab, no such fascination can be made like its name.
⚱️Methi Murgh Kasturi: diced chicken cooked in rich thick white gravy not for spice lovers. Very succulent dish to go with both rice & bread.
⚱️Murgh Sufiyani: yeah its a biryani, just like its name it surprises us with its taste too. Not so over spiced, nor even extra oily, a balanced flavour to meet your tastebuds. Highly Recommended.
⚱️Masala Kulcha: apart from its spicy stuffing everything was quite regular.
⚱️Kesaria Firni: very traditionally garnished firni with portion of serving two, if not a sweetlover.
As located in such a prime location, pocket pinch is on the higher side. Service could be made a little prompt regardless of the crowd that comes in. Ratings given solely for the taste it offers.
P.S.: Full bar is available in case you want that extra pinch to settle down.

It's situated in block B 3rd floor..
Ambience is too good.. It gives u afghan's feeling..
Service was fast..
Coming to the food..

SHARBAT-E-KHAS
We had Marine delight, Choco-lated and fresh lime soda.. They were okayish..

STARTERS
We order Murgh sunehre kebabs and we loved it..
They recommended us Zabib-e- Murgh tikka. I personally didn't like it much

MAIN MEAL
We ordered Murgh kurchan with cheese cottage kulcha and cheese naan..
And they were to the point..

DESSERT
The most fav part.. BOULAWNEE
it's an afghani dish with lots of dry fruits and a scoop of vanilla icecream.. it ws so awesome that I packed 2 of it for home(obviously without icecream)
A must try I say..

PRICE
It's not at all pocket friendly.. price is on higher side..

Overall It was a nice experience.. I'll definitely recommend it..

Starting with the food,it was good. I ordered murg sunehre,methi murg, gosth sikandari and with maire delight.. kebab was really awsome heavenly tender and tasty as the apple from the eden. Gosth sikandari(mutton biriyani) so enough for two and mutton was better than rice. Rice from the biriyani was fragranced but I felt it was lack of biriyani flavour. Gravy of methi murg was mouth watering . But the chicken was not tender and floverless from inside . It was hard to chew and swallow. Marine delight was one of their refreshers and it was good. To start a spicy n flavourful journey... And there was pan (complementry) at the end...

A foodie generally finds a gem no matter where it hides . In general you can say this place is a little difficult to find .
This is something you can categorize pretty much as a theme restaurant . The decore gives you afghani and middle east feel .The ambience and music is definely gonna impress you .Coming to food, you get some creatively authentic afghani and a some selected middle east food here. Starters will impress you very much .

This is a themed restaurant located at city center 1 . Ambience is very good with nice soft music at the background . We have tried Murgh Sunehre Kabab, Khandani Naan and Registani Lal Ghost. Murgh Sunehre kabab delicious. It had a unique taste . Little sweet little spicy Chicken with peanut topping . Khandani Naan was also very good and unique in taste . But I got disappointed with the ghost . It was not so tasty . Overall nice restaurant . But expectations was more . Cost around 2k for 2 persons with drinks .

Since I have been here a number of times, I have tried alot of stuff here..but my favourite lies in Murgh Sunhre kebab, Khandani Naan and Rogani Gosht.
They also have a special dessert Boulawnee which you can definitely try once.
This place is usually crowded on weekends but it's worth the wait.

I heard a lot about this place specially about their kababs as this is the epitome of Mughlai cuisine. But this place is highly overrated. We had tandoori gosht ka sekua & Afghani murgh ka kalmi. Both were insipid and highly overpriced I found the complementary pudina chatni best among all. 

We came out and went to Oudh for our main course.

Two back to back visits is what made this place the local house of dining. With the authentic food ambiance, it has really become the place one must visit.
The Staffs are well trained and polite, the time taken for the preparation is not heart breaking and the food is mouth watering.
If you plan on visiting the place do try; Zabib- e - Murgh Tikka, Daal Pakhtooni.

This restaurant is good for Afghani (Kind of North Indian) food lovers. The Khandani Naan and Dal Makhanai are specialities.

Location: The restaurant is located at City Centre 1, and hence convenient to reach with car/ public transport.

Ambience: I have been visiting this restaurant for over 5 years and the restaurant looks the same. The restaurant has Afghani looking interior, photographs, "guns". the servers are also dressed in traditional afghani dresses. I would say this is unique about this restaurant.

Food: We ordered three starters: Veg seek kebab, Murgh Sunhere Kebab and baby corn something. The starters were good, but ordinary. For main course we ordered paneer makhani, Dal makhani and "KHANDANI NAAN". The dal tasted superb and the special naan was amazing. It was a large naan with lots of dry fruits and fruits grated on top of it. Tasted a little sweet but it was nice and unique.

Service: Pretty normal, no too good and not too bad either.

As I mentioned, I have been visiting this place for over 5 years and will definitely visit again.

Loved the signature dish Kandhari mutton. Ofcourse there was drama in presentation. The chicken was not very good (gravy was nice, chicken pieces didnt taste fresh though). That was a turn off considering the price.
The waiter seemed in a hurry to pickup our plates and  i didnt know why :P another turn off.
Biriyani was light n good. I would take it as a one time try thing :)

LOCATION: It is situated in a tiny nook in the 3rd floor of city centre 1. It is a little difficult to find but the security is always ready to help.
AMBIENCE: The walls are painted in the rust shade. The whole decor evokes a Rajputana feel. Rusted swords and huge guns are mounted on the wall giving a very royal vibe. But flies were roaming on the table & sometimes landing in the food. The hygiene is extremely disgusting.
SERVICE: The service is fast & the staff is quite helpful.
MENU: The menu features a wide expanse of Afghani specialities including huge varieties of kebabs.
FOOD: The tandoori gosht ke sekua was melt in the mouth though a little dry. The zabib e murgh tikka was really good though. The khandani naan was huge  & was soft delicious. It was covered with saffron & nuts & was more of like an afghani pizza. The sunehre paneer was a little too sweet for me. The boulawnee was okayish & warm served with a scoop of ice cream.
PLEASE SEE TO IT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO INSECTS PRESENT NEAR THE FOOD.

What may appeal to some, was actually a bit of hygiene issue for me - the hanging rugs. They looked as if they were not dusted in quite sometime. Now, coming to the food, I won't even call it average. They all tasted very dull. To make up for the lack of taste all the food items were made in extra rich (tasteless) gravy. Service - average. The staff have little idea about the food on their menu.

Ambience of the hotel is ok,give a feeling of some fort.Well placed and good service.Be prepared to wait for 40-45 min on weekend.Now about their food, we tried Irani Machi,Murg ke sunhere kabab, chicken biryaani.Iraani Machi is good for those who like less spices (my son love this dish),it melts in your mouth.Sunhere kabab is ok,not exceptional as thought. Biryaani served with sweet curd, is also good.Overall ok but scope for improvement is there.Lastly ,it's a bit pricey.@ankitamathur

The moment you enter, you will have a feeling that you have landed up in an Afghani household. The interior, the staff dressed in Afghani style, and everything else about the place is to be blamed. We didn't order any starter due to time constraints. We ordered Khandani Naan and Murgh Kurchan - an absolutely made for each other combination. The portion size is actually very high, so please be careful while ordering. Overall, very nice experience.

Superb food. Just loved every single dish we ordered here.
Tandoori aloo was too delicious. Loved the green mint chutney served along with it. 
The daal makhani n pindi chana masala were great. Infact one of the best chana masala i hv tasted in a long time. Tawa paneer was good too but i found it a bit dry. Paneer lababdaar was great. Butter naan was soft. Masala kulcha deserves some extra points! The vegerable biryani was mouthwatering. 
The complimentary meetha paan kept at the exit gate was just the icing on the cake.

The decor could be improved as its the same old furnishings since it opened. The waiters were friendly n service was prompt.

Definitely gonna visit again

Reached the restaurant around 1230 noon was more or less empty.getting a seat was easy.decor us nice different. Setting is indianised Afghani.. coming to the food we ordered sweet lime soda,murg makhmali for starters , keema naan and Rajasthani mutton . The food was tasty.. keema naan was to die for. Ended up ordering more though we were full.  Kebab and mutton was good .service was fast but a bit slow in the end when the restuarant started filling..but a burn in the pocket will be felt as it came around 2000+ for 2...

This restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of Block E at City Centre 1, and can be reached using the lift . The interiors of this place resembles a caravan , and has colourful patches of cloth on the ceiling to make it look like a tent . There are guns displayed on the wall ( don't worry ,they're out of reach of children ) , and the false ceiling made of iron takes you straight to a film set ! The service here is amazing , with a bunch of attentive staff , and the ambiance is great ! The music is light , so it doesn't disturb your conversation. The food here is amazing . For starter , the Afghani Murgh ke Kalmi had huge chunky pieces of well marinated , melt in the mouth chicken , that is a must try here. It is served with salad. In the main course menu , the Gosht Sikandari is a special kind of biryani with shredded pieces of mutton , and a more than average spicy rice , that tasted great . The Sunehre Murgh is a must try item here too, and has a creamy , nutty gravy with 6 very well cooked pieces of chicken. For dessert , you have to try the Boulawnee , which has a Shahi Tukra like nutty pastry base with a dollop of vanilla ice cream . This dessert will keep you drooling long after your meal is eaten and digested ! The drinks menu is also served at the beginning, and you may order your food to be served after drinks, in which case , they have to be informed 15 minutes in advance . They do serve a mean Margarita, and have a choice of other conventional cocktails as well. Overall , indulge in the opulence of Afghani cuisine in this larger than life restaurant, which is a must visit for non vegetarians in the city!

Well being an interior designer, I'd like to tell about the interior and ambience at 1st...
It's really nice..I won't say it's totally unique...but it holds a fine symmetry which soothes eyes and totally goes with the Afghan Theme... Especially the furniture and decor...From the lighting to the flooring and the ceiling, it really establishes the theme into our minds...
Now coming to the hospitality part...
The staff over here are helpful to choose dishes..but I found them a bit confused while suggesting their best dishes...overall it's nice...
Now finally coming to the Food part..
We ordered the famous Afghan delicacy "Kandhahari Laham" along with Lahsooni Naan and Tandoori Roti....in Dessert we took "Boulawnee", another rich delicacy of Afghanisthan...The meat dish was really tasteful and the proportion of spices were totally in balance...it maintained a harmony with the smokey flavour...
It tasted more yumm with the nun...
The dessert was a totally awesome one..it made our taste buds conflict with both hot and cold...and the dry fruits in it added a special texture in the taste...
The overall experience was really good overlooking the tiny issue we faced for paying via Paytm..It was fast solved though...

Initially couldn't believe I was in a restaurant, it took time to understand that this place serves food and I was in Calcutta, interior decoration was marvellous, gives the feeling of Middle East, it's my first time in life I discovered kebab could be made in this way as well, the taste of the food was awesome and virgin, never had this kind of food anywhere in Calcutta, being a foodie guy, order anything I bet you'll lick your fingers till the last morse, hats off to the concept, and blessings from my tummy which was delighted by them.

Well with location I think everybody knows city center 1.  It's in 3 Rd floor of B block.

Ambience not so classy  "theme restaurant"
Hanging carpet that to so congested in ceilings. May be they tried to do some theme but interior horrible.

Lets come to food 

Ordered 
Starter Murgh Malai and Murgh Suneheri
Chicken were so tender the Aroma of flavours top to the mark.
Mutton Biryani cooked with ghee(butter) after oudh this became my favourite.
Lababdar Reshmi  gravy with mashka Naan 
And Mutton Rogan with Tandori Roti.

Complete our dinner.

Bit overpriced but valued.

Most important thing do check your bill coz they have problem with there billing system every order charging 2 quantity. If we didn't check would pay them extra 3k.

Had heard a lot of good reviews about this eatery, so went their with family. My experience was okayish.
The decor is indeed nice and the staff is courteous too. The sitting arrangements are a bit unique but comfortable.
However, the food did not live up to the expectation. The Kabuli Naan was a royal turn off and we could not have it at all. We ordered Butter Naan again to complete our meal. The Chicken Starter and side dish we ordered were nice. The Biriyani was nothing great. Desserts variety is also not worthy of much mention. Icecream is perhaps the safest option to go for. Price again is on the higher side.
All in all, you can visit it once to try something new, but I am not sure if you would want to go back.

Salt lake sector 1,Kolkata.
Kaafila is an amazing place which serves lipsmacking authentic Mughlai cuisine.
From sorbets,food to desserts everything bout this place is so very good. It's a must drop in for foodies around there.
This is my third visit to this place but my first review for Kaafila.
Well,I throughly enjoyed my dinner here.
Our meal stated with Irani Macchi tikka,Sharbat-e-khaas Marine Delight,followed by main course Veg pilaf,Noorani macchi,Kabuli tandoori murgh. I wanted to have a dessert too but my stomach didn't allow as food so good was filled inside😃
Next time I'm surely gonna have their dessert.
Really had a good time there.
Thank you.

One of the best themed restaurants in kolkata, situated at the city centre1 in salt lake, pleasurably noted for their exotic authentic Afgani, Mughal and North Indian foods. We went there for dinner. Awesome decor, ambiance was very soothing. Particularly we loved their sitting arrangements, which was very spacious. There we had one green salad
 with one non veg platter. Foods were so yumm. The waiters were very attentive and fast , though the foods were a bit pricey. Above all our experience was very satisfying.

First the Cons:-
1.Seems to an office converted into restaurant
2.Not very spacious.
3.Ambience so so. Many will differ with me but look at the hangings over bar counter or look up near toilet
4. Only one Toilet which is a problem
5. Half back chairs are a bit uncomfortable.
6. Pocket pinch is quite high.

Now the Pros :-
1. We were 10 person and went for lunch hosted by my dear sister in law and his Doctor husband, both just back from UK.
2. Seating was comfortable except for the half back chairs.
3. Staffs are very very helpful and courteous
4. We ordered for two plates of assorted non veg kebab pllater consisting of chicken, mutton and fish kababs and two plates of Kandhari Laham which is our version of full leg mutton kababs as starter.
I had tested only fish sik kababs from Non Veg pllater though it had many items of Chicken and Mutton kababs and their specialty Kandhari Laham.
The fish kabab was stale and giving bad smell. They promptly took it back but a chef looking person started giving me lecture regarding its freshness. I just said that I when everyone is praising all other items then what's in earth we will complain about only fish sik kabab. He agreed but seems to be disgruntled.
Now comes the Kandhari Laham. It tastes not only Superb but OUT OF THE WORLD TASTE. It melted like butter with no fiber at all. Since I have reduced taking mutton but it reminded me of Burra Kabab of Amber/Sagar. TRULY WORLD CLASS AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . Very good presentation with firey tray and be sure everyone will look at it like they move their head with the sound of sizzlers. Good but Bad as the fire and smoke alarms are switched off or else this firey presentation cannot be made.
5. In main course we ordered one chicken and one mutton gravy items and Kima nan, Garlic Nan, Plain nan and Pilao.
I did not eat any of them except Kima nan with Fish Tikka of which two piece came as complement against returned fish sik kebab and one extra plate we ordered.
The kima nan was ordinary but the FISH TIKKA WAS SUPERB. IT JUST MELTED IN MY MOUTH. AGAIN HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Since I did not take any soft or hard disks or didn't taste many items, so no comment on those.
Overall very good experience except small deficiency which is covered by unique and unusual taste of dishes I ate.
6. Accompaniments for Kabobs are available in abundance.
7. All kebab items were highly praised by others but main course was not so much appreciated.
8. Another WORLD CLASS DESERT WAS FIRNI.SOME OF US EVEN HAD TWO. TASTES TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN ALL FAMOUS BIRIANI RESTAURANTS IN KOLKATA.
One more thing, if you are employee of TCS nowith ID Card, you get 10% discount. I don't know which other companies get the benefit as they didn't tell us from their own.
My advice, read all the reviews and then order your food depending on your preference of chicken, mutton or fish . Chances are that you will not be disappointed as we have done the same. Please note that what is best for others may not be preferred by you but still reviews give good ideas.

Located at city centre 1 with parking no issue at all.
On 3rd floor of block b.
Now when you enter this yum food station u might get disappointed by seeing a small room with limited seating arrangements and no good ambience i mean on the top i saw cloth hanging !!
But keeping aside all this when i ordered the non veg platter which consisted of mutton chicken and fish i opted out for mutton though.
The platter was just "Yum" i mean it was soft well cooked hot it was just amazing , it was surely one of the best delight to our stomach.
I have uploaded the picture of the platter do check it out !!
Now platter was fairly priced . Main course dishes were yum to I tried "Murgh Sufiyani Pasanda" which simply means "Chicken Bharta" i was Afghani style not much spicey.
I am yet to explore more dishes of this place!!!
But on the whole its looking a great mixture of food and taste !!! 
Prices are on the higher side main course dishes are quite expensive and quantity is just ok .
Seafood dishes are expensive to but i think we can give it away for that great taste !!
Attendants are quite good service is nice a complete family atmosphere.
It could have done more justice to itself if it was a little more bigger in seating arrangements.
Must recommended!!!!

Kaafila is an amazing Afghan restaurant, and it also has that Afghan feel when you enter, the Kebabs are very delicious, I had DEZAJE MASLUQE when I went there, it's a bit expensive.

Went dere 4 lunch. Ordered Murgh Sunehre Kebab, Gosht Sikandari & Kesaria Firni. Kebabs were superb wid Pudina Chutney & Raita served along wid it. Nuttiness of ground peanuts well liked by me & my friends. Gosht Sikandari i.e. Mutton Biriyani was average. Mutton used was stiff & smelly. Firni was good. Bit pricey but their portions were good enuf. Ambience gets full marks so does service.

Kaafila is undoubtably one of the best Mughlai dining restaurant in the City Centre 1 area, Salt Lake. The place has evolved to be one of the forerunners of the Mughlai cuisine in the city. I had a chance to visit this place with some of my colleagues as this plasce is not far off from my office.
Upon entering, we found the ambience and the set up eye-catching with the service staffs complimenting the look and feel of the outlet. 
As we were up for a quick lunch, we ordered Tehri murgh, Tandoori Mahi Kebab and Fresh Lime Soda. The Kebab tasted good but it was nothing "out of the world"-ish. Then came the showstopper in the name of Tehri Murgh. A plate with 6 eggs, 6-8 potatoes in tikka mode, abundance of rice and around 12 pieces of juice boneless chicken with gravy is what culminates into the magnanimity of a dish called Tehri Murgh. It is undoubtably one of the best rice items I have ever had. The Lime Soda acted as a nice taste changer with the richness of the other dishes.
The service was prompt but lacked a homely touch. The pocket pinch was distinctively high. Overall, Kaafila got a thumbs up from my side !

I had this in my bookmark for a while and finally got the opportunity to visit yesterday.
The décor was outstanding, so was the food.
We had Dezaje Masluqe (Tangri kebab) as starters and peach pina colada and black mamba for drinks.
For main course we had Sunehre Murgh(side dish),Ghost Sikandari (Mutton Biryani) and Murgh Sufiyani (Chicken Biryani).
I absolutely loved the side dish, it was perfectly made and I even asked them to pack another for take away.
The biryani was tasty as well but I felt it was less in amount compared to the expense.
Yes expense is slightly high at this place but I really liked the food and would like to pay a visit again and try the other items.

I had ordered chicken biryani from this place. The chicken biryani was as delectable as it could get but the raita served alongside was extremely sweet. My taste buds were shocked with the combination of biryani and a sweet raita. On another occasion, I had veg food from this place which had exceeded my expectation. The aloo Patiala is a must try for the vegetarians.

This well known restaurant in City Centre  was on my list for a long time. Last Sunday I got an opportunity to visit the place with a set of my relatives on the occasion of my nephew's birthday.

The restaurant has a fine ambiance. With the carefully planned decor, the artifacts on the walls , the pictures of Afghan tribesmen adorning the walls and the waiters attired in some traditional Afghan style, it manages to create a special North West Frontier touch in heart of Kolkata.

After settling down , we ordered our starter items, consisting of the Kandahari Laham ,  Dejaje Masluqe , and Murg Malai Tikka .  The Kandahari Laham is a whole mutton leg prepared in tandoor in a special Afghan style , while the Dejaje Masluque is an Afghan version of our Chicken Tangri  Kebab. When the orders arrived, we wasted no time in jumping into the fray. And, truth be told, each of the items turned out to be a winner. The Kandahari Leham brought a whole medley of flavors to our taste-buds, and was clearly the star of the show. The other two Murgh Kebabs were also mouth watering delicious. Once we had enjoyed the starters to our hearts content, we went for the main course of  Kid-nu-Gosht, Lababdar Reshmi Murg and Kofta accompanied by  Tandoori Roti, Lasooni Naan and Hara Moti Ki Pilaf. Each of the main course dishes was cooked to perfection and went very well with the accompaniments. The Lasooni Naan  and the Pilaf were one of the best I have had anywhere. The main course meat dishes were also outstanding.  Initially we had planned on having some desserts but after the main course we were so full that we had to abort those plans.

The service was very good  and prompt, and all the staff were very courteous and helpful. The bill for nine people came to around 6000, which is a bit steep in Kolkata but OK considering the quality.

Here are my ratings regarding the restaurant :
Ambience - 4/5
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4/5
VFM - 3.5/5
Overall - 4/5

A visit to the restaurant is definitely recommended. It is undoubtedly one of the best dining places in Salt Lake area.

Among the very few this is my favorite thematic restaurant. It has a proper royal and Afghani touch. The Interior is very well planned and decorated carefully with antique pieces.
 The service was a little slow because the place was crowded.  I went there with my family on an occasion. On that day they were offering a turkey preparation which tasted absolutely perfect. We had ordered  assorted non-veg kebab platter, tandoori​ murg awadhi, biriyani with a chicken side dish named lababdar reshmi. 
All of the items were so good. No complain with the quality and quantity of the dishes. The kebabs just melt in mouth, the chicken was tender and juicy. We also had kesaria firni which was pretty good. Our pathani dining experience was quite satisfying.

Having tried many Punjabi restaurant in salt lake. I wanted to try for new restaurant in salt lake and opt for kaafila after looking at good rating and reviews.
If you are planning after 8 on weekends be prepared for an hr wait. Ambience is quintessential Afghani carpet hanging, guns on wall. Name of the dishes are bit complicated and u need waiters help to understand and then order. I ordered  murg and afgan kabab and for main course we ordered suneri chicken with naan. I loved them all and quantity was good enough for 3 of us. Kaafila z worth trying I would recommend kaafila if u like afgan or Punjabi crusine

With ancient vases and a collection of guns, this place welcomes you with an amazing smell of tandoor.
Pre booking is highly recommended. Though they sometimes do not accept bookings.

Food: Tandoori Platter is a must try. Breads were perfectly made. Kadai paneer will make you drool. Dal makhani is out of this world.
In totality, You are in here for a TREAT!

Pocket pinch: High.

Kaafila ia great in its cuisine. We tried lot of things but i must say mutton kandahar was la jawab.infact cocktails are also very refreshing. The sitting arrangement , food service everything is just perfect.whenever we stepped in we felt we are  in different city of afganistan or kashmir.but i found the music of modern dj mix just very odd and distubing in these kind of theme based decoration.after all compatibility of music and the art create  the whole ambiance.i dont know how they did this mistake in choosing right music there. The music should be of desert.

Sudden plans made us go to this Afghani restaurant. Located on the 3rd floor of the right wing of cc1 KFC ,it is really hard to locate.
Just like the name Kaafila, interiors are extremely Afghani and so are the staff ,dressed in long Pathan kurta.
The interior had a no of carpets hanging from the ceiling , and walls with guns ,saddles and knifes.Try to visit during night time,looks awesome.
Now comming to the food.
They have a open bar and serve both drinks and dinner on the table.
Being a group of 6 ,we opted for 
The non veg platter: It is a combination of 2 big pieces of  hariyali kabab, 2 pieces chicken tanduri, 2 chicken sheekh kabab and 2 fish sheekh kabab, a small mutton galotti  and lastly one small awesome grilled pomfret (costing around 1k).

Main Course included 

A khandani nan : It is a sweet nan having around 10-12 pieces ,with nuts ,fruits coating. Even though my friends did not like the sweet nan,I liked it a lot.

Lababdar Reshmi : I found nothing special , looked like a regular reshmi chicken gravy found in other muglai giants.

Keema Shahezade: It is mutton Keema gravy with peas and a awesome combination with normal nan roti.
Keema Nan: Being one of house special,tried it ... Was nice but try the one with butter.

Normal Nan and a few drinks.

The cons are a few,first being it's very costly and specially the liquor section.
2nd con that I could find was the menu being too complicated with Afghani names. U might just miss what u want to eat and order something else.

Overall the place is nice with great ambience. Another thing that made me happy was the pan, which was refreshing. And even though I broke a drinking glass they didnot charge me or say anything, thanks guys .

I simply love the restaurant. I can go back to this place only for the ambience. I have been there twice. They never fail to satify me even though the price point is on the higher side. Murgh Sunehre Kabab and Murgh Malai Tikka are the ones one must try here as chicken starters. Also kakori kabab is mind blowing. I had Iranian Macchi Tikka too which was not so good. Mutton biriyani is tasty but nothing exceptional. Overall this is one of my favourites among the theme restaurants that I have tried out.

Been here couple of time with family. The ambiance is nice with its traditional Rajasthani aura but does wear a little faded & tired look.  Its a small restaurant and does not  entertain advance booking, has a tiny waiting area. So please go there with a backup plan.
The food is awesome & has some nice cocktails, I particularly liked "Blood of God", if I remember the name right. It will be unfair to single out one dish to vote the best but I would certainly  say don't leave the place without their "Tandoori Chicken Awadh".  If you like awadhi style food, take your pick with their butter naan and you will go back a happy man. Cheer, have a nice time

It is at the top floor of city centre 1, saltlake. A little hard to find it's entrance. But after u enter u will be taken to a rajasthani ambience. Guns on the wall, diff music, diff architecture everything will welcome you. Coming to the food we ordered a kebab platter with varieties of chicken, mutton n fish kebabs in it. It was really nice. Then we had their special khandani naan n 2 side dishes which i can't remember. We ordered for 3 naans but the waiter suggested for 1 n to our ultimate astonishment we couldn't finish that also. Lots of small pieces of naan with some toppings on it were there. All the dishes were really good. Service was also good. Moreover a very good experience.

But didn't liked the taste of Mutton Biryani (Ghosht Sikandari). Mutton was also not fresh. Rest all ok. Rates are on little higher side. And yes, tried Mojito there and the taste was awesome.

Went with my friend at Kaafila. The decor is very good. If you visit in the afternoon and get a seat near the window, then one might feel a bit hot due to sunlight. However, the seats, the decors, the ambience is pretty decent and we'll decorated. The staffs were courteous. One of the best Restaurant I have ever been to this year. We ordered Rogani Gosht and Naan. The food was served pretty fast. The dishes were amazing. Very very tasty. The mutton was soft and creamy. The spices used were adding more to the aroma and it's taste. The naan were very soft and not at all chewy. It was going pretty well with the naan. Definitely its in my one of the must visit Restaurant list!

I went there on Friday evening to meet one if my very close friend. It was my first visit to this place and heard a lot about it from my cousins. But my experience was bad , the ambience was good, however the food was pathetic. We started with the starters but seeing the standard if the starter we didn't go for the main course. The chicken was stinking and when we complained about it they suggested us to go for something in mutton . We thought it would have been good but it was more disappointing and smelling. Over all a very bad experience for the first time. It spoiled my evening as I wanted to make it a special for my friend. Won't go or suggest anyone for this place.

Beautifully decorated to set the mughal mood and you can sink in it with mouth watering kebabs pleasing your tastebuds.

Price may be on the higher side but it will at the end of the day worth. Would you be little less spicy as it is cuisine of Afghanistan. But I feel it is a balanced cuisine

Traditional Afghani food in our very own city of joy. Kaafila has been serving Kolkata's gastronomic fraternity for quite some years now. The ambience is beautiful. Food is also really good. Some of the absolute must haves are
Kandahari Laham
Dezaje Masluqe
Tehari Murg
Kakori Kebab
Gosht Sikandari Biryani
The quantity of food that comes with with plate in most cases serves 2-3 people. So order carefully. Fortunately the staffs are extremely good in guiding the uninformed. The restaurant has bar inside. The rates of alcohols served are extremely reasonable and quality choices are available too.
Last but not the least, absolutely never miss out the complementary paan served before you step out. I'm not much of a paan lover, but I cannot just stop at one.
Definitely a recommended place for family, friends and office parties.

The ambience was amazingly good. The staffs were were courteous and really fast service. We ordered marine delight and Irani fish tikka as starters which was yummy & thus made me excited for the next course. However, the murg sufiyana biryani we ordered was average but it was Sunehre Murgh and kulcha which was delicious & perfectly cooked. Overall great experience.

Located on the 3rd floor of Block B in City Centre 1, this place prides itself on it's Afghani cuisines and a decor that matches the food thematically.
Blue lagoon and Gold rush- refreshing curacao and ginger ale respectively to wash down the spice overload
Irani Machhli- Soft bhetki fish marinated with herbs and spices
Chiken legs- Spicy boneless chicken legs
Kandahari raan- Juicy mutton kebabs that are literally ablaze
Dum pukht biriyani- the perfect blend of spices, aromatic rice, aloo, egg and mutton keema
Khaandaani naan- My personal favourite,  one naan is sufficient for 3 people. It's quite sweet with an undertaste of cherries, sauf and mithai. It alone serves as a dish of it's own although we had ordered sunahra murg and kalouti mutton along with it. 
Each and every dish lived upto it's expectations and was so filling that I skipped dinner after this enormous lunch.
However minus 1 point because of the seating arrangements and the ambience. The seating is such that there is no way that the waiters can reach  the persons sitting far from the head of the table. So each time we were being served a dish, we had to raise our plates over and above our neighbour's head to reach the waiter. Not a great sight. Regarding ambience, it was a sheer case of bad timing. A bunch of women in their late 40s and 50s had turned the restaurant into their little kitty party. They were shreiking and laughing and even playing housie and totally drowned our voices. Maybe the management should keep people off playing gambling games in their outlet, no?

This place was on my bucket list for quite a sometime now & it's totally worth the wait.. 
This place is all about mughlai cuisine and culture and is quite visible in d decor . Form d seating arrangements to lights ,the hanging carpets  all elements helps to create a beautiful bohemian atmosphere... 
but the best part about this place is undoubtedly the meat platter (no veg platter )  .. 
Not only that but each and every dishes that we tried was just awesome... 
*must have: Boulawnee (one of the best dessert I have ever tried)

Visit this place for 2nd time. this time with family. So going to mention which we all love here.

For this visit, Khandani naan (with the dry fruits topping) took our heart along with daal pakhtooni. 
 Khandani naan -> tried first time and just loved it. The size is huge, so one naan is sufficient for three.

The mutton pices are very succulant and properly spiced in the first dish...the way they served it..was very unique...

Another themed restruant in the city with afgani decor and getup. The restru is most suitable for fimily gatherings. Staffs are well behaved, repeated helpings they offer. Poultry items are equally cooked to the perfect ratio. Especial mention for the non veg platter. The afgani biryanis I found here is slight overpriced compared to the taste.

You don't have to worry about the location because you just have to reach city centre saltlake.

First of all if you think to take a first e dinning in this Mughal themed restaurant then you should book a table first & most importantly it doesn't have too much place for waiting inside the restaurant

On the table #kandahri_laham #galouti_kebab #murgh_kurchan #karachi_murgh_alkaief #ghost_sikandari #masal_kulcha #khurmi_naan #kesariya_firni

Service is admirable and the food is just impeccable.

I am a regular at this restaurant and till date no visit has been disappointing! Kaafila always manages to maintain their impeccable quality! 
Though their best dish is probably the must heard about Kandahati Laham, this time I wanted to try something different and lighter. I ordered the following 
Subz palau - beautiful aromatic palau with carrots n veggies which was surprisingly light.
Karahi Murgh Alkaief - Succulent chicken legs in a beautiful gravy. The gravy tasted wonderful wuth the palau. I would highly recommend this dish. 
Fresh lime soda - a bit over sweetened.

There was a big goof up from the server's end due to which they served out starters half an hour late.. or even more. They apparently served our starters to another table with similar order. The only downside of that day. The food and cocktails were great and tasty. Beautiful ambiance and music. Will surely visit again, and expect a quicker serving time this time.

This restaurant has an interesting decor - a combination of indo-west and Arabic. One of the very few fine dine options available at CC1.We ordered Iranian fish, mughlai chicken and stuffed paneer tikka as starters. The paneer dish was absolutely fantastic. However the fish and chicken were average. In fact I have had numerous better preparations elsewhere. For main course we ordered mutton Biriyani, Chicken achari tamatari, sunehri chicken, and masala kulchas. Biriyani was something different and was very good in taste. The flavour was not like the usual Arsalan or Shiraz types. It is less spicy and full of aroma. Nothing to mention about the rest of the dishes. We also took a couple of mohitos and pina coladas which were disastrous.
Good part about this place was very less waiting time and ample quantity of servings.

Situated in City Centre 1, it is easy to find Kaafila being right in front where the elevator stops. 
We went there for family dinner.
The ambience and decor was great and the staff very helpful.
We ordered Chicken Biryani. The order came after 20mins approx. 
The smell was upto the mark and the rice very soft and long. The taste was okay compared to other popular restaurants. The chicken was very tender and perfectly cooked. They serve complimentary raita to the guests. Not recommend for Biryani lovers. 
Don't miss the complimentary paan.

Ordered their special dish Kandahari Laham, thought it was a whole leg which will be put on the table, but the meat is basically scrapped from the bone before they bring it to the table, I am a bit skeptical about the quantity as did not look like a a whole leg. IMHO it's a lot over priced considering the quantity and quality. Taste is good no doubt about it. Karara Gosht was awesome and Machi tiki taka was okayish. 
Will I come again .. umm maybe maybe not. 50:50.

Usually they don't compromise on food however the the Fish Tika Tin was not worth being their speciality. Mutton Rogan was ok nothing special. The paneer item was really awesome. I have been here twice before this and liked the food a lot. This time it was average. My expectation was not lived upto. It could be one off the days that they were unable to deliver what they are best at. I would still recommend people as the service was top notch.

The Khandaani Naan was shown as a speciality dish here and it lived up to the name!! Really tasty food. The waiters were really co-operative and were very willing to help! I have to say the menu card is really creative as well. I had a really impressive night at Kaafila and will come back again for more... Kudos!

Visited Kaafila on 2nd January 2017. There were 3 of us and we all found this place very nice and cozy. Coming to the rating 1) Quality - 10/10 2) Ambiance -9/10 3) Value for Money - 8/10. A touch expensive but again the best thing about this restaurant is that they don't compromise on quality or quantity. 

Kebabs are something to die for both Chicken & Mutton, didn't tried the fish though. The menu for desserts are limited to only 3 options, we tried Boulawnee (Afghani pastry made from rich dry fruits and served with a scoop of Vanilla Ice-Cream), it was amazing. A must try dish.

Did not meet expectations as per the hype. Biriyani that we ordered had rough mutton and tasted somewhat stale- even the rice was hard. The majority Kebab was cold. The chicken lababdar was the sole saving grace. Firni was good too. Not too keen about this place and would think twice before visiting next time.

Meeting an old friend after ages is sure something to look forward to. Good food added to the mix makes the experience a lot more enjoyable. In my case, it wasn't spectacular food by any stretch of imagination and highly average food at best if I were to be lenient.

Location - City Centre in Salt Lake is a prominent landmark and this place finds itself on the 3rd floor of the very same mall.

Ambience - the place is artistically done up with mud colored walls, loads of antiques placed over grids made out of slabs in the walls and yellow lights brightening the place. 

Staff and service - fairly attentive at all times. It didn't take long in placing the order as the staff was helpful enough by pitching in with their recommendations. Food didn't take long to reach our table and they made sure the main course was served once we we were through with our starter. 

Food and menu - they boast of a menu with a large number of options to choose from. They seem to be sought after their non vegetarian offerings, looking at the tables that surrounded us. We went ahead with our vegetarian offer post their staff's suggestion and it reinstated my belief that they're known primarily for their meat based dishes. 

Chatpate paneer shehzaade - a fancy name for bharwan paneer, this had a couple of major problems. One, the not-so-tender paneer chunks. Wouldn't call it rock hard or highly elastic in nature but it could have certainly been a lot softer. Secondly, a predominant flavour of mustard which overpowered just about everything that the stuffing had to offer. 

Dal makhani - this one was peculiar to be honest. I'd never in all of my living days tasted a sweet dal makhani until the time I dined at Kaafila. Loaded with cream on top, the lentils had been boiled well but this one carried a strange sweet flavour to it which is absolutely not how a dal makhani is supposed to taste like. 

Butter naan - the only thing coming out of their kitchen which we did not carry a flaw in it. Prepared well, the naan did not over stretch and was right on the money. It would've tasted a whole lot better if the dal had been any less sweeter. 

Here comes the disappointing bit. I've always considered the restaurant's pricing of their food a major factor while penning down reviews and this one falls flat on its face majorly because of that. We ended up paying close to 950 bucks for this food which was just about average to be honest.

Food tasted good, even if I did not get to try too many things. Decor is decent but badly in need of maintenance. Service speed needs to improve. The khandani naan is a monster.

Went to this restaurant for the first time on 2nd January for New Year Celebration. Heard a lot of rave reviews on this restaurant, so I was eager to try out this restaurant.As soon as we entered the restaurant we were almost transported to the Afghani lifestyle. The ambience of this restaurant makes you feel you are living in an Afghani Culture. Now talking about the food quality, we ordered Galauti Kebab and Tandoori Murgh as starters and then for the main course we opted for Maska Naan, Murgh Kurchan,Gosht Sikandari (Mutton Biriyani) and Fresh Lime Soda.I must say that Galauti Kebab was just out of the world 😍, although Tandoori Murgh was a bit spicy but it was nice too, Mutton Biriyani too was nothing less than Awesome (though I think the quantity is a bit less compared to Oudh 1590), Murgh Kurchan and Maska Naan was too Good and nothing to say about Fresh Lime Soda, it was just a regular one. I must say that the their food quality is OUTSTANDING. The staffs are very courteous and their service is another worthy mention. But I think that this restaurant is a bit on the expensive side. Overall my rating will be:
Ambience: 8/10
Food Quality:9.5/10
Service:9/10

Go to this place for an altogether different dining experience. Went there for a friends birthday bash amd were treated to some awesome food. The decor is truly mesmerizing and the food too. We ordered the Alkaeif chicken and that just kind of melted in the mouth. We had Murgh Biryani too and that was a great one. All in all, one of the best restaurants in Kolkata.

By the time mocktail was served Kawab was also ready, to the surprise it was not chewable.

This is the best food place in City center 1 Saltlake. The plan of the mall is little crazy so for a first timer finding out the place may be a little tricky. After you find the place and open the restaurant door you will be teleported into some different world. The ambience is breathtakingly beautiful as you will feel like you are actually seating in a north western frontier village at Indo- Afgan border but with elegance and panache. The food is great. I have visited many times, just to mention a few marvelous item kandahari mutton leg, dal pakhtooni, irani fish tikka, harialy paneer makhani and sunhere murgh is a must try. I have left Kolkata quite some times now but I always try to visit this place whenever I am back in town. Right now there is many different food option in the city but I remember when this place was opened quite a long time ago they were among the pioneers to bring such exotic great flavor to the city's food lovers.

This review is long due.
Had dinner here with my cousin and his friends on his birth day.
The place carries an aura of traditional look . Gives you a royal feeling.
The staff are well dressed and courteous.
Food :
We ordered 
1. Mutton biryani : this was heaven. Nothing like the kolkata biryani this dish won my heart. I loved its taste . Mutton was soft.
2. Chicken tikka : thumbs up.
3. Naan 
4. Chicken lababdar 
 Food is gud but all I remember was the biryani . Its was so different yet great. 

Pocket pinch is high but the ambiance makes up for it. So does the biryani.

Awesome food, great ambience, very good service that's what I can say for Kaafila. I was there yesterday for the first time and loved the place. Kakori kabab I would say a must try here, so very good, it will melt in mouth. We had sunehere murg, Afgani murg ka kalam with kulcha. Every dish was yum. Fresh lime soda and Mojito were also nice which I miss in most of the Kolkata restaurants.
Zomato needs to update the menu, some new items are included and prices got higher. The prices are on the higher side here.
All in all great experience and going to visit this place again.

Frankly I found Kaafila overrated considering both quality of food and expenses! There are a few plus points though. It's not completely bad but I can't call it extremely good too. 
Coming to the ambience it's a 5/5
Since it has the perfect, rustic dhaba touch to it! 
Then comes food,
There's nothing to say about the fresh lime soda. But the starter, Afghani murgh ke kalmi, as suggested by one waiter as their speciality, lacked every kind of flavour in it. So our lunch didnot start on a good note.
Coming to main course we ordered chicken biryani, masala kulcha and paneer.
The biryani had an extremely strong smell of old rice and my friend,

honestly wonderful lovely.....great food great taste and the best part is My mom.moves in a wheelchair and it was possible for Me to take My mom there 
we ordered Shirley temple,a full plate non veg platter kebabs sunehri murgh,sufiyan murgh biryani,a nd a prawn lazeez and a maska naam...all were good...the Shirley temple was refreshing, the raita given along with the biryani was just so awesome ...all the meat was just so tender....but trust Me guys the prawn lazeez though it was a heavy thick gravy trying to justify the name "lazeez" with the price tag of 600 bucks maybe I would suggest that is not that great and worth it kaafila is specialist for meat...and u should stick with it.....however the non veg platter costing around 900 bucks had 3 chicken dishes 1 pomfret dish 1 mutton dish and 1 minced "bhetki" fish dish.....so all the dishes were fine cool and good bit the quantity for the mutton given was too less ....I mean too less.....but it was (y)...
all the staff were courteous and well behaved and nice but they weren't very good in suggesting dishes when I asked....after I received our non veg platter I saw a table somewhere in front having a flaming platter ...when we went for non veg platter the waiter could have suggested us that but they didn't....so a bit disappointment out there....
now coming to the ambiance it's really cool giving u the feeling of afghan tribes with a bar ...I wanted to have the alcohol but sadly I went there with My mom and dad so no chance out there
the decor is really good with swords in the entrance and guns on the wall but what I didn't like was the flooring it looked like not much care has been taken there.....I gave a 4 star which is really less but there is nothing in between 4 and 4.5 I feel sorry as well.... My honest rating would be 4.3....
0.2 deducted for for extremely less amount of the mutton dish and nor so worthy prawn dish...
0.2 deducted for the waiter's inability to properly suggest dishes though the waiter's were really really really really very good and well behaved
0.3 deducted for the flooring
My verdict 4.3/5 stars
unfortunately tomato doesn't allow Me to give 4.3

The carpets hanging down from the ceiling...swords decked on the wall does bring an ambience of afghan/mughal times. The staff is definitely courteous. For starters we had Kandahari Laham which is essentially raan. The meat is succulent  and again as starters it good for 4 people unless you are not heavy meat eaters. We had ordered Tehari Murg. Its essentially a full chicken roast cooked in basmati rice with mutton keema. It was something we tried out for the first time. In terms of taste it's simply great. All of us had the plates licked clean. Quantity wise its sufficient for 3 guys, so if you are a group of 5 then 2 plates is recommended. Considering its a chicken item @~1200 it's costly !!Overall a nice place and would visit again for other dishes. Cheers.

North western cuisine has always been something different and surprising. Kaafila gives the perfect match for that. The best part is the ambience and decoration- takes the mind to an Afghan or Iranian valley where some meat is must. To start with, we ordered murgh sunehri kebab, tender and delicious, blends in mouth. For main course, i really really liked the lababdar rashmi- a very different tasted gravy , never had anywhere before. Registan gosht also had good taste of gravy with garlics in it. The masala inside the masala kulcha turned out to be just fab. Even the garlic naan had a fine touch. Will be visiting again for other dishes soon.

The first thing that came to my mind when I heard the name first time.. us the sekh's in white dress and the camels and the desert.. :D
And rightly so.. Kaafila means the convoy of travellers in Arab.
So, here it is the kaafila of some great mughal, Afghani and north Indian dishes..

√ Location: 
_______________
in cc1, b block, 3rd floor... 

√ Decoration:
________________

It's have a nice decoration of mughal Raj. You will find talwar, pistol of ancient times. Well decorated light, looked that attractive in the evening.
It's a pretty popular restaurant, so we will find this place well gathered always though.

√ Food
_________________

Let's start with the segment for which I am here to write this review.
♠ Starters
________________
• Irani macchi tikka : this is owssummm in taste. And yes they server pure bhetki fish. 4 pieces. Cooked in ginger garlic and mixed in cashew paste and cheese.

• Tandoori mahi kebab : great in taste. 4 pieces of bhetki. Well cooked in tandoori spice.

• Barbui Alu patil : very good in taste. 8 pieces of stuffed potato with green filling. Veg item.

• kandaharri Laham : it's a afgani cuisine. Whole mutton leg piced into small pieces. It's taste good. But I didn't found it that extraordinary at all.

It's sufficient for 4 people. 
The presentation of the dish is owsum though. It comes with some fiery presentation, hope that it's taste to me that good.

♠ Main course:
____________________
• kumbh sultani : very good in taste. It is a mix of mushroom, veggies go very good with plain rice or roti. But non veg people you can maintain a distance of it when you are in kaafila.

• Kid Nu Ghost : mutton cooked with small pices of potato. The best dish I had here. Owssumm and mind blowing.

• Tehari murg: this is just wow. 1st of all the presentation will blow your mind, and u will feel like a sekh :D 
It's a complete dish, biriyani rice with mutton keema, 4 big pieces of chicken and four pieces of egg.
Sufficient for 6 people when you have other stuff and dishes along with this.
It's huge in quantity. And thank God we have not ordered two Tehari murg .
And do note : it will take around 30 mins to prepare the dish to serve.

With that we took plain rice and keema nun. Keema nun was pretty good.

♠ Beverages:
___________________
• Blue heaven : blue coraco mixed with spiced lime juice. Very refreshing.
• Fresh gold : this is just owssum. Very very refreshing. A ginger refreshments.
• Irish cream : Irish coffe with cream and ice cream. I felt it was very flat. Didn't like it.
• Peach pina colada: this was just heavenly in taste. Mix of peach, pineapple juice, coconut milk with vanilla ice cream. Just superb.


♠ Dessert
_________________
1. Bowlawaanee : this is just need a hats off. Owssum preparation. Basically an afgani dessert. Made with rich dry fruit paste served hot with ice cream. Ahhhhaaaa....

2. Firni : one of d best firni in the town with no doubt.

______________________________
Overall experience was very nice. To me all the fish starters, all the desserts and the mutton main course were things to remember.

Now coming to the expense, it is pretty expensive. It cost 7000 for 7 people. I would suggest you to visit in big group , otherwise price per head will go high even.

I would have given a 4.5 but 0.5 is less for its high pricing. Otherwise the food quality is very good indeed.

Yeah, would love to visit it again if someone give me a treat :P

Wow what an ambience. The food is finger licking good, literally. For starters, we had murgh tikka and paneer chutneywala, both of them were delicious but to my surprise, I liked paneer more than the chicken tikkas. The paneer was the most tender paneer I ever had. Then we ordered a paneer and a chicken curry for main course and it was good too. At the end, when were done, we had a pan which they keep at the counter and I loved it.

This year I went to kaafila for my birthday lunch. As birthdays are always special so the the place to dine in this occasion must the special one. The restaurant is not the big. But it has a decent decor which gives the afghani flavour. We ordered the following:
For mocktails
1.shirley temple
2.soft shangria

For appetisers
1. Murgh shorba 
2. Dezaje masluqe

For mains
1. Keema shehzade
2.maska naan
3.ghost sikandari
I liked shirley temple over sangira because I love litchi flavour more than grapes. Both the appetisers were vey good. Dezaje masluqe was well grilled (charcoal) and was full of flavours. I would suggest every one to try ghosht biriyani.  it is different from our usual one. Flavoursome,  light and aromatic. The quantity is huge. Me and boyfriend stuffed ourselves like anything. Lovely space with good food. Happy pocket and happier tummy :)

After being suggested by a friend and checking out the positive reviews on Zomato, I with my family, went to Kaafila for a dinner. Their Chicken biryani was good but not something extraordinary. Besides biryani we had Butter Naan, Murgh Kurchan and Paneer Kurchan and Afghani Kabab. Everything was fantastic. For desserts, we had Phirnee and Vanilla Ice cream with chocolate sauce. The mocktails served were good as well.

I like the ambience of this place, really nice one.But food wise I feel it is just average if I compare with the price. I went there recently and had ordered a red meat preparation which was not well cooked (but this might be one of the cases and shouldn't be judged on that). But I personally feel this place is over hyped and over priced.

4.Maska Naan. Very nice and soft
5.Masala Kulcha which we did not like much
Overall experience was really nice!
Would love to visit again!

I love the ambience of this restaurant. The ambience gives u Aladdin feel. Though there is a long queue on almost everyday. The service is not up to the mark. The waiters are bit confuse between each other n thts make the service abit slow. The food is good here. I had tangri kabab, mushroom biriyani, Lucknowi chicken these 3 were perfect but the raita was so good... The mutton recipes are great here...

This first time dinner in the restaurant was truly satisfying.we enjoyed afghani murgh ki kalmi a lot because of its different preparation than other regular tandoor items.khandani naan was really good and it was a perfect match with mutton keema shehzaade.surely would love to visit this place again.service was good but not quick.but enjoy the soft music and good ambience till your food is served.

So after one previous failed attempt to get in because of the crowd and 1 hour wait time, we finally got around to experience kaafila recently. Little advice there, try to reserve tables or atleast go during off peak if you want to get seats here. They have a pretty high footfall on weekends.

The ambience is definitely unlike anything you've ever seen before. Guns hanging from the wall, hanging carpets, beautiful metal pots and vintage vases here and there and an overall rugged feel interior will cater to your imagination of what a typical Afgani den might look like. The interiors were one of the main reasons why I was so keen on visiting this place and it didnot disappoint.

The seating arrangements were comfortable and the staff was extremely courteous and the light groovy music playing in the background definitely boosted to the mood( Note: I might have been too busy singing afgaan jalebi in my head to notice what songs they were actually playing. But you get it, the place has a real Afgani feel to it!)

Coming to food, here's what we ordered

● Irani macchi tikka: This is an absolute delight. The fish was fresh, well marinated and the subtle flavours really refreshen the taste buds. Must try.

● Murgh tikka: pretty average.

● Kandahari Laham: It's basically a tandoor item made from one whole mutton raan. We had high expectations from this dish in particular. While the dish was a visual delight, the taste was disappointing. The mutton was hard, rubbery and the spices were limited to the outer layer of the pieces only. It seemed like a complete waste of 1200 bucks.

The rest of the dishes that we ordered included naan,kabuli tandoori murgh gravy and gosht sikandari biriyani..these were good in taste as well as quality.
The bill came to a close of 4000 rupees for 5 people.
While I donot really look forward to visiting the place again, you may visit it once for the feel and the food isn't too bad either.
Parking available! ( just being Captain obvious, it's in city centre, duh-uh!)

Afghani themed restaurant in City centre 
provides good ambience and service.
The attractive Afghani interior makes you twist n turn your eyes to watch the detailing around.
Average - Good food quality 
There is some peculiar aroma in the place which you get accustomed to in a while.
At the same time it can keep one refrained from visiting the next time!

I have to admit that I expected more than what I was offered at Kaafila. We ordered mostly starters. Mutton was awesome. Softness was commendable. So was chicken and fish. Biriyani was disappointing. Moctails were awesome. Mocha especially, is a must have. Service and food delivery was also good.

Treat!! Treat!! Treat!! What's better for a foodie then this. Well, went to Kaafila for a treat from someone special and had a great evening spent. 😊 Kaafila best known for its Afghan cuisine lived up to the mark as well.

Place : City center 1, Block B, 3rd floor. Further if you still won't able to find it please follow the building map or may ask somebody to help. Surely they will.

Ambiance : The moment you enter into the restaurant, the atmosphere you'll find is a soothing, calm and relaxed. The decor is premium as well wood finished cushioned dining place, shamiana couture seating blocks, nice wall hangings people all dressed up as pathans of Afghanistan. Well I like it and hope you'll as well. 😀

Food : Started with some soft drinks and in house kebab specialties such as Soft Sangria and Shirley Temple accompanied by Paneer aur Kumbh k Tarane and Tandoori gosht ka Sekua (mutton). The tangy drinks complemented well along with the kebabs. Tandoori gosht ka sekua is a preparation prepared with boneless mutton chunks grilled with herbs and masala. The mutton was tender and as usual delicious, n.b. - this might be my biasness towards mutton, but it was really prepared well and was tasty. But to say more the Paneer was marvelous, soft Paneer coated in tangy spicy masala served with tender mushrooms was just mouth watering and we were craving for more.
In the main course we had Murg Kurchan and Maska naan which is the butter naan obviously. Murg Kurchan is a heavy dish prepared with shredded pieces of chicken in thik spicy gravy and lots of capsicum. Tangy, soury, spicy, flavory they all complement each other and suffice the needs of your taste buds well.

Service : service was quite pleasing and we did not had to wait for long for our food.

Expense : A bit on the expensive side, but then all is worth you are satisfied. In my case I was.

To sum it up, quite a good place to be. Would love to visit again.

Located in city centre 1 this famous restaurant known for Afghan cuisine as you enter, you will find land of carpets,aladin,spices and all things Persian. The whole place is decorated with wall hung carpets,white cloths,lanterns,nice crockery,rifles,paintings giving you that Afghani culture feel! 
Decor is magnificent, seating is quite comfortable and there are private space-outs with sofas for big families, it can seat a lot of people at one time full Egyptian and Arabian type themed bar cum restaurant! Soft music was playing at the background, which is really awesome!

The price of food is on higher side but considering the management and overall maintenance, quality and hygiene of food it is worth try there broccoli and cheese kulcha , hing hari gobi aur chatpatta aloo they are master stroke………

Their packaging for take away is done very well there is a personal touch to their services. The staffs were good and polite. Service was also good..

Not to miss!!!!!!!!!!!

Kaafila will arrest us with its food, service and Afghan ambiance. Its Keema Nuns, side dishes and Biriyani simply makes us go head over heels. If anyone is in the mood to plunge and indulge in over-eating, Kaafila is THE place...

One of the finest north west frontier cuisine you can find in Kaafila. I am very impressed by their hospitality. They open the door and welcome you with a smile. Walk u till the table. Greets you and also makes u comfortable and gives you privacy.

When they come for order taking they help u choose the correct dishes according to your likes and preference. 

The decor of the place in unique. I felt like i am somewr away from my city. It compliments the cuisine and goes hand in hand. 

Now comes the food. Tandoori chicken is soft n tender. The look and presentation is no less than a star graded restaurant. We loved their naans n biriyani. Chicken butter masala could have been better. Dal makhni was the show stopper.

Highly recommend to visit this place. Its in ciry centre 1, salt lake.

A beautifull restaurant located in one of the most convinient location, serving delicious food. But really didnt like the mocktails here.
The drinks ordered were shirley temple, soft sanghria .. both tasted like cough syrup.
In food our order was murg tikka, barburi aloo tikka, kabuli tandoori murgh, paneer kurchan with khandani naan. Every dish was delicious but the khandani naan just stood out.
Waiting to go there again :)

I usually do a lot of take aways from here and they are great both in terms of quality and quantity. Price is around midrange but worth it. Do reserve table in advance if you have a big group as they are usually quite packed on weekends.

A treat from a friend on Saptami night lead to Kaafila since all others place were crowded even close to midnight. A meagre wait of 10mins and we were provided a table. They were serving a curtailed menu due to puja but it had options. Started off with beers, accompanied by a fish kebab and their signature dish, the Kandahari Lamb. Both were very tasty. Special mention for the lamb, it was delicious, the meat was perfectly cooked with the correct blend of spices. For main course we ordered Tandoori roti & chicken lababdar. The taste of the chicken was pretty nice & creamy. Dessert like all other moghlai joints had firni. It's till date the best firni I have had, simply mouth watering. And all this burnt a hole of 4000rs in my friend's pocket which I can say was reasonable for 4people. Looking forward to visit again and trying items from their full menu.

Kaafila a pure Afghani decorated restaurant.. :-) Though visited this place a while ago.. A late review of the restaurant.. 

Location :- City Centre 1, Salt Lake... :-) which is quite easily accessible..

Ambience :- The most beautiful part of the restaurant is its ambience.. well as you enter the restaurant u feel like entering into Afghanistan apparently.. The guys were dressed in Afghani Pathan dresses... With low light and pure classy furniture's and you get a good view of the Bar.. :-)

Food :- We had the Dejaze Masluqe.. ( pardon me if the spelling is wrong :- p)  Well is was a lip smacking dish.. I wish I had more of it.. :-(

Then we order for the murg sufiyani biriyani.. well it was pure Afghani biriyani.. and the taste was just lipsmacking.. Every ingredients were perfectly mixed in proportion and tasted heavenly...

The biryani was accompanied by lababdar murg.. well the best accompaniment u can have.. The gravy was just incredible.. A bit spicy though.. :-) 

We were too full to have dessert.. 

If you want to have authentic mughlai dish that too in an Afghani environment this place is a must visit... 

The service was good.. overall a good restaurant...

Heard a lot about this place and decided to visit this place for a Dashami lunch and it was really great. For starters we ordered Murgh tikka and murgh malai tikka. Both tasted good but murgh tikka seemed better to me probably as I like spicy food. For main course we ordered murgh sufiyani, gosht sikandari and lababdar rehmi. Biriyani tasted preety good. It was not like the usual kolkata biriyani. If the mutton would have been a bit more soft the taste would have enhanced much more. Lababdar rehmi was on the spicy side and I liked it very much.What I liked much more was the Afghani ambiance. The theme was nice with decorations and the staffs were also polite. The service was also good.

Amazing food. 5 out of 5 for the food. Hospitality was pathetic. Service staff are rude and dumb. Even to get a plate of plain onion rings, they had to discuss with manager and then i had to convince the manger. I suppose the success of the restaurant has gone high on the heads. With such poor service level and warmth, the rating will surely go down. Btw the food was very nice and breads were well baked. They will make you feel like they are doing some favour by serving you food. Absolutely not acceptable behaviour. Thumps down to the restaurant and for sure not returning here ever

Yesterday started this year Durga Puja celebration and had dinner at this place. I was bit eager to visit this place for the first time because was hearing lot many positive things about this restaurant. I found it nice but not extra ordinary. North Indian and Afagani food what they offer here. I was with my family and ordered-
Starter: 
Habi- bi
Tandoori Gosht ki Sekua- 
Murgh Malai Tikka 
Main Course: 
Lababdar Rashmi 
Lachedar  Paratha 
Chicken dishes were good but not really liked mutton in form of "Tandoori Gosht ki Sekua" I think it was not well cooked. 
Employees were helpful and courteous should give them full marks. Decor nicely made but not well maintained.

I had visited Kaafila before with my friends earlier and loved the place. So when my brother and sis-in-law wanted to treat the family on their anniversary, I promptly suggested Kaafila. And they didn't let me down.

Firstly, the ambience. The decor of Kaafila is just so mesmerising, I just can't help staring at the walls, the artwork, the antique guns - in short everything that contributes to the look and feel of the place. You truly feel like you have been transported to some Afgan home in Kandahar!

The food. We started with the Kandahari Laham. The presentation of the dish with flaming fire was nothing short of a magic show. The lamb was hot and spicy. It takes the taste-buds on a roller coaster ride. In short, it was awesome! The non-veg platter was great with a lot of variety thrown in. But the highlight of the day was Mahi Motiyaan. That's undoubtedly the best fish tandoori dish I have ever tasted anywhere! I am in love with those little pieces of heaven.

The Biryani was, however, ordinary. Not bad, but could have been better. We tried all the Refreshers from Sharbat-e-Khas section and I loved the Pink Panther and Fresh Gold. The Blue Heaven was too sweet, but of course that's how Blue Heaven usually tastes like, so no complaints.

The service. The thing that I love most about this place is the service. The servers are always smiling, always ready to help you with food selection and make the best suggestions. And they are very patient with little children that tend to make a fuss (like my two little nephews) and I think that's just so sweet.

I shall always keep going back for more such wonderful lunch experiences at Kaafila.

Located in City Centre 1,this is one of my favourites when it comes to Afghan food.They were one of the first to bring pure afghan food to Kolkata.The Kandhari LAHAM Kabab is a speciality there,but order it only if have 2 others to share because it is a 'BIG'.Though it is marked as a starter,i think it goes well with Nan Roti as well.The other dish which is my personal favourite is the Tehari Murg,which is like biriyani,but is actual spices used are different.Again order I only if you have 2 others to share.I think it is a must visit if you like Afghani/Moghlai cuisine.

Went there on a Sunday with my bunch of friends for lunch. It was a get together of school friends and we all girls gang decided to try kaafila. Service and ambience is amazing. We ordered chicken and fish kababs and gravy items with naan. The kababs were awesome and among gravy items the noorani macchi was heavenly. I have never tasted such heavenly fish gravy to go with naan ever before. We also ordered murg sufiyani which was chicken biriyani mughlai style without potato. I am a huge biriyani fan and usually try variety of biriyani. I tried this because of good reviews. But the biriyani was disappointing. It tasted like desi fried rice. The price is steep but worth a try.

Came to this upscale restaurant after listening to a lot of good reviews from friends n colleagues, but to my disappointment the food served here was totally not worth the money we paid for. 
The tandoori moti mahi was stale n devoid of any taste ,
The so famous chicken lababdar was again tasteless, 
The biryani was still okay , n the pudina chutney was something rather the only food that filled my stomach.

Would never recommend this restaurant.

The pricing is bit on the higher side though the quality justifies it and I am always ready to shed out those extra bucks. I will always highly recommend people who love or don't love mughlai cuisine, they will definitely fall in love with it.

Yesterday was my birthday, so my Girlfriend told me that she will give me a surprise to gift in form of a couple lunch at a restaurant, where I have not been there! So it was a really surprise to me and she took me to Kaafila for lunch! Being a foody, I think a couple lunch treat to an unknown restaurant, was the best gift of the day!

The restaurant locates at 3rd floor of Block B at City Center I. Take the lift of that block and it will leads you to the entrance of the restaurant!

When I entered the restaurant, I was really amazed by the decorations and ambiance of the restaurant! Full Egyptian and Arabian type themed bar cum restaurant! Soft music was playing at the background, which is really awsome!

The stuffs are all polite and helpful enough to choose your dish according to your desire! They guided you, about the quantity of every dish, and also suggest you how many dish you should ordered!Service is fast! Till now good feelings, so lets look forward for the food!

We ordered Blue Heaven, Afgani Murgh Ke Kalmi, Murgh Sufiyani Biriyani and Lababdar Reshmi!

Blue Heaven - In one word, the drink is really wowww!!!!Full refreshing, little but not too tangy in nature! From the first sip to last sip, I bet you will love this drink! Full recommended!

Afgani Murgh Ke Kalmi - We ordered this dish as an starter! 4pieces Chicken thigh served with onion salad and green chatney! Chicken pieces were really tender and juicy in nature! Mid spicy and perfect blend of exotic herbs and cream make s this one super smooth! It melts to your mouth, as you take a bite! Green chatney was also good, but little sweet in nature! Perfectly perfect!

Murgh Sufiyani Biriyani - We ordered this one as an Main course item! It was good!! Well cooked rice, not oily in nature, two pieces chicken legs are there but no egg or potato piece are there and comes with raita!! But the biriyani was not so Spicy, which was not expected from me!!! Chicken pieces were tender nd juicy also!! The raita also tastes well! Quantity was sufficient for two person! Overall good!

Lababdar Reshmi - Eight pieces soft juicy chicken pieces are there, served in a thick greavy! Full Spicy in nature but little sweetness was there, but not suitable for Biriyani, I think it goes well with any kinda paratha or rotis.. Overall good, but I strongly suggest you not to try with biriyani!!!

With all the food mentioned above,it cost around 1.3K inclusive of all taxes, which is I think pretty decent one!!! They gave us complementary 'Mitha pan' when we were about to leave the place! In conclusion, I must say Kaafila is a fine dine restaurant, which is I guess perfect for dating or any special occasion like anniversary or birthday! The ambiance of the restaurant is good, like its food quality. Overall it was a nice dinning experience from me!!!!!

“Mashallah Mashallah ” or “Afghan Jalebi” or may be any other song featuring Arabian feel into it hits your mind as soon as you will enter this beautiful place with wonderful ambiance and decor all around. If you are a person who loves desert safaris and enjoys staying in tents y0ur heart & soul will be transported to some corner of middle east into a luxury tent or a bunker with all modern amenities all around. With this kind of look and feel they have kept their theme intact with the kind of decor, interiors or even with costume as well. I was totally impressed with their style and design.

If you want to have typical North Indian food, here in salt lake then you can go here without any 2nd thought..they have maintained their food taste and quality over years... though more popular amongst non-vegetarians, I would recommend to vegetarians too!!

Just visited last week with my parents for dinner after a long tiring shopping session.  And I am completely flattered by every aspect of this place. 

Ambience and interior- 
Well, I have never been to Afghanistan but this place is a good representation of the Afghani joints as we see in pictures or read about. The cozy sitting sofas and chairs, teh wall hangings, the tables, all reflect a rich heritage . The place is spacious , the tables are laid around with ample space inbetween and even when all tables are full, your privacy won't be disturbed. This place is great for family dinners or dates.

Service and courtesy-
Well, the stuffs are too courteous, humble and amazing people. I was too tired and wanted to sit in a big sofa so that I can rest my back. We were just 3 and when I requested them they gladly allowed us to sit in a big table. They were always smiling and helped us to understand the menu. The service is really fast. I was quite amazed. I mean suh good food served within 5- 10 minutes is really surprising (well, it was not much crowded. So when you visit, if there is a crowd, please give them the time as they cook  wonderful food.)

Food quality and quatity-
Chicken sorba- I tried sorba for the first time and I loved it to the core. It is mild, it has the perfect balance of taste, it is not heavy (like the chinese soups that are thick with corn flour and the warm liquid fills the tummy and makes you happy. There is enough chicken in it.

Mutton Biriyani- @ tender mutton with rice, no egg or potato served as this is not Kolkata biriyani. Firstly the amount in one haandi is a  little less when compared to that in oudh. But it is enough for two when you eat other side dishes too. Again this is not very heavy or spicy. The taste is different from Kolkata biriyani and I loved it. The rice and mutton melts in mouth. The spice does not overpower the distinct taste and flavour of mutton. 

Kabooli Tandoori murg- The chicken is again tender and soft. the gravy is not oily or greasy. The smokey flavour is balanced perfectly in teh tomato gravy.

Tandoori Roti- Normal. Not too hard.

Boulawnee- A must try. It is the desi version of brownie. The kheer is loaded with nuts and the warmth melts the vanilla ice cream slowly creating the superb taste. Last but not the least, the complimentary paan and chocolate.. Well, cherry on teh cake it was :* <3
Will go back to try the keema naan.

We recently visited Kaafila for  a farewell treat from one of my friends. We ordered "Kandahari laham" which is supposedly the specialty there.. it was a weekday night..the restaurant was really smelling shabby..or what u would call damp and the smell of liqour was not helping much. The laham ( much to our surprise and delight ) arrived quite quickly..I was told it takes time to prepare it..but our delight had an end right away..the dish smelled horrible..the mutton was cold, hard and uncooked..
Some of us had tasted it earlier and clearly told us that what we were served was nothing like it..we complained to the waiters as none of us could have it after a few bites ..and they took it back without much resistance.  
Next we ordered a dhania chicken shorba which tasted like the momo soup served at roadside stalls ..however thankfully they didn't know where to go wrong with jeera rice and a chicken masala dish. After this dinner , I was bed ridden for three days due to a severe food poisoning and the smell of that mutton still haunts me.
I had always been a big fan of kaafila and visited it on several occasions to celebrate good stuff ..but it all ends here. I would have ignored all of this. .but they need to understand when u are charging around 1200 for a dish ( yes kandahari laham costs approx  1200) and more than 3000 for a decent meal ..u cannot take your customers for granted ..be it a weekday or weekend.
Ps..I would have rated them  a zero..but the guy there was kind enough to return the debit card my friend had forgotten to collect after payment..hence 1.

This place gives you a good feeling. Feels like you are in a middle of a desert sitting inside a mughlai joint. The preparation of chicken is awesome for all dishes. Soft tender juicy. The cock tails were really very nice especially the spicy arabian. U can try the chicken starters they are too good. Kakori kabab was very delicious.

I ordered food from here, the order was confirmed. I even received a text message saying your food is on its way. However after 25 min of placing the order I got a call from the Zomato team that the vendor cannot deliver the food because of no delivery boys. This is unacceptable. Why did the restaurant accept the order in the first place ? I had guests waiting at home. Now I had to make another order and wait for another hour. Horrible service. Avoid ordering from here so that you don't go through the same harassment. Totally UNACCEPTABLE.

For main course we order the tried and tested Kandahari Lahm and it was delicious as usual. 
We love to come back to have this dish again and again.

One of my favourite restaurant when it comes to Mughlai food! The ambiance is amazing and a nice place to go with family and friends for a quite dinner! No complaints on the food and it's variety of cocktails!! Just that the place is in a weird location in the mall and gets bit hard to locate. This is one restaurant which I feel is underrated just because of its location.

One of the best Afghan restaurants in the city , Kaafila has been in my wish list for a long time. Finally  got a sudden occasion on my friend’s birthday last week. As soon as we entered the place, we were greeted with Afghan decor and aroma. The flooring , rifles , carpets , walls , Afghani wall hangings, lamps, sherwani clothed staffs all added to the elegant ambiance. The menu card, the chairs, the utensils all had a typical afghan flavour. 
Coming to the food, we had ordered Afghani Murgh ki Kalmi as starters and murgh sufiyani (biriyani), murgh lababdar reshmi as main courses.  The staffs were good and polite. Service was also good until the moment when they took about 15min to generate the final bill. 
Murgh ki Kalmi was grand and the star dish of the day. Served 4 pieces of Fleshy Chicken thigh with salads, vinegered onions and chutneys ,it was the perfect start to our meal . Chicken pieces were tender and juicy . It was grilled to perfection after marinating impeccably with adequate spices. Murgh Biriyani ,served with raita, was also good and complimented perfectly with lababdar reshmi . There were two huge pieces of chicken in the biriyani  which were a bit bland but that of the lababdar reshmi (6 pieces of charcoal grilled boneless chicken prepared in lababdar gravy) was good enough to satisfy your taste buds. Lababdar is a very rich  cashew/Almond/Poppy seeds gravy and is seldom spicy. It is in-fact a thick creamy buttery gravy. We also had tandoori roti in the end to finish up the delicious gravy. :D 

The final bill came around 1400 but it is worth judging the ambiance, decor and the quality of food they serve. Well, Overall a good place to have quality Afghan food in a typical Afghan atmosphere.  
Recommended. 
Heard about their famous Kandahari Laham. Will come back again to try that next time . :)

The most irritating part in eating out is when you don't get a table due to rush of people. I was refused twice at this place and my low rating is not because of this. I tried to book a table for my family today and they said no booking is allowed on Sundays and holidays. Who needs to book on a weekday when anyway you get a table!!! Damn foolish system. Shall not recommend a place,  let the food be out of world, when they make people stand like pilgrim outside a temple! Only if I could rate them zero!!!!

The ambience will simply take you to another world..  Coming to the food..  we had nawabi jalpari..  and it tasted awesome..  Biriyani was so so, but the speciality is the chicken of biriyani.. I never had this taste..  No words to explain..  Keema naan was also superb..  Overall a good experience altogether

We decide to pop in here after reading overwhelmingly Positive reviews so imagine our Surprise when were served Thoroughly Disappointing Food 😑👎

Ambience is alright compared to rest of the below average joints in City centre.

Service is alright although the Maitre de serving us was courteous and informative rest of the folks there looked as though they were forced to do their job,body language always speaks Volumes 😋

Menu comes.across.authentic but doesn't live upto the Name or Old glory or even do Justice to it Ingredients or item description. 😕

We ordered the following

Pet Bottle.of coke

Paneer tikka Marinated in Mint Yoghurt and herbs: Very Poorly seasoned there was no distinct flavour of either of.the aforementioned ingredients 😑 part of the Paneer was tough and chewy not soft at all inspite of specifying to the Maitre de to ensure it is. Overall bland and below average.

DEZAJE MASLUQE... Chicken was not.too.fresh and felt.as though was cooked and kept and then just poorly.reheated. Marination was poor, it lacked Seasoning, flavour on the whole bland.Did not live upto the Grand Menu description. 😕 😑👎👎

At this point we could fairly judge that The Mains were not worth ordering and so we requested for the cheque and headed elsewhere.

Only reason and that is just my opinion, the Restaurant is fairing well is due to it's close proximity to a Residential vicinity and it being the only decent looking family joint that doesn't serve Chinese or Bengali cuisine.

Not recommended if your a Gourmand like yours truly and someone who has a penchant for earthy cuisines as you will be Sour through the end of your experience.

From their superb biryanis to the awesome roganjosh, you couldn't go wrong with Kaafila.
Over the years, I've gone back again and again, as much for their rustic décor as for their signature dishes, and it is safe to say that I have tasted each of their offerings at least once!
While there are no dishes that I would recommend against, there of course are some that are my personal favourites: the Irani Machchhi Tikka, the Rogani Gosht and the Bolawnee.
If that doesn't take you to food heaven, nothing will!

Kaafila was in my wish list since long & after going through some good reviews decided to try it . Located in the City Centre 1 , Salt Lake the place has an unique feel . As soon as we crossed the entrance we got attracted to the Afghan look & decor of the place hitherto seen in the movies only. The flooring , rifles , carpets , walls , dim yet perfect lighting, sherwani clad staffs all add to the charming look . We had decided beforehand to try their signature preparation Kandahari Laham and ordered Maska Nun ( butter nun ) with it. The presentation of the dish is quite unique. A whole mutton leg marinated with spices ,  cooked with ghee , decorated with right blend of salad & presented with blazing charcoal is a marvelous sight indeed. The portion is quite enormous & was more than sufficient for two of us. The taste is amazing, the small pieces of mutton were oozing it's own juices & coupled with ghee & spices it tasted & smelled heavenly yet retaining the chew of mutton . The Maska Nun was the perfect combination with the Laham . At Rs 1195 /- it's  not cheap but certainly value for money. The complimentary Paan was really good & added to the feel good factor. Would like to come back & try Tehari Murg in future.

Absolutely loved it. The food ,  the hospitality  the ambiance are just a fresh breathe of air. We were a group of 29 people and had pre-ordered many of the dishes. The dishes were served piping hot and were delicious. Kandahari Laham, Khandani Naan, their special dessert  are three of the best dishes we had. Tehri Murg and Angaraa kababs were fantastic. 
What i loved about their service was that the servers advised us on the quantity of food and helped us  to minimize over ordering and wastage.
Will visit their again for sure :)

Kaafila, quite frankly,  scores in its decor, ambience and courteousness of its staff but has remained, at least to me, overpriced and overhyped. We tried Dezaje Masluque, Murgh Sunhere Kabab, Veg Sheekh Kebab, Jhinga 'E' Lazeez (prawn) and Kakori Kebab. The only saving grace was Murgh Sunhere Kebab. For main course we had Maskaa Naan, Cheese Naan and Lababdar Reshmi. The people who tried Mutton Biryani (Gosht Sikandari) weren't impressed either. 

Overall, based on the ratings on Zomato, I expected more. Probably the cooks were having a bad day!

I recently went here for dinner with my cousins. The interiors decorations complemented the theme of the restaurant really well. The food was amazing! I started with a drink named Quite Tangy and it had a variety of fruity flavors. It was tangy and refreshing. For starters we had Kakori kebab, Kandahari Laham, Irani Macchi Tikka and Dezaje Masluqe. The Kakori Kebab was soft, juicy and it tasted good enough; the Kandahari Laham consisted of a whole leg of deliciously cooked mutton, diced up into pieces and I would absolutely recommend it; the Irani Machhi Tikka was ordinary and not really worth much of a shot; the Dezaje Masluqe consisted of chicken legs which were tender, succulent and according to me, the best starter among the four! For main course we had Dal Pakhtooni, Kabuli Tandoori Murgh and Maska Naan. The dal was rich, creamy, buttery and everything a perfect dal makhani should be; the chicken was also tender, slightly spicy and flavorful; the Naan were crisp, buttery and had a nice slight salty flavor. Basically, apart from the kakori kebab and the fish tikka, all the other dishes were lip-smacking delicious! The staff was courteous but we would have liked it better had they advised us that we were ordering too much. Overall, it’s a paradise for meat lovers and a must-try even though it’s on the costlier side.

Ever wondered how is it like to enjoy some lip-smacking north western frontier dishes seating in an Afghan Shack..well Kaafila will give you that exact feel, you will transported from the crowded blocks of City Centre to some distant set-up in the middle of Afghanistan..
Coming to the decor,well that is one of the major selling points of this joint..what I loved was the detailing in recreating the theme..loved the rustic decor of this place..the steel lampshades, the guns hanging on the walls, the floor encasing.. the artefacts, the windows all will make you feel like a dhaba amidst the hilly terrains..Even the servers are dresses up in Pathan Suits to sync with the theme..Coming to food, they have done a brilliant job with their dishes as well, from selecting the most authentic ingredients to plating up the food beautifully they don't leave a scope to complain.. Though prices are on a bit higher side but loved the size of the portions and the tastefulness of the Kebabs..We sampled:
Tandoori Mahi Kebab: Four large chunks of fresh bekti charred to perfection with the right balance of spices will grace your plate.. Loved the marination as well as the freshness of the fish..
Afghani Murgh Ke Kalmi: Chicken thighs marinated with cheese, cream and green chillies and finished in tandoor will give a royal feel to your experience..also found a few pieces of almonds in the chicken with added crunchiness to the dish..
Masala Kulcha: Honestly it tasted more like a Aloo Paratha, baked instead of being fried.. dissappointing..
Butter Naan: Soft, crispy, flaffy and buttery to the right degree..
Sunehre Murgh: As the name suggests, boneless chunks of chicken immersed in a golden almond gravy.. the golden color was imparted by the use of saffron and the richness of the almond coupled with yogurt makes it more delightful..
Handi Jaituni Laham: Basically portions cut from the Mutton Raan cooked in an almod based white gravy.. what was interesting inspite of having a whitish Korma type look, this dish was not at all sweet to the palate..
We ordered a couple of Tandoori Roti with our sides as well..
Only flaws are the fact that the Menu is quite Limited and not much Option in Deserts..
Definitely this place exhibits a highest order of cullinary art and loved the fact that each dish was prepared with utmost care..Our total cheque was Rs.2525/- (all incl) for 3 people, but given the superior experience it was worth off..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 3/5

We went there on my wife's birthday. We found the ambience and lighting very unique and good. Coming to the food, the quantity is really good for two. We were thinking about ordering one "khandani naan" along with one "masala kulcha" but the waiter was very good... He advised us to hold the masala kulcha as khandani naan alone will be more than enough and really it was very true and we two even couldn't finish that. The only drawback among the total order was that the salt was little less but I think it's okay as low salt is actually good for health.

Tasty Food, Nice ambience, courteous staff & nice seating arrangement.... Overall all a good place to eat .
The Paneer Khurchan is a must have, haven't tasted the non-veg section yet hoping to tick it off soon as all seems good. and don't forget the PAAN while coming out, it is the cherry on the top.

A quality Afghani experience!! Beautiful ambience with decorations reminding you of a Afghani market place having beautiful pottery, shawls and lamp shades. Food was of good quality with very good behaviour from the staff. A must if you want to taste authentic Afghani. Price a bit on the higher side though but the food quality more than makes up for it . PS: Mutton preparations are too good!

Ticked off Kaafila from my wishlist finally! Royal decor, classy ambience, warm service and good food. This place delivered everything. For the starters I went for Tandoori mahi kebabs, which was undoubtedly the best one of the meal, a must for the bhetki lovers. Dejaze Masluqe was perfectly cooked and not the regular tangri kebab you have at most places. They are good with the sherbets as well. Fresh gold, the ginger ale was refreshing and the lime soda was perfect. For the main course we went for the murgh sufiyani Biriyani with raita. The Biriyani was high on taste and it tasted light and different than awadhi/handi Biriyani. The service was fast and staff were courteous. Next time at City Centre do give Kaafila a visit for some quality food.

Raan comes out as a sizzler, then the waiter pulls the meat off with tongs and you get it boneless on your biryani, without having to place an advance order for the raan.

When dull and monotonous tastes have made your food mundane, it’s time for you to welcome a perfect and innovative menu. And Kaafila is the perfect location for this purpose. With an Afghani flavour creeping into your tastes, you are sure to witness one of the best food journeys.  ‘Kaafila’ is a restaurant situated in one of the most popular malls, City Centre, DC-Block, B-wing, 3rd Floor, Salt Lake Kolkata.  As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting, a delightful marriage of antique lights and drapes adorning through the edges of the ceiling. The sitting area accommodates 50-60 guests at a time.
                                                                ...

Finally!!! Ticked off my bucket list....Though it is situated so close to my place , never got the chance to visit it.....But I would love to visit it again and again to try their scrumptious Afghani cuisine!!!!

Location(4/5): Located in third floor of B block of City centre mall, as soon as you step out of the lift , restaurant is right in front of you... It could be a maze to reach B block if you have not visited the mall even once....

Ambience(5/5): The setup is beautiful....That Afghani look and feel of the restaurant is just bang on....Just loved it.. One of the most classy designs iv seen till date...

Food(4.5/5) : Sadly we were 2 ppl and were not much hungry so could not try out many items....
1. Starters
Dezaje Masluqe : It belongs to the category "The poultry hut" of the menu card....Here you will get 4 pieces of chicken legs marinated with amazing spices and grilled in tandoor.... I had heard about this dish a lot of times and trust me it was just lip smacking.... It indeed had that Afghan flavour and was extremely delicious and juicy...Would love to try it again!!!!

2. Mocktails
Pink Panther: It is a strawberry based soda drink which was quite refreshing and the sweetness was just perfect... the balance between the sour taste from strawberry and the sugar syrup was bang on...worth giving it a try!!!!!!

Quite Tangy: My friend had this mocktail consisting of different fruit flavours such as lychee, blackberry, apple, cranberry etc.... The blend was perfect... I could actually feel the taste of different fruits and the sweetness was also just right....

3. Main Course
Ghosht Sikandar Biriyani: This was a special mutton biriyani served with raita.... The biriyani had 2 big pieces of mutton which was pretty much enough for 2 people.... The best part about the biriyani was that it was not at all oily.... I have seen many biriyanis that have oil/ghee dripping down but this one was so different.... it maintained it's authentic Afghani taste and at the same time consumed less oil/ghee....The quantity was more than enough that we actually had to pack the left over....It was just mind blowing...the raita complimented so well with it that no other gravy was actually necessary.... It is a must try for all biriyani lovers...

Service(5/5): People were very courteous and the service was pretty much quick...They greeted us with a big smile when we entered...So absolutely no complaint...

VFM(4/5) : The total bill was 1319 including all the taxes which I though was not very expensive for 2 persons considering it is situated inside a mall and they have an amazing setup....

Do try this once and I'm sure you would want to visit it again...😃😃

After reading such an enormous number of good reviews and ratings, I was interested to visit this restaurant!
And believe me , I loved it!
The hype is real! I won't mention the details about their interior decor and ambience, Since no doubt it's good , as evident from the pictures and other reviews.
For starter, we ordered Murgh Sunehre Kebab and Kaafila ki Martini! The kebab had the perfect proportion of spices and is worth trying!
Main course : We had Gosht Sikandari Biriyani, Jeera Rice, Masala Kulcha, Sunehre murgh and Tawa paneer Taka tin.
The Biriyani is one the best I had till date. Other dishes were equally good .
The total price came out to be Rs 3381.

Ambience
Kaafila is a beautifully themed restaurant and the moment you enter this place, you get that afghani vibe. Such is the ambience. The furniture,  the music, the decor, couldn't anyway better depict the afghani theme!

Service
The staff is very efficient and prompt at work. No complains about them.       

Appetizers
In this section we ordered for Banjara Macchi (chef special) a Pomfret delight, and Tandoori Mahi Kebab, a "bhetki" dish. Both the dishes were good, though the  Bhetki preparation could have been better. 

Mocktails
A bit disappointing, this section is. The drinks are abnormally high priced in comparison to the quantity they serve. The quality however is not an issue to complain about. (We went for Soft shangria, and Shirley temple in this section.)   

Main course
We ordered for Hari moti ki Pilaf with Murg Kurchan. The Pilaf was amazing! Crafted exquisitely with flavours and tender spices, this dish is a must have. Murg Kurchan on the other hand is like any other ordinary chicken preparation and doesn't have much to look out for.

A worldclass resturant ,stood better than my expectation... 100% pure feeling of afgan with awesome Afghani food..
Me and my friends planned to visit kaafila from a long time ago ,after entering the feeling was awesome as of i entered a taboo in afgan..
Soon we were in our table
We order kaandhari laham and khaandani naan as our starter It took half and hour of cooking time and belive me the taste was too good so was the way of serving ..
Then we ordered our main course the Tehari murgh and wow again this was probably the best of the evening ,too good yaar , we were four and it was sufficient for all four of us...
At last we ordered firni and Boulawnee. Here i want to say the boulawnee was just out of the world.. its the best dessert i would eber had..
As a whole the experience was awesome,wonderful experience at the end of the day

This is one of the best Awadhi restaurant in the city. Starting from the interior to food quality, behaviour of staff, presentation, every thing is superb, it will give you a nice feeling to be in this place. The only thing which I like to mention is that the cost is a little on the higher side as compared to few other restaurants in Kolkata, but no wonder to get such wonderful dishes, with such a great ambience, it is worthy of spending money here

Tasted almost all mutton preparation and starters a must for every visitor. As a travel and food enthusiast I would suggest the management to check with the price of liqour variety. Overall a great place for fun with family n friends. Not to forget kulcha stuffed and masala kulcha a great foundation for load lovers.

We had ordered chicken tandoori which was amazing.... The marination was super good....and we had ordered for dal makhani and sunehri murg(chicken ) with lachcha parantha and butter naan.
Chicken was very tasty but the dal was out of the world....and i had also ordered a firni which was okaish...
I look forward to come here again to try out some new dishes for sure...
Price is a bit high but I guess the food makes you forget that....

Kaafila was just the way i expected it to be. The Afghani decor and the dim lights 😍 I so loved the interiors. Coming to the food, we ordered garlic naan, plain naan, methi matar makai and paneer lababdar. The garlic naan was amongst the best i ve ever had. Not being much of a paneer fan, i did not really concentrate on the paneer dish. Methi matar makai was delicious. When we were leaving, we were served with paan and chocolates at the door, which was such a sweet gesture. :) We had a wonderful experience here.

I went to this place yesterday night for dinner with a friend. The restaurant was well occupied. I requested for a couch. They said all couches are occupied. Sat on a table for two. The table was too small to hold more than a couple of dishes. We had to constantly make space for our plates, drinks and dishes.

The service was pretty unsatisfying too. Had to remind the waiter a couple of times for finger bowl. Also for clearing the starter plates. Not very hospitable to put it simply.

However, the food was lip smacking. Ordered Murgh malai tikka for starter. It was delicious to say the least. For main course, we had jhinga e lazeez, masala kulcha and broccoli cheese naan. Very tasty.
I also had Blood of God, a red wine cocktail which is one out of the world drink. :)

In short, it's the food which will take me back to this place and not the service. Ambience is nice too, but that 2-seater was in a corner where I could only see the wall. So no points to that too.

Kaafila was sitting at my wish list since long and has become a personal favorite after a couple of visits. Not just their food, but the minute details in the decor and the courteous staffs have definitely made me come back to this place, again and again.

The rifles, pots, embroidered clothes and most importantly the sepia tone on everything sets the afghan ambiance right. This place can accommodate groups with any number of people as it contains 2-seater to 12-seater tables. It is difficult to get seated without any waiting on weekends but then again they do have reservation facility on phone, which actually saves your time. In fact you can ask for a table and instead of waiting, take a stroll inside City Centre and come back with doubled hunger pangs!

The food here is class apart from many other restaurants serving north Indian or north western cuisine. I have tried quite a few items and below are the details:

Banjara Machhi - Whole pomfret, rubbed with spices and grilled to perfection. A mouthwatering start to the meal.

Kandahari Laham - This is one of the signature dishes at Kaafila and we made sure to order this on our first visit itself. We asked for suggestion from the server and he told that one plate should be sufficient for three of us and the same would taste good with butter nun. We followed the same and the result was marvelous! This is a whole mutton leg, marinated with spices, prepared with ghee and served within the blazing charcoals. The view itself made us salivating and the taste made us content. I am never fond of mutton but I can swear by this dish. The fibers were not falling apart from the bones and I loved the slight chew in the meat. The flavors were upright and the butter nun and a bowl of Kuchumber Salad accompanied it perfectly. The portion size was huge but you will never get bored of it.

Registani Lal Gosht - I was expecting a preparation like Laal Maas of this dish but it surprised me differently. Not rustic like Laal Mass, but the tender pieces of mutton simmered in the kashmiri mirch gravy, looked hot but tasted delicious. And I absolutely loved those big chunks of garlic. Paired well with Masala Kulcha but would have tasted better with a much simpler Butter Nun.

Murg Sufiyani - Chicken Biryani to be specific, nothing extraordinary but extremely satisfying with subtle spices and flavours, and a huge piece of chicken. Being a Kolkatan, missed my potato in it. Absolutely adored the raita served along with.

Gosht Sikandari - Mutton Biryani with a big chunk of mutton but without a potato, again. The mutton was well-cooked but lacked spices. Little overdose of whole garam masals.

Kesaria Firni - An absolutely amazing dessert. The rich and creamy texture will fill your senses and the prominent kesar flavor will satiate your soul. I can come back a thousand times just for this dish.

Boulawnee - This is an afghani pastry, made of rich dry fruits and served with vanilla ice cream. This was unavailable on our first visit. The description on the menu seemed so tempting that we didn't want to miss this anymore and on our second visit, we ordered a plate of this along with the main course itself. We were expecting this just at the end of our meal but it took a lot of time to get served. But what got served, was completely worth the wait. Quite an ecstatic kind of dessert, with dry fruits in each bite, warmed up, up beautifully with the vanilla ice cream. The dish is not much sweet and created heaven on my taste buds, to the extent that we ended up ordering two more plates of it.

The ecstatic food, the great service, the cozy but elegant ambience is rightly set to live up to your expectations. Price range is on a steeper side but won't burn a hole in your pocket.

Last but not the least, the USP of Kaafila to me is the complimentary Paan served at the exit. It rounds up your meal in such a way that you immediately get tempted to plan your next meal at this place!!

One of my favourite places for North Indian food. 

Came here a couple of months back after a long time. The veg starter plater was ordinary this time with the spices and freshness missing. The disappointment continued to the main course as the vegetable and dal were ordinary as well. Would call it an average visit rather than an average place as this is one of the places we've had the most consistent food. 

It's all right guys. Everyone has an off day. Hope you make up for it next time. :)

After hearing loads about this place, recently I set my foot in here. With an awesome ambiance (though not so spacious, but I like the afghan styled decor), this is my new favourite. The foods we took were Murgh Suneheri Kebab, Murgh Kurchan and Ghosth Sikandari. The taste of biriyani is stil on my tounge. 😃 The quality of the foods were great. The staffs were polite. Hoping a asap visit.

This is one my personal favorites. The food is simply superb, everything i have tasted here is simply amazing kebabs, biriyani, gravy based dishes, everything is just mouth watering-ly delicious. I Specially love the karori kebab, the fish irani tikka kebab, the gosht biryani, the garlic naan and rest i don't even remember. The cocktails on offer are equally good, I highly recommend having the Mojito it is very refreshing and goes well with the starters. 
This place has a wonderful ambiance. The service is very prompt. I love this place.
I have lost count of how many times i have been here, but i would visit here over and over again.
Writing this review is making me famish. remembering all those lovely dishes.
Highly Highly Recommended.

So had this one bookmarked for long. Ultimately on the occasion of my Bridal Shower arranged by my friends, I visited this afghan-themed joint. Straightaway, the starters, Afghan Murgh ke Kalmi and Mahi Motiyaan were succulent and juicy. The refreshing sherbets: Fresh Gold and Quite Tangy, tasted great alongwith the starters. Spoilt for choice, we decided to have Cheese naan, Lasooni naan, Hari Moti ka Pilaf, Registani Lal Gosht and Murgh Kurchan. Lasooni naan had too much of garlic for me to bear while the murgh  kurchan was a bit sweet. The rest of the items were delicious. The creamy gravy of Registani lal gosht and the fresh aromatic pilaf can increase the appetite of anyone! Would love to visit again.

My first visit to this restaurant was really good. We had ordered kebabs and it was amazing. Let me tell you that I have tasted tunday kebabs in lucknow, so I really had a high level of expectation here and kafila scored good grades in that. The ambience was also pretty much cozy and unique.I do recommend kafila if you are a tandoori or north Indian food connoisseur

Finally a north Indian restra with the likes of peshawari and zaranj but not that expensive. Had black dal, paneer lababdar and veg biriyani.. The dal was out of the world, paneer and biriyani was good. I like this place, recommend it to all and certainly will visit again any time I get a chance to.

Not at all Great food .. standards have gone down , we ordered for Murg shorba , & Murg reshmi kebab during lunch, When it came was very hard & stale ... we called the manager , but he was reluctant to come to table & speak , after some time a junior chef attended the table .. & said they will replace ! but i felt sick after having the food . This is not at all excepted . There was no feeling of sorry towards the team members .

Had a wonderful lunch at Kaafila. The feel of the place is in sync with the cuisine. Among four people, we ordered the Veg platter which had kebabs, tandoori aloo, and the usual grilled assortment. They have a pretty good mocktail selection out of which the Shirley Temple was really good (ginger ale with orange juice)
Dal makhani and Makai palak followed which were very well prepared, and we also tried the cheese broccoli naan which was surprisingly tasty! Lots of other vegetarian options too. Had a great time!

Located inside City Centre this place is well decorated to give you the Afghan atmosphere all around. The moment you enter this place you can smell the flavour of Tandoor which is a big attraction for all meat lovers. Tandoori chicken, Murg Malai Kabab, Galawti Kabab are simply delicious.

Kaafila , as the name suggests treats us  with their a true afghani cuisine which also has an inclination towards our North Indian food. Well, it was a cool windy day and some hot n spicy food would be the best combination for uplifting our ever fickle mood. So .. We ordered  Irani Macchi Kabab. The Kabab was tasty , though the marination of the fish could have been a little better. Then we ordered Mutton Biriyani and Registani Gosht. The registani gosht was superb with all the masalas creating a spicy environment in your body and soul. The Biriyani was above average. 
The Mutton was soft and juicy (i.e no use of tooth-pricks after you finish your food).

The good
- Food is fantastic. You would be too full to try out all the varieties on the menu, which makes you keep coming back for more
- Nice ambience and decor
- Good service

The bad
- A bit overpriced

We went to this restaurant few days ago with my friends.
The décor of the restaurant is really great. You will really feel the ambience of a afgani restaurant with carpets, seating arrangements and show pieces.
As drinks we have ordered Malibu, mojito , blue lagoon, mango juice.
The food was also delicious. 
We have ordered murgh sunhare kawab and murgh malai tikka kawab as starters. 
In the main course we have ordered sabzi pilaf, butter naan and two chicken dishes(can't remember the names).
 In desert we gave ordered Boulawnee (dry fruit kheer with ice cream).
If you really looking for a place with good afgani / muglai go d, try this restaurant, you won't be disappointed for sure.

Located in the very popular city centre mall of Salt lake. The Afghani theme reflects in their interiors and ambience is good too. Food is very good. Afghani chixken and Biriyani is generally delicious.  The Kakori kebab is good too. Service is prompt. Nice place for a lunch or dinner. Weekends can be crowded.

It was in my bucket list for a long time and finally it got the tick in last Sunday.

Started with Tandoori Mahi Kabab(fish) and Kakori Kabab(mutton) along with Shirley Temple and Mixed one in mocktails. The mocktails were extremely refreshing and tasty in the sweltering heat of Kolkata. The starters, Kakori Kabab is a must try and Mahi Kabab was equally good.

Then came biriyani (mutton) and Registani Lal Gosth(mutton). The charcoal flamed smell of the curry of Gosth and the biriyani was awesome. Raita comes free with biriyani and we ended with Firni which was insanely tasty.

Cost is on the higher which is perhaps the only drawback but its worth it.

Finding this place is a bit tricky as it is located in the interior of the mall. A friend of mine took me there so I am still not too familiar with the exact location. But just like a cave or caravan, its tucked away some corner of City Centre.

The name 'Kaafila' brings forth visions of a convoy of camels trudging through a desert. As we entered the restaurant, we were ushered into the semi dark interiors of a cavernous space. The partitions act as screens, gradually introducing one to the many layers of the décor. Generally each partition has enough space to accommodate around 5-6 people. However our group was twice as large, so we occupied the central table which can cater for the seating of 10-12 people. This place surely encourages large family visits!
The interiors have been devised in minute detail to recreate an atmosphere reminiscent of life in a Afghani tent. Everyday items like pots and pans, rifles, framed photos in sepia tones displayed on the walls, the tapestries, canvas canopies, embroidered cloth hung from the ceiling, the patiala style dress of the staff and the lanterns used for low lighting, the setup looks good enough for a movie shoot. Also there is a cluster of desi hookahs and jars mounted on the wall, making me wish only if they could actually serve a desi shisha…that would have be enchanting.

The food here is a class apart from other restaurants serving north indian or north western cuisines. The starter menu entirely consists of tandoor cooked items which seems to be their speciality.
★    Paneer Chutneywala : No matter what the description reads, this is a conventional paneer tikka. The paneer piece was soft and evenly cooked on the outer. The garlic and mint paste was nicely coated all over it.

★    Tandoori Angar : This was a combination of tandoor grilled mushrooms, babycorns and baby potato. The corns were entire pieces of babycorn cooked with chef’s special marinade in the tandoor. The corn was crunchy, both on the inner and outer layers. The potato had a similar coating all over thus having similar taste. The taste was maintained impeccably though. Sadly didn’t get to taste the mushrooms as my friends had already gobbled them up.

Now moving on to the main course.
★    Sabz Lahori Korma : The gravy was rich with elements of cashew, coconut and other spices. The assortment of exotic vegetables with few paneer pieces was classy. Prepared in white gravy, the dish was inordinate.

★    Sunehre Paneer : This we decided to try out a different paneer dish. So we went with this yogurt-almond gravy preparation. The paneer pieces were nicely marinated in the gravy and were cut in not too large/small pieces.

★    Dal Pakhtooni : The classic dal makhani, just with a stylish name. And it was as good as usual. It had a nice creamy texture with a rich dark hue. And the taste was sublime.

★    Cheese Naan : Well this was the only disappointment. It wasn’t as cheesy as expected given that I have had better at other restros. But it was soft and evenly cooked.

For drinks & desserts we had :-
★    Lychee Delight : This was super high on flavour, too high perhaps. So it brought about a saccharine feel to the cooler thus subduing other elements.
★    Mocha Slush : This was the better of the two. Had a less sugary taste with equal balance of coffee and chocolate syrup.

★    Boulawnee : This was the first time I have had this and pretty sure that it isn’t available I any other restaurant. This is a Afghani pastry made by mashing rich dry fruits and covered with sugary molasses. Simply one of the best desserts I have had in long time. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

The service has areas to improve in terms of knowledge and attentiveness. So I learnt that this place is mainly for the non-vegetarians as they would have wide range of items to choose from. The food quality is quite good but they have an overly priced menu which will surely burn a deep hole in your pocket. I would recommend this place as a one time try.

We ordered a veg platter and a non veg platter. The veg platter tasted much better. Non veg platter can be avoided. The main course, both veg and non veg were a delicacy even though daal was below expectation. Chicken and mixed veg tasted very well. The masala kulcha and butter naan was well made as well. Most of attendants bore a very serious look though. Overall a good experience and good ambience

It took me more than 15 minutes to figure out where this place was in the mall. The ambiance of this place was really relaxing and gives you an essence of ancient period. For food, we ordered for 2 drinks - gold drink and the other one was some mocktail made out of fruit juices. Main course - Paneer Khurchan, Garlic Naan and Hara Bhara Chana. Excellent food, good service. Prices are bit on the higher side.

Kaafila for Saturday luncheon.
The interior is apt with the kind of cuisine they serve. Well decorated and very cosy ambience.
For starters we ordered kandhari laham, murg sunhere kebab, mahi lassoni and chatpate paneer shehzade.
Each and every item was mouth melting and too tasty.
One must try kandhari laham. One of their signature dish.
Marine delight as mocktail and black mamba as cocktail and freshlime soda were there to quench our thirst.
For main course ghost sikandari and murg sufiyana and murg kurchan and murg sunehere as side dish.
All the spices were in appropriate proportions.
All the delicacies were amazingly tasty and we were all so full that we dint order anything for desserts.

The theme of the restaurant is awesome, and while dining one feels one's inside the tent in an Afghan Bedouin camp and not in a mall. The walled photographs depicting Afghan life, hanging carpets with intricate designs and jars and hookahs on shelves add to the charm of the well-decked interior. Apart from the ambiance, their north West Frontier cuisine is also very Afghani. We'd had Paneer Lababdar with naan which were ravishingly and richly cooked and served with care. Even waiters were dressed like Afghan men. The name itself sparks off an enchanting romantic Afghan sojourn in the rugged mountains.

If you want to have a feel of Afganisthan sitting in Kolkata, then your destination is Kaafila. Located in City centre I, Saltlake, this resturant is a must visit for all Mughal dish lovers. The ambience , with the decoration and dress code of the staff gives a Afghani smell all around. The hosptability of the staff needs amention too. Dont miss out on the famous Kandhari Lahm, Chicken Dezaue Masque, Fish Irani Kebab..too mention a few and round up with a Bolauni Dessert for sure. The staff gives you a welcome goodbye with a Pan and a "Come Again Smile". Pocket pinch is a bit high at Rs. 700-800 per head but its worth the value. Corporates get a 10% discount on food. My fourth visit in the last 1 year and many more to come. Meet you @ Kaafila!!!

It was one of my finest north indian dining experiences...from the ambience to the food and the mocktails...everything was grand.
They have well maintained the afghani look and feel of the restaurant from the decorations and cuisine point of view..
For starters we took their signature item murg malai tikka which was average..bt then the other starters we took were extraordinary including soft and melting mahi motiyaan which is the finest fish kebab i have ever tasted and chatpate paneer shehzade
For main course we had murg sufiyani,gosht sikandari,subz handi biryani which were delicious...along with the side dishes gosht khada masala,lababdar reshmi and paneer lababdar.But the best of all was the khandani naan which is definitely a must try if you visit this place
They hav a very different kind of dessert called baulawnee which comprises of vanilla icecream topping a hot delicious nut cake or afghani pastry..we all loved it
The best part was yet to come and were the mocktails...the lychee delight,wildon and choco moco were mouth watering
Its overall a wonderful restaurant located in cc1.

Was there for a second time this past friday with a colleague. Ordered Seekh kabab, kakori Kabab, dal and bread. THe meats were all stale the Seekh kababs were uncooked and cold in the center and the Kakoris were microwaved and tasted awefull. After some complaining the staff replaced the seekh kababs with burnt on gas kababs, which tasted even worse. TO add to this both me and my colleague had  a stomach infection after this. 
Only 3 / 4 occupied tables on a weekend at dinner time probably is an indication that the place has lost its touch.  
Best to avoid

The food was very good. I have been here 3 times and have eaten vegetarian food because I was the only one with an appetite for chicken. I did not want to waste the huge positions. But one of those times, I ordered a kebab, and honestly it was delightful. The service is also at par any fine dining place. Yes, I found the place a little expensive but I guess this is the optimum price for a restaurant like this.

Interior decor is excellent. Except the irani fish tikka d food is overpriced and taste was not dat good. After hearing a lot of praise it certainly didnt live upto its reputation. However it is advisable to have any kind of naan and murg malai tikka with slight gravy. Could b better, should b better.

I love this place! The rustic décor and the food never fails to impress me.
We went for lunch there today. For starters we ordered Murgh Sunehere Kebab, Mahi Motiyan (fish starter) and Kakori Kebab, all of which were excellent. The fish pieces were small, but plenty and tasted great. For main course, we ordered Jeera Chawal, Maska Naan, Masala Kulcha, Tandoori Roti, Lababdar Reshmi, Rogani Gosht and Machchi Taka-Tin. The Lababdar was awesome and the Rogani Gosht won everyone's hearts. The fish, however, broke our hearts. It was stale and smelly and we returned the dish. They did offer to serve another plate of it, but we did not want to take a risk of another bad fish dish.
My suggestion: Do not order fish, I don't think they get to serve much fish for main course and hence may have a stale stock. Go for chicken and mutton - these guys cook them brilliantly! The gravy will keep you licking your fingers, trust me!

The Mutton preparations are made to perfection and the meat is soft and tasty. The ambience goes with the cuisine and the theme of the restaurant.

I visited last time during durga puja.. it was crowded and we had to wait for long. Bt however the biriyani was up to mark and chicken do pyaza also tasted good. I preferred a cocktail , spicy arabian( vodka base) which was really nice. 
If you want to enjoy good food and drinks at a reasonable cost with family your can surely visit this place.

A good place to go if you love mughlai, afghani cuisine. The theme of the restaurant so much justifies the cuisine mentioned. One should definitely try out kandahari laham, khandani naan and murg sunehre kebab. One thing that was quite a big bumper in the menu was the sharbaat-e-khas option, where i did not find anything adhering to the cuisine type. I would also like to mention that the desert options weren't pretty vibrant to go with. I tried boulawnee over there, but it did not pamper my taste bud like a desert should do. It would have been great if "Kaafila" provided us with some more options in the desert section specially something like "Shahi tukra" would have been so much apt.Neverthless leaving aside this two options i loved the place and the prices are on a tad higher side but the quality of food makes up for it.

Worst restaurant. Worst service. Took 45 mins to make biriyani Inspite of restaurant being nearly empty. Too slow food service. Food quality is not even 1% worth the price even after super slow service. Total waste of time money and appetite .  Strongly not recommended !!!

The first thing that strikes you upon entering Kaafila is the decor - it takes theme based restaurants to a new level altogether. It has been designed to resemble Afghan food joints, and after a while inside the restaurant, you tend to forget that you're in a fine dining restaurant of a mall.

Coming to the food, we ordered a lot of stuffs -  kakori kebabs, murgh sufiyaani pasinda, keema shehzaade and registaani laal gost among others. The meat was tender and juicy - the kind you get only by proper marination! Based on the reviews here, I tried out the khandaani naan and was in for a shock when I was served around 10 pieces of breads! It definitely lives up to the name!

Overall, highly recommended if you are looking for good Afghani food!

Kaafila undoubtedly is one of my favourite restaurant in the city.The food is always exquisite and never disappoints.Following a recent visit the food was delicious,Kandahari Laham was very well made n succulent.The only criticism would be the odd chairs missing a backrest.Who would wanna devour the juicy kebabs sitting on those uncomfortable chairs.Otherwise an excellent place with a very nice decor and great food.

Undoubtedly one of the best Afgani/mughlai cuisine restaurant in north kolkata. Since the inception of city centre 1 way back in probably 2004 or 2005, this place has been instrumental in terms of meeting customer expectation. I still remember in 2008, after I got confirmation letter in my company, we 6 "bali ka bakhra" had chosen this place to give a treat to the entire project team and that cost 3500 per head!!
However, this days when u can afford money to have luxury dining, definitely this kinda restaurant is matter of choice. Do try their signature dish "Kandahaari laham". Definitely an item worth trying and worth to be remembered as a mouthgasmic preparation!!
Today also we visited this place on the occassion bengali new year. We had Kandahari Laham, Tehari Murgh, and one tengri kebab item(forgot the name). All the items were fabulous.

The chicken biriyani was very good too, with a scent of some kind. The Kid-Nu-Gosht was equally lip-smacking and very soft. Overall, very good. Highly recommended.

I Love trying different cusines in different restaurants in Kolkata. Today our choice was Kaafila.. Specialised in Afghani food.
Well not that great as expected.
We ordered for Kakori kababs, green salad, khandani nun, a chicken and a mutton dish (can't exactly remember their names).
The khandani nun was very nice. Very tasty and detailed.. I liked it..Apart from that the other dishes were preety OK .. Quite common types.
Ambiance is good... Not great.. Small space..
Service is nice and fast.. Staffs are well aware of the dishes.
We did not feel like having deserts as the price was too high.

Overall quite expensive. In one word not worth for money..

The ambience is great. All set up to fit in the afghani theme. Too many carpets, hookahs, fire, tandoor etc to fill up the place. The food for the start was good. Superb actually. But then the main course was not up to the mark at all. It was not good compared to the starters.

We loved the theme of this restaurant, that gave a raw Arabian look to the interiors. The seating arrangement was good. They had only the two of us seated in a huge table with beautiful cushions all around that made us really comfy.
Coming to the food, each bite had it's own delicacy. Absolutely loved the food. We had ordered a chicken kebab with 4 leg pieces for the starters. The main course included Dezaje Masluqe and Chicken biriyani, The taste beyond words.
We had ordered some drinks too that complemented our food just fine. I'd obviously say it's a bit expensive but all for the right reasons. Had a great experience!

This is an awesome restaurant...though a bit expensive, but the ambience and the food is good. The sharbat's were a turndown except soft shangria. Had murgh sunehre kebabs and dezaje masluque (chicken legs). Both were delicious and the chickens just melted in the mouth. The murgh sufiyani biryani was okay....the usual flavour of biryani was missing. We ordered sunehre murgh as well which was really very nice. Overall, a nice experience.

We went to City Centre 1 Kafila for dinner. This place is decorated with Afgani culture. This is one of the few places in Kolkata where you can have authentic Afgani and North Indian cuisine. We ordered Irani machhi tikka as starter.The fish was very soft and fresh. In the main course we had Sikandari Gosht Biriyani. The biriyani here is above average. Then we ordered butter naan along with their signature dish Kandahari Laham. This is an item prepared from whole mutton leg and is a must try at Kafila. In total, I would say an ideal place for family dinner.

Waiters are dressed in Afgani Suit with Pagri, this place is fully decorated according to Agfani Culture. 'Tehari Murg' is a must have if you visit this place. I have never tasted any afgani dish better than this. An ideal place for office or family party :D

I really liked orientation of the seating arrangement specially for the big groups. Service was excellent and all the service staffs were very generous and helpful. We stayed there for almost 3 hours and ordered lot of food and drinks. There are few worth mentioning and must try:

Kandahari Laham -- It's finger licking good. 
Banjara Macchi -- Loved this pomfret preparation 
31st special Roasted Turkey preparation -- Awesome
Blood of God Cocktail -- Definitely worth a try

Overall it's paradise for meat craving folks. I would definitely like to pay a second visit to explore more on the menu.

This is one of the best place to have afgani dish in city center 1. 
Me nd my gf visited this place at ashtami in this durga puja for lunch. 
At first look we love the place. The decor was full in afgani style. There r couch in cabana style covered with afgan style carpet. Walls r made to give a look of mud style. Waiters are dressed in pathani with johor coat with afgan topi. Lights r dimmed.

We have to wait as this place were crouded that day. Bt the service is quick so we dont have to wait for long. Attendent guide us to our table for two. Waiters are well behaved.

We ordered fish malai tikka and chiken reshmi kabab for starter. Fish malai tikka is so moist nd yummy so must try here. The portion of the tikka nd kabab was easily enough for two.
In main course we ordered kashmiri polau and mutton handi. Polau is good and mutton dish is another faviourate for me. In dessert we ordered firni its as usual yummmm.

The rate is lil in high way bt justified as it is a good dinnig experience for us.

After my visit i always suggested all my frend who wanna try mughlai item.

Hope to visit there again. Cheers!!!!!!

I should have written this long back but I am a lazy bengali. Me and my husband were visiting Kolkata. And during our stay after a hectic day, we just wanted to have good food. We went to Kaafila. I had tasted their food before but not my husband. We were so happy that day with the quality of food they served and the service we got. I remember we ordered Khandani Naan. That was great and some red meat, can't remember the name of the dish. 
But this is not the only reason I was impressed. I found a hair in my dish and I asked them to replace the dish. They not only replaced the dish but also served the meat dish again, that too with out much wait time. My husband was really impressed by this.
The manager, again I forgot the name (a healthy guy, maybe of height 5'5"), but he was so very professional and handled the situation with utmost sincerity. He didn't had to do that. He could have been rude or non-cooperative  or just be ignorant, like many other managers in other restaurants in Kolkata. Then we got a bill and to our surprise they didn't even charge for that dish. We felt bad and insisted to pay for that dish as we had enjoyed it thoroughly so it wasn't comfortable for us to walk away without paying for it. However, we couldn’t win. 

Anyway, the takeaway from this experience is that they maintain their quality, be it food or service. I would like to recommend Kaafila to anyone visiting Kolkata.

Dropped by this eatery for late dinner on sat evening, interiors are simply fabulous with carpets, lanterns, picture frames, lighting, music, waiters dressed in afghani pathan suit with pagdi. Ordered dezaje masluque for starter, leg pieces well marinated medium spicy and served hot, was pretty tasty. Ordered chicken lababdar, tandoori rotis, murgh biriyani with fresh lime soda and lychee delight. Biriyani was good and chicken lababdar was creamy. All in all, it was a good dining experience at Kaafila. Would like to come back again!!

This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Been there a million times and have tried almost every item on the menu, and it's really hard to zero down on a favorite. Kandahari laham and pakhtooni dal (it's the best I've ever had! ) are absolute delights that bring me back to this place every time.

I must say I found Kaafila a bit over rated and over hyped. Yes the ambiance is nice which gives you a feeling of Afghani hospitality. And the staffs are cordial and very much attentive to the guests, but the goodness ends there. I found nothing exceptional  that makes them better than a standard north Indian eatery. What I found out in my first visit here that, they masquerade the well known popular dishes under the veil of some fancy names, notch their prices up quite a bit and serve them. 
For example, the dish called "Murgh Makhmali Sikanj" is simply Chicken Seekh Kebab and the dish "Sunhere Murgh" is a kind of dish that we have had in numerous other restaurants in half of its price. Although the dishes were delectable, but I must admit after hearing so many good things about this place, I expected some thing more  which they failed to deliver. I am not quite a mutton person, so can not comment on their signature dish "Kandahari Laham". 
Although this was my maiden visit  and may be my expectation was set too high, but Kaafila turned out to be a damp squib for me. I hope the next visits here will not be as disappointing as the first one.
Here are my ratings :
Food--3.5
Ambiance--4.5
Hospitality--4
Pricing--3
Overall--3.5

It was the first time I visited an Afghani restaurant and I must begin with by saying that it was a superb gastronomical experience for me at Kaafila.
We dropped in to the restaurant at Lunch time, to savour the most talked of dish of the restaurant, Kandhahari Laham. The decor of the place alongwith the background music lends an afghani atmosphere to the place. Guns showcased on walls, works of art put up at certain places brings up the Afghani feel to the eatery. 
Coming over to the food, we ordered a Blue Heaven and a Marine Delight for refreshment. Both the drinks tasted good, the Marine Delight being my favourite. Since there were two of us only, so we thought of ordering the much awaited Kandhahari Laham, which would suffice both as a starter as well as of the main course. The presentation of the item was quite interesting and eye catching. The item being placed on an aluminium foil, decked with ghee, placed on top of another tray with fire below the aluminium foil to keep the mutton pieces heated up. It was an entire plateful which if had by 4 people, would have sufficed as a starter. The item was well cooked, and garnished with ghee/butter, and just melted down the throat. It was thoughtful of us to order the refreshers, otherwise this item when had by only two people, would have turned boring.
Since we were full on our tummy, so we ordered Firni to let the spicy mutton to melt down our throat. The Firni served was Kesari Firni and it was delicious to taste.
The staff was very polite and service was prompt. To top it all, we also got corporate discounts, which made us leave the place with a  smile on our faces. A definitely go-go for all the meat lovers out there. Happy Eating!! :-)

We had some nice lamb raann tikka. Jeera rice, garlic was an instant hit. Rap it up with awesome Rum Balls. Nice decor. 

Visited them again and this time they mesmerised us completely with Kuandaani Naan and Mrgh Tehari. But the Galawati Kebab just spoiled our appetite.

lets come to the main issue!! I must say our sudden plan had not made us disappoint. The restaurant was very nicely decorated in a mughaliya style.. Their service was quite fast.The quality of the food was delicious and the price was also good..
In sort a well spent day at Kaafila.. People should go there at least once..

KAAFILA stands to be one of my favourite restaurant serving lipsmacking afgani food,  after peshawari. The decor is similar to it but a way too cramped. I am still longing to give a group visit to savour their specialities like kandahari laham,  tehari murgh and khaandani naan. But it was just two of us and hence a short orderlist comprising MURGH MALAI TIKKA, CHEESE NAAN,  LASOONI NAAN and SUNHERE MURG,  out of which murgh malai tikka was worth remembering. The chicken side dish was way too sweet to my liking. The only negetive i could point out was the price hike they do during pujas, without any prior notice or advertisements,  and the very limited menu being served.  Simply Not done from a restaurant of this class!

The ambience is also very good with wall hangings and everything it gives you a very Mediterranean feel.

Went for lunch on 1st Jan. First let me talk about the ambience. I must say it was pretty good and something which was new for me. Now let me come to the food part. First we have ordered two mocktails one of them was Fresh Gold and another one was Marine Delight. The fresh gold was awsum and containing the gingers which refreshed my test bud every time I took a sip. Marine delight was also good but nothing special. Then we have ordered Dezaje Masluqe which was a new version of Tangri Kebabs and I liked it very much. Now it's time for the main course: We have ordered Tawa Paneer Taka Tin and Murgh Kurchan. It was good but nothing awsum.... Overall I would like to visit again......

I have been to Kaafila 5/6 times and everytime it has been an unique experience. The decor, ambience and overall the food is exceptional. The taste, use of spices, the percentage of grilling the meat is just perfect and you cannot have any better Afghani food in Kolkata than this.
From the drinks menu I tried Fresh Gold which was very unique and I really liked the ginger taste.
From the starters menu, I tried Tandoori Mahi Kebab, Irani Machhi Tikka and Murgh Tikka. Each was very good and holds perfect grilling, nice use of spices and not overdone in any sense.
Then comes the beauty of Kandahari Laham - When the waiter hold the beautiful leggy roasted leg of lamb infront of you with fires burning on top of it and then puts off the fire with a waive of his hand - the grilling smell, exceptional use of spices really puts your taste buds on run. This is a true delight and I love to have this time and again. Be prepared to wait a little for this beauty as they will take their own time to prepare it and present it to you. But rest assured, your wait will be compensated.
From the side dishes I tried Lababdar Reshmi, Tehari Murgh and Rogani Gosht. All were very good.
I also had Gosht Sikandari Biryani which was not very exceptional - the biryani is dry and not a very juicy affair. They don't use potato and there is no sign of the Kolkata Biryani here.
The Khandani Naan is very good and must be tried. A very large naan which can be shared by 3/4 people full of dry fruits.
In desserts, Boulawnee was good.
Kaafila have been a very good experience and would love to be back here again. Thank You.

Very good ambience and interiors. The staffs were also very good. Went there to have lunch but had to cut it short to only starters as was getting late for a movie. Had dezaje mosluqe which was 4 big chicken leg pieces. It was medium spicy and tasted quite well. Also had Mahi motiyaan, which was bhetki fish cut into small pieces and prepared. The preparation was good but had a bit of smell in it, was basically undercooked. Else it was a good experience.

The food "Awesome Saala!!!"... Irani Macchi Tikka and Registaani Lal Gosht my favourites, and if its your friend who is paying the bills then go for "Kandahari Laham". 
The ambience, the interiors with kerosene lamps hanging from the roofs, guns and hookahs adorning the walls and the shelves, the background middle-east music (all Harmonic Minor scale stuffs) just makes you drool over and mould you into the theme. 
The only thing missing is a "belly-dancer" and the view of the sand-dunes out of the windows!

I will have to thank my friend soumyadeep for taking us to kaafila today otherwise i wouldn't have got to try one the best north indian food in kolkata. This place is an absolute gem. 4 of us went there at around 1.30 in the aftrnoon. The inside was beautifully decorated..simple yet elegant. This place is quite spacious inside.
Now we order murgh tikka, murgh makhmali sikanj and murgh sunehri kebab for our starters.. Its was excellent ..each and evry one of them. I will highly recommend ppl to try the sunehri kebab. 
Then in the main course we ordered khandaani naan and murgh lababdar.. ( another i would recommnd is to try this naan..it was beyond excellent) . The lababdar was nothing special. We ended our feast with boulawne , a dessert made of rich dry fruits and ice cream..it was rich in taste.
The price fr all this came around 2500 fr 4ppl.. Depending on the amount we ate it was very reasonable.
I'm coming back again.that's for sure!

An excellent restaurant with great decor and food quality. Ambience and food quality wise superb. We arranged a corporate party in Kaafila with foreign guests. We took them to this restaurant on a previous occasion. They requested specifically to arrange the dinner again in Kaafila. 

On multiple visit i came to realize that the best dish they serve is kandahari laham. Try that only if you have a big team. Price wise costly but the food quality, service and ambience make up for that. 

Finally couldn't afford much pics. We were busy gobbling up.

If you're a North Indian /Mughlai cuisine lover, just come to this place!! Immediately! Because trust me, this place is going to seduce your taste buds like no other restaurant in Kolkata. For North Indian cuisine, I used to consider the Karim's restaurant in Delhi as a shrine and after today this place is also a shrine for my gut. My senior doctor had advised me to go to the place in last February and after eating here, I have to admit that I should have visited the place earlier. Since it is located in block B of salt lake city centre kolkata, finding this restaurant won't be much of a problem for you. After entering, you'll love the decor. Big enough to accommodate about 30 +customers at any given time but it will be better if you book a table for two before coming. The waiters helped us to choose the best dishes. We ordered Murgh tikka, murgh sunehre kebaab, fish taka-tin for starters, Lababdar Reshmi and Khandani naan for main course and Boulawnee and firni for desserts. Each item was served within 10mints. You'll love them. You must try the Khandani naan. Order a coke and have it with the main course items mentioned, I think you'll be surprised with the taste of the coke. ;) Cost us 2600 rupees which we happily paid. No negative points at all. I'll definitely visit this one in future whenever I'm near City centre.

Another wonderful dinner today. Khandani naan rocks, reminded me of fall colours. Awesome taste
Appetisers and main course were outstanding as it is in Kaafila

A memorable dinner. Each dish cooked to perfection be it the kababs, the naans or the main course dishes.
Non veg platter is awesome, it is a big portion and heavy. 
Naans and kulchas were undoubtedly one of the best.
Saffron chicken is done so well (It is quite an effort to eat the regular chicken gravy at home next time after Kaafila)

The decor especially the bigger tables at the right side of the restaurant are very catchy. I want to target those the next time ;-)

Portions are heavy and large so order keeping this in mind.
We had packed the surplus food and relived the Kaafila experience :)

Can't wait to dine here again!
Khandani naan will be a must do the next time.

But that is not to discourage you... the quality of the food served is worth the pinch!
 Talk about kababs and name the biryanis.. mention the curries and ask for the rotis.. 👍
Satisfaction is guaranteed!
Ambience is just perfect for a meal with family or friends...

Went to Kaafila after a long time and found it's still holding it's charm. This is my favorite place for Mughlai cuisine. We ordered Ghost sekua, Sunehere chicken, Nawabi Jalpari and Chicken kalmi as starters with our drinks. All of these 4 items were unique in taste and very soft. In main course we ordered Lasuni naan and Spl yellow dal. Both were nice. Even the sweet paan offered at the exit was also very tasty. The ambiance was charming as always giving a real feel of Afgan interiors. The service is also apt and well mannered. Overall a very satisfactory experience.

Kaafila has become my favorite restaurant in town. Yes, its pocket pinching but the ambience, the service , the food..its all magic and worth every penny!
I went with my colleagues for a team dinner and the service was absolutely flawless. We'd booked the table over phone and even though we were a little late, our table was ready. We ordered some prawns (Nawabi Jalpari), mutton (Tandoori gosht ke sekua) and obviously, chicken (Murgh sunehre kebab and Murgh ke hari kalmi). Trust me, all the above mentioned delicacies were finger licking good. Highly recommend Tandoori gosht ke sekua and Murgh ke hari kalmi! If only I had an extra stomach.. We were so full after hogging on our starters that we ordered almost no main course. I've always ordered the Chef's Special Yellow Dal here and it doesn't get any better than that.
The drinks menu is a overpriced (OVEEERRPRICED)! And hence the -0.5. Nowhere in Kolkata have I had to pay Rs.450 for a large peg of scotch. So, if you plan on drinking here, make sure you increase the credit limit on your credit card before coming.
All in all, big up to the staff and management! Keep it up and make us fat! 🙏

In cc1, this is my favorite joint for afghani food. The dishes are mouthwatering and the variety in the menu leaves me confused for at least 10 mins before ordering. The ambience oa thematic with a NWFP feel with the caravans and chadowas. Great food, great ambience and loads of variety to chose from. What else do you need in a restaurant.

If you are in or around City Centre 1 and are looking for a fine dining place, Kaafila is your answer! Mouth watering food! I guess I was simply hogging on the food there. Very hungry as I was, Kaafila made my day. Friendly staff always helps you with the overall experience. And then you have the themed interiors, another plus. The carpets, the guns - the overall look makes you inquisitive and you simply keep looking around. Garlic naan- one thing which I am generally disappointed with in Kolkata tasted fantastic. Dal and paneer - tasty. Cannot think of anything to complain about. A must go place!

Had been craving for some NWFP kinda food and the man of the house suggested this. Now, I usually don't give much thought to restaurants that are housed in shopping malls and hence had really low expectations. 
But the decor and ambience simply blew us away!  The food was awesome and the prompt and courteous service was an icing on the cake which was already very sweet.  Loved the Afghani Murgh Tikka and the Rarha Gosht cooked in whole spices is specially recommended.

A wonderful place for fine dining located at city center 1, Block B. After listening much praises about this place from a friend we finally went to have lunch here. As it was almost 3 o' clock the place was crowded and almost full so we were offered with a very uncomfortable seat just at the entrance. But once i complaint the waiter about the sitting arrangements, within 5-10 minutes he managed us a much better seat with a bigger table. I was instantly happy with service and stuff's behavior.
The place is beautifully decorated with afghan theme and ambiance was great. Lets come to the food. We started with Irani macchi tikka, bekti kebab cooked with yogurt and cashew. the kebabs were too good. mouth melting and heavenly in taste. Then for the main course we ordered suhere murgh,murgh sufiyani,and a maska naan. The murgh sufiyani, chicken biryani cooked in afghan style. It tasted good but was a bit spicy. I didn't like this much as I only love biryani in Kolkata style. Naan was good and the gravy in suhere murgh was awesome. We had Kesaria Firni in dessert which was also fantastic.
Overall a memorable and unique experience. Only con is a bit expensive.

One of those places where everything's just about perfect. The ambience, the food, the staff and a really well-stocked bar. I've been coming to this place for some time now and I just love this place. The moment you walk in the ambience is a real welcome, with walls adorned with queer antiques, including some old guns. They have some really good cocktails and mocktails as well. The good thing is they have their own array of cocktails which vary slightly from the original recipe, and the result is usually brilliant. You'll also find Bailey's Irish Cream on the menu, hard to find at many other places.
Coming to the food, the wide range of Kebabs and tandoor is sure to put you in a fix as to what to order. The few I've tried so far were awesome. My personal favourites - Tandoori Gosht ke Sekua, the meat is absolutely heavenly with a very distinct flavour and cooked just right. On the main course - Gosht Khada Masala - Succulent pieces of mutton cooked  in a spicy coriander gravy, it goes really well with their Khandani Naan. All their mutton preparations, I've tried so far has been divine. The chicken is good too, but the mutton preparations really steal the show. The staff are really polite and service is excellent. And this is one of those few places in the city, where the quality and service remains absolutely the same even during the peak time of Durga Pujas. All in all this is an absolute delight if you are looking for North Indian or Mughlai Cuisine.

An Afghan restaurant  that serves North Indian cuisine, nestled in the city’s most popular Shopping Malls the City Center 1, is a popular dine-in façade for food buffs and families and corporates. Low light, lanterns hanging from the walls, old rifles, wooden floors and smoky smell from the kitchen is a perfect Afghan setting you can expect for. The restaurant offers an interesting ambiance – to reflect on the Afghan tribes, times and tents!  A 4/5 for Starters as well. You can settle down for their famous Biryani’s – Murgh Sufyani, Gosht Sikandari or Subz Handi. All Biryani’s are served with Raita. For side dish, the Rogani Gosht or Murg Sufiyani Pasanda does a brilliant job. Soft succulent pieces of mutton that will melt in your mouth served hot – just cannot go any better. Highly recommended if you’re in City Center.

Kaafila will leave you with a lingering taste of authentic Mughal cuisine that will keep bringing you back for more. A spacious and themed decor, a host of savory mocktails and a well stocked bar complement the chef's skills perfectly... making this joint a gem for food lovers of all stripes.
While not pocket friendly, it's definitely worth the expense.
My personal favorites: Khandani Naan with Gosht Khada Masala.

If you haven't been here before then do go & visit & do try the kababs. Am sure you'll not regret! @moumita saha

We visited very early that evening. Not much hungry so ordered biriyani and kabab. To my utmost surprise, the biriyani was something that I never had before. It was melting in mouth and the typical scent of biriyani was replaced by the nice smell of desi ghee which also made me feel good.Yummy food and good decors.

We paid a visit here today. Had a very warm welcome.I liked the ambience very much. We chose to order Kandhari Laham and Tandoori Maahi Kebab.I loved Kandhari Laham which is a preparation of whole mutton leg in yogurt and olive oil.It was also server in very interesting way. Maahi kebab was okayish... Then we opted for Tehari Murg, basmati rice with dumchicken,mutton keema,egg and aloo. I liked this dish also.Then we had an awesome dessert, Boulawani, Afgan dessert made of dry fruits with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream.. Overall very pleasant experience.. And one more good thing they've given corporate discount also..

Thanks to Oudh 1590 that we decided to go to Kafila instead of waiting for 30 mins. Frankly speaking Kafila gave a heavenly delights to my tastebuds after a long time. People who loves North Indian dishes should go once there.
 I had ordered only three items and they were simply superb. Fish makhmali was worth his name, pure Kolkata bhetki in such exotic flavour that I literally licked my fingers. This is the second visit and it's memorable. 

I will give two thumbs up. People try once.

Kandahari Laham is always delicious!!! I have been to Kaafila a few times, but never during the festive season. They had a special menu for durga puja. We tried noorani macchi, which was delicate but a had a light fishy smell. However the taste was delicate and beautiful. The Laham, though a starter can easily be eaten with roti and we had it with butter naan, which was soft and perfect! We also tried mutton biryani, again spot on! But being accustomed to Calcutta biriyani, we were missing the potato. We also tried lasooni naan, again very good and mutton khade masale, which was also yumm! Kaafila makes you happy.

A North Indian/Mughal themed restaurant with perfectly cooked meat.

Starting from the floor work to the walls, artefact models are put up meticulously to bring out the feel of a Mughal dining hall.

Speciality - Kandahari Laham (Whole leg of a mutton roasted with spices, can serve 3-5 people as a starter)

Food - 4/5 We were 3 and ordered a Kandahari Laham, Gosht Khada Masala and Maska Naans. Being a lover of red meat, I always prefer mutton, beef or at least lamb at most places. The Kandahari Lamb was brought in by the waiter with fire all around the serving plate (snap attached). It was a pretty heavy starter for 3 people and I was half full. The spices and the meat was well roasted and chopped for easy consumption. The Khada Masala Gosht was cooked to perfection and the meat was falling off the bones. Spices had seeped in which showed that it was marinated very well. 

Sitting and Ambience - 4/5 Spacious and comfortable

Service - 4/5 Fast and Responsive even on a Nabami night

Value for Money - 3/5 This place fits right in between premium and value for money restaurants. Better quality and good cooking can balance out the money you pay. We paid 1200 for the Kandahari Laham and 1200 for the rest. Had 3 full tummies by the end.

After reading so many positive reviews decided to pay a visit to the coveted kaafila on a Puja evening. I solicited kaafila a lot while deciding the dining place amongst a large list of option from my friends (4people total), and finally managed to Pin down the dining option to kaafila for their famous raan preparation "kandahari lahm". On arrival we were given a waiting time of 1.5hrs, however table was allotted within an hour! The whole menu was not on offer due to Puja. Few selected items were put on offer which luckily included the kandahari lahm. It was the costliest item on the menu (rs 1200/–) but its soft &succulent peices serves around 4-5 people. Supposedly they serve a whole mutton raan, and U r given an option of having the whole thing on table and serve yourself with knives and fork or they show you the whole thing and do the rest for you. On suggestion from the waiter we ordered 2 garlic naans with the raan. After waiting for 20 minutes, the dish arrived on a huge plate with fire lighted on sides, definitely was a visual treat. The plate was never kept on our table though We had a large table. We could see the fleshless raan on the plate and around the same was the small cubed mutton pieces with a lot of salad dressings. Waiter served the around 50gms of mutton cubes and 100gms of onions on each of our 4 plates. First dissatisfaction from not being served on the table. Coming to the taste, it was just another keema type shredded mutton preparation with a smoky touch, but was not at all soft as expected. The mutton pieces never seemed to be from the raan. And the quantity was never sufficient for more than 2-3 person max. We decided to complain about the hard and under prepared mutton pieces. The waiter told us they have stopped serving the raan on table, but was prompt to send some senior waiter to attend us. He took a sample from our plate and took to the chef, and said the chef agreed it was hard so we shall be served a replacement. That made us happy. What arrived after 5mins was a small plate with a  very small quantity of mutton cubes on it which was a tad softer than last preparation, but nothing near to what we were told or expected.Hopeless on getting anything better we decided to try their mutton biryani (Rs 400 for 2ppl) which came out to be pretty mediocre.2 Garlic naan were ordered which were supposed to come in 3x2 i.e. 6pcs, came in only 4pcs. Again on complaint they got us the remaining pieces. Garlic naan priced at Rs90 was tasty though. Brought my friends to this place with a lot of high expectations, but were leaving dissatisfied. My message to the management is, I understand this is Puja time and you are serving a larger crowd, but what you should understand is when you are charging your customer the same price for dishes, you are indirectly assuring your customers the best of your services, plz keep your repute in mind and don't serve the dishes that you cannot properly deliver.

I must say this is a awesome place for all the Kebab Lovers.

I went there twice. First was on my B'Day.
My friends went there with my B'Day cake and when I was supposed to cut the cake, Kaafila played a beautiful B'Day song for me and that made me special on that special day.

You must try the Kebab Platter which includes various Chicken, Mutton and Fish Kebabs. Kebabs was really mouth watering. One platter is enough for two. I must say whatever you order here, they serve a very good quantity (which you can rarely find in town). 

Then we ordered main course. Butter Nun and Kabuli Tandoori Murgh. I am a Butter Nun lover and this was the best Nun I have ever had. It was so crispy outside, yet soft inside. Last but not the least, they serve Paan at the exit. 

Overall it was a good experience.

Secondly I went there on the Durga Puja eve 2015 with family. The restaurant was full and luckily got a seat. For Puja rush they offered a small menu with selective items. 

I ordered Murgh Malai Tikka, Butter Nun, Jeera Chawal and Gosht Khada Masala.

On this festive season they maintained their food quality and quantity very well.  Murgh Malai Tikka (6 pieces) was really larger than the regular size and no need to mention the taste.

Courteous staff members. 

I would recommend my friends to visit this place so that they too can treat their taste buds with such great Mughlai food.

Visited Kaafila about a month ago while puja shopping was on in full swing at City Centre 1. The place is nicely decked like an Afghan food joint with the waiters aptly dressed in turbans and sherwanis.
The food 🍴 also was pretty nice...the kebabs and the rotis tasted yummy. Some of the names in the menu card were not familiar but the person waiting on us was quite informative.
All in all, it was quite a nice experience.

Heard about Kaafila from a lot of people, so when one of my friends had to give me a treat, I suggested this place. The place is a afghan theme restaurant with nice decorations and sufi music playing. We went with murgh malai kebab which was a favourite of this place for starters. It was not out of the world and the texture of the meat was too well done instead of the juicy meat I was expecting. A thumbs down there for all the hype.
Main course we went with the house special of khandaani naan and reghistani gosht. The meat was very good with big pieces of mutton and spicy gravy. The khandaani naan is by far the biggest naan I have seen and one is enought to feed two people (if not three). The naan had cherries, carrots and nuts on top which made it so tasty, you can have it just as is. 
After that we did not have place for desert.  Maincourse made up for the starter though. Will visit again maybe to try something else. Overall decent for the amount of money you pay.  3.5/5 overall.

Its a good place to bump it with your friends and family. Good ambience and resonable food. Price seems a bit high with respect to the quality, but if you are shopping in CC2 and you are hungry then it can be a good choice.

Visited kaafila with lots of expectations. But i was dissappointed totally. The quality was not upto the "KAAFILA" quality. It was not better than any roadside dhaba. Service, ambience , was good but quality was a disaster. Tried kandahari lamb..... it was the worst. I hope in future I will experience a much more better KAAFILA quality.

The ambience and decor is pretty nice. There is a little problem with space though. The food though is amazing . We ordered the kandahari laham which is the whole leg of a lamb and amazingly delicious. You need atleast 4 people to finish it and if you still have space for more food ask them for their special biriyani. Have fun. ;)

The ambience is nice placed at the city center 1, 3rd floor...... well be patience as they serve the food lately..... but when the food comes it will literally put water in your mouth. We ordered for non veg platter,  cheese onion nun, keema nun, chicken briyani, one spicy chicken preparation and prawn kabab.... Each one just have it's own taste and just melts in your mouth..... A place which just toped in my chart

Went to Kaafila for a office dinner party. The food was amazing!!! We had chicken tandoori kabab,mutton seekh kabab,pomphret kabab,bhetki fish kabab and of course the speciality : raan kabab,for starters. Raan kabab was awesome. The pomphret kabab was a little raw,so did not like it much.the chicken tandoor was mouth watering,and the mutton seekh kabab was so soft,it almost melted in the mouth. After all the starters,I was too full,couldn't enjoy the main course. Had a bit of butter naan and chicken kabab masala, both were very delicious. The cost of food is a little steep,but the amazing food and the "kaafila" ambience made it worth every penny :)

Kaafila is an entirely different world inside City Centre. This theme based restaurant has attractive afghan/persian interiors with rugged carpet hangings, vintage showpieces/ replicas & swords. Decent spacing is maintained in the layout providing adequate privacy to the guests.
About the food. I love the clear & thin 'murgh dhanya shorba' (soup) to start with. 'Iranian macchi (fish) kebab' was perfect for starter! When in a group of 4-5 adults, I prefer this heavy dish, 'Tehari Murg' rich in chicken & minced mutton mixed with spice and rice. The Afghani mutton dish 'Kid-nu Ghost' with our choice of Naan & Khulcha was good as well!

This is really a very nice restaurant to take your friends or family members visiting the city, as the restaurant is in the famous City Centre mall.
Though the overall experience was good, deducting 0.5 for the pocket pinch!

I enjoy eating here. The decor is quirky yet welcoming. The service is prompt and courteous. The palak paneer is a hit or miss. The piece de resistance has to be the sikaandari raan and lasuni naan. 

It is absolutely orgasmic in case you are a hardcore meat lover.

This place was so much overhyped after experiencing the foods over there, I realized. The place is in the city centre 1 and to find the place I found it quite tricky. The interior wise they tried to give a look of the Arabian Sea boats and matching lightings are used. But I hate it when I see discrepancies in services just because a larger group is occupying the center table and all other waiters are pretty interested in serving them almost overlooking the other tables.
I wondered when I ordered a fish kebab and they served five pieces and after with lot of hesitancy I asked as I have seen in the menu that it should be of six pieces and then another waiter brought one left piece of the same. I felt awkwardly pissed off. The biriyani is no where matching with the price by quantity or quality, even our roadside dhabas serve better biriyani than this. The shorba costed around 200 per bowl which actually not even overpriced but also unimaginable. Everything in the menu was too costly and tastewise either very ordinary or pathetic.
Not sure why this joint is so popular whether for their 10% off on corporate bills or may be nearby no such good restaurants are there but one thing is for sure... Kaafila is not so special about Arabian food but the speciality is you can meet the Arabian decoits....after paying off the bill you will realize.

I keep on coming back to this place for the mouthwatering kebab platter on offer here. The ambience has its spark too . My personal favourite is the Kakori kebab. Its minced meat with spices cooked to tenderness and perfection. Pardon me for bragging , but these were the best things I had in a long time. The kalmi kebabs and the biriyanis were also decent . A little on the higher side pricewise if I compare the portions. Nevertheless ,  I am going back soon for the kebabs. Slurp!!

The moment you walk through the doors of Kaafila you are simply taken aback by the interiors. Awesome is an oft used word but have to use it again for the decor.....SIMPLY AWESOME. The feel is that of an Afghan village and the staff are all dressed in the traditional Pathan suit to add to the decor. Coming to the food.....we ordered for Nawabi Jalpari, Kandahari Laham as starters and Registani Lal Gosht, Murgh Sufiyani Pasanda, Murgh Sufiyani for the main course. We had also ordered Pink Panther , Marine delight and Blue Heaven as refreshers. Nawabi Jalpari was basically Prawn kebabs...succulent and soft. The highlight of the day....Kandahari Laham, which was whole mutton legs cooked in a tandoor.....this was a dish which not only was great to taste but the presentation of the dish was unique. It was served on a platter over a burning flame to keep it piping hot. The main course dishes all had their unique bits. Murgh Sufiyani (Biriyani) had a very different taste along with a very different Raita . The staff managed the orders well in spite of the swelling crowd.
The pocket pinch is a bit too high considering the entire experience...the management would do well to pay attention.
Go to City Centre 1...and do pay Kaafila a visit. If you are a group of 4-5, do order a Kandahari Laham...you will be utterly pleased.

And decided to give this afghani outlet a try

To start off, the traditional afghan decor caught me off guard and blew me away. The ambience was cosy and the staff were really cordial

The starters are the man of the match as every little piece was delicately handled and were made with care. We went for Galouti Kebab, Murgh Sunehre Kebab, Irani Macchi Tikka. The galouti was one of its kind, really amazing and brilliant in its own way. Just absolute bliss.

For the mains, we had Khandani Naan, Cheese Kulcha and Lachcha Paratha with Gosht Khada Masala, Murgh Sufiyani Pasanda and Dal Pakhtooni: with the khandaani naan being the icing on the top.

We ended with the kesaria firni, which alone would make me go back and visit againt 

Nevertheless you could very well feel the class in everything they prepared

The moment you enter Kaafila, its decor will strike you. The interiors are brilliantly done in a very passionate Kabuli or Afghani style.
Definitely to complement with the exclusive decor, they serve lip smacking food.
Kandahari Laham is my all time favourite at Kaafila. The biriyani is always brilliantly cooked, the tenderness of the mutton always amazes me.
Those who have an adventurous tongue you may try the Chicken cooked with tomato. It is worth the money you pay for the dish.
Wish alcohol costed a little less here.

Kaafila has a rustic and a mughal feeling to it. The decor is beautiful, although the restaurant seems to be a bit congested. The starter for was a bit bland, but the main course and the drinks compensated it. The Subz Biryani was simply a delight, a must try for all the vegetarians. Overall a good experience, look forward to visit it again.

If zomato can bring us a section called brilliant biriyanis, then for places like these a section should be named as Shaan-e-Mughal.
The ambience was perfect. The decoration was very nicely done with vintage showpieces and rugged carpets. In a nutshell it was absolutely superb.
Coming to the food, we ordered actually a quite a lot of things. To start with we ordered a dish of kandhari lamh , irani machhi tikka, followed by lasooni nan and kabuli murg tikka. We also had boulawney as dessert.
Kandhari lamh, a signature dish is basically a boneless mutton sizzler. Although it did pinch a big hole in the pocket,but was definitely worth a try. The mutton was cooked with slight ghee base and spices. The mutton will literally melt in your mouth.  Irani fish tikka is a perfectly cooked fish in a smoky flavour. An absolute brilliant piece of dish.
I am specially addicted to garlic dishes and so lasooni nan was an obvious choice. Toasted with butter and garlic , the nan was very good in taste. The special mention is the dessert which is halwa of dry fruits topped with a vanilla ice cream. The fruits are almost smashed and the flavour of the ghee will fill all of the five senses. Please do not count the calorie intake while having this.
It will also be my pleasure to visit again

It's an honour to write a review for kaafila. It has always been one of the best restaurants in my city for mughal cuisine. 
I went to kaafila with obe of my friend during aug 2015, and the food left us just speechless.

We ordered hari moti ki pilaf (peas pulao), irani macchi tikka (fish kebab) and handi jaituni laham (mutton in white gravy). Wonderfully prepared and awesome taste.

Best wishes to team kaafila, keep it up.

I had lunch today with my friends at this amazing place. We enjoyed all the dishes that were served to us, especially Khandani naan. Although it looks like Indian pizza it is actually delicious to taste. Among the starters we loved Lababdar Reshmi. I loved the gingerly taste of Fresh Gold. However, we found the biriyani to be very plain in taste. But that was compensated by the tasty Boulawnee and Kesaria Firni.

I have visited Kaafila many times, though this is the first time that I am writing something about it. It is one of those places that serve you delicious dishes the way you want them. I was there where I was meeting some very old friends and called for a reunion. 
We ordered Kandahari Laham of course, along with some Chicken and Fish kebabs. We had the Black Dogs, Old Monks and occasional beers to accompany us as well. The kebabs were well saute'd while they were soft at the same time. I think Kandahari Laham is too good a mutton starter any day here and it tasted exceptionally good.
Every body who has been to Kaafila would acknowledge the Tehari Murgh. You just can't leave the restaurant without having this. One plate can easily serve 4-5 people. It was speechless and absolutely sensational in taste. 
We ended our treat with Phirni which was well served again. Friends, booze and some really well cooked dishes to satisfy the gastronomic lust. Cheers to this place and I will definitely come back again.

Taken biriyani in main course which is not at par compare to any good biriyani point. Though side dish like macchi taka-tin and murgh kurchan are well cooked and well flavoured. Also, as always, I find fresh gold, ginger base soda refreshing.

Another place for exclusive tastes. Your taste buds are used to sensing a certain set set of flavours and so, when a new sensation is produced by an exclusive taste, you can't really predict whether you will like it or not. Such is this place.
This logic holds for this place in exactly the same way as Oudh in Desapriya Park. Without hurting anyone's sentiments, I would highly recommend this place to you if you eat out a lot and have tried all kinds of dishes a number of times, so much so that you are in desperate need of tasting something new. Otherwise, you will not realize the uniqueness of the taste of the food here, and Kaafila will be reduced to any other Indian restaurant.
The decor is fabulous though the entrance is gloomy and not well maintained. It is in City Centre and you can always bring guests along with you. Keep in mind that the quantity of each dish is quite large and you must always ask the waiter before placing your order. I recommend the following ---
# Kakori Kebab
# Nawabi Jalpari (but the prawns aren't too big)
# Murgh ki hari kalmi (this is the usual hariyali kebab, but very succulent)

This was our second visit to the place and the experience was unexpectedly very cold. The reception was poor and despite of the sparse footfall at that moment, the waiters appeared to be unseemingly agitated and very restless.

The ambience though, was unchanged and was maintained quite nicely. But the food was not upto the kaafila benchmark. The biriyani did not taste good at all and the other dishes too seemed to have lost their flavour. The fish appeared to be stale and emitted a pungent odour.

It made me wonder whether it was just me; but as it turned out, my entire group felt the same way about the meal. On top of that, if the pricing be considered, I would say it was a total disaster. As for the rating, I will bring it down by 2.5 notches.

After shopping at City Centre, my friend and I needed to eat somewhere and so I suggested Kaafila to her, having been there twice previously. 

The restaurant theme is Mughlai and North Indian, and the decor matches the cuisines being served, with wooden panels, lanterns and Persian carpets, adorning the walls. The servers are also dresses in a similar fashion. All in all, the ambience makes you feel that you have been transported out of Kolkata for the meal. 

The server assigned to our table was helpful and for appetizers we ordered Tandoori Angar and Tandoori Hari Gobhi. The food arrived in time, and being a cauliflower lover, I instantly fell in love with the perfectly marinated cauliflower florets, not overdone and having a smoky flavor. 

Tandoori Angar was supposed to consist of marinated and grilled baby potatoes, mushrooms and babycorn with capsicum and tomatoes. However, we weren't served any mushrooms and it is only when we bothered to ask, were we told that they were out of mushrooms and had instead given us extra potatoes. Really? Potatoes instead of mushrooms? Is that how much you value vegetarians? The potatoes and babycorn, no doubt, tasted good, but it would be appreciated if from next time,  if at the time of placing the order, the server informs the diners of what may not be available.

Since it was just two of us and we were quite full with the starters, we decided to go for the Dal Pakhtooni and Subz Handi Biryani. The Dal was delicious and lined generously with ghee. The Biryani was accompanied with a plain raita. While the Biryani was, no doubt, well done, it was different from what we had expected. It was based more on the Kolkata style of Biryani, while we expected more Mughlai and Afghani flavors, given Kaafila's theme. 
 
The cheque arrived soon after the finger bowls.  It was around 1400 for the two appetizers, biriyani and the dal, which is a tad expensive for the quantity being served. However, the quality of food makes up for that. :)

So, the ratings for Kaafila would be as follows: 

AMBIENCE: 4/5

FOOD: 3.5/5

SERVICE: 3/5

VALUE FOR MONEY: 3.5/5

Whenever I am craving for having good north indian food .. The only place that I wanna go is Kaafila..
This place has a charm of it own and the food is amazing..
I have lost count as to how many times I have visited this place..
Their Paneer Tikka is beyond perfect.. you have to try it to believe it 😍
I would give it a 5 out of 5 !

This used to be one of my favourite places for north Indian food but my last visit left me disappointed in their service and hospitality dept. Their vague waiter told me that I would have to wait for 45 mins for a table but in 5 mins when my husband came in  and there was a table available.  That means without even checking that waiter told me there was no table . Food wise everything was  ok but they need serious training in the service department.

One my favourite restaurants in Kolkata...been there 3-4 times and each time their quality, service and ambience have surpassed my expectations. There are plenty of good restaurants around but a small subset of those leaves a mark...kaafila belongs to that rarefied group and I am so glad it is my neighborhood !

I do not want to waste space by putting up a list of items that I have ordered so far (usually I order kababs as starter, nan, a mutton/chicken dish, biryani and firni)...the important aspect is that whatever I have ordered have satisfied me to the fullest. On top of that, the courtesy and friendliness of the staff, the afghani decor (guns, hanging lanterns etc) immediately transports you to a roadside dhaba of kabul or kandahar adjacent to the moonlit afghan wilderness. That's the great thing about this place. Keep up the great work Kaafila and all the very best !!

I have been to this place 2-3 times. One thing you can be sure is that you will be gastronomically delighted before you come out. They also have pan at the exit door. This kind of small detail of the restaurant make it a great experience. The servers are quite knowledgeable about the dishes. You can ask them for suggestions and they will gladly comply. The ambience is very good. The decor and specially the wall paintings look great. There is even a collection of guns on display on the wall. Fake maybe. 

I first went to this place the Kandhari Laham. Its a whole lower leg of a baby goat made on tandoor and served like a sizzler on flame. This is also the costliest dish on their menu at around 1200 bucks and rightfully so. If you are a meat lover, you will be delighted. 

Apart from this I always bank on 2 mutton dishes of theirs. One being the Registanu Lal Gosht. Its a semi spicy mutton red curry dish. The pieces and the tenderness almost attain perfection. One can surely tell they use very good quality meat for their mutton dishes.
The other one is a all time fav of mine and my family as well. The Handi Jaytuni Laham is another mutton masterpiece. Perfect if you don't prefer spicy. Its a curdy white dish and the mutton is as always perfectly cooked. Its hard to justify curry dishes at 550 bucks each but their cooking takes the challenge.  Both the curries goes great with tandoori roti.

The restaurant clearly focuses on quality and fine service. You can be assured of a great dining experience either with friends or family.  Keep up the great work. Wish I was more in Kolkata.

The decor is amazing and at par with the theme. The kebabs are mesmerising. We ordered the non veg platter, kakori kebabs, mutton biriyani and keema shehzaade! I loved each and every item! The kakori kebab was the top contender for me. Also the waiters are really attentive and always keen to help. Last but not least I loved the paan that is served at the reception. Overall it was a very good experience and I will definitely go back to try out the other dishes.

Visited first time during evening. You will have to wait for 20-30 mins if not reserved in advance. Ambience was OK but bit crowdy. Ordered Tehari Murg and its a superb item. Couldn't eat whole because it was meant for four person. I would request to please consider half order as well for two persons. Service was good. Hope to return back.

1st review:
Afghani murg ke kalmi as starter,tehari murg as main and bolwanee as dessert make a deadly combination for me and my frnd yesterday.awesome decor but service is a bit slow.
P.S. the menu in zomato needs to be changed coz the kebab section is atmost rs20 steeper in the original than what is shown here.

This is one of the best Afghani restaurants in Kolkata. I visited twice or thrice, and every time l order Tehari Murgh without any second thought. They serve quality kebabs in Afghani style. Attendants wear pathan suit, that's another USP of this place. Ambience will take you to the Dhabas of Afghanistan. Murgh ki hari kalmi, that's hariyali kebab...it was awesome. Non veg platter consists of 4-5 items including pomphret fish, note it down Bengalis. Kaafila was Kaafi impressive.

Kaafila enjoys a tremendous reputation and not without reason :) Its colorful and smoky interiors evoke an atmosphere in keeping with its name. The assorted barbecue platter Tandoori Angaar was smashing. The succulent mushrooms were the highlight. Dum Aloo was expectedly spicy and tangy and did not disappoint. My companions really loved the meat dishes as well. This is fairly good VFM.  A very satisfying lunch indeed.

Next to south Indian food, continental and mughal are my favorite menu to go for a feast. Continental I can find in many places but I am trying to find a good mughal restaurant for quiet a long time. So when I searched for any good mughal restaurant I found the Kaafila with a 4+ rating. I was so tempted to visit Kaafila and give a try to the mughal biriyani. Lucky am at it was also located in the city center and very much walkable from my hotel. So one fine day we stepped in for dinner. 

Ambiance:
Once you enter you really feel life you're in a village near Kabul. It doesnt give you a feel of a top class restaurant with luxury sofas and furnitures. But that is what makes the difference. The decor, lighting and the people dressed up all makes it a kind of themed restaurant. I would give 4/5 for the interior. 
Food: 
We ordered one grill chicken and a plate of seekh kebab for starter. Then we ordered one chicken biriyani and a handi mushroom veg biriyani as main course. On top of it I ordered a cranberry juice and one mocktail. The seekh kebab was so good and delicious. And the biriyani... Chanceless.. The one I was searching for all these days, is here.. It was perfect in all aspects like spice, taste, aroma and everything. Now I understood why Kaafila was rated 4+ in zomato.

 I really want to step in once again for that biriyani before I leave Kolkata.

A most popular restaurant within Salt Lake and is highly acclaimed and praised by critics for their delicacies. The decor of this place is quite good and the ambiance inside is also classy when compared to standard restaurants elsewhere.

I wanted to try the Khandani Nan and the person taking my order suggested I should take Murgh Sufiyani Pasinda upon upon querying about a dish with a rich gravy. For the starters, I opted for Tandoori Angar. The Potato Tandoor was pretty well made and had a nice stuff of baby corn and mushroom and was unlike any other Tandoori Aloo I have tried elsewhere. The Khandani Nan was sweet as they should be like any Kabuli Nan but became very hard within a short time. I would not say they were the best as I have had better quality Nans right at City Centre - I in a different restaurants but they weren't bad either.

The disappointment of the day was the Chicken Dish I was suggested. The side dish was good in itself but was no complement for the sweet nuns. With two items being sweet in their own taste, I found it very hard to enjoy my meal as I would have wanted them to be.

The final bill came somewhere around 1000 but may not have been a total rip-off judging the ambiance, decor and the quality of food they serve. A little bit lenient on pricing would have made this restaurant reach to a wider public. Overall a good place and worth recommending to others.

EDIT: Made a couple of more visits to this restaurants. All for take-away's, none dine-in. So can't really comment on the service and ambiance. It looked good though from outside. The waiters are always on their feet and I have hardly seen anyone sitting inside the restaurant with a grimm face. Coming to the food, if not exceptionally good, it surely surpasses the likes of other restaurants located in Salt Lake. Their method of cooking is appreciable and the food does exotic. Only issue is the steep prices which needs to be cut down a bit. 

Had tried Irani Machchi Tikka, Afghani Murgh ke Kalmi (Twice), Murgh Tikka, Ghost Khada Masala and Kid-nu-Ghost! The Machchi Tikka was okayish type. Not something extraordinary which I have had expected. It was a bit on the hard-ish side implicating it wasn't probably cooked inside the tandoor. Was slightly undersalted. Afghani Murgh ke Kalmi tasted fantastic when I tried this for the first time. Perfect blend of cream and cheese, those 4 big pieces could be a delight to any gastronomical freak. The second time however was a disappointment. Less amount of cheese, rather negligible and insignificant. Was also undersalted the second time. Just like this one, the Mugh Tikka was equally big in size. The quantity these people serve surely justify the size. However, it was again a bit on the hardish side. I am a bit unsure why do the Chefs do not give enough attention to these Kababs and marinate them properly to make them softer. A single bad dish spoils the entire reputation of the restaurant. A mistake can happen twice but not on a repeated basis.

Coming to the main course, Ghost Khada Masala needs no introduction. A pure delight to the taste buds, I have hardly tasted such wonderful gravy apart from a Chicken Dish at the now-closed Copper Chimney. The wonderful spices creates such a magical flavor in the mouth that it will surely leave a long-lasting impression. Coming to Kid-Nu-Ghost, I was unable to find the difference between this one and Khada Masala. Both the gravies tasted comparatively similar. However, if I were to choose, I would go for Khada Masala on any given day. The Kid-Nu-Ghost had 4 small baby potatoes along with the soft and succulent mutton pieces. Unfortunately, the potatoes were neither salted nor marinated.

If you are looking for the perfect accompaniment to both these main courses, simply close your eyes and blindly go for Khandani Naan. Be careful though, one single Naan is enough to feed two people. So, do not make the mistake of ordering more unnecessarily. 

I would urge the management to kindly focus on the issues which I have mentioned above. Since the price range asked here is relatively high, even if one of the items does not fulfill your expectation, it surely hurts your pocket. 

@ Fellow foodies: The next time you are in Salt Lake, do drop in here. Am sure, you won't be disappointed. :-)

Now when it comes to PURE indian food there are few places left in Kolkata other than Dhabas which serve really good and mouth watering food. This happens to be just the place to go to.

Starting from the décor to the seating to the service and finally the food this place is spot on. Done up like a old indian house feel with painting and wall painting and chairs with a indian feel to it. The décor is in place but not so much that it overwhelms you. Just enough that you enjoy the same.

Coming to the food we ordered we ordered a veg platter of kebabs to start with. It had 2 pieces of different kebabs put together and for 4 people it was more than enough to be enjoyed so that it does not over fill your stomach. A special mention to the paneer tikka that was so soft and well marinated that we landed by calling for a separate plate for more. It is a must try there. After which the food was a delight. From the dal makhani to the paneer kurchan to the chana and the methi matter makkai, the food will leave you hogging like a maniac cause you cant get enough of it. The rotis are always so freah and hot when they serve on the table that you have to wait a minute for it to cool down to start with. A special mention again to the crispy tanddori roti and the masala kulcha which were made to perfection. 

Over all this place is a little expensive but for the things they serve and the way they serve it I think this place is worth ever buck that you spend. It is a must visit and I really enjoy myself whenever I go there.

The mutton. Oh yes, can't get over the taste and its tenderness. 
Well, a mutton dish ranges from Rs.  400 - 530, but one plate should be reasonably sufficient for 3 naans (two persons that is?) 
The service! I am a miser who doesn't like to tip much. But even I was more than glad to tip them well (Let's ignore the fact that the mommy paid the bill). Courteous, efficient and responding at one click! 
Just one chotta sa complaint. They took a little too long to serve our order. So, if you are in a hurry or badly hungry like I was, ummm, just give it a thought may be. 
It has cozy two seaters in the corners for the romantics out there and they ask you to visit again with a nicely made paan. 
Trust me, you would love to be back! :)

Went to kaafila on a saturday night with 16 of my office colleagues. The decor was simple but interesting. Had heard a lot about their kebabs and ordered kandahari laham (marinated whole mutton leg) on chef's recomendation. We were quite excited to see the fire from the side of the dish as the waiter brought us the mutton leg. (May be a major turn offs for vegetarians on the table). The dish was delicious. I also remember the light chicken shorba which live up to my expectations. The other kebabs were ok, dont remember anything outstanding. Overall food was good.
But the real disappointment was the below average service. We had only one person serving 16 of us. We had nobody taking our order for long time. The waiter kept running here there between taking our orders. The restuarant should really look seriously upgrading their standard of service especially during rush hour.
I think you can try the place during weekdays where you can enjoy the food and not suffer the services.

There are no words. There are no doubts. Everything here is good and amazing. Decor, style, people, staff, food, ambiance, service and what not. All is super fine. Who said that it serves only the best non-veg. I would say it serves vegetarian equally well.

Amazing people who serve us. They made every possible arrangement for our kid and us. This is the second time I had visited this place and it wowed me yet again. The kulchas, the rotis. everything was simply great and I am really not getting words to move ahead in this review. In the end the small gundi pans...they took my heart away. What more do you want.

Must go and highly recommended by me. Full marks and hats off.

It will look bit pricy at first but surely it will give u worthy taste for the dishes. We have ordered Thehari murg which costs 1195. But trust me it is enough for three people having good appetite and  just delicious. Please visit at least once in this place.

On my first visit to this place i loved it.... Trust I wasn't hungry at all but seeing the food I gobbled all the food. I ordered daal makhani (my favorite), methi matar makai, garlic naan and firni. The food taste and quality was outstanding..... And the quantity was sufficient..... The price is not too low not too high but reasonable.... Overall very satisfied......

Went to this place with my girlies for dinner. The pure Afghani decor was brilliant with hanging rugs and carpets. The starters were brilliant. We had ordered for kandhari lamh( which is kaafila's signature dish) and irani machhi tikka ( fish kebab never tasted better). The kandhari lamh comes in a plate with fire, this arrangement itself is a visual treat. Also one plate was enough for five of us and it tasted yummy with slight ghee flavour. For main course,we had lasooni nan and kabuli murg tikka. The nans were soft and tasty. The kabuli murg tikka was delicious. As dessert we had boulawney. It is basically vanilla icecream on top of dry fruits halwa. It was very heavy and sweet. -0.5 for their slow service

If you are a Kebab lover, you cannot miss this place. The moment you enter, you are transported to the land of the Afghans. Right from the guns on display and pseudo tents to the themed outfit of the staff. We ordered a Black Mamba, one of their innovative cocktails which was served with peanuts. For the food, we had Afghani Kebab, some Afghani chicken, stuffed kulchas and Raita. The quantity is pretty good. We topped off our dinner with Firni which goes without saying, was absolutely yum.
What I loved most: the staff was extremely well behaved 
What could have been better: The music..they should play something to set the mood with the theme. Sufi music would be awesome.

It was a mesmerizing experience... the decor, the music, the food, everything was at par (if not exceeded) with my expectations. The food was delicious... the quantity was a lot. However, it is priced a bit on the higher side. But that doesn't mean you can afford to give it a miss.

A good restaurant for afghani and irani food.They tried to make it a theme restaurant,but I think it is a very weak try.Food is good,quantity adequate.But the service is horrible.In my case they forgot to complete my order,have waited for long then asked for bill.

An awesome place for gluttons.
A little expensive though, but worth every penny spent.And while placing your order,always listen to what they have to offer.
The menu is precise, but non descriptive so you have to keep guessing!
The ambience and services are amazing as well.

Checked into kaafila for my anniversary dinner, good decision after all. Both of us came out with utter satisfaction that "yes, that is what is great food with great taste". Service is nice and ambience was beautiful..dim lights with slow music playing, very pleasant to mood. Not only the nonveg but also the veg was deliciously cooked and served. Great place with great food and service 👌

I had first visited this place on 2009, when it was among the few restaurants in the city to serve Afghan food. It was how I had expected, specially the chicken legs which seemed to have a Pathani style of their own by sheer size. The was a bit rich than what afghans prefer ( Indians have a fetish for more spice and chillies specially the sahi masalas). Over all it was quite good and I would recommend everybody to try it out.

Well... The first thing i thought after entering this restaurant was why i hadnt visited this food corner earlier. The decorum and ambience try to provide with a feel of Afghan culture...the soft instrumentals playing in the background deserve a thumbs up. Also there are regally decorated corners for group hangouts... The Non veg platter is awesome, apart from kebabs they give nicely cooked fresh fish which is admirable. Kabuli Tandoori Murgh was delicious too... Kaafila now is definitely on my list for a few more expensive visits...

Definitely the go to place for Afghani cuisine. The interiors , decor and music transfer you to the heart of the afghan mainland. The non veg platter followed by the kabuli murgh are my favourites. Although on the expensive side, this place should certainly be on every foodie's hit list.

First the interior which is nice. Total afgan theme, I liked the place very much. Only thing place  is little small. Next food. Food was not excellent but good.
starter : 
Bhutte ki nazakat and veg kabab were not upto expectation but the paneer in starter was excellent. 

 Some of the must haves for vegetarians are : 
1.  Haryal paneer makhani , this is a specialty of kaafila and its jsut awesome. We also ordered sabz lahori korma( did not like it) , Kaafila ki dal , and chole dhaiya masala. 

The Khandani naan is a must. It tastes more like kulcha without the inner filling. In dessert Balownee is a must have. All the foods are sufficient for 4 people per dish. So be aware while ordering.

I have been wanting to visit this place for long time but had to wait for many years and finally I was able to dine here with my close friends.It's well decorated having a kind of Afghani look and even the foods are mostly Afghani and kasmiri. It was really hard for us to place order because we were hardly able to understand such names of starters and side dishes. Food was really tasty but I would say it was a bit costly.You can easily get the same food at lower prices in other restaurants. You can always give a try !!!

I had gone to this place for dinner and the ratings were nicely justified. Tucked up on the 3rd floor in B block of CC1, Kaafila serves some really tasteful kebabs and more.

Ambiance:
The place was quite full on a weekend. We were 6 people and had to wait for quite a while but it isn't much of a problem since you have the whole mall to yourself for killing time. The decor is very raw and earthy. A very unique place! The door lock is huge like that of a palace's and the the roof is done up so well that I couldn't help but look up from time to time. Different patterns in different places! Some swords and guns welcome you to this restaurant. The seating is huge. There are comfortable couches and independent tables and chairs. The flooring is again very raw. It has a village feel to it. Overall, the ambiance is quite good.

Food:
A very compact menu yet it has so many options! The tandoori maahi kebab has soft chucks of well-cooked fish with a portion of salad. Very light yet very tasty. The murgh malai tikka has pretty big pieces of tender chicken with a portion of salad. Nicely cooked in tandoor, it does give a hint of malai. The mahi motiyan is absolutely delicious! Spiced up tiny pieces of fish is served which taste the best with their green chutney. 

The kid-nu-gosht was not as interesting as its name. It tastes just about okay with a thick spicy and oily gravy. However the mutton was delicious. It was well cooked and was very tender. To go with he spicy gravy there's good ol' tandoori roti. The mutton biryani is a must try! You can totally taste the spices but it is very light. An ideal pick for those who don't like rich food. 

To sip on the side, their fresh lime soda is good.

Service:
The staff is very nice and polite. There was a glitch at the end with which the manager dealt with nicely. The prices are slightly on the higher side but perfect for a fine dining experience. Another visit? Definitely.

My love for north indian cuisines have made me visit this place lots of times, especially with a college in sector five, I have had many meals here. It's been a while that I have visited this place, but my experience has always been pleasant, the decor and interior is rather unusual with spacious seating area, and beautiful lights only adds grandeur to this place. Perfect for a romantic date with it's rather eye pleasing mood lighting. Last time when I was there, we ordered murg malai kebab ( simply melts in the mouth ).For main course their Irani macchi tikka, and the prawn dish ( something jalpari ) were delicious.

The tandoori gosht is nice too, and the cheese nun is something of a speciality, very soft and delicately prepared.
Their service is fast and efficient but when there's a large crowd things do go a little haywire.Come here if you want to gorge on some good kebabs and delicious nuns and basically want to have a good time. When it comes to good food, the options in salt lake are a little limited, located it city centre one, this place is a must try for all north indian food lovers, it's really very good. Give this a try, you won't be disappointed.

Have been to this place 2 times only although it is situated at city centre 1 which is very close to my place. The decor of the place is nice and has a very Mughal rustic feel. With cabana type of sitting arrangements and old riffles and armory and copper utensils. Their speciality is there kebabs which r excellent. I didn't like the main course dishes that much I mean u get such tasty food in Dhaba and other North Indian restaurants too, but the kebabs were really . 
So I will suggest one to go have order loads of kebabs and some cooler and enjoy.

One of our colleague wanted to treat us and the venue of choice was unanimously decided as Kaafila as most of us were craving for some good Kababs.  We had an awesome evening and were served some really delicious food. the taste of kandahari laham still lingers and I will be visiting Kaafila soon for it. Price is marginally high but the tasty food will force you to leave some tips. The ambience adds to the taste and makes you feel you are having the tandoors at the right geographical location.

Went for some meat eating with my wife on a weekend. The decor and the guns remind of North West Frontier of old India. Though the food price is slightly on the higher side, the tandoors and the kebab s were quite brilliant. Enjoyed the evening and the service was very nice and hospitable. Definitely recommend this place.

Despite yesterday's adverse weather condition decided to visit one of the most 'recommended' restaurants in modern Kolkata. Tried 'Kandahari Laham' and our expectations were sky high. The dish could not fulfill a minimum bit of our expectations. The meat was dry and hard so one has to chew it several time to make sure it digests. In a famous restaurant like this we should expect right quality of food every time. The man who served our food was very helpful and stuffs were polite in nature.I am not sure if I can take this memory with me when I leave my Kolkata.

Kaafila is my old time favourite. I have been there numerous times. And every time this place has pleased me with its evergreen charm. To day i went there with my better half for a quick lunch. I ordered murg malai kabab, tandoori mahi kabab, cheese naan. Everything was too nice. As for beverages Shirley temple & lychee delight were not so good but peach pina colada was pretty delicious. And pineapple raita was good. And at last we get a surprise "paan". Overall very good experience. Their plus points are their interiors, decoration, ambience, music, tandoors, kebabs. You can also try their kandahari raan, irani machhi tikka and nawabi jalpari. So, u can surely go for a eating here and try to have enough time to cherish the food. Highly recommended.

Casual dining place with good food! Must try the tandoor items - chicken tikka, lamb, paneer tikka, grilled cauliflower etc.

The dal makhani and biryani is yummy too!

Cool place to hang out with friends and family.

Can work on making more space.

I found the place a bit congested though!!

I went there with today evening my wife. Ambience is excellent. Staff behaviour was very good. We ordered a non veg kabab platter . Believe me its huge in terms of quantity. Its enough for both of us . Nothing else were required .

But the bad thing is the taste . Pomfret kabab smells to be rotten . Other kababs  were good but not very good especially if you compare those with Shiraz & Arsalan . This is the aspect where they have to improve a lot.

Today, we visited Kaafila after a long time, and was thoroughly satisfied, again. 

Service : We tried to reserve us a table by calling in, at around 11:00 AM on Sunday; although the restaurant opens at 12:30 PM (as per the official hours), they did receive the call, and promptly made the reservation, as requested. A table was duly reserved and set aside at 1:30 PM, when we reached. The ambiance of the restaurant is unique, and the staff is extremely efficient, and cordial. Our host took the time to explain the details of every dish we requested for, and even suggested a few good ones. Overall, the service at the place is great.

Starters and Drink : We ordered the signature Non-Veg Kebab Platter, containing Chicken, Mutton and Fish preparations of varying type and flavor. The tandoori chicken and the betki preparation were decent, but nothing exceptional. The mutton bara, and the chicken haryali and seekh kebabs were extraordinary. The surprise element, however, was the pomfret preparation, which was truly unique. We did not try any alcoholic beverage, but went for a ginger-based mocktail, which was recommended by the host, and turned out to be quite refreshing.

Main Course : Please do not miss out on Kid-nu-Gosth if you are this place! This is one of the best mutton preparations that I've ever come across in the restaurants of Kolkata. We coupled it with an amazing veg raita, and some simple bread items -- naan and kulchaa. Simply put, it was heavenly!

Cons : Chicken tandoori in the non-veg platter were nothing out of ordinary, and was a bit dry.

Looking forward to my next visit at this place! Thank you Kaafila for a great lunch.

If you wish to have food in Afghani style, then this is the place which you should try out. Maska naan along with lababdar tandoori murgh accompanied with beer is all we had and the indoor is decorated in afghani style. The waiters are well behaved and a nice place to have dinner at city centre.

After a lot of feedbacks and all the talks going round the city that Kaafila serves the best Biryani in town, I must say I was DISSAPOINTED ......... The Biryani lacked the essence. It kind of felt something was missing. Arsalan I think is still up there to be the best, but unfortunately, Kaafila has a long way to go. Apart from that all other dishes which we ordered ranging from Sunhere Paneer, Sunhere chicken, lababdar chicken, all were very good not exceptional. We also went for the chicken platter, veg seek kebabs at the start which were also very good. Hopefully next time I visit there would be a new menu to offer and a better Biryani to taste. Fingers crossed

I would first start off commending the staff who made my little son very happy. He loves broccoli kebab and we hadn't ordered any vegetarian platter. However hearing him asking us for his favourite veggie, they got him one specially made for him on the house. This little gesture made us feel happy and the fact that the people are paying attention to things which would make our experience a better one.

Coming to the food, I found that the kababs are done perfectly. We had ordered a non veg platter which comprised of fish, mutton and chicken. I would have rated the place 5 if they would just throw in some prawn kababs. 
On the main course, there is nothing to complain, the rice and rotis are done nicely. The curries are not overly spiced and are made with a nice balance. 
They don't take reservations on the weekends and hence you need to wait if you reach the place late.

A back to back choice of a cuisine regionally closely placed, there are bound to be comparisons. This place was there on my list, more so cause I had heard a lot about it. It is okay. We were there for lunch on a weekday afternoon. The decor is really good, it looks like a Afghaan caravan, done well. The restaurant seems to be divided into different rooms, well decorated. The ambiance is good, privacy is catered to.

Coming to the food, it was okay. I guess, the menu is in the process of being changed, the menu lacked description for the dishes. As am not too fond of this kind of cuisine, it did not much appeal to me. The food was served hot. Murg Malai tikka was so so, rather the Aloo patiala tasted better, but the Murg aur dhaniya shorba was not at all up to the mark. It tasted like potato stock with the chicken thrown in. But then, the murg tehari needs a mention. It was good. A happy deviation from the usual biriyani. Its a rice dish with a lot of meat and chicken. Aromatic with spices and a lot of potato, it was really high on the calorie count, and it was heavy, one portion can easily fill up six people. The Jaytuni laham was a different taste from the usual mutton preparation, mutton cooked in white gravy is rare. Overall, the food experience was okay.

The restaurant scores well on the ambiance and decor front. It's quite spacious, the staff is courteous but they still can work on the hospitality and be more prompt. I realize that in every review I need the staff to be prompt, something might just be wrong with me. Anyways overall it was a decent experience. We did not try any of the desserts, an ice cream from the kiosks down below seemed a better option. The Kaafila menu did not provide many options either. I may visit again, but then the pocket pinch did not much seem worth at the end. Happy eating!!

PS: The loo needs some attention, if the management is listening.

The ambience is very nice. Our favourite out there is the Veg platter. They give about 4-5 items in that and the portion is pretty large. It includes items like Tandoori Aaloo, Paneer Tikka, Seekh Kebab, Cauliflower.
For the beverage, you might like to try the Ginger Ale. 
Overall, we're pretty satisfied with the place  and never mind revisiting it! :)

This is one of the most unique restaurants I've ever visited and the theme, as a pure Afghan cuisine, is very apparent at every step. The kebabs here are one of the best that I've tasted, they are amazing, we ordered the non veg platter, which comes with 12 pieces of kebabs, including mutton, fish, and chicken, and their varieties,hardly a few were identical to one another. Then we opted for the lamb leg, something that we found pretty unique, *forgot the exact name, but is in the list just below the kebab platters and is priced at 11** excluding taxes on the menu card*. The waiters and guards were all dressed up in sherwani, afghan style. The flooring is a very natural wood finish, which looks more natural than most you've probably got to see till date. The ambience of the place is pretty good. We were offered afghan paans in the end for free, which tastes somewhat different from normal paan. Their firni is amazing, a must try, I'd say. If you're looking for an afghan cuisine, this is probably the best place to go in kolkata. About the pricing, three adults meal without any real meal but only kebabs which are amazing, including taxes were around 3000 rupees.

Excited to meet up with my friends, I rushed to City Centre..we decided to try Kaafila as it is listed under fine dining restaurants.

The ambience is good..the service is good..I happened to get a chance to visit their kitchen which was absolutely clean..the food is hygienic..the staff is well dressed in clean attires. 

We ordered dal makhani, mixed vegetable, masala kulcha and garlic nan..all items were good..worth a visit.

Afghani food is not very rare in Kolkata. But kaafila stands out. The kebabs are one of the best in the city. Very different to the barbeque nations of the world. Do try there lamb leg roast in Afghan style. 
The staff is friendly, ambience is themed over Afghanistan. Highly recommended if you're in City Center.

I have been there thrice or more and each time with a big gang. Whenever you enter immediately you feel you are in an Afghanistan war camp. The ambience and decoration make you feel so. Service guys are also dressed up as traditional afghans. Wide variety of delicacies are served. It is probably the place that can be called 'Heaven for Kebab-lovers'! Lots of kebabs with super fine quality. A bit costly but justified by the quality that is served. The meats just melt in the mouth leaving an everlasting impression of perfectly proportional marinade cooked with extreme expertise. Taste and flavour at its best. Apart from kebabs, other dishes also maintain the same excellent quality. Kaafila is undoubtedly topping in the list of the restaurants that serves similar cuisine.

Entering into the place you are welcomed with a lamp lit ligthing. Not with the name the interiors feel like a typical Punjabi restaurant. Do try the mutton raan dishes. We had Mutton Kandaharai laham a whole mutton leg preparation and it's just exquisite and mutton sekua to go with.

I packed Sunehre Paneer and Pindhi Chana last night. Sunhere Panheer / Paneer Butter Masala, popular vegetarian curry, is available in both red curry (tomato based) and yellow curry (less spicy). Paneer had a perfect combination of spiciness and creaminess (yellow gravy base), absolutely fabulous. And, Pindhi Chana was served hot and well cooked. Also, on quantity aspect single servings is optimum for three persons with moderate appetite.

The place looks good to me and has a natural feel to it. Being in here would take you to different place when it comes to experience. The ambiance is warm and different from any other in the area.

One would simply like the quality of food they serve and the service is quite impressive. The prices however care on the higher side and one can expect to spend around 1500-1800 for a proper meal for two.

The bad thing is that the problem with bed bugs showing up and saying hi. It sounds strange but it's true that you might get the discomfort of being constantly bitten. That's enough to spoil someone's expression, at least mine. That's the biggest problem with this place for stopping me from visiting again.

Visited this place last week on Saturday, surprised to find place. The place is quite nice, the interiors and the ambience is good. I would recommend to try the starters platter which is very good and also in the quantity is good enough for 6 people. The main course is good though not great. Khandani naan is a must have, very similar to Kabuli naan but it contains portions enough for the people. Overall it's a nice place to spend an evening

Heard a lot about this place but not a place for a person who is not into meat and biryanis!!! The decor is nice and does take you to afghans!!! Me being a non meat eater I quite liked the place as I dig into the rice of the biryani!!! But you must have the Firni it stood out!!! The service is also good... The place good be more spaced out and bigger!!

This is perhaps the best place to eat within City Centre if you love Mughlai cuisine. The ambiance is super! Once you step inside you will feel you are in the middle-easts and the waiters become the local inhabitants to welcome and serve you.Being a very popular place, it's generally crowded. So make prior reservations to avoid the long waiting list.

Their menu and the cuisine are perfect match with the ambiance. I haven't tried many here, but still would recommend few of my favorites - Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Reshmi Lababdar, Rogani Gosht, Chicken Malai Tikka, Irani Macchi Tikka and of course Firni in the desserts. Their service is as good as the food. The cost is on the higher side, but worth it for the food, ambiance, service everything.

** Kaafila Revisited ** 14/03/15

This time our main target of tastehunt was 'Kandahari Laham', which is actually a tandoori raan. Honestly, we were disappointed! It was good, but not enough to be a must try! Also I feel the portion of food is ok for 3 people as a starter. Taste wise it is way too much costly! This time we also had Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Lababdar, Biriyani didn't seem to be as good as previous, also the portion of meat was less. Chicken lababdar was great as always, so as the firni as desserts.

Updating my rating to 3.5!!!

A very sensibly decorated restaurant to give you a feel of Baluchistan. Very warm staff members would welcome you and make you comfortable in the waiting area even if the restaurant is fully occupied. Has adequate varieties of liquor. Serves awesome vegetarian food as well. Overall I have had very nice experience whenever had been here. They even offer you good corporate discount. Always ask for it, they just check your corporate identity card and adds some extra happiness to your dining experience.

This place was always my favourite But it wasn't in my list today .I thought of going balle balle dhaba but it was packed n full so then decided on going to kaafila as the food here is yummy . So finally we entered here. I loved the ambience of this restaurant. We were damn hungry so we straight away jumped to main course,ordered chicken lababdaar and butter nans. Chicken labaabdaar was superb ,gravy was quiet rich ...red gravy n pieces were quiet sufficiently big n good and butter nans were soft n buttery...yummmmmmy ..service was also good overall a good experience. Bill was around 687 which was ok nt too much.@disha rohra

Been there today to celebrate valentines day. It was full, had to wait 20-25 minutes. But it was totally worth it. Awsome food, great ambiance and quick service makes it a complete package. Tried Afghani Murgh Ke Kalmi, Tandoori gosht ke sekua for starters.  Both were brilliant. The mutton was very soft. Then had Keema shehzaade and Keema Nun. These were also very tasty.
Overall though the price was on higher side but still a definite recommendation.

Food was good, service was also fine but we had to queue up for around 30 minutes to get a table for five! But the good thing was you could roam about in the mall for the long wait time. All in all a good experience!

The food on the menu card is all enticing and all inviting , and lives upto all expectations, once you start exploring the flavours which soothe your tastebuds. Do give this place a visit, and keep returning for tje awesome food.

After trying a lot of Chinese, North Indian restaurants me and my friends thought of giving our stomach a bit different taste and so we thought of trying the Mughlai cuisine and "Kaafila" is one of the place that comes into mind when we think of Mughlai. It was the day of Saraswati puja and after getting tired of seeing beautiful girls wearing sarees we thought of visiting Kaafila to get rid of the tiredness. The place was not crowded and so we got a nice seat of our choice very easily. As we were 3 in number so we couldn't try their special Kandahari Lahm(because it is recommended for 4/5 ppl) but instead we ordered the following dishes-

Starters- Kakori Kebab(Hmm very soft mutton kebabs just loved it)
Murgh Malai Kebab( Again loved it!!)
Main Course-
Maska Nan
Gosht Khada Masala(Very soft mutton pieces and very tasty)
Hariyali Paneer Makhani(Their special as mentioned in Zomato and yes really it was special)

The prices were a bit high but the food quality was too good.
So overall our Saraswati Puja lunch was awesome and we loved our first time experience in Kaafila looking forward to visiting it again in near future.

One of the best restaurants in City Centre Salt Lake. This Afghan-themed restaurant is an all-time favourite. The signature dish is the Ilaichi Raan. A whole mutton leg, charcoal-grilled with care, this one can be had with Naans and Rotis. Do not miss the Kashmiri Naan that comes with cherries and nuts.

We ordered one plate for tehari murg...its basically a platter and enough for 2 or 3people...and whole bhetki...the tehari murg was great but the fish wasn't boneless and so we had problem while eating it...
Otherwise this is a great place...they have some unique preparations...and the ambience is wonderful as well

A definite favourite for me and my family and friends in Cal.Have been going to the place ever since they opened shutters .Infact we were here for lunch the very same day they opened and have loved it since.
Ambience is completely in keeping with the name.The carpets,muskets,add to the feel of being in a bedouin tent.Love the pictures they have on the walls along with the way they have made the place so that it appears to be sculpted out of sand or mud.
Service is slow irrespective of it being empty or crowded.The servers are attentive and warm.
Food is the star here definitely.I cannot have the veg kebab platter enough times along with their yellow dal and garlic naan.Drinks like the khus mocktail really quench a parched throat in the summer months.Have eaten almost everything on the menu over the years and have loved almost all of it.

This was a Zomato find as we were new to Kolkata and were staying at Salt Lake City. It exceeded expectations as we were two vegetarians who landed in an Afghan restaurant. It was fantastic, though it was near closing time, the staff members were gracious and food was delicious. The tasteful interiors manage to mask the space constraint. The stuffed cheese naan, paneer starter and dal were delightful. The authentic afghan dessert was also tasty.

When it comes to eating out I expect something extra apart from scrumptious food. Food is the biggest weakness but there are places which like to tantalize your taste buds with their mouth watering food items. Such is Kafila which serves always extra on its platter. The place is comforting, as eating is supposed to be done in peaceful atmosphere. On the menu what catches my attention is the name or titles of the food items. When it comes to the ordering food items I get confused as there are so many good appetizing foods. Noorani machi which is a bhetki fish preparation with cashew gravy is something to drool over.  The fish smitten with gravy is yummy. I normally order sabzi pilaf which goes fantastic with murgh sufiyana pasanda. The shredded chicken is completely heavenly these are the few times when I like to go beyond the typical traditional homemade ‘mangser jhol’. Sometimes I relish their methi murgh zafrani, or murg dhaniwal korma; the chicken laced with masaladar gravy is enough to make us all drool over instantly. Any veg curry is a treat for me; hence I love their mausaum ke sabzi, a preparation with seasonal vegetables cooked in thick gravy. Lastly or sometimes I can only try their Kesaria firni, a desert to come down my sweets cravings.

I have been to this place countless number of times, for years, and their quality has remained constant throughout! My entire family loves this place. Firstly  the decor is very authentic and different. It's quite amazing. The food is really good, have tried most dishes, and no complaints yet. In starters, the sheekh kebabs, both veg and non veg are great. Their biriyani is absolutely amazing, with unique flavours. But the standout dish is the Kandahari Laham. It is made to perfection. The waiters are really nice and helpful here too! It is on the pricier side, but the quality of the food is too good to complain. Must visit place.

The Kolkata restaurants, bars and food parlours are not merely caters to the food enthusiasts they are now experimenting with foods of all kinds and all sections of the world; ethnic, Mediterranean, sub continent, such a restaurant cum bar is Kaafila whose delicacies are appetizing keeping up the flavour and taste intact perfectly. Banjara Machchi is a pomfret is preparation and as I love pomfret I often order this dish and enjoy relishing it. Irani Machchi Tikka, fish fillet marinated in ginger-garlic, mixed wi8th cashew paste, fresh cream and cheese and then grilled in tandoor. Veg sheek kebab is also my favourite. How can I forget Tehari murgh or methi murgh zafrani or shahzani kofta, all these are excellent as all the masalas go with the meat very well. A person like me can’t do without rice so I order jeera chawal with that I prefer tandoori angar or barburi aloo patiala. I have recently tried raita and I loved it also with raita roasted papad or green salad is suitable. There are also bread and nun items which I have not tried yet. Lastly dessert kesaria firni is apt to finish the whole meal.

Kaafila is the place to go to for north Indian cuisine..I went here for lunch on 27th December. The warm ambience , the great food , the efficient staff describe kaafila. We were 3 of us,we ordered veg platter for starters and fresh lime soda. Veg biriyani for main course and balauni for deserts. The quantity was so good . one dish can easily serve 4 people. The taste of the food takes u to another level. I recommend this place strongly to everybody..I'll take my guests also to kaafila next time. :) keep up the good work.

This place was a roller-coaster ride overall. The rating is based on the value one receives from the time and money one invests as a customer. 3.5 is what this place is.

This place -- Ok I ll be very categorical while assessing this place. I was here with some friends on a Friday night as an invitee to a party. Its at a secluded corner of the City Centre mall 3rd floor with a concise area.

Ambiance --- Very Classy, I loved what they had done with that small area. Ladies can happily spend all evening clicking selfies and pictures here.

Staff --- Disappointing, they portray as if they are a bunch of slaves enchained and forced to follow their master's orders forever. Zero enthusiasm, they hardly show any interest and have a poker face all the time.

** Starters: They were just OK. Chicken starters were good. Paneer starter, I distinctly remember, was tasteless.

**Main Course Veg: It was very very good (!), just the right amount of spices put to convert a bunch of raw veggies or paneer into a delightful memorable meal.

**Main Course Non-Veg:
- Chicken: Not upto the mark, trust me, I am a chicken fanatic and it dint feel right. Sloppy work in the chicken section of their kitchen I must say.
- Fish: Outright disastrous, I tried Machchi Taka-tin (I kinda memorized this name just to mention it here) . It was a mockery made out of the classic Bhetki.
At this stage I had given up my hope on this place but then we ordered,
-Mutton: One word, Exquisite! I literally repented as to why I even bothered to touch fish and chicken. It was so perfectly cooked, the gravy was smooth. Mutton surely did 'litt up' my mood and saved my evening.

**Desserts: Again OK. And a statutory warning, don't experiment. Stick to vanilla and chocolate and you are good.

Enjoy!

After reading so many positive reviews opted this place for an office party. 
Simply amazed with decor which perfectly creates afghani ambiance. 

Coming to food, we ordered for Murgh Malai Tikka and Kandhari Laham along with fresh lime soda as starters. The presentation of  Kandhari Laham is very interesting. A whole leg of mutton on fire!! The taste was very nice. Murgh Malai Tikka was juicy and very tender, tasted awesome.
For main course we ordered only Teheri Murgh, a biriyani type dish though tastes much  much better than biriyani.  The rice was spicy and the chicken legs were very delicious. 1 of this dish is more then enough for at least 3. 
For dessert we ordered Boulawnee and Phirni. Phirni tasted nice, but this Boulawnee  was a different treat for taste buds. Made with dry fruits served hot with ice cream , a perfect finish for the day.

Though the pocket pinch is high (80 bucks for a glass of fresh lime is just too much!!), the ambiance and food really complement this.

The choice of restaurant for dinner was made by our very well informed friend cum host for the evening. He had considered the type and quality of cuisine apart from the logistics of time and distance. The name 'Kaafila' brought forth visions of a convoy of camels trudging through a desert. As the five of us entered the restaurant on the third floor of Block B, City Centre, Salt Lake, we were ushered into the semi dark interiors of a cavernous space. I blinked to let the eyes adjust, and looked around. The partitions act as screens, gradually introducing one to the many layers of the décor. 

Having reached for an early dinner, we found the place quite empty and chose to sit at one of the best tables. Later, of course, the restaurant filled up and some people even had to wait for a table. The tables are large and the long seats on three sides can accommodate 8-10 people. This place surely encourages large family visits!  

The interiors have been designed in minute detail to recreate an atmosphere reminiscent of life in a tent.  Everyday items like pots and pans, rifles, framed photos in sepia tones displayed on the walls, the tapestries, canvas canopies, kilims, the cosy sitting arrangements, the patiala style dress of the staff and the lanterns used for low lighting, the setup looks good enough for a movie shoot. 

The service staff is pleasant, attentive and helpful. They assisted us in selecting from the starters and we ordered a non-veg platter and a veg seekh kebab. The platter came in a generous serving of fish, chicken and mutton kebabs. These along with the veg seekh was shared by all. Each variant was prepared with a different flavouring, perfectly marinated and grilled and was enjoyed thoroughly. We decided to go for veg and next ordered tandoori rotis with 'khumb sultani' and 'kaafila ki dal'. The fresh tandoori rotis complemented the mushroom dish with a thick gravy and thick flavourful yellow dal preparations quite well. Our dinner drew to a close as we realized that the evening spent in the company of excellent folks and equally enticing food will surely be remembered for long!

My second favourite restaurant after barbeque nation!!! First time visited on insistence of my friends and I was taken aback by the sheer Afghani delicacies that were lip smacking. Kandhari lahm is a must try. The price is more than normal but you get value for money ????. Good for drinkers as well. You have the option of choosing from several kinds of drinks ????. Bottom line is good for people with penchant for outside food.

Paid a visit to this place with two of my friends tonight. The decor is amazing. As soon as you step in, you are greeted by bandhgala donning people which makes you feel like you are in a kabul bistro. The lighting is reddish and the seating is very comfy. Infact I had to let go of my shoes and sit in a yogic posture to enjoy the food. :P The mini cushions add to the charm. The food is nice..nothing fancy but very straight to the point. Only grudge of mine- My friends were ordering non-veg items and I was looking for help from the waiter for a veg starter. He immediately mentioned the ubiquitous panner tikka kabab but I told him that I was too bored of having paneer everytime in every dish. I waned something different. To my utter surprise the waiter retorted "What else is there to eat in Veg other than paneer?" It is truly ridiculous. How can they talk like this to their patrons? I know hundreds of veg dishes that are had in afghanistan itself, but they cannot prepare it. My request to the management, please encourage your staff to help vegetarian people choose their dishes. You just need to come up with a dish name mentioning the ingredients, that's it! The customer will choose the item. If you cannot come up with a name, just show them the menu. You dont need to advise them to have non veg instead of paneer. Anyway I went ahead with Veg sheekh kabab and the guy replied that it would take 20 minutes to bring it. I am well versed with this answer hence I went ahead with the order. And in it came in 12 minutes along with the non veg starters. Why would the waiter discourage a choice? I dont know. Anyway, the mixed vegetable was good. The naan and rotis were burnt on the crusts,at least all of mine were. The biryani was ok and so was the raita (at least they served some :) ) Not much of desserts here so we skipped the most extravagant course of a meal. The bill came down to 2000 INR and the entire experience was ok. Full marks for the decor and theme and fast service of the kitchen and staff. I was about to give a 4 but the worthlessness of the waiter and the burnt naans take away a .5. Ohhh...and how could I forget the PAAN at the exit! It was the best item that I got there. I took two of the deliciious paan. They were melt-in-the-mouth with the right amount of everything in it. But alas! being a vegetarian, I guess I might skip this place the next time.

You walk into Kaafila and you feel like you have been transferred into another world. The ambience is THAT beautiful. The decor lives up to its name, which means envoy or caravan in Urdu. The ceiling is done up like a tent, with stunning  canvas panels and woodwork. There are rifles, various wall hangings, beautiful lanterns, tapestry artwork, shelves with various pots, pans and shishas and photographs on the wall. The lighting adds an elegance to the look and the feel. The interiors have been done up in a way to maximize space and utility, without looking too cramped. 

Kaafila is well known for serving authentic NWFP cuisine, and the food will not disappoint. We did not experiment too much and ordered food we were generally familiar with as it was our first visit: the Kabuli Tandoori Murgh, Gosht Sikandari Biriyani, Chicken tikka masala (I forgot the name), Tandoori roti, and a Pink Panther for me (they wouldn't serve us alcohol as we were underage). The tandoori murgh was very good, but I've had better at lower prices. I absolutely LOVED the biriyani and I thought it was one of the best I've had ever. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it right now. The chicken was tender, marinated and cooked to perfection and the mix of spices in the gravy was absolutely divine. The tandoori rotis were light and fluffy. The Pink Panther was very citrusy and appetizing. 

The staff of Kaafila is courteous and friendly, and service is fantastic. Prices are on the higher side but worth it. I plan on being back soon to taste their delectable kebab preparations. Kaafila is undoubtedly one of THE best restaurants in the city for North Indian food, but also in terms of ambience and service. It's definitely worth a visit and more.

My search for authentic food from the North West Frontier Region, in Kolkata, finally came to an end at Kaafila. For the last six years, I have made several attempts and have returned dissatisfied with the fare served by restaurants masquerading as the flag bearers of NWF cuisine. I chanced upon this restaurant while looking for a place to take my family out for dinner. As advised on this forum, I did make a reservation and was happy that I did so. The occasion was my daughter's birthday on 20 November. Upon entering the place, we were promptly greeted and shown to our table. Even on a Thursday, the place was full with a couple of families awaiting their turn. The decor is warm and friendly with the Afghan motif setting the mood for a sumptuous meal. For starters, we ordered Dejaz-e-Masluque (Chicken Legs marinaded in a rustic spice mix and cooked in tandoor) and Kakori Kababs. I must say that entire family voted in unison for Dejaz-e-Masluque. It was delightfully tender and succulent. The Kakori Kebabs were no match, although they were good. For the main course, we took the suggestion of the waiter and ordered Chicken Methi Malai with Lasooni and Plain Naan, followed by some Jeera Rice. All these dishes were excellent. The chicken pieces were soft and succulent, the Naans had a earthy flavour and the rice was super soft. We did not order any desserts as there was no place left for it. The prices were very reasonable and the overall experience was wonderful. I would definitely recommend people with a discerning taste to try this restaurant. I am already planning my next visit to try out the Peshawari Laham.

A chance meeting with a dear cousin from Silicon Valley in Kolkata was reason enough for the celebration. Though visiting Kolkata from far out end of the world to spend quality time with his elderly parents, I found my cousin quite well versed with the local culinary scenario. Going by the host's choice based on his research, five of us headed to Kaafila, located on the third floor at Block-B of City Centre, Salt Lake. We went in a tad early for dinner and thus had no difficulties in getting accommodated around a spacious table. We found the clients trickling in and soon the restaurant was chock-a-block as the diners had to wait for grabbing an empty table. In order to infuse an authentic Afghani look, the restaurant used upholstery & tapestry with Afghan motifs, displayed several framed photos from everyday Afghan life and showcased a veritable collection of pots & pans from the region. The lighting was just adequate to set the tone for a cosy family rendezvous. 

As starters, we asked for a non-veg platter comprising an assortment of large chicken tangri kebabs, fish tikkas, chicken sheekh kebabs and minced mutton kebabs. We also asked for a plate of veg sheekh kebabs, which came in huge portion. All the roasted preparations lived up to our expectations and satiated us well. As the elderly folks resigned after the starters, three of us ordered 'khumb sultani' (veg dish with lots of mushroom) and 'Kaafila ki dal' (yellow lentils) along with Tandoori rotis. Mushroom was quite well prepared but simple yellow dal tasted excellent almost like its home cooked variant. We retired as happy souls and were delighted by the discovery of Kaafila.

Kaafila is well known for its unique delicacies in Afghani food! The dish which i liked the most is their fiery mutton raan preperation(do not exactly remember the name). One would smell the rich aroma of afghan spices While eating , which would make your taste buds go yumm. Prompt service, perfect ambience, it would make you feel that you are sitting in some local afghan village! 
The price is bit on the higher side which is then again acceptable if you want to have sumptuous food at the end!

Thumbs up to the taste and quality of the dishes I had in kaafila! Biriyani was quite average but I loved the non veg gosht starters as well as Barbari aloo Patiala. The "aloo" dish is my all time favourite. Ambience - quite cozy and likeable too. In short, great place to gorge on Mughlai cuisine.

So,  did you have Kaafila binge yet? 
This place, I guess serves the best Afghani cuisine in town. The taste of the food, the smell of the spices are the things to die for. Three of us went there to try their quite popular non-veg kebab platter. It's a block buster. You get chicken, mutton and fish together in it. Then came the legendary Tehari Murgh.  It's a gem of a dish for the meat mongers. The rice and the chicken is just unforgettable. The quantity is huge. We couldn't finish and had to take the left over as parcel. The next time we had Kandahari Lahm, which has an unprecedented taste. All over if you are ready to take the pinch in your pocket, make sure you visit this place. It was a delight to eat here...

Visited kaafila on 2nd October,Had a pleasant evening with family. Ambiance was nice, service was prompt and frankly their weren't any real hiccups that i could remember. Although i wish eateries like this could ask people to stop flash photographing as its really distracting . As far as food is concerned went with the server's recommendations and it did not disappoint. Price is a bit on the higher side but worth it. Based on this experience, would definitely visit again, in a not so distent future. :)

well to start with, Kafila takes half of your scores with it's amazing mild lit ambience and the precise decor, carpets of different kind in different corners are worth a special mention.


Coming to the platter on offering, honesty I felt too confused what to leave and what to opt for, the elegant mix of spices they add onto each dish will blow you out & you will simply be left out with 'slurp slurp slurp' in mind!!!!
From keema naan to tehri murg, from their handis to kebabs, all will drive your taste buds go crazy.
Though the pricing does a kind of a drill into the pocket but still ....KAAFILA rocks

highly recommended, go for the Tehri murg and the kandahari lahm ( be there in a group of 4 to try these stuff else the quantity will be dominating ...mind it)

Apart from delicious mouth watering cuisines, Kaafila Situated in sector 1, Salt lake Kolkata, has lot in its platter. With fabulous décor and cozy ambience you are sure to enjoy foods of all sorts. The restaurant boasts its food items ranging from tempting side dishes to delicious deserts. Take their bhetki fish cooked with cashew gravy finished with cream which is absolutely gorgeous. And who can resist their dish master creation which marinated fish cooked in tandoor. Prawn is bengalis’ all time favourite and the restaurant has not forgotten that by keeping in the menu headless prawn tossed with hot spices and cooked in cashew paste with a touch of fresh coconut milk. It is simply yummy. Those who drool over paneer here is a dish of marinated Paneer with ginger garlic, crushed peppercorn and cream cooked in tandoor. The restaurant’s kebabs and malai tikka are another attraction to all. And not to forget the irresistible array of soft drinks such as pineapple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice, lime juice all are soothing.

A very authentic place for kebabs black daal and Indian breads. Slightly smaller than the restaurant size it should have had. I mean you wouldn't like to wait for a table in such places. You just can't return disappointed having not got a table. It stays packed and it deserves it. I would like to ask the management : "why don't you open up a branch in South Kolkata?" I am sure you will have a much larger loyal customers added to your existing list. Cheers!

Food is fab, the non-veg platter and kandahari laham and tehari murg being my favorites. Biriyani tastes average, side dishes like sunehre murg and murg lababdar tastes fine. I would suggest to stick to kebabs and laham if you really want to enjoy the food. Service is on the slower side, the servers have a laid back attitude which goes with the ambiance :P

Price is a bit on the higher side but not too high considering the food quality and ambiance. 

Trivia: I really like the paan that they serve as mouth freshener.

If you are a fan of mughlai food and kebabs then this is the best place to be. Undoubtedly one of the best family restaurants in city centre. 
The ambience is decent, nothing extraordinary and the staff is courteous. Since I visit city centre a lot, I have been to this place a number of times and have tried most of their dishes. The biryani is something i have whenever i visit this place. The mutton raan is a must try and is served quite exotically. Another dish which I like vrry much is something called dezaz e masluque (pardon me for the spelling).
Though the price is on a higher side, but the  quality of food is excellent. Must visit for all.

The plaque at the entrance reads 'Zomato : User's Choice'. Not wrong, not wrong.I had come here on Navami, and the queue was pretty long. However, we did have reservations and didn't take us more than 5 minutes to find seats.It does live up to expectations - the Naans are almost perfect, the Jeera Rice was quite light too. There was a Chicken Jhafrani which was delectable, and another yellowish gravy which was pretty damn good. The mocktails had a wee bit more ice in them as was required, but that didn't dampen the taste. Lastly, the firni was sumptuous.The ambiance around here is wonderful with the Middle-East type chairs and some Arabian music playing. Overall, one of the best North Indian joints in the city - and I've been to my share of places, trust me.

For starters- HAPPY DURGA PUJO - to each one of You foodies out there;and for this - no better Place than the very own- City of Joy - Kolkata!
Shashti- big family reunion/ get-together - City Centre the closest being... *With Prior reservations - finally got table. (Worth mentioning this - this one small table was waited for 15mins- coz these three "regulars" - don't wanna call names (Pujo Vibe) but- literally sat there like uses less mannequins until ALL 18 of us bore deadly Stares into their empty tables n faces!)
Really good 'Habibi' style music,Arab an ambience with a really smiling n efficient staff& service.
Food- well 'North Indian in Kolkata' - so really not 'WOW-Out of the World' but Good & Tastyyyyy!
For the lamb lovers- this Tandoor of the entire leg- 'onFire' - was evidently the crowd pleaser for sure! 
The ChickenLababdar - nice yogurt-spiced pale gravy - really delicious 
Paneer was really dairy fresh & soft, yellow dal- boiled well and basic - ALL of these- tasted exponentially better with Lemon & GreenChillies!
*Jeera rice- nayy - as in weird of me saying - but the rice should be perfectly moist (not dripping) with ghee,and should be an Independent dish in itself - so this one was dryer and too cooked with the jeera.
The end touch- meetha Paans kept at the gateway for a sweet & Desi bye.

This place is located in City centre and has an amazing ambience.. this should be your pick if you love kebabs.. They have got a good selection of kebabs both veg and non veg.. Main course is just fine.. Nothing out of the world.. But i would suggest to try the Tehari Murg.. it is Whole chicken with mutton keema and basmati rice and is Heavenly in taste.. just perfect. Service is quite good too.. A nice place to dine in Salt lake area

This is a good place to eat if you like your kebabs. They have made a genuine effort to make sure that the ambience and the food are well matched. I usually stick to eating Kebabs, Dal and Roti's whenever I visit. For non-veg kababs  try the Murgh Malai Tikka , the prawn Nawabi Jalpari (though the size of the prawns has shrunk over the years !!!). For the vegetarian kebabs my picks are the Chatpate Paneer Shehzade and Barburi Aloo Patiala both of which are good.Just combine that with their Dal Pakhtooni (kali dal) and the Cheese or Garlic Naan and it makes for a great meal. If you like Mutton and are a group of 4-5 people a good dish to check out is the Kandahari Laham which is basically a tandoori raan ... good stuff.  We had also ordered the Alu Dum which was nice enough. For beverage tried the "Marine Delight" which was Khus based nice and refreshing but a tad sweet for my taste nothing that a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon would not cure.
Dessert was a bit of a let down my friend ordered a Firni which was not upto the mark in terms of taste. Otherwise overall a fairly enjoyable meal.

Kaafila- the name pretty much describes the place and the ambiance and once you enter you actually experience the same. It has the whole caravan feel. Very new and interesting concept and indeed very well executed. I felt i was in the sets of sholay esp that song "mehbooba", you know where you see this shamiana and guns and the char pai's (the make shift bed cum seating arrangement). The central area is more typically a kaafila but meant for large crowds. If you are just 2-4 people then you will be seated in the normal table and chair area. Anywhichways the ambiance was very arabic and the place was quiet crowded, having a waiting list so reservations are highly recommended.

Now coming to food. We ordered the non veg platter which was humongous and absolutely mouth watering. It had a whole tadoor promfret, chicken wings and kebabs, mutton kebabs and grilled chicked items. The platter was so huge that we could not finish so had to pack it for later. Then we ordered the  the murg malai with keema nans. Personally i felt the murg malai was very heavy but the nans were soft and yumm. Their  dessert options are very limited. The day we visited they only had firni. Bit disappointed on that front but nevertheless their north food was amazing  but Price was on the higher side which i think is expected out of every high end restro. 

Service was average. This particular waiter (this lanky fellow)despite our repeated guideline of serving the food after the drinks kept coming back saying that the food is ready. At one point we were little pissed at his impatient behaviour. It was not that difficult to understand that we want the food served hot after finishing our starters and drinks. But this incompetent waiter seemed out of line. Even the other waiters noticed the same and told him to be patient.

Other than that it was a pleasant evening spent here with good food.

It was time for a family lunch and so this place was chosen. This place in salt lake city centre was unknown to me a few years back but friends of mine suggested it to be quite something. And it surely is. The kabuli tandoori murgh kebab, the murgh sufiyana and the murgh lababdar really did blow us off. The chicken was soft and tender. The gravy was well cooked and was flavoured perfectly. Cost a bit on the higher side. In spite of that, a great place!

‘Kaafila’, an Urdu terminology, stands for ‘a convoy or a group of travelers’. Earlier, people used to travel in big groups in order to escape/face attacks by robbers etc. and such groups wer...e called ‘Kaafilas’.
 
 The diner ‘Kaafila’ is an approximately 50 seater restaurant, with small but cozy reception area, dining area, bar, toilet and kitchen. However, the drinks are only served at the tables.
 
 To stand true to its cause, this diner is designed on the lines of tent pitching stopovers of a ‘Kaafila’. The ceiling is a combination of tent type cloth strips and woodworks. Walls are adorned with ‘laltens’ (lamps), hunters, rifles, small  ‘durries’ (mats) and old photographs of north-west region.  Dining area has few waist length walls, thereby giving it a rustic look. Furniture is wooden. Table tops are multi colored and tiled.
 
 The menu is most suited for ‘sharabi kababi’ diners as it lists a plethora of liquors and ‘tandoori’ style non veg dishes.  Vegetarian folks can also enjoy a full ‘tandoori’ meal with enough options. They also serve a  good collection of mocktails. We ordered Tandoori Angar, Paneer Lababdar, Naan, Masala Kulcha and Papad. Food was expectantly good.
 
 The staff is great in number, well trained, prompt and is clad in ‘pathani’ i.e. shirt like ‘kurta’ teamed with ‘salwaar’.
 
 This is your regular, busy eatery with conceptual and quality décor, expectantly good food and moderately high pricing. Food for two will cost you minimum Rs. 1,000/-.

Your search for food from the north western province better known as afghani cuisine should end here . Just visit this place and you would be amazed by the mouth watering delicacies. From nan to juicy kebabs and from mutton dishes to pulao everything is simply too good to resist. Alongside, the ambience and the hospitality also deserves special mention. Their pricing also does not drill into your pocket too much. A must visit place for every foodie.

KAAFILA - The name plays a very important role for any business ! So this name itself creates a curiousity to have a look whats inside! 
This restaurant has been anytime favourite for me and for my family for any family occasion or a weekend outing. 
The interiors are so well done till each corner. Amazing it is.. brings you to a totally different mood. The afghani theme is brought to its best. The wall hangings, the show pieces and lot more things which you can discover while you are seated and waiting for your food to come..
Now coming to the FOOD.. Its Superb..
We usually have a same order i.e. Chicken tikka - Thats my fav! Amazing
 Dal makhani, kashmiri aloo dum, panner makhanwala, chicken tikka butter masala, masala kulcha and papad
Everything leaves us with no complaint and even the service is prompt and courteous! 

Recommended by me! A must visit..

Kaafila - one of those restaurants about which you will seldom find a negative review. Always a place that I wanted to go but somehow never managed to - untill 1st August 2014 that is. Being an established name, we walk into the restaurant with a presumed rating of 4.5 and review the place on fixed parameters like Location and Ambience, Menu, Quality and Taste, Service and VFM. As we are starting with a high assumed rating, we will only deduct points for any shortcomings to come to our final score.

Location/Ambience
Being in City Centre mall, location is prominent and parking is not an issue. The place is bit small but has cover of 70/80 I would guess. However, they have managed the space well and if you get one of the 3 family enclosures, then its quite nice and cosy with that extra bit of privacy. Lucky us, after a 30 minutes waiting (standard on weekends), we got into one of these "cabanas" and possibly the best one i.e. the one in the middle. The themed decoration is really wonderful and I believe quite well recognised in foodie circles in Kolkata.  No deductions for location and ambience.

Menu
The restaurant is themed on North West Frontier cuisine but has also included some North Indian dishes to offer  good spread. Should not be a problem for anyone unless someone is hellbent on having conti or oriental :)

Quality and Taste
We were in a group of 4 adults and a child and going by reviews, we had ordered for Kandahari Lamb and Teheri Murg with some mocktails to wash the food down. As separate dishes, both were delicious and justified their claim to fame. However, the gravy on Teheri Murg killed the taste of the Lamb dish and this I would put to my bad order. It was like two heavyweights trying to punch out the other to win your taste buds. Probably its better to try simple Biriyani with the Kandahari lamb and on a separate occassion one can try the Teheri Murg with a simple kebab starter. The ingredients including the accompanying veggies and works were fresh (expected from a restaurant with such footfall). The mocktails were fine as per the others (as I did not have one). Expectations about the food were high and there was no reason to complain about the food and so no deductions.
Service
Courteous and just as quick as you can expect given the cuisine. The queue management was efficient and transparent. However just a small point of grudge -  for a premium restaurant one would expect them to have GPRS card terminals that they can bring to the table for the guests to key in the PIN. Was kind of surprised when I was requested to step up to the counter to do this. Given that all Credit and Debit cards are now opting for this security feature, the management should introduce this quickly. A 0.25 deduction for this (and I am being really very miserly here). 

VFM
Its best to remember that Kaafila has been positioned as a premium restaurant. Given that, the cost per head works out to around 700/800. Not exactly the cheapest in class but not over the moon either. No scope for deductions here at least.
So with just the one 0.25 deduction, the score comes down to 4.25 from our initial assumed score of 4.5 - however since Zomato does not allow a 0.25 interval, I would round it off to 4.5 (honestly speaking, 4 would be unfair for the place).

Oh! I love this place. What an interior!! One of the most attractive restaurants in Kolkata. Their service is also good and food is awesome. No complaints at all with whatever we had. We ordered, Murgh Malai Tikka, Paneer Kali Mirch, Gosht Sikandari Biryani, Naan, Masala Kulcha and one Mutton gravy dish (I cannot recollect the name of the dish). All were awesome. Though an expensive restaurant however you will be satisfied with the food and ambience and will remember it for a long time.

1st of all the restaurant is situated at citycentre saltlake which definitely helps to locate it easily.Even if you mess up any person working there will always be at your help. The very 1st thing that strikes is the decoration...the ambiance It might not occupy huge space but its very...very well decorated. We have had ordered ghost biryani. Not only was it pipping hot but the quantity was enormous. It doesn't have a potato or an egg in it which normally every kolkata biryani has, but it compensates by giving 4-5 pieces of lamb which are well cooked and are  of moderate size. We have even ordered chicken side dish ....it was delicious.The chicken was extremely well cooked not dry and was still juicy. They have served the raita as a complementary side dish. The price was definitely on the higher side...but i guess to a lot of extent its worth it.  The quantity for 2 people is huge and can be eaten by one more people accompanying them.so if 4 people goes order for 2. The waiters were courteous and unlike other places they don't gape at people and  at their food. They are never in hurry and allow ample time to eat ...and if possible digest :p We had to pack up some food because of their generous quantity and at the last moment had to order sweet lime soda...even that might be 1.2 ltr per head. its normal to ask for more food but here never dare to because they can kill u simply with their mouthwatering food served in bulked quantities :p Go ahead and have food there! beleive me ...it will not dissapoint you

The decor is what catches the eye and stays with you long after you have left the restaurant. It's definitely one of the best themed restaurants in Kolkata, replete with ammunition hanging on the walls, low seating characteristic of the North West Frontier Province, and the sartorial choice of the waiters depicting life in Afghanistan perfectly. The seats and the curtains separating each group from the rest are beautiful, and as you start feeling like a queen/ king already, a lot of attention is bestowed on you by the waiters to convince you entirely of your royalty. The menu is not too long and confusing, and as you are transported into the region while you read the description of each dish painstakingly written, you can easily choose what you would like to have. While the food is definitely good and the meat is cooked quite well, there is really no magic in any of the dishes which you could remember for long and recommend to your friends. In a city like Calcutta, where so many people are connoisseurs, Kaafila should definitely try to delight its customers as much with its food as it does with its ambiance.

Hell yeah its Kaafila. The name is right now more than enough. Right from service to ambiance to food, both in terms of quality and quantity, all are excellent and top notch. Simply one of the best restuarents right now in the city. Exotic kebabs, soft juicy mutton kebabs with a tongue twisting balance of spice and masala. "Foodgasm" may be the right word to use after you have eaten in this place. A must go and a highly recommended place.

2nd Review

***************************************

Kaafila is and will be always in my wish list. Visited on sashti with few of my friends with high expectations and my recommendation. However we were presented with 'Puja Special menu' which lacks almost most of their specialties. Thank god, Kandahari Laham was there to save our day, we ordered two plates of that for 5 of us (mainly because there were nothing else in the special menu as good as this). For main course we ordered naan and Sufiyana pasanda only. 

This time, oddly, one of the house staffs was behaving rather too cocky. First, when I ordered Tom Collins, he suddenly came out with the wild idea that it is a whiskey based drink although I tried to convince him that its gin based. Then he tries to lecture my friend on margarita cocktail. That's not all, my friend specifically asked for crushed ice in her Margarita but was served with ice cubes. Management should clearly take notice of these small things. 

***************************************

1st Review

***************************************

Saturday lunch with friends at city center presents lot of options. However there are only a handful of good ones - Kaafila, without a doubt, is one of them. Everything in the restaurant is so perfect - the ambiebce, people, behaviour of house staff and the food of course. 

We ordered Murgh ke Hari Kalmi and Kandahari Laham as starters which were ample for 6 of us. Along with the food, we ordered lime soda, long beach ice tea, spicy arabian, blue heaven and scotch juice. Spicy arabian was supposedly house special but wasn't to our liking. Kandari Laham was awesome. For main dish, we went for Tehari Murgh - undoubtedly the best dish. It comes with 4 large pieces of chicken along with rice mixed with shredded mutton. The dish comes for 4 people (mainly for 4 chicken pieces) but is enough for 6. We also ordered Murgh Sufiyani Pasanda and a naan to cover the deificit but soon realized our mistake. 

It is always a treat to dine at Kaafila. Never have been a scenario when I was dissapointed with the food of this place. The ambience gives you the afghan feel boosted by the attires of house staff. 

P.S. Meaning of Kaafila is Banzaara as confirmed by one of the waiters.

Since Afghanistan is bordered by Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, China, Pakistan and Iran, it has been the place where important trade routes between India, China, the Middle East and Europe converged. A rich culture took hold at this crossroads, and with it a varied cuisine.
Afghan cuisine is mainly influenced by that of Persia (Iran).

Kaafila tries to recreate that cuisine for you right here at the heart of Kolkata. Located at City Centre 1 in Salt Lake, this restaurant is an Afghan themed restaurant. Starting from the door to the interiors, the entire restaurant is designed to give you a feeling that you are sitting in Afghanistan and having your food. 

The decor is beautifully created with North West Frontier theme. One can find lanterns and rifles hanging on the walls. The ceiling has Afghani rugs hanging and the seating area too draped in reddish carpet. The unique décor with canvas, carpet, and utensils would make it look like a tent and giving you a medieval feel.To add to the effect, the staff are dressed in what we know as Pashtun dress.

I had been to this restaurant multiple times - in large groups and with my family. Here are the items which I like and are always a part of my order. Some of these are a must try of you are paying a visit to this restaurant:

(1)Murgh aur dhania shorba - Rs 155/-
(2)Bhetki Ke Nazakhat (whole bhetki rubbed with lemon juice, salt, ginger garlic and cooked) - Rs 435/-
(3)Murg Makhmali Sikanj (Chicken mince mixed in spices with herbs and finished in tandoor) - Rs 300/- 
(4)Kandahari Laham (Whole mutton leg marinated with ginger garlic, lemon juice and rubbed with nutmeg and soaked in yogurt, olive oil and hot spices overnight. A tandoori delicacy of Afghanistan) - Rs 995/- *** MUST TRY
(5)Khandani Naan - Rs 145/- *** MUST TRY
(6)Kesaria Firni - Rs 120/- *** MUST TRY
(7)Boulawnee(Afghani pastry made from rich dry fruits. Served witha scoop of vanilla Ice cream) - Rs 165/- *** MUST TRY

The staff is courteous and service is good. The Kandahari Laham takes some time to cook (so you have to be a bit patient) and when it comes, you would see it all in flames with smoke whizzing out. 

If you want to have Afghani food, perhaps this is the best place to go. The price however is quite high and might be taxing for your pocket especially if you are taking a large group for a treat. Try and avoid weekends and holidays if you can since the place is jam packed. If you are yet to pay a visit to this place, I would recommend you take out time and get a taste of Afghani cuisine.

I had been to this joint several times, but this time I thought of reviewing this place. Coming the ambiance, I must say that you would not feel any disappointed in it.  The decor is beautiful and procasted theme of Afghans. You can find lanterns hanging all around  and rifles on the walls. 

Coming to food, each item was awesome and real treat to our taste buds. Quantity wise the food was enough to fill our appetite. We ordered kandahari lamb, no-veg platter, irani macchi tikka and tandoori angaar for starters. All of the item were good. You can try all of them. But the kandahari lamb was just awesome.  You must try this item once. 

In the main course some of us ordered butter nans, tandori rotis, masala kulcha, mutton biriyani, rogani gosht, murg kurchan, afghani murg and desaje masluque. All of them were really awesome.  But the biriyani wasn't out of the world, it was "okayese". The Rogani Gosht was simply delicious. 

The service was good. The staff behaved polite to make us feel homely.  Price of food was costly. To cut short,  I highly recommend you to visit this place once.

Went for lunch on the occasion of mom and dad's anniversary. The environment is classy and the food tastes awesome. Heavenly feeling. A little costly but the taste of the dishes makes up for it. A place to be recommended. Variety of kebabs and chicken dishes along with tandoori roti tastes perfect.

We eight were at this eatery for lunch on a rainy Friday afternoon. And just as we stepped in, we were just super impressed by the ambiance! Yes, we all were then a group of aliens from some other planet since few of my friends were shell shocked learning that we had never been to this place before! Anyway, let's get back to were I was, the ambiance is really way above average and very consistent all through out. Every small details was just perfect, you can find several snaps along with this review which just tries to give you a feel of the ambiance. Now coming to the food - we had ordered for Assorted Non-Veg platter, Kabuli Tandoori murgh gravy, Kandahari Laham, Lachhedar parantha, Masala kulcha, Methi murgh zafrani, Murgh Sufiyani Biriyani, Paneer Lababdar, Tandoori Angaar and Tandoori roti. Out of these I just loved Assorted Non-Veg platter, the fish and chicken in there were just super-soft and super tasty. The Kandahari Laham was good but I guess now the quality has gone down a bit, since I sincerely felt it is a bit over-hyped considering its present taste, content and aroma. The biriyani in itself had a nice aroma/taste and I almost finished it without any side dish! All in all - the food was good, but not really out of the world! But worth a try, cheers!

Had been there yesterday with my office colleagues. The ambience is good and the typical indian, mughal style. Ordered murg tikka, afghani murg and desaje masluque for starters and all of them were really good. You can try all of them. For the main course we had chicken bharta, dal fry, palak corn. This was good but nothing very different from any other indian restaurant in the same league. Loved the masala kulcha though. Hot and soft. Melted in the mouth. Service was good and employees very polite. Do visit if you are in City centre and looking for a good fine dining option

Reached at 9:15PM (6 people) and within 5 mins after handing the menu the waiter started rushing for the order. Ordered a lamb Raan among other items. When it arrived I wanted to take a photo but the waiter refused to put it on the table. He served the lot on the plates and rushed away (maybe there was hair or cockroach on the food) Took an afgan dessert which was horrible. After knowing the waiter's name, Mr. Mishra ignored the attitude.

Kaafila can be clearly considered as one of the best eating joint in City Centre, Salt Lake. We had been there on the Saptami of Durga Puja 2013 upon seeing a good review of it in Zomato. The place was pretty much full and we had to wait about 30 mins to get our table.

The decor is beautifully created with kind of North West Frontier theme. There are lanterns hanging all around. Then again there are rifles put up on the walls. The ceiling has some nice off white rugs and the seating area too is quite large draped in nice red. 

The food here is truly enticing. We had ordered for Murgh ke Hari Kalmi for starter and Rogani Gosht with Butter Naan. The starter was awesome and the tandoor was done to perfection. The naan was super soft and the Rogani Gosht was simply finger licking. The mutton was perfectly tender and complemented aptly to the dish.

The service was pretty ok. The main course though took sometime to arrive but then you need to give some time for some exquisite dish.

All in all a wonderful experience and highly recommended. Two thumbs up from me.

One of the best place of mughlai food in kolkata. The decoration(like afghan), ambience, service everything are fantastic. In food i have tried kandahari lamb, roti, chicken n mutton biriyani, machhi taka tin, sunehere murgh. all the foods are very good. machhi taka tin and kanadahari lamb were best, must try dish. in  drinks they have a standard menu and they provide one complementary cold drink. the only point to consider is this place is not at all pocket friendly, quite costly. but must visit here atleast once...

Me my wife was given a treat by a very close friend of mine. This was my first visit. I was amazed of seeing interior of this place look like we have came to a dessert. We ordered Mutton seekh Kebab and Normal Tandoori Kebab. Trust me you will never find kebabs better than this place in anywhere in kolkata. When I have given first bite on Seekh kebab I was feeling like heaven and it was melting inside my mouth. I was not feeling that I am eating mutton it is soft like gulab jamun. But main course is average and like any other mediocre restaurant.

Thank you for mouth watering kebabs.

North Indian restaurant... Tho I am not a big fan of North Indian but sometimes I manage to go for that cuisine. First ambience is nice, interiors is like Arabic or afghan types. When it comes to their food, it's actually a really good restaurant to have North Indian. Food was terrific..!! Specially the dal makhanni and pindi channna just superb..to add on there briyani is also kinda great. So basically Calcutta North side craving for good North Indian food kaafila is a MUST TRY..!!!

I visited Kaafila on 3rd May on my father's birthday. We were around 8 people.
It was a Saturday and thakfully we got a table. The ambience is nice with dim lights.

Food we ordered :-
1) Non veg kebab platter : It was good but for 750 bucks we expected some more quantity.

2) Veg kebab platter : I liked the gobhi and aloo only in this platter. Again, quantity was less at 650 bucks.

3) Kandahari Laham : This dish consisted of a whole leg of lamb cooked with spices. When brought to us, we were pretty excited seeing the flames and all. As I am not a lamb/mutton lover, I did not enjoy the dish.

4) Dal fry : Pretty plain like normal dal. Not good.

5) Keema naan, cheese naan, lasooni naan : The naans were awesome. Best I have ver had. Soft naans buttered with generous amount of butter. Just yumm.

6) Kabuli Murgh : This was for me and I liked it very much. Went great with cheese naan. The gravy was a bit sweet, which I liked.

7) Chicken Biryani : A bit different in taste but very light and good to taste.

8) Mutton biryani : Nice. The mutton was very hard but on complaining they changed it immediately. +0.5 for that. :)

9) Kakori kebab : It just meleted in my mouth. The best dish for that evening. :)

10) Firni : It was good but highly on the sweeter side.

11) Fresh lime soda : A glass of this costs 200 bucks. Highly overpriced beverages.

Pocket pinch was around 7000 bucks.

Had an okay-ish type of experience.

An excellent place to visit. The menu is wide and gives a lot of options to choose from, but doesn't end up confusing you. We tried the veg platter which has quite a lot of portion for everyone. The vegetables were smoked and had a nice taste to it. The dal and the paneer were also good and the breads were crisp. It'll be worth the time and money.

Kaafila is awesome both in terms of ambience and the quality of the food. Just as you enter you get a kind of Persian feel to it. With the Persian carpets lining the walls and the middle eastern cutlery and the silverware and the various photo frames giving it a modern look.
I personally love the North West Frontier cuisine that's why Kaafila tops my list. The food is great and worth the money. The Tamatar-Ka-Shorba is nice and spicy. I prefer that over the Dhania-Murgh-Ka-Shorba. The Afghani murgh ki Kalmi is also great and the kebab just melts in your mouth. One thing we always order is the Mirch ka salan. Big green chilies stuffed with nuts and spices cooked in a rich gravy. The only negative point is the low height of the tables. We always have a problem while getting out, but I don't mind. The food and ambience compensate for it. The complimentary paan on the way out is like the cherry on top of the cake.

One of the best places if you want to have North Indian food. It may be a bit pricey but the quality makes up for it. The food is extremely delicious and in good quantity as well. Among the starters the tandoori chicken stands out. Sunheri paneer is one of the best dishes in the restaurant. The ambience and seating arrangements are also brilliant.

Northwest frontier food that you are looking for? Then Kaafila is the right place.Kandahari Lahem , Tehari murg and boolounee in the desert is a must try.These above mentioned 3 items are the best thing that I have ever tasted.Simply superb.But keep in mind if you order Kandahari Leham and Tehari Murg then you should be atleast 3 to 4 people,because the quantity is too heavy.You will always come back for the above mentioned 3 Items. The presentation of Kandahari Leham is excellent with fire lit plate.As far as the food goes it's 10 on 10.Lastly before leaving you will get complimentary "pan" near the reception.After a sumptuous meal, a pan is very welcome. The decor is also good.They have put up rifles, carpets and various other stuffs to build an ambience.Drinks are a bit overpriced, overall the best place for Afghani food in kolkata.

OK, i have given rating as 5 as they do not have a 4.8 rating. .2 i deduct for the lack of space in some tables. 

Somehow Zomato has deleted my earlier review of Kaafila. So I am writing it again. This is one of my favorite places among all city center restaurants. This place has unique décor with canvas, carpet, and utensils which make it look like a tent.  The only complaint is that the space is little low in some tables, so getting in and out can be a problem. Now let me talk about the food.
The kebab platter is simply awesome with a medley of chicken tikka, mutton seekh kebab, fish makhmali kebab and tangri kebab/chicken hariyali kebab. Quantity is good for 4 people. The fish kebab jut melts in your mouth. The biriyani with long grain rice and soft mutton pieces…aha…bliss for food lovers. The cheese naan and daal makahani, can’t even describe it in words. Noorani macchi is a delight for fish lovers. The murg dalcha had very tasty gravy and succulent chicken pieces. The raita with creamy curd and delicious firni in earthen pots accompanies these dishes very well. The service is also impeccable. Once they served us chicken hara kalmi which was over salted, before we could complain they replaced the dish themselves and apologized profusely. That talks hugely about their service level. and I love the free paan at the exit gate. Keep going back to this place again and again and they have never disappointed me. If you are a food lover and never visited this place then please do.

This restaurant transports you to the rugged and beautiful terrains of Afghanistan. the decorations are similar to the movies which try to depict the gone by era of the middle east .Dressed in pathani suit the staff are cordial and eager enough to help you out with the choice of dishes. a must have here is the Raan. The delectably cooked mutton pieces are soft and succulent and melt in your mouth.  It's a bit on the costlier side but worth every penny. Then you can try any northwest frontier dishes with ofcourse the naan, which is a specialty of the Afghani cuisine. The biriyani here is also quite good, a bit different from the good o'l Lucknowi biriyani that we are so used to have in Kolkata. Verdict: One of the must visit restaurants if you are a fan of north west frontier cuisine. The pocket pinch is quite reasonable considering the quality of food you get.

This is one classy joint. If you're not in a hurry ( huge queues on weekends), and in the mood for some North Western Province cuisine.. Do drop into this place. The tandoori murg is mouth-wateringly delishus!!! The biryani can be avoided. In fact, I'd recommend the butter naan with a chicken side dish. The naans are buttery soft and melts in the mouth kind. The portions given are good for two average eaters. The decor is like that of a tent in the NWFP...very sophisticated rustic... I especially like the display of bandooks ( guns). The carpet hangings on the faux ceiling are a novel touch.

The cocktails are decent.. But way overpriced IMHO. The Marine Delight, a mocktail made of khus, lime topped with soda, is yummy! Give it a try.


______________
Updates:

i went back again for a bite. The tandoori chicken...is as a delicious as ever..in fact I thought a tad bit more so! The nans were as good as ever. Tried the chicken lababdar..very creamy and medium spicy gravy which contained shredded pieces of succulent chicken. Just yum. Taxes on drinks bit us badly :(

City Centre of Kolkata is one of the most happening places of the city and Kaafila is right there. You get greeted by an exotic north western frontier decor, matching outfit of the waiters and a fabulous ambiance. Kebab here are good, with no shade of doubt in my mind, is the best I have ever experienced in the city of joy. Biryani is gorgeous too and especially light on your stomach. Being a carnivore, I did not taste any vegetarian item during my visit to Kafila, every non veg dish I tasted has been great. The mocktails are brilliant too! No surprise that you see so many college students among the clients in spite of the menu card appearing a bit pricey. One of the best places in the center of the city to dine. My clients liked this place. Unless one is a compulsive and inexperienced faultfinder. Visited this restaurant in the month on April 2014 on an official visit to the city.

We dropped by at Kaafila for a weekday Lunch.
Well, I would say it was a chance visit, as initially I had targeted the new Rose Viand restaurant on the same floor (Block B 3rd Floor City Center).
But since it was full, and we were asked to wait, we decided to try out Kaafila instead.
The decor is pretty, with a bit of junk mix and match theme.
While a wall has a column of indian rifles hanging above a booth, another part has Persian rugs.
There are middle eastern crockery and silverware as well as atypical western photo frame collages in different areas.
The central portion has white ceiling tapestry, bamboo sticks, and an earthen, almost a medieval feel.
Since we did not have enough time for a 4 course, we decided to skip shorbas and kebabs and head for the mains instead.
We ordered a Kid-nu-Gosht, which was a delicious mutton (very very soft) dish cooked in a gravy with almonds and potatoes in Afghani Style.
we paired it with Hari Moti ki Pilaf (Green Peas Pulao) and we liked it too.
It was enough for 2 people, and we decided to finish it up with a sinful firni, which is till now, one of the best firnis I have tasted.
The staff were courteous and refilled water / served the dishes without asking on regular basis.
All in all,a great experience. 4/5 for Kaafila. Would surely visit it again.

The best joint for authentic North Western frontier food. A delectable spread, great taste, including of the eternal favorite "Tandoori Chicken" and probably the best butter "naan" in Kolkata. Very nice ambiance with a professional but helpful service. Good for office dinners, get together with friends as well as family meals. Slightly on the expensive side, especially if you are favoring their bar, but worth every penny. Go for it!

One of my all time favorites. 
Went with a group of vegetarians, so I can't comment on the nonveg food. But as I hear it from some of my friends, non veg at kaafila is really really good.
Order veg kebabs. You'll end up yearning for more. They are so well prepared. Have it with the green mint chutney.
Special mention to 2 dishes : Malai Kofta and Mirch ka Salan (  Surprisingly well prepared ). Garlic naan was good too.
The service is reasonably quick and waiters are courteous.
Difficult to find a table on weekends. Awesome place overall. Special mention : Afghani Ambience (Too good) :D

A place with good ambience if you wish to spend a quiet evening (only if are not surrounded by loudy guests).  The food is great. The kakori kebabs are just awesome. We were two and ordered Murgh Sufiyaan, Ghost Sikandari (biriyani), Pudina Paratha, Mixed One (A fruit punch), Fresh lime soda and Boulawnee (A hot dessert with all rich dry fruits and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream). The biriyani was just about good. Loved every other item except for Mixed One, which was too sweet for my liking. By the time we finished our main course we were full, hence decided to cancel the dessert, but it was ready to be served by then. But after lousily having one spoon each, we devoured the sinful bowl in no time.
Our total pocket pinch: 1800
Want to turn up again for tasting some more kebabs.

Also, the presentation is very nice and the ambiance is just very beautiful. Do visit and get to know what I'm talking about.

After having heard from a lot of friends of the charisma of the place, as i entered Kaafila yesterday it made me drive back to the 90's near baghdad! Exactly! The interiors perfectly suited the markets of Arab! We were a group of 10 and were seated at the centre most table!
With a pleasing ambience, we were delighted to witness the place.
What turned me off was the class of the food. Or may be it was like people over rated the place. Nevertheless it was an above average meal.
The attendants were not very couteous but overall it was a good experience.
If are there for the first time you must try the veg kabab which they serve with a green chutney.
That was fantastic starter which made my mood that day.

Kaafila is undoubtedly my favourite North Indian restaurant till now. All the vegetarian dishes are top class. The Dal Makhani is unparalleled. Paneer Lababdar is again a personal favourite. A few more options for Vegetarian starters would be a welcome change. Haven't tried out the Non-Vegetarian dishes but I bet they are as good. This place is a must-visit for all who swear by North Indian food. 
The decor is amazing too.

Went there with a friend of mine and actually reached at 10:20 PM. we were informed last order closes in 10 minutes. Since we were two guys, we were given a small table. But since we planned on dinner as well as drinks, we ordered everything at once (last order). Soon they realized the small table wasn't sufficient and they shifted us to a bigger table. We had a gosht sikandari Biriyani, kabuli tanduri murgh Gravy and naans. We also ordered a few drinks. The food was awesome, so was the ambience. The service was top class. Wanna visit again.

I think it offers best of afghan food in india. I have been 7-8 times to this place. The must try is "The Tehari Murgh" the best of briyani i ever had in my life span. The best thing is all my friends to whom i have taken to this place have loved the ambience and the food specially the tehari murgh. The dish serves abt 3-4 people so make sure u have good foody company :p. Do try all the Raan special options. Veggies to avoid this place. Firni is a surprise that to in the heart of city like kolkata   :D

Eat & keep enjoying life :)

One of the best places I have ever been and eaten. To me, this place gets the topper award if afghan is the food theme. The ambiance, the food, the experience.. all so warm and welcoming. Ambiance : The moment you enter Kaafila, you forget where you were few moments back behind the door. Complete interior gives the feel of the middle eastern Asia and the wall, the lights, the carpets, the seats - all proudly bring out the illusion with pleasure. All together a perfect visual satisfaction. Food: We ordered for Lasooni, Daal, Makai Palak, Lababdar Reshmi, Sabji Pulaf and Kandahri Laham. I don't know which one to pick as the best but I found Laham to be an unique dish and of taste one of its kind. The price can leave a bite in your pocket but you cannot have it all, can you? The price is worth the taste. The lamb leg was so sufficient and so attractive that it took away all the credits. All dishes taste very delicious, clean and full of coloring flavors. It feels so good to have dinner at a place like this which can last forever and you crave for the same evening more and more to accumulate all those experiences again. Hospitality: Perfect. The Happy, smiley greetings from the Peshawari styled Indian faces quickly fills your heart with warmth. Service and assistance offered by them are also at par with the way they have dressed themselves. To summarize, a perfect dining experience in Afghani style. I am a fan of this place because of its ambiance and offcourse food. Again, a pocket pincher.. but the pinch is sweet. I can take it.

Very much overrated and extremely overpriced! I did not find any of the items that brilliant as it is said. The signature dish, the kandahari laham is nothing but lamb cooked with a lot of masalas. It looks nice when brought, but tastes very average.
Can be tried, if you do not mind experimenting. Once is fine. Not worth multiple visits.

I feel its the best Indian food I ever had. Everything tasted so yummy. And moreover people who like to drink can have what they want as well :) ....

My second visit to the place --- had paneer tikka, the spices were absolutely on the mark, but I thought that the paneer cubes could have been a little more "crispy", if I can use the word aptly here. My main course consisted of Pindi Chana, Sabzji Lahori Korma and Masala Kulcha. Pindi Chana was perfect in taste, ever so slightly tangy. Sabzji Lahori Korma was a sweet preparation consisting of cashew nuts vegetables and fruits. For the tricky combination of ingredients, the preparation was worth a shot. I have something  to mention here for the Masala kulcha at this place. Masala kulcha is a bread which even the best of restaurants fail to get right but it was optimally stuffed and soft to chew along with the dishes. 5 star for the kulcha here.-------


Had  full blown veg North Indian dinner recently and my taste buds weren't disappointed by any of the items dished out by the place. Recommend it for revisits.

if you want to taste hot smoky afghani kebabs, head straight to kaafila. located at city center mall, it's easy to access and parking is never an issue there. the ambiance is superb with decor matching the type of food offered. also the waiters have afghani dress and they were very helpful in offering correct food as per my taste.
coming to food, kandahari lahaam is what you must order first. it's a complete mutton leg made into kebab and served with fire around the platter. add a couple of alcohol pegs and you are all set for a superb dinner. then move over to rogani gosht with cheese naan - a superb combination that was delicious. i also tried murgh pasanda which was shredded chicken in thick white gravy, it was a good combination with the naan as well.
overall, the food quality is awesome, the price is on the higher side though. another issue is getting a seat during weekend evenings. the place is not too spacious and people waiting inside makes the place cramped.

2 items I shall like to have every time with a group of 4.
Kandahhari Lahm and Tehri Murg. Kabab Platter is also delicious and dont miss the variuos types of naans, paranthas and Kulchas
Food is very expensive, no doubt, but they definitely maintain the Afghani style.
You can't eat much as food is really heavy. So compared to normal restaurant you should order food a bit lesser quantity.
Have visited this place with large groups and small groups , was never dishartened.
Place is definitely expensive but you wont repent after having the food there.

Kaafila has been sitting on a wish list for a very long time. Every time I am at CC , I try my level best to make it to Kaafila but have failed miserably. This time however, it was my friend's treat and she wanted to have kebabs and at CC.
"Kaafila chal" came the prompt reply from my end.

So, R and I went to Cc to enjoy a gastronomic mughlai lunch at Kaafila. 
Now, I would agree with a few reviewers that Kaafila might look really spacious in the pictures but it actually isnt so huge. But its definitely a beautifully themed restaurant. The NWP Frontier has been depicted beautifully. Right from the waiters to the curtains and chairs and the walls holding the rifles. 

The staff is nice and offer good suggestions.
Here's what we ordered :

Two fresh sweet lime soda
Afghani murgh ke kalmi (read : kebabs)
Naan (Plain and cheese)
Sunehra murgh

The sweet lime soda as I had though helped digest all the rich gravies and kebabs that we had gobbled.
It was nice and fizzy.

The kebabs were juicy and succulent and huge in size. I was totally bowled by them. R had almost burped and I knew that she might not be able to finish the entire meal.
The kebabs were a complete delight. Four huge pieces were a complete challenge for us.
However with the onset of the main course, I was pleased. The naan went wonderfully well with the sunehra murgh.
Now, sunehra murgh is a spicy preparation of chicken and well seasoned spices and its gravy is yellow in colour, owing to its name.
It has cashew nuts mixed in it. The chicken was soft and juicy and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Half of a naan and we were already full so we decided to pack the food.

Experience at Kaafila was one of a kind and I'd be back for more. Especially for their afghani pastry which I missed due to my filled tummy.
Cheers! :)

There comes a point in your life when everything ceases to excite you or ignite your imagination appreciably.Monotony and indistinguishability  breathe heavy in your psyche 24x7 as you pine for a breath of fresh air with a verve that borders on sheer desperation.

All the Kolkata restaurants I have visited off late have reeked of monotony and sameness, to the extent of reeking of sheer blandness. I am not talking strictly about the food here, but every single aspect that a decent restaurant prides itself on.

And then, I spent an evening at Kaafila....

 It was an experience worth every iota of my remembrance.It was a set- up that automatically accentuates the insouciance in your mind. And it certainly helped assuage the baggage of monotony I was submerged under for too long by  ushering in a breath of much- needed fresh air..Needless to say, it felt damn good :)
The interiors are done up so meticulously that you couldn't help but believe that you are sitting in the midst of a busy Middle- eastern hub. The lanterns, the shamianas, the earthen& metal pots, the 20th century artillery and a host of other authentic confetti hit you distinctly and surprise you pleasantly. The cutlery being used was pretty impressive too.

We now come to the most important bit: food. And I seriously am scratching my head to point out any aberration that might have served as a deterrent. But no, I am yet to come up with any loophole worth jotting down here. 
Everything we had was unimaginably good, starting with murg ke purje (don't quite remember the exact name, pardon me!) , nazakat ki bhetki, dal pukhtani, sikandari laham and a wide assortment of naans- maska, lasooni and kandahari. The naans were soft, feathery and easily the best I have had in a long, long time. The chicken and fish starters were supremely good, though the fish could have been even better& tastier, I felt. The dal pukhtani was polished clean off our plates, though it wasn't radically different from dal makhani. The LAHAM was brought to us on a plate of fire and the explosion of a gamut of spices& succulent mutton in my 'buccal cavity'(hehe) was absolute bliss! Lasooni naan and LAHAM is a match made in heaven and if you already haven't quite given in to it's enticements, you should..ASAP!
There's no reason why the rating should be any less than 5, but I would curb my instincts and go for 4.5 this time, simply because I would love to barge in again soon& treat myself to an even better experience..I am saving the 5 for precisely that occasion..cheers!

Located in city center 1, Kaafila,Undoubtedly the best place for an afghani feast in Kolkata. The ambience inside will set the mood right off. The walls decorated with old prototype guns and pictures, the floor and roof equally perfect in resembling Afgani culture and their habitat.

As far as food is concerned, Kaafila has a quite elaborate menu to offer.  For starters, Afghani murg ki kalmi and kakori kabab will surely satisfy your love for tandoori food, the chicken is soft and juicy, perfectly cooked and has the aroma of properly cooked  chicken fresh out of a tandoor.

For main course, Murg sufiyani Biryani is my favourite, i have been living in kolkata for a year now and my quest for a perfect plate of biryani ended here in kaafila, Murg sufiyani biryani with sunehri murg or lababdar reshmi makes it a perfect meal. For those who prefers a drink, for them Kaafila has various options. But for a non drinker like me sweet lime soda serves the purpose or there are various mocktails to choose on. 

Have'nt tried desserts yet, but you can try firni or ice cream. The price for the food is  bit high but quality and quantity of the food justifies it completely. The staff is friendly, well behaved and perfectly dressed as per the theme. Dont forget to taste the complimentry mishti pan offered there.

Visited Kaafila for our 1st wedding anniversary. I had heard a lot abut this restaurant serving the best North Indian & Mughlai dishes. However, I was a bit disappointed with the food quality. We had ordered Kakori for starters. The food taste was rather flat and somewhat cold.. I mean.. any kebab would not taste good if not served hot!! Anyways, after that, we moved on to the main course where we had ordered Hare moti ki pilaf and Kidnu Gosht.. the main course was better than the starters at least. The Pilaf was tasty and the mutton preparation was good. mutton was soft, the baby potatoes were added attraction to the dish. We finished off with Kesariya Firni.. which was great in taste..

Overall, I think Kaafila is quite overpriced for the quality of food they serve. The ambience is something new although but not enough free space.. the chairs are quite uncomfy.. I dunno what was wrong with the lights in the restuarant, I had a hard time to click good photos inside ... I would think twice before re-visiting this place..

Possibly the best joint for Mughlai Cuisine in the Salt Lake area, Kaafila is located on the 3rd floor of City center, the theme of this restaurant being Afghanistan. So if you are looking for authentic Afghani cuisine - this is a must visit place. Walking inside you would be greeted with a decor you would normally associate with Rajasthan. The walls are nicely done up with pictures and designer carpets.

Whenever I do visit Kaafila I generally order my faourites which go like this. For starters, I have never looked beyond plates of kakori kebab and paratha. The kakori is nice and juicy and will melt in your mouth - remember to sprinkle it with some lemon and finely chopped onions that come with it. If you are not a kakori fan you could choose between Tandoori mahi kebab or Irani Machi Tikka or both and I can assure that the fish doesn't smell! 

Moving on to the main course this is generally what I order. Lasooni Naan, Sikandari Raan, Daal Bukhara and Tehri Murgh. The Sikandari raan goes best with the Lasooni nan. It's soft and juicy and cooked very well. Next comes a plate of Tehri Murgh which comprises of rice, four to five pieces of chicken and egg. Be careful while ordering because this dish can feed five big eaters easily. The Dal Bukhara compliments the tehri murgh very well. It's very tasty indeed. If you want some gravy chicken or mutton dish you could choose murgh sufiana pasanda or lababdar reshmi or murgh kurchan. Wind up with some kesaria firni - it will surely make your taste buds happy. 

Would recommend you to book a table in advance. Staff is nice and courteous but waiting for a table can be very irritating at times. I had once asked the manager why they do not expand and his prompt reply was his take away outlet on Shakespeare Sarani did not run well! Prices are on the higher side but the food compensates for it. I have dined with my friends on a number of occasions and I have never been disappointed.

Went with my cousins to this place, on the first of January, this year, and it was a good start to the year! 

The very first thing that caught my attention was the 5 guns or rifles on the wall. Also the dhaba-ish decor of the place does add a rustic charm to the joint. We had ordered two three kebabs, and that special naan and a few more dishes, whose names fail my memory. I might not be able to recollect the names, but I do remember we actually fought over who gets the last piece of every dish. When I say the place and the food, topped the events of the day, I speak collectively for all my cousins. 

Lovely place, and a great time.

Have been here too many times but always remained skeptical about reviewing this place since I fear words will fall short in describing how overwhelming this place continues to be even today. They offer North West Frontier cuisine hence the decor is done keeping the Afghan culture in mind with show guns, rifles, carpets and finishing it off with brick red color walls. The waiters wearing the traditional pathan suit have taken the Afghan culture "look" of the restaurant a few notches higher.

When in a place like Kaafila you will be spoilt for choice about which dishes to order. I have never attempted in killing my hunger by having the mocktails and have always jumped straight on the food because there is so much on the offer. From the numerous visits, these are dishes that I have managed to savor.  

For starters:
Afghani Murg ke Kalmi - the thigh pieces infuse you in an aromatic smell of exotic herbs with a hint of cheese. A dash of chillies add the right amount of spice.

Murgh Malai Tikka - this dish needs no introduction. Succulent chunks of chicken, extremely juicy dunked in their signature mustard sauce with a dash of lime. 

Kakori Kebab - this melt-in-your mouth kebabs are a must try whenever you visit this place. Just with your first piece you are immediately transcended to Lucknow. The spice and the smoky aroma comes with the perfect blend of red chillies and cooking it in tandoor. 

Tandoori Gosht ke Sekua - the mutton chunks are so soft that it melts right when you try to cut them, way before you actually put them in your mouth to soak in its taste. The smoky aroma is all thanks to cooking it well in tandoor.

Tandoori Mahi Kebab - really soft fish cubes cooked in the right balance of spices. Simple yet tasty.

For the main course:
Gosht Khada masala - four solid huge chunks of meat cooked in rich gravy. The color adds a lot of drama to the dish with your tongues wagging out for more. By the time you devour the dish completely you are left craving for more. I think the rich taste of the gravy seals the deal for this dish.

Kid-nu-gosht - yet another mutton delicacy that has oddles of baby potatoes. The gravy is all about a fine and thick paste of almonds. Needless to mention that the tenderness of the mutton is yet again the show stealer for this dish.   

Gosht Sikandari - the mutton biriyani comes with a complimentary raita. I somehow don't prefer the fistful of fried onions that they sprinkle on top of the biriyani either for garnishing or for better taste. Whatever the reason I don't like that and usually separate the fried onions from my palate before getting lost in the blissful taste of the biriyani. Unlike biriyani in other eateries where they enhance the taste by adding dalda, the use of dalda here is an absolute no. The oil is mild but the dish is rich in taste and the aroma just makes you feel if only time had stopped and the biriyani from your plate would never finish no matter how much you ate. 

In most of my early visits I would be too full to have any space left for desserts but not anymore. I save up some for the phirni and thank god for that because I was missing out on a lot. The phirni is a creamy and milky paste and you can almost feel the fine texture in your taste buds. 

I am refraining myself from giving it a 5 because the prices are on the higher side. Hence, I would settle with a 4.5.

If you are wishing for a gastronomic extravaganza then Kaafila should be your go-to place.

Kafila was one of my most memorable and so called cherishable restaurant so far at Kolkata before today.
The savory taste used to bring my zyca for food for last 7 years almost as I went there last on 2007.
In the meantime who ever used to visit Kolkata I asked them to try kandahari Raan.  I always used to give it a upper  hand than elaichi raan at ABCOS.
Today I have really been disappointed about this dish, Here is my 2 pennies review on that.
*  The meat was not at all marinated well ( not that soft which you can expect from good quality of goat meat) 
*  AND this is not at all the preparation of whole goat leg in tandoor. Rather than the goat meat been prepared separately and served with a decorative  bone.
* last time on 2007 when i had this dish I used to fork out the tender mutton from the bone but this time the waiter served the loose portion and ran away with the bone and portion is also not that great.
I beleive the same bone wont be reused again :)

Hope kafila management will bring back the taste again.

Visited Kafila recently. had heard a lot about this restaurant. And to be honest...it really lives up to its reputation. has a great ambiance.

Ordered Kakori Kebabs as starter. Really good although felt a bit over priced for the quantity.

Then when looking into the main menu for biryani, the waiter suggested to have a look at the X-mas special and suggested to go for turkey biryani. Also tried out the Kid -nu Ghost. The quantity of biryani was enormous--- one plate was more than enough for two people. The turkey pieces were well cooked and the biryani tasted good. Not that impressed with he Mutton dish but was okay.
Overall a good experience.

Total around Rs. 1900 for two people.

I first came to know 'bout it from my friend. Today, our senior asked me to find a place nearby Saltlake where he would throw a small party as promised before. Then, I found details 'bout this restaurant in ZOMATO. We were given a hearty welcome by the guard & then we were stunned by the ambience. We started with Soft shangria,Shirley Temple from the list of refreshers,the later being more refreshing indeed. Then, Dezaje masluqe, Afghani murg ki kalmi were yummilicious. When we were devouring Sunehre murg with soft lasooni nun then the waiter came with a stylish casserole with fire burning on it, & carrying Kandahari Laham on it. It was no doubt a Kaafila special & times &again recommended by my fellow Zomatians as a quality dish. I don't think this item is available in any other restaurant in Kolkata. The dining odyssey ended with Keshria Firni, Boullowni. That was the best firni I ever had in Kolkata. Boulowni(sorry, if I misspelt it) offers a great contrast of hot & cold. To cut the long story short, it will remain a memorable experience & wish to return to give the other dishes a try. Not to mention the courtesy & knowledgable, smiling waiters in proper Pakhtun attires adding to the glamor of the decor.Only negative side is its a tad delay in serving the orders. However, the price may seem a pinch to your pocket but the quality itself is worth the cost. MUST VISIT THIS PLACE AT LEAST ONCE....

Revisited Kafila this holiday season after a gap of two years. Back then I had vouched for the awesomeness of its kebabs by declaring it the best in Kolkata. So along with the same partners-in-crime (wife, bro+sis-in-law) we set about exploring the other delicacies in Kafiia's roster.

Here's what we feasted upon:

Kandahari Raan: As the name suggests it was indeed the iconic tandoori raan, luxuriously marinated and slow cooked in surprise surprise, a tandoor. Sadly it was more a style over substance dish, as the theatrics involving the presentation of the whole raan, flanked as it was by a live flame on a the serving tray,  far surpassed the actual taste. It wasn't that bad, but not out of this world either and was primarily hampered by the stiffness of the meat. We summoned the captain and asked him to ensure that the meat was tender in the subsequent dishes that we order. That worked as the raan remained the first and only disappointment of the night.

Batakh khada masala: Loosely translated as duck cooked in whole spices, this was part of the special Christmas menu. The gravy was nice, smooth and thick while the duck itself was meaty, well cooked and soft and not over powered by the gravy.

Kidnu Gosht: This is a rather popular dish in Pakistan and is of course representative of the NWFP cuisine positioning of Kafila. While I cannot vouch for its authenticity, on its own merit it was spectacular. What I particularly liked was that the gravy was thickened by high quality almonds rather that an overdoes of dairy products. And no Bong worth his/her salt would mind potatoes with his/her meat, whether in robust curries or in biriyanis.

Gosht-e-baffat: This was the most subtly flavoured dish that we ordered that night. The vinegar added a refreshing tanginess, and along with the coconut was a good counterpoint to the inherent spice in the gravy. The meat was supremely tender.

All of these were had with copious amounts of naans and tandoori rotis. A small comment on them; having eaten widely around India, I've found that rotis cooked with a mixture of aata and maida are superior in taste and also unlike their maida only brethren, don't resemble an elastic bubble gum after cooling down. But while piping hot, these rotis and naans were heavenly with the gravies.

So Kafila lived up to its lofty expectations. The colossal raan may have been a disappointment, but barring that it was indeed a meal befitting the nawabs.



----- 16 Sep, 2012 -----

Succulent melt in you mouth kebabs, soft and piping hot tandoori rotis and a killer daal with a lingering aftertaste; the Pathans of NFWP would not mind at the seemingly dubious adaption of their legacy to suit a Kolkatan palate.
Was woken up from a prolonged afternoon siesta by brother-in-law thanks to a last min dinner plan here, and amidst my somnolent state, had zero expectations from this place. Boy was I about to eat humble pie. Amongst the softest kebabs I've ever had, I would not be surprised if the chef is poached by some other restaurants. The piping hot Tandoori Roti dipped in the daal was stuff made in heaven and quite diabolically almost convinced me to turn vegetarian. Thankfully another bite at the kebab restored sanity.
Definitely visiting this place on my next trip to Kolkata.

One of the best places for north west frontier food. We frequent this place for office hangouts and its worth it if you go in a group. Try Sunheri Murg and Jhinga lazeez (prawn dish). The lamb leg roast is really good even though its pretty heavy on the pocket if you are a smaller in number. The kebab platters are a good choice to start with.

The restaurant has mouth-watering recipes. Each one better than the other. It's a pleasure to have food here. Even the service is excellent. I would rate it higher than the "insane!" i.e. 5.0 if it had any higher rate. All the dishes are the best. This restaurant is my personal favorite :)

This was my 6th visit to Kaafila but first over the weekend. I was surprised and dissappointed that they did not consider Visiting Cards for their corporate discounts unlike many other famous restaurants. As it was a Saturday I did not carry the office card around, but staffs there were not ready to accept that, to me it seemed rude. However the food was very good as always. As we were already half full, we only ordered for 2 Fresh Lime Soda, 1 Shirley Temple, 1 Murgh Sufiyaani Biriyani, 1 Sunhere Murgh and 1 Maska Nan. Including tax it came about Rs. 1242.



----- 30 Jun, 2013 -----

One of the best! The NW-frontier ambience was great, food was delicious and what more - price was also not sky high. We had refreshing drinks, Mutton and Chicken biriyanis and four side dishes - fish, chicken, mutton and all of those taste yummy! The Kabab Platter which consisted of 13 different kinds of Kababs was absolutely mouth-watering.

Kaffila is a good  Afghani restaurant in cc-1, kolkata. We, four ,went there on 11.12.13 at 1.00 P.M.
It is a memorable experience,as I was the first timer to any Afghani restaurant. we ordered paneer
kabab which is very delicious,followed by butter naan,boneless chicken ,paneer kofta,phirni. chickens
 were very soft and tenderer.The food is not too spiecy but too testy .The ambiance of the restaurant is
 very good, with spacious sitting arrangement, and had well pathan- dressed soft spoken waiters.We had
not to wait for a longer period for food.

Kaafila is one of the best Mughlai restaurant in the city, this is a theme restaurant and the theme is Afghanistan. Seating capacity is about 50 and even in weekdays it remains full all the time so one has to wait for a while to enter during peak hours but as we went there at 7.30 pm it was semi full so we got a table without any waiting.. The Ambiance is extraordinary, one can have full afghanistan household flavour here, wonderfully decorated.. Its a spacious restaurant, so there is no feeling of cramped atmosphere.. Waiters are dressed in pathan suit and they are knowledgeable   as well as well behaved and well trained.. We ordered the non veg kabab platter which consists of 12  big pieces of chicken mutton and fish kabab, all the kababs were extremely tender and tasty. for main course we ordered masala kulchas-which were big fat, full of stuffings, gosth e baffat- the only  boneless  mutton preparation, rich & tasty and Badshahi kofte-these ate potato dumplings in rich creamy gravy, sweet & delicious.. Despite the crowd serving time was very fast, they served everything within 10-15 mins and everything was piping hot..They serve many alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages which are also good..cost for 3 came around rs-2500..If anyone wants to celebrate some special occasion on a mughlai restaurant then kaafila should be the destination..Everyone should visit this restaurant atleast once, will be a memorable expetience..

I have not went to too many Afghan restaurants, but I am confident this one will surely stand out as of the good ones. We ordered the best item in the menu-  Kandahari Laham! This dish is just awesome! They serve a full leg piece of mutton with flames all around. The presentation is also fantastic. Other items on the menu would range from average to above average, if not excellent.

Excellent food !!!!. Its very difficult to get proper mughlai food in kolkata , as maximum all resturant end up making all the dishes very oiling which not good for the health. But Kaafila is an exeception it seems. If you conscious and Foodie then one should must visit Kaafila.The quantity of  Chicken Awadhi biriyani is more than eneough for 1 person .Its taste exactly the same you will get in Afghanistan Post my visit there , i can actually compare the food with the food i got in turkey. It feels great that in Kolkata you have the places to get best food and taste the world cuisine around. Cheers !!!!

Kaafila was on my wish list for a very very long time since I had heard only positive words about it from all my friends and acquaintances. I finally landed up at this restaurant on 5th August 2013, too bad I forgot to review this place !  
As already pointed out by most of the fellow Zomatians, Kaafila is a restaurant specializing in NW frontier cuisine with a very Afghani ambiance ! 
Location and Ambiance : Situated on the 3rd floor of City Center Mall in Salt Lake, the restaurant is not as big as I expected. It can accommodate around 40-45 people at the most. The tables are big enough though with comfortable sofas and chairs. As I went during the day time, the restaurant was naturally lit. Since we went on a Monday afternoon, we immediately got a table. 

The Food: I heard so much about their Kebabs, i was spoilt for choice and could not decide which one to order. Finally i played it safe and ordered a Non Veg kebab platter so that I can taste around 3-4 types in one order ! The waiter warned me that it would be too much for two people. I insisted that I would like to have the Kebab platter and he went away with a smile :) 
We had to wait around 10 minutes for our order to arrive, after which we were served with a huge plate consisting of 12 pieces of kebab ! There were 6 Chicken kebabs (2 variants), 2 Fish kebabs and 4 mutton kebabs (as far as I remember). 
They were pretty big in size and looked delicious. Sadly the chicken kebabs were too salty! Otherwise the chicken was soft and tender and should have tasted wonderful if the salt was used properly. 
The Fish kebabs were absolutely lip smacking. The quality of fish was very nice and fresh. 
The mutton kebabs were also nice. I and my friend really enjoyed the kebabs and were full by the time we finished them. We were really not in the condition to order main course. 
The bill came to around Rs1000 for the kebabs and it was worth it. Next time I will be back to try the other items. Would have rated Kaafila 4 but have to deduct some points for over use of salt !

Great food and service - we had an awesome evening and a sumptuous dinner, coupled by some warm welcome by the staff. Tehari Murgh was awesome.
Interior decor - Soothing, good taste, ethnic look, soft music.
Overall a great experience! Thanks team Kaafila

During the pujas I visited Kaafila, located on the 3rd floor of CC (I). It was my very first visit here and it definitely swept me off my feet.

The place was very crowded, which was itself a clear signal to its standards.

Firstly, the wonderful ambience struck me. It is so beautifully done and it totally represents the cuisine served here. The centre area is covered by white cloth spread across the ceiling. There's a corner surrounded by carpets. We took our seats by the wall which has guns exhibited on it.

The staff, who are courteous, polite and helpful, were also accordingly dressed in the pathanis and galabandhs. They can be a bit more attentive.

The service is good but not excellent. But then, we visited the place during pujas, so I'll give them a benefit of doubt here.

Now let's go to the most important aspect that is the food. I simply loved the food here. We ordered for ghosht sikandari biriyani (which is basically mutton biriyani) and murg sufiyani pasanda.The biriyani was excellent, although not the best, with the perfectly cooked rice, potato and mutton, which was very soft but the show-stealer was the chicken dish called murg sufiyani. It was a creamy gravy and tasted heavenly.

Would look forward to taste the other delicacies!

Whenever I think of Kalifa  "Afghani Murg ki Kalmi"is the first thing that comes to mind!
It is one of the best dishes I've ever tasted!
One plate will have 4 pieces which seems enough but once you taste it you will feel like having more and more!

I recently went for lunch ,hence jotting down my experience for you guys! 

1.Food:Ordered Afghani Murg ki Kalmi,Mutton Biriyani,Kabuli Tandoori Murg ,Butter Naan and Phirni.
Afghani Murg as I said was super yum!The mutton pieces in the biriyani was a little hard ,I've had tastier biriyani.The raita which is served with the biriyani is very thick unlike the usual raita we have,initially I was little hesitant to try it,but when I did, I was totally pleased.The chicken pieces of Kabuli Tandoori Murg was very soft and the gravy was red in color and a bit sweet.Butter Naan was soft.
Phirni was also tasty ,nothing to complain in that!

Kafila has an amazing ambiance.The place is nicely decorated.I love the white cloth which hangs on the ceiling!
I noticed one area is covered in carpets,which I thought was very cool!

Service has nothing to complain about!The waiters were polite and confident!

Price is on the higher side,I'd say.But its totally worth it!

I'm dying to revisit again for the tasty "Afghani Murg ki Kalmi"!

Serving North-western cuisine in the best quality possible, Kaafila should be a regular visit for those who love the tandoor. Decorated with ethnic carpets and some guns, the place does have the typical Afghan look. The food does justice to the beautiful ambiance. The kebabs are delicious and the biryani is  really good. The firni is a dessert that must be tasted. It would be great if they would serve the food in traditional crockery. The place is small yet cosy and is always full. 
Well done, Kaafila!

The mock-tails were very made and I have never been disappointed with this place!!

Meal for two on average is 1200 with taxes.

Highly recommend it for family get-togethers.

The desert brownie with vanilla ice-cream is  a must try and really nice, completely different and full of dry fruits!!!

Visited Kaafila after 3 years and nothing has changed since then. Still gastronomist of North Indian cuisines swear by its dishes.

In beverage one must try Fresh Gold and Pink Panther. In starters for a gang of 4-5 adults Kandahari Laham is a perfect dish. Slow cooked over night marinated mutton raan shredded meat served on silver platter. While in main course no one can dethrone Tehari Murgh which a whole dumphukt chicken cooked like biriyani with mutton keema and basmati rice. Topped with egg slices. Never ever try these landmark dishes with less than 4-5 people or you will end up wasting such expensive dishes.

In dessert only options will be one of the best tasted Kesaria Firni topped with saffron strands and edible silver foil and an Afghan delicacy Boulawnee which is baked dessert with rich dry fruits served piping hot with a scoop of Vanilla icecream on top.

Even finger bowl will have a slice of fragrant kafir lime. While exiting crunchy paan will be there for you. Such an amazing ambiance, royal treatment and exquisite food do burn a hole in your wallet. Bill came to INR 3574 with taxes after 10% corporate discount.

Would have been a perfect five but as a scope of improvement the waiters must be trained properly for not to drop food on table while serving.

--------------------------------------------------

Kaafila's uniqueness is its Afghan ambiance. Waiters also present them in pathan outfits. You will even find show guns and rifles hanging from wall. The restaurant suits all reason whether corporate dining, family outing or romantic dinner. Cocktails are great and so are the starters. For vegetarian options are bit less but makes sense in any Afghan cuisine.
We ordered chicken, mutton and fish kebabs. Drinks included few beers and couple of cocktails.
Service was ok but they were late in serving one of the cocktails among many drink we ordered.
In main course we had both chicken & mutton biriyani along with Sunehari Chicken. Food is not over spicy to give you heart burn but makes a hole in your wallet. But quality always comes with a price. If you haven't tried this restaurant then I will advice to give it a try.
You always have option to book your table in advance for evening because they are strategically located to keep them busy almost all day. Reservation: +91-33-30990249

Had visited the place on an afternoon some 6-7 months back. Ambiance was good, however had a not so good experience with food. Tandoori roti served were cold. It appeared like they were made 20--30 mins before being served. On pointing this,they put the same rotis in taandoor to make it warm and in the process burned the rotis and served burnt rotis.It was in the third attempt that they were able to get it right and served warm rotis. Now you dont expect paying huge sums of money to be served cold food .  

Also ,i noticed the restroom inside the restaurant was filthy.Not that you find in a good restaurant

The place makes you pay for its location.The design , the attire , the setup definitely sticks to its theme and the staff does well to bring that Persian Experience .However the food is very overpriced .The starters are good especially the choice of platters.One should definitely try the Kaali Dal here ! However considering the Vegan Junta , i feel the choices are limited and you will end up shelling quite a lot.However one surely should visit the place considering the hype it  has around itself.

I'm a pure non vegetarian and thus I'll request you guys to try out all the dishes one by one every time you visit. I'm sure you are going to go back after your first meal. the proportions and the quantity is also commendable along with the cordial service. my friends and family enjoy every time we visit.

I guess there's reason enough for that. Kaafila has really maintained its standards both aesthetically and in terms of food. Its authentic, honest and serves well. Though not a regular haunt for me but I like this place overall. its apt for a nice big family dinner.

Kaafila offers a really elaborate options from Pashtun / Afghan / North West Frontier cuisine ... I particularly mention kebabs and the special Kandahari Laham .. one of Greatest Kebab available in Kolkata .. Biriyani is not so good here .. 
But if you think of going to a Theme Restaurant .. better avoid it ... though there are tent like ambiance and Matchlocks (Afghan Gun) in wall ... you must be astonished hearing Pop like songs in loud voice and seeing a Fountain Coke Machine in front destroying all the ambiance .. And for a Theme Restaurant Plates and Sitting arrangements should have similarity to original .. which Kaafila didn't offer  ..
So the food is very very good but the ambiance is not

Kaafila is a quite renowned restaurant located in City Center mall. It had a takeaway branch in Shakespeare Sarani earlier but closed out. The speciality is North west cuisine. The decor is a meant to give an NWFP feel but i did not find it so great. The place is small and pretty compact.  The service is slightly on the slower side but the staff is warm and they know their menu well. The place has long waiting queues on weekends and since the place is small, it gets too crowded as well. But food compensates for them all. 

The restaurant is priced in the league of Massekah, tangerine, teej etc. The kebabs are great for starters except the tandoori babycorn which was pretty average. The paneer tikka and tanddori aloo were great. The kebab platter is worth every penny spent. The main course dishes are good. I would rate their koftas as one of the best in town. Mirchi ka salan is one of the dishes that one wont find in many restaurants in kolkata but the kaafila people do every justice to the dish. I loved the biryani as well. Deserts are good too.

Pros:
1) Amazing food quality
2) Great kebabs
3) Mirchi ka salan, kofta are recommended
4) Warm service

Cons:
1) Place is small and congested
2) Decor is not so royal
3) Long waiting time on weekends

I would say its a great place for lunch/ dinner on weekdays but i try to avoid it on weekends.

Please follow me for more of my reviews.

I went to kaafila for lunch on a sunday.It was pretty crowded but i had a table booked.The decor is good but feels a bit crowded,tables could have been placed a bit apart...for starters we had non veg kebab platter and murg ki hari kalmi kebab, They were superb.For main course we had kulchas with sunehere murg- it was ok,nothing gr8. I tried murg biryani which was awesome. but word  of caution, my friend had a Choco moco for drink-it was terrible, we took turns to have a sip each but still couldn't finish that single drink. But again firni as desert was as best it can get.Service was good.
So overall, in my opinion, the kebabs, biryani and firni were the gr8 stuff- try them.

I am sure they serve very tasty food here with Very (with a capital V, I'm sure) good ambience and decor, but, still, I must also admit, the pricing is a bit high. The kababs are very tender and well marinated and grilled,the naans and rotis are very crispy and soft. Biryani and curries are very good too. The staff are very courteous, helpful and friendly. I would have given them .5 more if the pricing was just 10-15% lower. Still, a very good place for a afghani/ moglai dinner.

We i had visited kaafila on the day of id, i had ordered the following items

Murgh Sufiyari 
Non Veg Platter 
Kakori Kebabs 
Kesari Firni 
Papad. 

I usually order dry stuff because i am not that fan of spicy food. 

Food was ok but nothing to great to rave about.

A different kind of a restaurant offering basically Afghani Cuisine.The interior is moderately done
giving a feel of the Arabia.The place is a little congested.I mean it would have been better to space out the tables.
I found the food to be good.Infact one shoud try the Kalmi Kabab & of course their Biryani.
The price is slightly on the higher side  but nevertheless worth giving a try!
Without booking , specially on weekends may depress you as you may have to wait.
Average dinner for two people would be between 1200/- to 1500/- depending on your order.

I visited this place yesterday. I had kakori kabab and mutton sikh kabab which was really awesome. I never had sikh kabab like this before. I did not like niriyani here. I had masala kulcha which was soft and moist. Overall nice food specially kabab. ambience was nice but bit conjested.

We went to kaafila with high expectations on zomato after checking the ratings. The service and staff courtesy is totally unacceptable. It seemed like that they were in a rush to serve and get us out of the restaurant.  There is a certain amount of courtesy and softness that the staff should show the customers and not be in a hurry if the clock is ticking. 

The waiters are hovering on your head like flies ...should have had a spray...alas. Really horrible service...never to return place.

Firstly, Whichever day of the week it is, Do make a reservation unless you plan to go slightly early by around 7 :00 pm. Went there last evening with a few friends. The decor is really good with a very afghani dhaba kind of feeling. May get a little noisy during peak hours but that can be overlooked. We ordered a vegetarian kebab platter and were warned by the waiter that it would be too much even for three people. Considering that we were hungry, we ordered it. The kebab platter was massive. We didn't even go on to the main course. Just a few drinks and the kebabs. The cocktails are quite good - We tried the zingatini which was surprisingly really tasty. 
On other occasions that I have gone, I remember the black daal being delicious and even the naans and kulchas are soft and nice.
Average dinner for two would be around 1000 rs without alcohol. 
Definitely look forward to going there again.

Kaafila is a restaurant with very good antecedents, but it's a dirty, smelly place with poor ventilation and poor quality of food. 
We visited shortly after it had undergone some pest control and fumigation, and the chemical odours were over-powering, so much so that we left our meal half-way. We came back a few weeks later, and it was a little better, although the smell wasn't yet gone altogether. 
The quality of the chicken we were served had a spongy, defrosted texture which really put me off. A lot of the food looks and smells the same, and Kaafila's chef is guilty of using a one-size fits all kind of gravy in most of his cooking.

I have been to Kaafila a number of times and each time it was a great dining experience. Here is a place where you can find perfection everywhere. The ambiance is good, the music soothing, the staff helpful & prompt. Their cocktail menu is awesome, my personal favorites being 'Blood of God' and 'Spicy Arabian'. Food is impeccable in terms of presentation, quality, quantity & taste. Never miss out 'Lasooni Naan' and 'Sunehre Murg'. If you like soups, then the 'Dhania Shorba' is worth trying. Kaalifa is worth every rupee & every second spent there.

Yesterday I went to Kaafila for the first time after reading good reviews here but my experience of the food was OK. The first visual mpression of Kaafila makes you remember Peshawari. The ambience, the decor, the attire of the waiters all very similar. 
We first ordered Pink Panther and were very disappointed with the very first item. Then came the Kakori Kebabs. The Kakori Kebabs though soft were a little on the sweeter side but nowhere in comparison to the ones you get in Dum Pukht.
Then for a change the Kabuli Tandoori Murgh and Maska Naan were good and when we asked the waiter about the Murgh Sufiyani Biryani, he said that it would be very dry much to our dislike.
So we ordered Rice and Dal which by quality and quantity were good.

Many of the famous eateries in city center are ruining their food quality, but I'm glad Kaafila is not among them. If it is NWFP cuisine, I would undoubtedly pick Kaafila for its rich food preparation and excellent afghani ambience, along with the paan they serve for gratis towards the end of the meals! The food is excellent, the staff is friendly and welcoming and overall, the restaurant has maintained the food quality over these few years of its existence, maybe even enhanced it!

My first review on Zomato because I found this place so interesting that I had to share.
The moment you enter you find two swords with a round shield at the left side and a short gun just at the entrance. Photos of Afghani people and culture, hanging on the walls. I did mark all these as I had to wait for some time to get a table. But let me tell you, it was worth it. Then each individual section of the restaurant has its own distinct Afghani touch. 
Food quality was really nice."Afghani Murg Kalmi" is a must try. You won't forget the buttery soft chicken for a long time. Main course was also up to par. Starters of this place are really awesome.
Service no wonder as I heard before, excellent. Staffs behavior and time taken for the preparation was circumspect. For a period of time, a thought came across my mind why don't they speak Urdu while providing service "obviously" along with a translator  . 
Really nice food and a real good experience. A must Visit Place.

The moment you enter the restaurant you will realize you are in an Arabian tent house. Food is awesome here especially the kebabs are mouth watering and so tender and it goes well with their range of wines. "Afgani Murgh Ke Kalmi" is a super duper kebab. Had the usual main course but only kebab is stuck into my mind. One of my favorite restaurant in and around Kolkata.

Good food. Nice Ambiance. Reasonably priced. What more could you ask. The kebabs just melt in your mouth. We like filling up on the kebabs and then skip the main course. But if you do tread on, try the Kid-nu-Gosth. For a lighter fare, Kaafila ki Daal (yellow daal nicely seasoned) is recommended. The mocktails are nicely made too.

Yes I'm giving it a 5.
I had a perfect experience here today.
First of all, the decor. It has been detailed really amazingly to resemble an Afghani setup, with carpets and ceiling drapes and even rifles on the walls! 
Then of course, the food. I can safely say that the Kakori kebab I had here was the best mutton kebab (or any kebab) I've had anywhere in town. Just the right amount of softness too. Also, the Sunehre Murg was a great dish. I couldn't resist ordering mocktails, and both the Quite Tangy and Shirley Temple were perfect.
The waiter who served us was very polite and well-behaved and service was fast. 
It cost two of us a total of 1400 bucks (and yes, we were full), and I'd say it was worth it! 
As a final cheer, they offer you mitha paan on the way out. I'm definitely going to save up some money and visit soon again.

This is a must have! The food is absolutely amazingly! The Mutton Biriyani was the die for! Even veg dished: A paneer dish was amazing! I do not always highly rate Indian dishes if they are not done well. The chicken was soft and tender. The biriyani was full with a lot of aroma and was really tasty! The flavor stuck to your tongue. Same goes for the vegetarian dish too! Best of both worlds! The ambiance is very inviting. Perfectly lit. Just the perfect setting eating time should have!
The staff was courteous and very helpful. The ipad for the menu card is a fancy addition!
Overall it was good! And you i will recommend and re-visit this place.

A perfect place for food lovers. If you are a foodaholic,then its a must visit place for you.Its located in the City Centre1,Salt Lake.
The ambience and beauty of the place is just awesome. Its one of the rarest kind of resto in Salt Lake.The moment you enter this place,you will feel the Afghani attributes all over the place.The waiters are dressed in afghani attire.Be it the flooring,paintings or the furnitures,you will find the afghani touch everywhere.
Well,coming to the food.I ordered for Ghost Sikandri Briyani which was damn delicious.The mutton was well-cooked and literally its so good that you don't want to swallow it.Really,a treat to mouth.The most happening thing about this dish is the raita served with it.Believe me,the taste is just uncomparable. Its one of the best raitas i had till date.
If you are going in group,Kandahari laham should be the must try dish for you.It just looks so royal and the way they serve is just so worth-watching.
The only thing which worried me about this resto is the price.Comparing to the other restos of Kolkata,it may seem little over-priced.
I guess its because of the location,but still you will love the place.

Th restaurant is located in a prime location - B block city centre, Salt lake which also makes it a bit expensive. The food was good and we ordered prawn dishes and fried rice and the portions were copious. We heard a lot about the famous 'Kandahari Laham' but didnt ordered it but seems a try worth it.

Its worth a try as the food is good giving u a feel for the north West frontier cuisine as it promises. Happy eating!!!!

A restro - only for the big foodies like me, a restro - for the tandoor lovers, a restro - only for them who are alive to eat :) yesss, i'm talking about kaafila. My words may sound a bit large to the viewers until they get into kaafila. It left me no choice from giving a full five.
It is located at city center mall, very near to my workplace. It serves completely indian cuisines with traditional indian spices. I do not think you will get such a variety of nawabi and afgani platters anywhere else in kolkata.

At first, the interiors are just most matching for kaafila and it's speciality. The ambiance is great in a single word. I went there with three of my friends and we were accommodated so well that we were having great pleasure while eating. Their placements of furniture and the decor suit the theme of kaafila.

Well now the main thing, the food !! Whenever I go to an afgani restaurant, a always take biriyani and sometimes get disappointed. But kaafila's ghost sikandari is beyond any comments. Guys, please dont miss the biriyani when you visit this place. I was very delighted to see kakori kabab in the menu and i ordered. THE BEST KABAB ITEM I EVER HAD. The mutton pieces were so soft that they were melting in my mouth. At the same time it was too spicy.. awesome !!  We took a new item kid-nu-ghost and it was also very good. I liked it because it had potatoes in it. All the items were soooo good looking, spicy and mouth watering. 
I will be there again and again whenever i feel the thirst of nawabi foods, in fact i will visit kaafila very soon and this time i'm going to taste the dal items. A very good place for all kind of people like couples or family or friends. Biriyani and kabab are must try for kaafila.
Best wishes and lots of love for kaafila :)

Kaafila, located in City Centre 1, Saltlake is an absolute delight to visit. The food at this place is a treat to the mouth. The most special dish although is in the dessert section, Boulawnee (An Afghani pastry). A lot of people don't try this but this is something worth trying.

The service is quick. The restaurant needs to undergo a refurbishment and they should replace the stools with proper chairs with a backrest.

Always make sure that a prior reservation is made to avoid delay in services.

The mecca of Afghani & Mughlai cuisine in Kolkata. The decor & ambiance is one of the very best in town and you are sure to be transported to the magical world of Arabian Nights once you set foot in this gorgeous restaurant. The waiters are royally dressed, well behaved and eager to help you out with food selections. 

Their best dish is undoubtedly the Kandahari LAHAM. Trust me, it's just majestic. One whole mutton leg, sumptuously marinated with ginger-garlic, lemon juice rubbed with nutmeg and soaked in yogurt, olive oil and hot spices overnight. It takes at least 4-5 people to devour this dish and the lip-smacking taste will linger on for quite some days (yes, days). The assorted Kebab platter is also a very good choice if you prefer kebabs.For the main course, my recommendations would be Sunhere Murgh, Kid-Nu-Gosht, Rogani Gosht, Jhinga E Lazeez and the Gosht Sikandari Biriyani. 

Each dish is prepared with much care with just the right proportion of spices which makes them truly irresistible. Well, yes, they are a bit on the spicier side, but that's what Afghan & Mughlai food is all about. Overall, this extraordinary dining experience is worth having every once in a while.

Kaafila is the best place to savor Afghani cuisine in Kolkata.
The ambiance is a perfect north-west setting with Persian carpets, dim lights, mud-hut like walls, armors and hand painted tile encased tables on a rough floor.
The food served is a delightful combination of meats cooked in herbs and spices.
I'm in love with their mutton cooked with baby potatoes and biriyani served with tender pieces of meat and a cool raita to go with it.
The kebab platter served is equally worth the price with generous quantities of mutton, fish and chicken kebabs of different tastes and textures. The meats are well cooked, but not overdone resting on a bed of cucumber and carrot julienne served with mint chutney. The fish kebab was delightful, just melt in the mouth. 
I liked the idea of serving a paan as a mouth freshener kept on a platter near the entry / exit. 
It's simply a foodie's paradise.

Waiting for the food to arrive becomes easy and memorable one...when you begin to relish the place and its aura...A wine counter gives added beauty and charm....I got very excited to see people taking orders on tablets.....I found the food very easy on taste buds ...they do not try to surprise you with different flavor when you already know the taste of a particular food....giving what you want and precisely what you want....but personally I felt the quality of rice was very very good....don't know they grow it themselves or not....but I will never forget this in my entire life...Machhi Makhmali was fair to eat and oh! I also had Lychee Delight....the visit associated with precious gems of memories...will always revive my tranquil memory....even if I never retreat to Kaafila....

The drawback being that it is so popular that one has to wait in a long queue before getting a table and this LONG WAIT generally makes a person belligerent with hunger...
My suggestion being that it is worth the wait and it should'nt be opted for when you are hungry and you need quick and delicious food.

I have visited Kaafila many times over the years. It is extremely sad to observe that Kaafila has shown consistent fall in service standards during the past years. 

My wife & I visited Kaafila last evening. The restaurant was full & the reception was empty (not a new thing, I assume it was meant to be empty as I never found anyone there!!). A person approached & informed that tables will be available minimum after one hour. Again, such a "shoo away" approach is not new to me as I have seen them doing it at the time of rush hours. I insisted that they should write our name in the waiting list though it should be the other way round. Within 15 minutes we received a call. 

Food standards were not as they used to be. Byriani was totally dry despite its Lahori style of cooking. During the dinner, we saw a cockroach is roaming freely on our table.  While we informed a waiter, he just brushed it aside.  It seemed he is quite used to such incidents.

I hope they will try to rectify their attitude towards business & providing service towards customers & not take anything for granted as they are doing now.

this is my second review of Kaafila and am writing again for a reason as I sit and dine here, we ordered through the very porsche tablet which was very smart and we were very impressed as I hadnt seen this in Kolkata after Bistro By The Park and obviously abroad... BUT as I was just enjoying the beverage we saw something that freaked us out- a baby cockroach walking by our table and me immediately called the waitor told him the same he just brushed it away. now this is a big no no I understand that it maybe a minor hitch but they should get a pest control done.. this cant be good. but the food is awesome and so is the ambience and decor... i hope this doesnt happen again

the best place of authentic afghani and mughlai food. The biryanis and mutton dishesh are awesome and the kebabs are a must and the ambience just adds to it all

Really good food, nice themed ambience and excellent service - you get everything at Kaafila! You'll get only Afghani dishes, and the best of them. Be sure you try out the Kandahari Laham (roasted leg of mutton) with the bread baked with dry fruits (can't remember the name). The Kabab platter, the biryani and the mutton with whole onions (Khada Gosht) I think are also very good. 

Price is slightly on the higher side, but definitely worth it,

Kaafila has good interiors, lighting, the guns and swords. i loved the extraordinary meat on flames. The food is so rich and heavy. Its a nice place, with rich flavors and you really get full you cant have dessert. i had to parcel the dishes out. I had a mojito and it wasnt made very well, there were sugar crystals at the end of the drink.I liked the paan that they serve you at the end of the meal on our way out. Some of the dishes are a bit expensive. But on the whole its a alright place to try out. but i wudn go there anytime soon.

This is where one gets the best Kakori Kebabs in Calcutta. Soft succulent and with the taste of perfect blend spices this melts right in your mouth. The staff is courteous and the decor is very north west frontier  down to the attires worn by those who are there to assist the guests. The sunhera murg was perfect with roti but the taste suggests it would make the perfect 'couple' with rice as well. We were two girls in our twenties and as a result we were quite full with the  Kakori kebab, tandoori and murg along with a creamy mocktail to begin with and so this time I was left longing for the rich Afghani pastry . My only suggestion to the owner is that the addition of purely traditional beverages of north west frontier such as Dugh a rose flavoured lassi drink and other unknown beverages. I cannot wait to taste their platter of kebabs.

loved the food. ordered a kebab platter and it was sooo filling and we had ordered biryani and sunheri paneer n we were just wondering how we were going to have the rest of the food. but the biryani came and it was so nice and light. I ate almost all of it.  my friend loved the paneer. 
                                  just one hiccup was with d mojito. they put sugar crystals instead of sugar syrup.
        The service was great. special mention to the guns hanging.  :)

I tried the non-veg platter and it is worth every penny. The biriyani is unique and different from the ones we usually get in Kolkata.
Though must admit it is an expensive fare but a very nice option at city centre

The place is good with the decor and everything and the food is not bad either.

The veg and non-veg starter platter and quite good and so is the dal.

Portion size is fair and the service is decent too.

If looking for a place to eat at city center 1, kaafila is not a bad choise.

We were 5 members.
Wanted to dine out on Tuesday evening, the 22nd Jan.
Quite confused, where to go.
Then we went through the rating of Kaafila in Zomato and decided to call on Kaafila.

We ordered,
Tandoori Angaar,
Kandahari Laham,
Mousam ki Sabzi,
Kaafila Dal,
Sunehre Paneer,
Pineapple Raita,
and Lamb and Prawn (forgot the exact names).

Except Lamb everything else was prepared well and served at an optimum time.
Service is good. Especially they prepare food fast. You can refill your plates and bowls without thinking about time. 
For the first time, I got to know that Afganisthan ambiance too can please you. :)

I give 5 stars for this one, because the price we paid for the quantity of food and service was awesome. I will definitely recommend all to go to Kaafila...

Since am extremely fond of indian food,KAAFILA wud be in my list of TOP-10. 

An Afghani decor with waiters in pathani suits & turbans, guns on walls, carpets hanging from the ceilings, wooden tables & chairs is how we can describe the interiors of this restaurant. 

FOOD; Great taste, Highly recommended- Khandaani naan, kaali dal, biriyani. I wasnt too happy with the kebab platter as i have had better kebabs in other places.

PRICE: A meal for two without drinks would cost- Rs 1000-1500.

WAITING TIME; high during weekends. The best time to visit this place wud be 7-7.30pm(dinner), Lunch wud be 12.30-1pm.

AMBIANCE: Nothing fancy but good.

I have visited this place only once and I have become a fan.

The interior is very soothing and matches with environment,food & aafgan culture.the waiters wear turbun,kurta and all.Very well trained and polite.They helped me to choose the right dishes.

If you are in a mood to have kebabs then this the best place in the city.They serve many types of kebabs.We ordered a kebab platter for my family which had 14 pieces(total) of 5 types of kebab.all of them were just great.

In the main course we ordered a biryani,a mutton side dish and roti . Mutton was the best mutton curry i have ever had,and the raita served with biryani was too delicious.But i found the roti not upto the standard of other food.

Over all it is a very nice place for family dinner as well as friends hangout.Nice environment,and much heavy on the pockets.

Kaafila thy name " Convoy of travellers in Persia,Arabia" ,its definitely satisfies the name for foodies/food lovers in kolkata.

The host with a Bandh-gala ,the waiters with Pathani suits and the dimmed light ambiance just creates the impression you wont forget soon.We were 2 couples got in around 8:00 PM in the evening last Friday.

Started with the Kabuli Tandoori murgh and Dezae Masluqe (Afghani delicacy) , the meat just melts in the mouth and the aroma just works like an appetizer .You have to wait for a max of 10 - 15mins to have the orders ready which is very fast for the delicacies "Kaafila" Serves .I liked the crispy Cheese and Lasooni Naan in the Breads. The best part is you dont feel heavy when you finish your meal, as they use the right combination of spice in the dishes.

Lovely Kandahari,Peshawari to Afhghani dishes to try out for a change of  taste .


Recommendation : Must try Dezae Masluqe and other Tandoor Dishes

I have been a fan of Kaafila ever since I had their mirch ka saalan. The service here is medium-slow and the place has a laid back ambiance. Recently I went there with a bunch of friends, and tried out the Biryani. I think they have probably changed the chef or something, because the Biryani was GOOD. Plus I really love the kababs they serve, especially the lamb leg, Kandahari Laham. 

Another special mention is possibly the fish taka tin, which was quite nice.

After a very hectic day and being at a very hungry state we landed in Kaafila....We were seven in the group of hungry lot. Since we reached at 6:30 we had to wait till 7 o 'clock to get in, which increased our hunger. Once we entered, we hardly took any time to order the very famous Kandahari laham as starters. Along with that we ordered Lababdar chicken and Nan/roti as main course. Even though many said the biriyani was not good in Kaafila..we ordered a couple. 
After 10-15 mins of wait, the kandahari laham was served...The presentation of the dish was excellent...however the dish was average. I expected much more from a dish which cost you around Rs.1000. The begining of the dinner started on a pretty average note and it continued in similar fashion when the chicken and roti's were served.  Then came the Mutton Biriyani.... It was just awsome...probably the best in the town...It would give an Arsalan (park circus) Biriyani a run for its money and might win the race. The biriyani was so good that we ordered one more and along with that a chicken pasinda. This pasinda was also a winner all the way. Finally the dinner which started on a average note ended on a high...with full gastronomic satisfaction.
The ambiance and service are excellent. 
Food - Big thmps up for Biriyani and a thumps down for Kandahari laham.
Price - A bit heavy on the pocket..specially the Laham.

PS - the price shown in zomato currently are old ones..the rates have changed. Average per couple would be around 1400 without alcohol & tax.

Recommendation - Definitely try the Biriyani.

The word 'Kaafila' is Urdu for a group of travellers. And if you indeed choose to venture out into this restaurant, it won't fail you with its delectable Afghani cuisines. A typical decor and dim lights suiting the impeccable ambience, the waiters wear the Afghani turban, Pathani Kurta-Pajama. The whole attempt is basically to deport you somewhere else. The menu offers everything that's scrumptious. From Awadhi, to Peshwari and pure Afghani delicacies, as you browse through the range of dishes, the corresponding prices might raise your eyebrows more than ones. It is indeed, a pocket pinch. But the food and its plethora of tastes won't let you down. With the ambience, the staff service, the decor and serving time, the food and its flavours are all to be looked forward to. So get your pockets pumped up, before becoming a 'Kaafila'!

The first thing you will notice about the place is it's unique Pashtun influenced decor with rugs, hunters, canopies and old rifles on the walls, that and the soothing Music leads to an awesome ambiance.

Now the food at this place is again Pashtun/Afghani Influenced, so this is a must go place if you like Kababs and Shorbas .The NonVeg Platter is a must have starter at this place and a single platter should be enough for 3 people..
I loved the Murgh ke Hari Kalmi and Murgh Sikhampuri and if you are a mutton lover you have got to try the Kakori Kababs. The Tandoori Roties and Butter Nans were very soft and delicious and wildon & Irish Cream were decent desserts.

Now the Alcohol at this place is reasonably prices and shouldn't burn too much of a hole in you pocket and they also have quite a decent Cocktail Menu, but they have a temporary License and dont serve Alcohol everyday.

Now it shouldn't cost more then 1800 for two people if you order as I did...should cost you considerably less if you dont take Alcohol..

Rating: 4/5

Kaafila.

Located in city centre, this is one of the best places if you wish to try afghani/mughlai food. Items on the menu are moderately priced. A meal for two without alcohol would cost Rs. 1500. The ambiance is great which takes you to Afghanistan with wooden tables and chairs and private chambers separated by huge embroidered carpets. 

An ideal meal at Kaafila would be an assorted indian bread basket, a plain peeli/kaali daal and a kebab platter. I have tried dejaze masluqe, which consists of succulent pieces of chicken marinated in yoghurt, hot spices and crushed mix of ginger and garlic for a strong flavor. The murg tikka kebabs are as succulent as you can possibly want and lovely marination of the spices and well finished in the tandoor gives off a lovely aroma. The Kandahari Laham is a whole mutton leg rubbed with nutmeg and lime juice, marinated overnight in hot Indian spices and soaked in yogurt and olive oil. Great portions and can be shared by at least 3 people. The kakori kebabs are soft and melt in your mouth instantly. The meat was perfectly minced and mixed well in yellow chilli powder and poppy seed paste. The pineapple raita deserves a special mention. Also, worth a mention are the variety of their indian breads. Try their keema naan and pudina paratha.  Kaafila, with its service, food and ambiance offers a great evening. 

The drinks and their sharbats are innovative and refreshing. I loved their mocha slush, shirley temple,pink panther, peach pina colada, and irish cream! Infact I was spoilt for choice! 

I will certainly visit Kaafila on my next visit to Kolkata. You should too.

Rate- 4 on 5! Its really good but there is always scope for improvisation and improvement, which is why i reserve that one point.

Utterly disappointed...!!

Not because of the food. . But because of the pathetic behaviour of the staff. . 

I had called the restaurant for a reservation on a Friday evening when I informed they do not take any bookings....

But when I reached the place I was turned down by saying there is no table available. There was 2 vacant which I was told I reserved.

On top of it the person interacting Mr. Joginder Sharma was particularly rude and a big liar.

My suggestion to avoid the place or face disappointment...

Just returned from Kaafila.. went today to kick off my puja celebrations. started with alcoholic beverages but was misled with the prices mentioned in their drinks card. Later realised that they mentioned drinks prices per 30ml(small peg) in their price card. But as usual, their food is awesome. Fish kebab is very good but a bit costly. Gosht sikandari is awesome but may be my bad luck, the mutton was a bit under cooked. Nevertheless, kaafila is always one of my most favourite restaurants serving NWF cuisine. It is worth tryng but it is a bit costly if you take alcoholic beverages...3900 for 2 persons and we drank only 2 large pegs :(
[Editing] Just checked the prices here, they have increased Rs. 50 to 100 in every item for Puja and they are not serving all dishes mentioned here.

It is one of the better restaurants serving North West Frontier Cuisine more specifically Afghani cuisine. The ambiance and the crockery just add to the experience. We have been there just once and its very impressive loved the Naan and kebabs and the main course and the desserts were just authentic. Do try it!
Four stars from me :)

For non-veg fanatics, this is a place to die for. Food is terrific, and is well complimented with a proper ambiance. Kababs are just awesome over here. Kandahari Laham, Afghani Kalmi Kabab, Dezaje Masluqe and Kakori Kabab are few of the favourites amongst starters. Biriyani, here is just passable. Sunehre Murgh and Kid-nu-gosht are some of the side dishes worth mentioning.

Very much worth trying....actually one of the best in the city!!!!

By far the best kebab platter in kolkata. The food here is aromatic, scrumptious and mind-numbing. on entering u wud be greeted with a warm smile. one can make out that is uniforms are inspired by Bukhara/ Peshawari for ITC hotels, but the range of food is much better and vast. 

The star of this restaurant is the Kandahri Laham (roased whole leg of lamb) come with the bone and i flaming platter. quite an experience. The Daal here is one of the best in the city and so are the kebabs. 

The ambiance is great. but occasionally they play some strange songs. The choise of beverages is great too. but i hav been refused red bull a few times. 

these are very minor flaws . the food compensates for them. the choice of breads is brilliant too. i am not very keen on their Salan (the flavors r a little too refined) 

they now hav their menu on tablets and its very user friendly. the staff is warm and ambiance is cozy. 

overall ... one of the best Indian restaurants in the city.

I had to give Kaafila 5 stars for the following reasons
1. Undoubtedly their food is too good. starting from starters to main course to salads..they are just flawless. my favourite here is Tehari murg, khaandani naan, their special kaali daal, and pratically all chicken items . havent had much of mutton items so will not be able to give a fair view. Being a har core non vegetarian..hats off to Kaafila to make me fall in love with their vegies too...
2. Service is excellent....from the manager to the floor boys...each one of them is courteous sans attitude. They give a warm and friendly smile and when asked for food suggestions..are helpful and genuine.
3. The ambiance is perfect..
4. Location is also very convenient.

Went to this place for lunch last week. Nicely themed place with a very warm and welcoming staff. 
Food was excellent, especially the Mixed Kebab Platter..chicken, fish, mutton everything was so well cooked..and also came with complimentary beer!
Other dishes were good as well. The only drawback is that they take a too much time to bring the food to the table.
Will definitely suggest this place to someone who wants to have a great and sumptuous lunch with a bunch of friends!

Nice themed restaurant. Food is good compared to other Arabian cuisine restros. I love the Afghani Kebab and the lamb items. The staff is very warm and you'll get a nice welcome. Good place to celebrate a birthday as the will arrange a special candle and music at no extra cost. Don't have the biryani over here as it's horrible and very dry. Overall, a good place to go for lunch or dinner if you are near the city center in salt lake.

The decor & the ambiance of the place is pretty good. However I cannot say the same about the service. They take a long time to even respond. The attitude of the waiters are no less than the famous (or should I say infamous!) waiters of restaurants in Park Street. The food is nothing too great. However I did like the Biriyani even though it was very different from the kind we expect from Arsalan or Shiraz. The firni was a total disaster. In short it is not a place I would like to go back again & again.

The restaurant has an Afghan decor, a super chef and pretty decent service. Also, a fairly good bar. Might be a little difficult to locate inside the mall if you're not used to the ways of City Center but ask around and you'll find this small restaurant on the third floor. 
Vegetarians: Make sure you order the veg platter for a starter. It's huuuge but it's delicious. I also recommend their veg biryani. 
PS- The mint chutney served on every table is TO DIE FOR!
PPS- No bookings on weekends, so the first-come-first-serve basis which takes anywhere between 45-90 minutes is a major turn off!

The kebab platter is a def must have at this place-esp the veg one. There is more than enough kebabs to feed a hungry family of 4 and still have some left over. Also love the kali dal and the garlic naan. The ambience and decor is really good as well.
One of the drawbacks that i can think of it that it is really difficult to get them over the phone to make a reservation and if you make it there without a reservation, the wait is really long.

I visited Kafila a month back with a team of 10. We have really enjoyed the interior decoration and the ambiance. We have experienced a restaurant standing apart from other north Indian and mughalai restaurant serving non-veg with afghani spices. Dishes were awesome and they have a good choice of cocktail/mocktails.

Ambiance:  9 out of 10 (I could have been given 10 out of 10 easily if there was a bit more light on the table)

Food:  9 out of 10 (Need to improve more on Biriyani)

Service: Good

Value for money: 7 out of 10 (Dished are priced correctly. Few dishes are bit over priced like kandahari lahm and veg dishes)

Good dishes and combination: Kandahari Lahm is a must have, Chicken Sikahampuri, Briyani 


Over all I will give 8 out of 10 to this restaurant.

One of the best north-western cuisine I have ever had. Irani machhi tikka, kakori kabab, tihari murg, sunahare mugr, kid nu ghost (this item is not available on menu card always, but on requesting they serve it) are simply "THE BEST". When want to give treat to somebody, Kaafila is the Safest option
