Never been there but ordered online much from this restaurant. Their service is good. Serves varieties of dishes but tried only usual items. Chicken chow and chilly chicken makes a great pair. Their mixed rice taste great with my favourite prawn in it.

Never visited the place. But ordered for a few times through Swiggy. It delivers a good food beyond ur expectations in such a cheap rate. I loved their chow chow rice, chicken wings, shredded hong Kong chicken. I hope it won't disappoint u..

Well today tried their mixed fried rice, chicken and prawn fried rice and garlic chicken for the first time. Though no so extraordinary but considering the price it was satisfactory. Quantity was too good. One will find ample pieces of chicken and prawn in it. Pocket friendly.

I ordered in from this restaurant just wanting to experiment a bit.
Well this was one successful experiment. 
The lat Mai kai chicken was brilliant. Crispy and spicy with the sauce they provided. 
The golden fried baby corn was crispy and the best I have ever had.
The chicken pan fried momo in tomato and garlic sauce was overspiced, and not so crispy.
The delivery took more time than expected.
This restaurant is excellent if you are on a budget.

ordered from swiggy. wanted to try a new food outlet, finally "new flavours" was in the list of swiggy. went thru their menu, they had wide varieties in their menu. chose to order veg american chopsuey. as swiggy has no minimum amount range to order; so i got the delivery in all total of 96/- (70/- for the chopsuey, 20/- for the delivery charge, & 6/- for the packing). 
the food reached to me on time...fresh & hot. @70/- bucks, the quantity was superb, wd loads of fresh veggies, packing was neatly done, and tastewise also - it was good. no complaints xcept that the chopsuey gravy was less tangy. it lacked lil bit of tanginess & sourness which basically chopsueys should have. rest, all in all, it was really good and worth the money :) a must try place for all coz its extremely pocket friendly!!

Great food against the price.
Loved the Shanghai Prawn and Broccoli chicken.
Also available at Swiggy.
Their fried rice is awesome to say the least.

Used to come here with my buddies. Liked the Chicken Rolls , Chicken Fried Rice , Garlic Chicken etc. But now quality has degraded a lot hopefully they will fix this issue soon.
