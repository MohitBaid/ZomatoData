This one little spot in the middle of Kolkata was the best part of my trip, considering its one of the only cafes that understands and serves vegan food. And the best part is, that they managed to make it so delicious and provided some great variety! Their multigrain rajma patty burger, cous cous ensemble, soups, broths, mexican rice bowl, and pretty much everything else is a bowl of delicious goodness. Add to it the small but amazing collection of books.¬†
A must visit :D

‚ÄòEating healthy food‚Äô not always indicates going on a diet and to cut down all the stuffs which can be termed as flavorful. For me, eating healthy primarily means eating that food item which suits my body and which is prepared in a hygienic environment with proper care, with the best possible ingredients that are not adulterated. If I feel my body needs a bit of fat or carb, then I should of course have it, every individual has different food requirements which is very important to understand. Saying so, the cooking method, hygiene and ingredients should also be kept in mind as well. Having loads of boiled vegetables which have been boiled in contaminated water doesn‚Äôt make much sense. I really liked the thing which Rahul Arora said about his caf√© - Caf√© Pranah doesn‚Äôt serve any diet food, the food you‚Äôll get here is like something your grandma will be serving you when you are back home. And this one line explained the entire concept behind the food available at Caf√© Pranah. It is real good food, served with utmost care and prepared with best of the ingredients. So to me, it‚Äôs a place where I can have anything without worrying about my health, because I already know my body will love the basic ingredients that constitute these dishes.
                                          ...

Another small cafe in Hazra. Beautiful space and aesthetic interiors. But the mocktails/food is equally bland. And then zomato says a review must be 140 characters long! How much more can I crib! :/

Had been here with mom some weeks back. This cafe has a unique menu. We ordered Chicken Salami Burger, Egg Burger, lemon basil iced tea and cold coffee. 
The burgers tasted good but the bread weren't fresh because of which we couldn't lift them and take a bite. The healthy version is something we loved. 
The Basil lemon tea was good. 
My mom liked her coffee. 
We liked the ambience. The books and the  decor. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Being a student of Ballygunge Science College it is impossible to miss out on this cafe. No I am not fitness freak but this 'health' conscious cafe is something I wanted to give a try. 
They have an amazing range of tea's. Not quite a tea lover but tried some of them and I must say I didn't regret it. The iced lemon tea is really very refreshing. Cinnamon tea has the right amount of spiciness and freshness of cinnamon. 
Oh coming to nachos. Guilt free nachos as they call it. Yes totally guilt free but they will leave you craving for more. Right amount of crispness and an amazing combination of chicken,olives, sweet corn with ample amount of cheese. 
Ambience is warm,cosy and unique. They even have outdoor seating.  
Overall a nice experience and would love to visit again. @

Cafe Pranah is a health cafe located in hazra. If you are looking for healthy food and calm environment this is the perfect place for you.
The cafe is small but the decor and the spiritual vibe of Lord budha throws away all of your negetive energy instantly.
We ordered the multigrain roasted chicken burger, the chicken sheek wrap, reisin carrot muffin, orange iced tea and classic lemon iced tea. Both soothing iced tea was the perfect escape from the outside world. Multigrain roasted chicken burger and sheek wrap was really good and healthy. Reisin carrot muffin was very soft,warm and yummy.
If you are a lover of oily spicy food don't come here cz cafe Pranah is all about healthy yet tasty food.
Those who are health concious and still looking for wide variety of food to tickle their test buds, cafe Pranah is highly recommended for them...
Take a sip and forget everything...
This place has one more thing to offer a small book shelf.Those who can't think tea without a book they can just grab one from there and can find their own serenity..

This place describes how healthy food could be tasty too!
We ordered The Guilt free Nachos . They serve nachos with a curd dressing which definitely makes the Nachos guilt free and tasty!
We also ordered the Mexican rice bowl, a burger and a wrap! The food is both tasty and healthy !
And the Meusli muffin is love !
The place is economical and has a lively ambience.

This is a health cafe located in Hazra which has attempted to serve food in a healthy way. In a world which is health conscious, this cafe has come up with a very good initiative to provide tasty food with healthy ingredients. 
Once you enter the cafe it gives you a very positive vibe, chants playing in the background producing a calm environment. The interiors are nicely designed with decorative items like Buddhist gongs, statues, paintings and other things, a spiritual environment altogether. 
The menu has been designed in a unique manner. Everything in the menu has been designed with a health conscious mindset. I ordered -
1. Roast Chicken Wrap- this is a chicken wrap consisting of roasted herb chicken cooked with bell peppers and topped with barbeque and yogurt. It has veggie fillings and tastes great. It is filling and the dish gives two wraps. 
2. Nolen-gur Yogurt- this was a special dish they introduced for a period of time which is probably not included in the main menu. There was a sweet festival going on and I wanted to try one among them. The dessert tasted brilliant with a  perfect mixture of yogurt and nolen gur. It wasn't very sweet but the yogurt was perfectly matching with the gur which is a Bengali favourite. 
This cafe is ideal for all the food lovers who want to go on a diet but can't live without food like me. The food is good to taste, the ambience is very nice, the staff is approachable, the presentation is very ordinary. The price is also reasonable.

I visited this place in a group of 6. The cafe is small but the staff were quick to arrange tables and accommodate us. Honestly, I loved the interior. Though I feel going in a group is not a great idea for this cafe. I was glad that they have books as there were a few which I was eyeing on for a long time. 
Located just beside karma fitness studio, this place is for health conscious people.
We placed the order for Roast Chicken wrap(  tasted okay), Fruit of the forest with vanilla ice cream base ( again was average), mango yogurt (this was good and may be the best among all), salami burger ( filling and decent in taste), dark choc muesli rocks ( we ordered the 45% dark one and it didn't rock at least. It is crunchy and tastes good) 
Surely delightful for calorie conscious people but not me.

This was my second visit at the new outlet at hazra and proved to be much better as compared to the first.
I ordered the mango basil cheesecake shake which was yummy, perfect flavours and is perfect thirst quencher in the blistering heat.
I also had the hot basil chicken with brown rice which is super healthy and delicious. I am a fan of brown rice and this was a delight! The hot basil chicken was cooked perfectly, perfect consistency, texture, colour and balance of flavours.
It says 'soul cuisine' and stands by it! Thumbs up to Chef Rahul Arora and his team.

Well, the name is creative enough to attract any inquisitive foodie- It was even more clear when I got to see their logo-amazing!

Ambiance is superb with great paintings, show pieces, sculptures from Buddhist school of mindset.Interior decoration were worth visiting. It was more soothing with the background music. Bookshelf was there with moderate collection-although I felt it ought to arranged in a better way.Overall nice ambience.

Coming to the food section...Their menu card was written excellently with technical healthy food inputs. So our expectations grew. We ordered Lavender and mint ice tea and mango,mint,chilli ice tea. Although they were a little bit late in serving ( they sited a big delivery order behind this- not convincing!), First one was very good. The second one was disappointing and I doubt whether there was any trace of tea or not as it was tasting like normal squash. Again they showed same reason behind it!

We ordered Tuna wrap next. The stuff was good with proper tuna and an unique taste. But the flat bread was too thin to hold it!

So overall a moderate experience and hope to have a better service next time!

As every foodie abides by the fact that -
"There is no love sincerer than love for food"... needless to mention how important a role is performed by our taste buds, so as to bring in the delight we expect, or prefer to derive from a delectable meal, be it a breakfast, lunch, dinner or some casual munching on the go!!

However, nothing can beat a place where health concocts to taste, and you can eat to your soul, leaving behind the consistent agony you beared all through about the calouries you're gaining!!

Sounds interesting??!

Walk in at "Cafe Pranah", a destination that every food aficionado should look forward to..

Located on Hazra Road, right beside the 'Karma Fitness Studio', the place happens to be a 'cut above the rest' amidst the hustle and bustle of the entire neighbourhood, eventually being a perfect place to crave for some pristine peace, over some delectable yet healthy treat to pamper your taste buds.

In fact, the immediate refreshing vibe that you get, while walking in, is enough to absorb your stress and allow you to relax, and order for some delicacies from their menu, which includes some brilliant teas, salads, brown rice meals and so on!!

Specially the "Kashmiri Quawah ice tea", "Wild Berry tea" and "Orange Mint Honey tea" happens to be a sheer bliss to stimulate your body and soul, eventually leading you to exude the vigour and vitality, a connoisseur of food is expected to possess.

Even the salads, the multigrain bhel, the brown rice combos(that includes ' three varieties of Minced meat in hot basil', 'Thai green curry' and 'Thai chicken yellow curry') and all the other offerings in their menu happens to be an amazing concoction of health and taste that is sure to leave you utterly delighted on your each and every visit!!

P.S. - Don't forget to try the "Dark Chocolate Muessli Rocks" in dessert

Happy Eating üòÉ

Sometimes while our body craves for food , our soul too yearns for serenity. We want to sit and enjoy our food in peace away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Cafe Pranah , I must say is that abode!! The moment you enter this place , you feel at peace. The reclining Buddha, the prayer flags, the beautiful pictures of the hills makes for a perfectly calm ambiance. Sit and relax and order something from the menu, there is an assortment of teas, salads, burgers, brown rice meals, smoothies, wraps to choose from. The prices are very reasonable and the food , a prefect blend of health and taste.
We tried the Kashmiri quawah ice tea and the wild berry tea. Priced at 109 these are the perfect coolers.
The "Grape Melon salad" , can be a perfect choice for those who wants to eat light .
I perfectly fell in love with the " multigrain bhel" (rs109) , something unusually tasty as well as healthy. 
For those health conscious people the brown rice combos are the perfect lunch offerings( the combos priced at rs 229 comes in three varieties minced chicken and hot basil, Thai green curry, Thai chicken yellow curry)
The teas are always something that cafe Pranah is known for. Tried the perfect "Orange Mint Honey Tea" and the blend was perfect and soothing.
If you are looking for desserts "Dark chocolate museli rocks " are the perfect choice.
Thus this cafe is highly recommended for all those looking for tasty yet healthy food served in the perfect ambiance.

Cafe Pranah has always been a guilt free restaurant where you can go and eat!  Eat! And eat!. A place where you  will  get the feeling of being in some northeastern  state(due to music) and it's  so peaceful but eating healthy. A special menu dedicated to Summer Coolers and Ice Candies is what rules and believe me the experience is like none other. We ordered grilled chicken burger and tuna burger and it was yum! But remember to not miss the dessert.

Leave it on Chef Rahul Arora to make your taste buds tickle if you are looking for a treat in Kolkata. Introducing, his creation - Cafe Pranah that is all about channeling your inner yogi and eating healthy.
Do not fret just as yet - for healthy does not essentially mean boring. Sometimes, healthy stands for a balanced yet scrumptious meal. When one enters Pranah, this cafe has the potential to transport you to a zen state of mind with McLeodganj vibes and a monastery bell ringing in the ears. This cafe is a delight for people who are looking forward to unwind and eat healthy, maintain a healthy lifestyle or just drop it to relieve themselves from the huff and puff of the metro city.

STATUTORY WARNING : All the dishes are cooked in absolutely less or no oil and are a delight!

Luckily, I got the opportunity to taste the different array of food this quaint cafe had to offer. We started the luncheon with ¬†Multigrain Bhel, Kashmiri Iced Kawah, Grape and Watermelon Salad and Wild Berry Iced Tea. The Grape and Watermelon Salad soon followed suit and to say that it was fresh is an understatement. Although, the Multigrain Bhel and Wild Berry Iced Tea were by far my favourite when it came to starters. The vivacious bhel was a game of hopscotch to my tongue. It was super fun and the flavours packed a punch in the mouth. The ¬†Wild Berry Iced Tea is the ideal mate for the summers, with little blueberries swimming in the tea.¬†

Moving on to the bigger plates - For main courses, we were served ¬†Homemade Rajma (red kidney beans), Minced Chicken with Hot Basil, and Thai Vegetable Green Curry with two portions of the lightest brown rice I have ever had.
The rajma was impeccable. I've been there and done that in Delhi but never a rajma this light and tasty. It was amazing. But the Minced Chicken with Hot Basil was phenomenal. ¬†One can never feel too full after eating here. The food is so tastefully done up and is so light on the tummy. The minced chicken with hot basil was everything I could ask for. The last helping was of the Thai veggie green curry. Now I must admit that I have never tasted a Thai green curry before and Pranah sealed the deal for me. I have always had a weakness towards Thailand and its gorgeous beaches but the Thai green curry was quite the revelation that made me realize that I should totally pack my bags for Thailand!

Wrapping up the gastronomic journey with the dessert that took an unexpected turn with the Orange Mint Honey Tea. Who would have thought that tea can be infused as a dessert! If you take a closer look, there lies a beautiful golden layer of honey at the bottom which when stirred, turns the orange mint tea to a delightful honey and mint orange tea. Slowly sip in, breathe and let the ambience take you away to a peaceful abode.

Small cozy little place with a book shelf. Had the chicken broth, mango cheesecake basil smoothie, tuna burger and chicken seekh kebab wrap. The broth was not good and gave it .5 less for that only. Instead of cooked chicken pieces they had put frozen salami pieces and tastes very raw. Rest everything was amazing and did feel healthy. There are great options for salads as well. The smoothie was our best order.

Little hidden gem not heavy on the pocket. Ordered 2 drinks, one was rose & cardamom iced tea which was excellent, the other was kashmiri kawah which I didn't like too much as it was out of a tea bag and had strong flavour of clove and there was no hint of saffron. 3 snacks were ordered Guilt Free Nachos, Thai Paneer Burger & Amritsari Tikki. The Nachos were amazingly crisp & weren't overtly heavy with cheese sauce. I can go back to Pranah just for the Thai Paneer Burger. Very refresing and left you wanting more. Amritsari Tikki was OK nothing to rave about. 
The staff was courteous. Overall a great experience. Will go back to try the rest of the dishes.
Gave 4 stars just because there was a slight smell in the premises.

A friend suggested this at a meeting place as we wanted to sit and chat . An ideal place , quiet , neat and clean . We ordered A pahardi corn chaat . a salad wrap and two iced ginger promogrante iced tea. The service was quick .¬†
I think the chaat was ok , it had nothing pahardi about it though . made of american corn it tasted like a corn sabzi i make at home . The iced tea was good and my friend liked the Salad wrap . Though i took a bit and felt the wrap cover was a bit hard .¬†
I would go there if i wanted to meet someone in Ballygaunj area . But i would not go only for the food . The food did not excite me at all .

Salad - We ordered a salad with mixed lettuce,pickled gherkins,olives,yellow bell pepper,golden corn and barbeque chicken ! It was delicious and a generous.

We ordered mint lemon honey tea and roast chicken wrap. The tea was damn refreshing. The honey works as perfect substitute for sugar. The roast chicken wrap was not bad either.

Healthy food has no taste - Can anyone beat this ??? Well the myth is already broken with Rahul Arora's soulful endeavour Cafe Pranah, the health cafe at Hazra Road. Tasty Salads, Finger Foods, Health Drinks and so many delicious options, that it might leave you perplexed about what to eat and what to skip. Low on calorie, high on protein foods at Pranah are lip-smacking yet wont make you heavy. Try soul salad bar, mexican rice bowl and tuna crostini among others. Soft lights, light music, wooden touch to the decor make the ambiance perfect for a healthy food palette.

I visited Cafe Pranah with a friend. It is a small well-decorated place, and also looks very clean. We ordered Kashmiri kahwa tea, a rajma galauti kebab and a roast chicken wrap. The tea was excellent, though it was brewed using a tea bag. The roast chicken wrap was good, but not exceptional. The disappointment was the rajma galauti kebab - it had been recommended by a friend, but the version we got turned out to be slightly hard pieces of bean paste, and the quantity was also very little.

Overall, it seems to be a good place to step in for tea or some other hot drink, and the ability to design one's own sandwiches, burgers and wraps seems to be a good idea, but it didn't seem exceptional.

Finally planned to give this place a visit and I discovered that a few months back this cafe was being advertised at Bon Appetit, Hazra as both belongs to one person.
Anyway, the ambience is good, dining is available both inside and outside. We had Roasted Chicken Burger and Tuna Melt Burger. Service of the cafe was poor as we saw only one person handling everything. The burgers were quite impressive. Soft buttery jumbo sized burgers filled with juicy chicken/tuna and healthy. A slice of cheese could have made it better. Now the billing process took another 15mins. A little improvement is needed.

Cute place run on a small scale with good intentions. Well, ¬†I don't know this of course but that's the vibe I got :) I can only comment on the food as I ordered takeaway. The rajma galawati was good stuff that could have been better. It was rescued by the dahi dip, a smart option. The chatpati tikki wrap was also good ¬†stuff that could have been better. It was tasty but I couldn't tell there was a veg patty inside. On my part, I did eat about a half hour when it was getting a little squidgy. Will make amends the next time :)

This place is an exception to the fact that all delicious things are fattening. Kudos to the people who came up with this concept-it helps us gorge on scrumptious food without guilt and not worry about the calorie intake. 

I have been hearing about the healthy food concept that this Cafe offers for sometime now. And it's only fit that I decide to give it a visit when I start a diet. Located on the left side at Ballygunge Phari, at a stone's throw distance from the petrol pump, this outlet houses both indoor and outdoor seating facilities. The area isn't too big, yet the ambiance is pleasant and the decor is neat. Books adorn the wall (unfortunately, not available for reading) and the entire finish is wooden. The inside has 5 tables and four or five more are placed outside. 

The cafe was empty when I went, around 5 p.m, except for two staffs too eager to receive us. I went for the following order:
1. Roasted Chicken Burger: This is a multi grain burger with fillings of lettuce, onion, ball pepper, and herb roast chicken dressed with yogurt pepper and sweet chili and Mango, and boy! It's absolutely delicious. So much so that my friend and I ended up fighting about who gets the larger share! 

2. Customised wrap with toppings of Sweet Corn, Olive, and Cucumber, filled with Chicken Sausages and dressed with Barbeque and Kashundi. This was ended up pretty good, and I can't blame them much for the tiny part it went wrong, for I got to choose how to prepare it! :P
Now this is one thing this Cafe specialises in- customising your burger, wraps and salads. I think it's not only an innovative approach, but also provides greater customer satisfaction, since you're responsible for your own food! 

3. Yogurt Parfait: This is a multilayer dessert consisting on blueberries on top, followed by yogurt, and crumbled cookies at the bottom layer. This gives a taste of cheesecake, just way healthier, and do I even say, as good? The frozen yogurt and cookies will give you very few chances of complaining! 

4. Date and Fig Kulfi: This is another innovation stirred up by the Chef. I was not too pleased with this one though, since the seeds kept bothering me, and the kulfi tasted average. 

Overall, I feel too lucky to have found this outlet, and am hoping to drop by again to satisfy my foodie self, yet not get worried about gaining those extra pounds.

Pleased to the core by the food- had the Moroccan mint, papri chaat, veg broth, chicken burger, Mexican bowl, chocolate rock and yogurt parfait. Chickpea pancake wasn't the best. It was all indeed guilt free and despite the fact that we are sooooo much, we didn't feel full in a sick way. 

Very very very very disappointed by the use of disposable plastic cutlery. The cafe's theme is centred around good health and the food lives up to it, but how exactly is a healthy body to be created and maintained when Earth's health is being compromised so brutally I am not sure. Space might not permit the cleaning of cutlery, but paper and edible cutlery can be easily used instead of such large amounts of plastic. 
Won't revisit this place again due to these unsustainable practices which were heartbreaking.

A front runner in the healthy food options in the city, Cafe Pranah provides good food options in a relatively healthier avatar.

Located in Ballygunge close to the Dhaba, this cafe gives earthy and rooted vibes. The interiors try to give you calm feel. The place is small with outside and inside seating.

Tried the following-


1) Veg tikki burger which was tasty. The bread used was brown bread and the patty was good. The sauces seemed fresh.
2) Paneer wrap which was okay. Honestly it was a big chewy, but overall the taste was decent.

The food was served in disposable takeaway boxes and was hygenic. 

The staff was cooperative! 
Prices are reasonable. 

Would come again definitely!

I wanted to try this out for a very long time and finally went today. We ordered amritsari tikia, roast chicken burgers and yogurt parfait.  I was pleasantly surprised with each item. They were all healthy and tasted delicious.  The burger was extremely filling and the dessert wouldn't leave you with any guilt or regret. Will definitely visit again.

After a long wait of more than a year, we visited Cafe Pranah. The ambience and interiors are wonderful and the chantings create a peaceful atmosphere.

Coming to the food, we ordered two kinds of wraps- Chicken Seekh Wrap and Sausages Ahoy, and one Roast Chicken Burger.

I didn't like the chicken seekh wrap as I felt it was something I could just make at home. The chicken seekh inside seemed like just another one brought out from a Venky's, and the veggies with it seemed raw. But the wrap was crispy and soft, I only wish it was more tasty. I can't deny the fact that it was filling.
The burger looked and tasted delicious and was a great meal in itself.

I heard good things about cafe pranah, so I was looking forward to a good experience here. Had visited on a weekday evening with a friend. The ambience was OK. There weren't many people, and we opted to sit inside the AC room. However it felt a bit gloomy and shady. Also our eyes were burning because of, what I'm guessing is, onions being cut nearby. 
Coming to the food, it's not as great as I was expecting. It wasn't bad mind you. We had ordered 1 lemon ginger honey tea, 1 tikki wrap, and 1 paneer pita. Only the wrap was what I would say good, others fell a bit short, but still, not bad. 
Yet, the main issue, food wise, is that the quantity served was excessively small. The above items cost a total of 500, and yet we weren't half as full. If the quantity was more, the experience would've been fine. But as it stands right now, I recommend people to give this place a pass, unless you just wanna try a wrap.

Was walking down to quest to have a coffee with some good food but on my way found this place and thought of trying something new. It was a first experience ¬†to try some health cafe. Ordered Valley of flower tea and thai paneer burger. Tea was made by preparing a tea bag from all the dried flower petal and it was good . Burger was okay. Overall a good place in Ballyguange.

Have been seeing this caf√© for years everytime we passed from Ballygunge Phari. Even though it is a diet caf√©, since the ratings were good we thought of giving it a try.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: The nice thing about this place is that, outdoor seating is available. But then there's AC inside. Ambiance was really boring, us - being the only customers. There were 3 staffs who kept busy among themselves and were less attentive. Service was swift, though.

FOOD: For our evening snack, we ordered a Roasted Chicken Burger and a Guilt-Free Nachos with BBQ Chicken.
The Burger was good. It was brown bread and there was no patty.. but strips of chicken. There was a mango sauce which went well with it. 
Guilt-Free Nachos were okay. I'm a big Nacho fan and those multi-grain nachos didn't serve my taste buds well enough. There were enough veggies and cream was substituted with yogurt.

Being a junkie food eater.. this place's food was too light for us. But on the whole it was an okay experience for us and we'll come back to try the other stuffs in the menu.

A good place to hangout with friends on a lonely afternoon!!!!!! The food quality is good and if someone is looking into having a healthy diet for a day outside home, this place is the best.... But the pocket pinch is a lil bit high compared to the quantity.... Ambience is very soothing and the staffs are helpful too!

This is placed at the outset of this review because I was shocked that this could be the case. Cafe Pranah has NO WASHROOM. I think it's serious enough to merit this comment since all caf√©s /eateries/restaurants, should have a washroom no matter what their space/money constraints are, since it's a basic facility and disregarding this seems like the establishment does not care about their customers' needs as long as they can carry on their business.¬†

Coming to the main review, I have nothing but ¬†good things to say about it.Both the indoor and outdoor spaces are well laid out; the tables are not crowded and the faux wood/ glass aesthetic feels calming on entering. However, this place really starts to stand out when evening falls as the warm lights inside and the outdoor lights begin to glow. Their menu is exciting for a south Kolkata cafe: their list of teas and salads really impressed us. We had ordered their customised salad option, Soul Salad Bar, ¬†a chamomile tea and an iced pomegranate and ginger tea, and the salad really surprised us. It was served in a large plastic container and was a more than generous portion for two. The ingredients were fresh and well balanced, and the cold lettuce felt refreshing. My friend really enjoyed the iced pomegranate and ginger tea, but I felt that the ginger was a little too overpowering, something that can be easily righted, I feel. Their chamomile tea was standard quality and infused well.

Seeing that this is such a great place and one I'd love to bring friends to, it seems a bit disappointing to note its lack of a washroom, and I'm going to dock one whole point from my rating for this. I hope that the management takes up this issue and does something about it, because it marred my experience of an otherwise great place.

Words may fall short if I start describing the place and our experience. Starting from the tea varieties to the eatables everything according to us was just perfect. The food as they mention "guilt free" was too good. I specially liked their "rose and cardamom iced tea", "classic lemon iced tea", "guilt free nachos" and their "customized" salad. If salads are these, I am sure I can spend the whole day on them only. Ambience: too good. Location: ballygunge phari. Just can't wait to visit them again üíú

Just the place to be if you're feeling guilty of all the unhealthy food you've been stuffing yourself with. We have tried the burgers that are immensely tasty and even the vegetarian fare is pretty good, with a variety of dressings as flavours. The drinks are good too although with quirky tastes. The outdoor seating arrangement is perfect. The location is also very convenient right beside the Dhaba.

Near Ballygunge Phari, this cafe is a quite a relaxing place...with the minimal amount of seats this place has a charming ambience. 
Had been here once, ordered a Kashmiri Qawah (Iced tea with cinnamon presentation) and a Roasted Chicken Burger.
Qawah was highly refreshing, and burger patty was tasty making it luscious as a whole.
Pricing is more or less moderate.
Staffs are prompt and service is fast.
Although they require improvement in sitting arrangements, well they have a few outside sitting arrangements as well.
Recommended. üò∏

Took a short break from work and had a chance to visit this nearby cafe which is located at ballygunge phari . Tried the ROAST CHICKEN WRAP and YOGURT PARFAIT. The wooden cafe decor is nice with both inside and outdoor seatings , servers are friendly. The wrap was a healthy one in terms of constituents but seemed to be a smaller one when comparing with the price. The dessert was a calorie cutting version of blueberry cheesecake , with the same cookie base and blueberry compote topping , not much upto my liking as i am not a yogurt liking person. Their concept of serving healthy food is very catchy and creative , though some more additions to the menu besides wraps burgers and salads would have done better.

3)desserts-yogurt parfait(super super yummy,a must hav),carrot raisin muffin( when i ordered i was doubtful whether it was right to order, but it cem it was so soft n yummy),kala jamun yogurt( this dish wasnt there in the menu,i was lucky to b present on the day it was available,its a request from me : please add it in the menu i would want it in all my next visits)
4)varieties of sauces( we tasted quite a few before ordering.
5) food is served in disposable plates.

This place is a boon for people on a diet, cause you can choose anything and everything without worrying about the extent of calories consumed.
Of the drinks we ordered, wild berry smoothie(yoghurt based) and mango basil cheesecake snoothie(yoghurt and honey based) were the clear winners.
The Galawti kebab is a rajma based hence healthy for those who miss the kebabs and is a must eat.Soft and spicy just as we like it.
The tikki wrap truly proves how healthy food can still be yumm .Crunch of the lettuce and bite of the tikki. Nom nom.
But when here one musnt miss the nachos. Yoghurt sauce instead of cheese , the very fresh salsa with green yellow peppers, olives ...might even be better than the cheesy nachos we eat. I could happily buy a bagful of those mulitigrain nachos for my munch munch.
Couscous bowl and mexican rice were the next dishes we ordered. Here is were the disappointment set in. Both the dishes had similar sauces. But couscous was tangier spicier and tastier than its sweeter cousin.
On another occassion I had ordered the chickpea pasta salad, which too had a similar taste and same veggies, so be wise and order any one of the three.
For desserts we had the apple skewers , it is like having an apple pie without the pastry.
 You gotta eat here . 
Not becausr you are on a diet but because food is delicious!!
P.S. the yoghurt dip ia nice and creamy and yumm. Request it with your wraps .

Had been wanting to try this out for a while. It's a cafe with a soothing ambience and a focus on healthy eating - quite a stark contrast to the bustling Ballygunge Phari area where it's located which is teeming with traffic and people eating at roadside stalls.

I ordered a Lemon Honey Tea and the Chicken Seekh Wrap. Was a bit surprised to see that the serving was in express style i.e. wraps served in plastic tray, plastic cutlery etc. However both the tea and the wrap were refreshing and delicious respectively. Service was adequate.

Cafe Pranah, located in the prime spot near Ballyguange Phari the Cafe draws the attention the moment you stepped inside of it due to its minimalist yet warm ambience. The open air sitting arrangement is certainly not fit for a hot summer afternoon. But the cafe's main charm lies into its menu. Long variety of dishes that is too focusing on calorie and health conscious people. What else is needed for a gym freak like me!

Located beside The Dhaba at Ballygunge Phari More, just before Birla Mandir if you are going there from Gariahat, this place turned out to be a horrifying experience for me. The food quality was not upto the mark and coupled with the high price, it is one of the worst places for a non vegetarian food lover. The ambience and seating of the place does give a nice look to it. They have a good collection of books as well. However altogether by entire experience here was nothing short of a catastrophe.

Pranah has to be a personal favorite when it comes to guilt-free indulgence. The Summer Coolers festival is just what one needs to refresh themselves in the Kolkata heat without piling on unwanted calories. The festival includes naturally flavored popsicles and summer drinks. The ice-candies on offer are Aam ka panna, Musk melon with ginger and honey, Wild berry and lemon, Masala mojito, Watermelon and mint and Mango with basil seeds. All priced at Rs. 79 plus taxes. My favorite amongst them were the Musk Melon and Ginger and the Masala Mojito. The latter had actual lemon pieces inside the popsicle. 
They are offering a wide variety of naturally flavored drinks, my personal favourites being the Barley followed by the hibiscus. 
The festival ends on 15th June and must not be missed

Cafe Pranah lies distinct at the Ballygunge Phari crossing opposite to the Chinese Pavilion, and hence is easy to locate. The hoarding and the caption distinctly affirms that the place promotes healthy and tasty food. I had been there yesterday evening along with a friend to laze away some time. The place looked decent and neat from outside and have exterior open seating arrangements too ! But abolition of smoking in an open area at cafe makes me sad, and hence I went inside to seat in the comfort of the AC.¬†
Coming to the food, we ordered their customized salad with 7-toppings, two layered chicken (chicken sausages and their homemade herb based chicken) with an icing of exotic eggless mayonnaise and sweet lemon sauce. The salad was fresh and tasted excellent. A highly recommended dish.¬†
We also ordered the Guiltful Nachos which was made very nicely by the staff with proper amount of chicken, golden corn and veggies, however the layer of baked nachos failed to impress me because I personally feel that they should have options of selecting various nachos of different makes, and not just Oats nachos.¬†
Last but not the least, we ordered Vegan Cold coffee, which seemed ordinary to me going by the high expectations set by them, yet tasted good.
Special mention goes to their service which took away an extra half brownie point from my side. The staffs were jovial with a bright smile and decent behavior which was absolutely worth appreciating. Cheers to the Pranah team and wish them the best of luck for their future endeavors !

Each and every ingredient was synonym of fresh!! 
Its been 3 months that I have relocated in Kolkata. Me and my Sister, we stroll around the city every weekend in search of good food joints here in the Food Paradise of the country and this place is for sure a gem!!
We had #coolers #RoastedChickenWrap #GuiltFreeNachos 
It was worth every penny spent!!

Cafe Pranah is a place I absolutely love to hang out. Usually I always feel guilty when I eat out but never when I visit this lovely Cafe because not only is the food awesome but healthy as well. Therefore when I got a call from Chef Rahul Arora about the month long Iced Candy and Summer Cooler Festival at Cafe Pranah I was super excited. We landed up on a muggy evening and what unfolded was pure happiness.

I always wanted to visit this place as I had a diff feel for this place. As the name in itself is so soothing and gives a positive vibes. So today when I was in Kol for some work me n my guy decided to visit this place and end up being there in the late afternoon. 
The moment we reached there I saw a smiley face of one of the cafe guy which gave a very positive vibes and felt really good. Unless you go there you won't get that fresh soothing and positive feel. 
We ordered for one black coffee one green tea (premium infusions) and guilt free nachos and everything was just what we wanted totally up to mark. Price is very reasonable.
So if you wanna drink healthy n eat healthy this is the place to be sure shot recommendations. 
Good job team Cafe Pranah

Cafe Pranah is located at a walking distance from Ballygaunge Phari. The Cafe has both options of seating inside and outside . I chose sit inside as it was very hot. The decor is very nice and I liked that they have books to read. I ordered roast chicken wrap, chicken seekh wrap and from the ice candies section masala mojito.  The wraps were quite delicious and I liked the ice candy as well. Would love again to go this place.

I had been planning to go here in forever and finally made it last month; like they say some good things are worth the wait. I instantly fell in love with this cosy place and the lovely menu. Was extremely refreshing. I ordered fruit of the forest and  I did not like the spices in it but the staff was willing to change it immediately (guess they figured my love for food) to mango basil cheesecake smoothie which I relished so so much! Then I ordered the Tikki burger which was good and filling along with couscous  salad: which was very flavoursome but the couscous was a bit over cooked which made it very soggy but I still enjoyed it because of the perpetration along with fresh cucumber dip. It looks like this place has someone's private collection of books which almost felt like its my bookshelf. This place reflects and foodie passion and for that this place gets big thumbs up! Surely going back to try more dishes!

Love the interiors and the ambience. Was my first time here and I was not disappointed. Ordered the Tuna Melt Wrap and really liked the fact that it is healthy and tasty at the same time... difficult to come across that combo!! 
Will definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu :)

The synthetic grass floor with the contrasting black chairs is what welcomes you to this cafe's outdoor seating. Nice ambience! The indoor is also well made up with a relaxed drawing room kinda interior. The waiters are helpful and will help you with the menu( though i was a bit upset with the choice i made of chicken salami instead of roasted chicken in my salad.) You can enjoy the soothing chants going on as background music while u bit into ur food or take a sip. so ambience:3.8 .Next comes food:3.5 as its damn healthy and tasty also, but people who enjoy spicy and rich food would find it less satisfying. We ordered a roasted chicken burger ehich was nice , an ensembled salad, yougurt perfait, then the dates and fig frozen desert, which were all very filling quantity wise and quality was fresh. Though i wish the salad would have an extra topping of mayonese for i am a mayo lover. It was also lil too salty, but the crunch and mix were lovely. I just wish the yougurt parfait was made out of some more delicious cookies instead of the buttery versions they used. I would surely have all these items again. Service :3.5 since it was only us and another table of people who were there still the service was a lil late. Hope it turns better. Over all a dieter's paradise to try the tasty food while you are on a diet and can enjoy a nice chat with your loved ones in a casual and quality time.

A recent visit to the cafe pranah satisfied me immensely. Being on a diet, the food their was a saviour. I called for mango cheesecake shake with yoghurt as my base and sugar free, it was just perfect, I loved it. My friend loved his iced tea. Next was a sausage chickpea pancake.... Yummy, very well done. We ended our meal with a sugar free kulfi which I loved to the care. I have to come back for their salads soon. The interiors are simple yet relaxing and the service is good :)

This place was in my bucket list from quite a lot of time. I would describe this place as a simple and serene one with whole lot of nutritious food. The ambience is good. The interiors are quite simple. It's sort of homely atmosphere. 
The menu has a lot of nutritious food in it. Among them I had ordered for the below :

‚Ä¢Rajma Ki Galwati - These tikki kebabs were made out of Rajma. It was soft and had a very less amount of oil in it. And the best part of it was it was made out of olive oil. Which is again very healthy.
‚Ä¢Roasted Chicken Burger - This was delicious. The bread used in the burger was multigrain bread with lots of veggie fillings and shredded chicken inside it. It was really yummy.
‚Ä¢ Chatpati Tikki Wrap - Well my vegan friend loved this wrap. It had a balanced flavour and tasted good aswell.
‚Ä¢ Cold Coffee - The cold coffee was just perfect.
‚Ä¢ Buttermilk - I exactly don't remember the name of this drink, but it was buttermilk with a minty twist. Good for beating the heat.

Overall my experience to this cafe was a good one. Perfect for a cheat day in your diet plan. Healthy food even tastes good !! I would surely look forward to visiting this cafe again.

Right at the ballygune phari crossing, yet a bit hidden away from the honks is cafe Pranah. It has a small outdoor seating which can be an option for winters but otherwise you must walk right into the bright warm cafe. The menu is interesting with a dose of good food prepared with the right kind of ingredients for the health conscious. They make tortillas without oil and take extra care to make the dressings with real good healthy alternatives. Think multigrain for sandwiches, fresh salads, good healthy oil less wraps, assorted herbs and goodness of seeds all packed into the options. I sipped an orange ice tea with shavings of orange peel in it to get instantly refreshed in this heat. The rajma ki galawti is a must try..good protein for good health and great treat for your taste buds. You could also try their roasted chicken burger. It's been given a good twist by adding a sweet chilli and mango dressing. The non veg wraps are also a good mix of non veg and veggies for the right mix of health and taste. It's great to have an option like cafe Pranah where you can have healthy yet tasty food served with smiles.

That week two of my friends had come from Mumbai, and that day was such a boring day for us, since entire day we were at home sleeping whole day. It was late in the evening when we decided to go out to some good cafe to spend good time and grab some good food on the go! I instantly took to Zomato search and the name of this particular cafe Pranah grabbed my attention and I decided to visit this place.
We booked an Ola from my apartment to the cafe, and it took hardly 15 minutes for us to reach there. Its easy to locate, as it is located overlooking the main road in Ballygunge Phari. 
The entrance of the cafe reads a big sized decorated billboard written "Cafe Pranah". The entrance takes us to an outside seating area with artificial grass flooring and wooden tables and chairs well arranged. Though the outdoor area was much pleasing and appealing, I preferred sitting inside in the AC due to the summers. 
The indoor decor was equally pleasing. The decor was all wooden. Light Brown colored walls, with wooden furniture, dark brown colored wooden tables and chairs. The reception area and the open kitchen was included within the cafe area itself. On one wall, there was a kind of window pane white colored, with racks made in there. The topmost rack had electric lanterns lit on the sides, with a statue of the Buddha centrally placed. The two lower racks had various books on fiction, non fiction, essays etc. The decor was added up by the various wall hangings, and the beautifully oainted ceiling with lights. The lighting of the cafe was good, and everything added up to the ambience of the place which was peaceful, quiet and relaxing indeed. There was a pleasant aroma all over the cafe.
The waiters, I found, very helpful, friendly and suggestive. They brought us water and the menu. I always prefer to start with drinks. So I ordered an Orange Iced Tea and Cold Coffee (Iced Coffee), one each. The Cold coffee seemed pretty blank but it tasted really well, thick, with the perfect blend of caffeine flavours and ice. Loved it! 
The Orange Iced Tea was refreshing as well! Loved the well infused orange flavour and the cold tea. Refreshing and soothing!
Next we ordered our customised salad from the Soul Salad Bar on the menu. I opted for a mixed salad base of various kinds of lettuce, with toppings of green, red and yellow bellpeppers, olives and jalapenos and golden corns, with the precooked dressing of Herb Roast Chicken, continued with the dressings of Sweet Chilli and Mango, and Mayonnaise. The Salad, when served, looked so tempting and healthy! And yeah tasted wow equally as well. It had an adequate quantity of everything asked for, tasted great, and healthy as well. We all loved every bit of the salad.
After the salad, I was on a spree to have another Iced Tea and this time (on the suggestion of the staff) went for the Kashmiri Quawah Iced Tea which was a cinnamon flavoured drink. This tasted refreshing and tasty too, with the perfect tea taste and the flavour of the cinnamon with a cinnamon stick dipped in the drink! Loved it!
The bill was also quite pocket friendly. And I will visit this place soon once more to try their specialities and drinks!

This cafe had been on my wish list for quite sometime. Finally visited it and though the outdoor sitting looked pleasing,as it was a very hot day we choose to sit inside in the ac. The ambience was soothing and apt for a cafe with wooden chairs and tables and books on the rack. The waiters were friendly nd helpful. We ordered a salad comprising of mixed lettuce,mixed bell peppers,onion, tomato and herbed roast chicken. The sauces sweet chilli nd mango and yoghurt pepper were flavourful. We ordered a raw mango mojito..it was a little too sour..bt the taste kind of grows on with you..and it tasted refreshing while we were having the salad.Its consistency is thick and thus enough for 2. Lastly we ordered the dark chocolate muesli..its crunchy..filled with raisins..nd tasty!!
The bill came to ‚Çπ 453 including taxes.
A healthy cafe with minimal pocket pinch serving tasty food in good quantity.

Three of us visited the Cafe.The small cafe has indoor and outdoor seating. But being a very hot day we sat indoors. The decor was soothing and comfortable. Service was good and efficient. We ate roast chicken wrap, roast chicken nachos, tuna bruschetta and some chat. Everything was fast and healthy. I would have like some more lemon to be served with the food. We drank darjeeling tea, earl grey tea and ginger tea. The earl grey was not OK. They should try a different brand of tea! But over all we all like the food ambience and music of the cafe. Definite go back again.

After reading reviews on zomato, my heart went out for this place. It offered healthy food and guilt free indulgence. We went there yesterday evening (sunday). The ambience was good. Though the place is small, also has outdoor seating the mood was set right with all spritual stuff, books n soulful calming instrumentals. It was soooo relaxing. Fortunately the place was vacant. We two were only ones. We decided on mango cheesecake smoothie with yoghurt n honey base. For salads we took 5 toppings priced at Rs 189  + pre cooked topping at Rs. 39. We chose mixed lettuce leaves, red bell pepper, olives, mixed dry nuts, gherkins, corn with homemade salsa dressing n cheese base. Pre cooked toppings - chicken herb sumthing. 
The food arrived n it was pure bliss. We loved it. Its good to c ppl coming up with such cuisine, were kolkatans are all bout chinese n biryani. 
Its a must visit if u love peace n healthy eating. The staff is very cordial as well.

I have forever been search of such a place and I must admit, the long lookout for soul food comes to an end with the discovery of this place! The perfect blend of healthy food which also portrays itself as a soul seeker, this is one of the best possible things to have happened in Kolkata. 

First things first, I must congratulate the owner for coming up with such a concept! We are familiar with the likes of Subway and other cafe's which probably provides similar kind of items. So what's the difference? The difference lies in the sheer innovation, combination of flavors and then making them available to the common people. For us foodies, we have always been bugged by the monopoly market of the existing giants and we should accept, that we had almost got bored by their presence. Same old menu, same old food, not much of new introductions, and on top of that detoriorating quality with steep increase in the prices. It is only when you land up here, you realise how much of a change we have and finally we have something we can regard as our own Desi Version of soul food!

I reside in a place which is very close to probably the first professional venture of the owner to establish a food outlet (Am not sure if there were any before, but I guess the one I am talking about is the first one). I have seen the cafe in Salt Lake, some 11-12 years back, if not more when all it had was some mediocore tables and chairs and a single display case showing off the food items. Times changed and with years passing by, it developed to a much posh giant with another branch in Salt Lake. Right after these many years, the owner has moved to another direction, yet maintaining the simplicity of the food items we have seen in his earlier venture.

Speaking of Pranah, I came across the signboard many-a-times while passing by Ballygunge Phari, but never actually had the opportunity or the chance to drop by due to shortage of time. It is only when, that I saw showers of compliments and praises bestowed upon this cafe by fellow foodies, I decided its time I should check this out on my own. So, one fine evening (Last Friday), I came by here. For people, looking for a direction, if you are coming from Gariahat, just cross the Petrol Pump at Ballygunge Phari, which is located bang opposite Kwality. Walk straight for 30 seconds, and this cafe would fall to your left.

As you walk in, you would see  a couple of sitting arrangements made outside in the open air with a clear signboard saying 'No Smoking' ( I absolutely hate this :-(.....). There is also a separate sitting arrangement in an enclosed section which has air conditioned facility in it. The inside cabin is not huge. Probably has 6-7 tables with a couple of chairs (Hope I counted the number correctly). Right in front of you would be the counter with three of four guys on the opposite side of it welcoming you with a warm smile.

I quickly managed to find a place. The cafe was partially filled up. Ordered for a customized salad comprising of:-

a) Mixed Lettuce Base

b) Tomatoes, Cucumber, Golden Corn, Yellow Ball Pepper and Mixed Nuts (Have a query here; refer to bottom please)

c) Herb Roast Chicken and Sunny Side up

d) Pepper Yogurt and Mint & Raw Mango Chutney

Along with this, for drinks I went for a Melon Mint Medley. The drink was delivered first and then the salad came over. It took 10-15 minutes to serve both. By then, the owner dropped by to deliver some raw materials. :-) I quietly began to enjoy the drink while listening to some music. The watermelon was perfect in taste, just the way it should be, with slight hint of mint. Although, I would say, I am slightly disappointed here. I was expecting the mint to be slightly stronger or may be some other ingredients to really pack a punch here. That is, if I compare adding a Raw Mango Chutney to a Salad ranks way above than the presence of Mint in the Watermelon. I would have had gone for other peppery and spicy drinks, but those are something I am really not comfortable with!

The star of the day was the salad! For a customized salad, things can go wrong if you choose just one wrong ingredient! Yet, the salad was perfectly done and I could have had wished for no other alteration. The lettuce base was crunchy, although I felt that their quantity could have been reduced. The chicken was wonderfully grilled and the entire plastic box was overloaded with chunks of chicken. Probably one of the best chicken toppings, I have had in ages. The tomatoes and cucumbers were fresh and added the juicy component to the salad. The nuts were roasted and went really well with the veggies. The yogurt and pepper sauce was good as well, but the pepper portion was hitting my tongue way too much than I would have had liked them to be. What really exceeded my expectations, was the Mint & Raw Mango Chutney. It had a infusion of mint which added the zing part and the raw mango added a tangy flavor to the salad. Just the way I would have liked it. I absolutely had no issues in finishing the salad on my own in my own sweet time. If I would have wanted something to change here, I would have probably added the sauce content a bit more. At times, I felt the salad went dry and I could had really used sprinkling of some extra sauce here.

For parcel, I ordered for a customized 'Wrapped up'.

a) Cucumber, Tomatoes and Mixed Nuts

b) Salami, Sausages and Herb Roasted Chicken

c) Mint & Raw Mango Chutney and Home Made Salsa.

The wrap was also prepared pretty quickly. By then, it was almost 9 and I asked for the bill. Two of the best meal I had just ordered and the total price was just Rs. 570/- (approx). A steal of a deal. Clearly tax portion was included in the menu.

Upon returning home, I quickly dug myself upon the wrap. By then, the tortilla had gone broken at few portions, probably due to the moisture. But nevertheless, I was t the comfort of my home. The veggies were fresh here as well and the nuts added a nice crunch to them. The quality as well the quantity of all three varieties of chicken was commendable. A perfect value for money. The homemade salsa complimented the Raw Mango Chutney like a perfect soul sister. Together, it was one hell of a meal!

A little query:- 

a) For the customized salad, I got pretty confused with the rate asked for Step 2 (Fresh Green toppings). While at the beginning, it says Rs. 20 per topping and then lists the greens, immediately after it lists a separate price for five/seven/nine toppings. Does those apply for greens? Is it mandatory to take a minimum of five toppings atleast? if yes, why has those been mentioned afterwards and not in the beginning? Also, would then Rs. 20 per topping mean Rs. 20 per extra topping beyond the set limit of 9 toppings?

My initial assumption was those were mentioned for the non-veg entries but the waiter attending to me insisted that those were for the veggies. This part of the menu has been poorly written down and needs urgent modification.

b) Why is there no option to add extra dressings? (Even on payment)?

Nevertheless, these little cons surely outweighs the pros here. The menu is vast and diverse and gives you  more than enough options to play with your tastebuds and explore your culinary expertise. The ingredients are fresh and the dressings do not overpower the non-veg toppings. Nor do the toppings dominate the likes of the veggies and the dressings. The salads adds the perfect juiciness and the presence of the nuts for sure is a great advantage. If you are bored of the constant likes of noodles, chicken, pizza, sausages and blah blah blah, drop whatever you are doing, and drop in here right today! No need to take anyone. I hate to share my soul, err soul food with anyone else!

It was a casual meet with a friend and we both wanted to keep it light, so we headed to Cafe Pranah at Ballygunge. It's a little cafe with a very zen-like aura about it, complete with prayer flags and wind chimes. The menu primarily focuses on healthy eating and consists of popular dishes with a healthy twist without compromising on the taste. Well, that's quite a good news for us health-freaks who are torn in the eternal battle between love for food and desperate attempts to keep the flabby arms at bay.¬†¬†We took a seat outside and I think it was a mistake, because the heat and dust outside was quite a menace, wreaking havoc on our table and food.¬†
We ordered a Roast Chicken Wrap and A salad with Tuna and Chicken and 3 kinds of dressing, mango being one of them.
The Wrap was really good, and one can easily discern the freshness of the ingredient by taking the first bite off it. It was filled with freshly chopped peppers, Roasted chicken and various sauces which didn't overpower the flavour of the other ingredients.¬†
The Salad was great too, with the mango dressing lending a distinct tartness to the chicken and Tuna combo. However, I didn't like the presentation of the salad much. It looked quite similar to the one we get at Subway and I wouldn't want my Cafe Pranah Salad to look like the Subway one please.

The service was great, the wait staffs were knowledgeable and attentive, providing useful inputs from time to time. Overall it was a great experience and I am definitely going back again.

A big thumbs up for the location of this place cause one will easily locate it once they are in ballygunge phari. My friend was in the mood for having something on the healthier side so I took up the opportunity of trying out this place which was in my list for a long time. While entering this place one will notice the artificial green grass floor which definitely sets the mood but alas beside it there is the dirty surrounding of repairing shops etc. nevertheless we sat inside. We were really struggling with the menu as we were finding it difficult to decipher but with the help of the staff we were successful in ordering our food.

We went for mango basil cheesecake smoothie and given the option of choosing the base and sweetener we went for yogurt and honey respectively. The drink was very quickly served and was really thick and worth the price of rs. 179 as it was also very tasty.

Then we ordered couscous ensemble with roasted chicken topping and salad which we had to make according to our choice. In salad we chose the base to be of mixed lettuce and then we went for 5 topping those were corn,olive,cucumber, jalape√±o, onion and for precooked topping we chose chicken salami. For dressing we asked the staff to suggest us something and listening to him we chose yogurt pepper and sweet chilli mango. The preparation  area was open so we could see the people preparing the orders for us which I personally liked. They served the couscous ensemble first but we were expecting the salad to be served before. 
The couscous ensamble was really tasty with nuts and pickles and veggies, chicken pieces and the tangyness was well balanced with other flavours. 
After we were done with couscous we were served with the salad and one bite into it we realised that it was quite spicy and both of us were not comfortable with the level of spicyness. We should have picked our own sauces instead of going with the spicy ones anyway we requested the staff to tone down the spicyness with some other flavour and he did help after that we could finish the salad. Our bill amount was rs 675 (approx ). I would recommend this place to all those who want to try out something healthy and tasty at the same time. The quantity of the food served is also very satisfactory

Are you bored of having pastas, sizzlers, noodles, burgers,etc? Are you looking for a place which serves very light and healthy dishes, dishes which are low in oil content, cholesterol or even less fat content? This surely is the place to vouch for. The name itself sounds spiritual and the decor inside the outlet is also comparable.
Plenty of books, Buddha statues and nicely lit interior will surely make you feel relaxed.
Enough seating space and a convenient location is a plus point.
Food: We started with coolers; orange ice tea, pomegranate cum ginger ice tea and raw mango mohito. The ice tea contained a lot of ice which dissolved of the flavour and taste of the tea. So I would request the management to look into this and do necessary modifications. Raw mango mohito (aam panna served in a different way) was the best among the three and I would endorse this.
We also ordered veg Nachos which was a complete package. It contained vegetables like sweet corn, black olives, capsicum, tomato, little bit of mayonnaise. Moreover the nachos were made of whole grain; maintaining the health benefits of the dish. It is a must-try at this place.
My friends ordered salad which contained abundant amount of vegetables, chicken seekh and mixed nuts. They totally loved this and were eventually full after finishing as the quantity is enough for two.@
Would love to visit this place again and try out the desserts and wraps.

Been there a couple of times and I truly do love the place, it's a nice easy to locate venue, it's right on the main road. The ambiance is subtle but inviting with options for outdoor seating as well.¬†

Coming to their menu, it's a menu designed for both innovative foodies as well as those who might not be into experimenting with their food. In my opinion I prefer making my meal from scratch and have not had a disappointing end result till date.¬†

Chamomile Tea was the beverage of my choice on both visits, nothing much to comment on this, tea with a tea bag, nothing special.¬†

As for our meal we had wraps and I cannot recommend their wraps enough. If made right, they are truly a delight. The bread they are wrapped in is beautifully thin yet sturdy enough to hold a generous amount of stuffing. Their quantity however leaves you wanting a little more. However, they will remain on your taste buds for a long time. They have a unique range of dressings and sauces, choice in veggies and so on.¬†

Their Dark Chocolate and Muesli Rocks in the dessert section is a sinfully healthy dessert. The combination of dark chocolate and muesli works in sinful harmony.¬†

Overall: Excellent food, excellent quality, quantity in my opinion could be a little more, good ambiance and a friendly staff.

Customized salads are always a gamble - a dressing ordered wrong here, or an extra in-cohesive topping added wrong there, could result in bad food on the plate. I have often dreaded that I was going to land up with something horrible every time I have ordered myself an entirely customized salad, and then I would only have had myself to blame for such gastronomical misery, if that happened ! Luckily at Pranah, the wonderful staff asked us our requirements, and offered to make us one on their discretion based on our requirements. This is an extremely customer-friendly smart move, and one that works very well in a food demography where we hardly have the culture of excessive customization in food orders, unlike America. 

Thus, we were served a lovely salad with iceberg lettuce, green bell pepper, corn, cucumber, tomato and mixed nuts with chicken seekh as precooked topping, dressed in sweet chilli and mango and herb cheese sauce. Salads have been Pranah's specialty, and this one turned out to be excellent. The veggies were chilled, fresh and chopped uniformly, but it was the dressing that added a zing to it. But, what really elevated the salad to another level were two items - first, the chicken seekh, which was very soft and tasty but subdued in spice than an usual Sheekh Kebab so as not to overshadow other ingredients, and second, the tossed white sesame seeds, which added a crunchy texture, and balanced out the sweetness and sourness of the dressing. This has been the best salad I have had in a while in Calcutta, and I recommend that you do try out at least one salad, if you visit Pranah. 

We also had the Vegetarian Nachos. Now, every time I have had Nachos, it has come loaded with cheese or other heavy dressings, quite naturally, and to alienate these two in my mind, took me a while.  It was only after I have had a few bites of the healthy Nachos served here, that the taste sunk in, and when it did, I quite liked it. The Nachos were made out whole-wheat probably and not tortilla chips, and topped with a very spiced, chaat-ish mixture of baked beans, onions, tomatoes, sweet corn, cucumber, capsicum, black olives with a light spicy mayo dressing, but not made too Indianised as well. My only feedback is to serve it on an open, spread out plate, instead of a box, so that the Nachos lying below are not left without toppings towards the end of the meal. 

We ordered three drinks between ourselves to gulp down the food. Both the pomegranate - ginger iced and the orange iced tea tasted refreshing, but didn't have any zing, or tea flavour. The raw mango mojito was a better drink, though the texture was very powder-y, the masala cola/ jaljeera masala had completely overshadowed the raw mango flavour. Unfortunately, the drinks showed much less innovation and skill than their food counterparts. 

All the prices are inclusive of tax. The servings are very generous, and the service is prompt. All in all, a damn good place and one which doesn't have too many substitutes or competition in the relatively un-explored health food cafe category in Calcutta !

Health conscious? Then this is the perfect place for you. Initially, I was reluctant to visit this place for its 'healthy food' tag and how could healthy food be tasty? But, today's experience did change my total mindset.

The location is very prominent, near ballygunge phari. The banner to the entrance reads 'health and soul cuisine'. There is both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangement, with an accommodation capacity of around 40 people. Since it was evening, we preferred sitting inside. The interior decor is quite good. There is also a book shelf on one of the side walls.

As we were thirsty, we decided to start with coolers. We opted for orange iced tea, pomegranate and ginger iced tea and raw mango mojito.

The drinks disappointed us to some extent. The pomegranate and ginger iced tea looked good but tasted bland. The flavour of tea was lacking. The orange iced tea was better than the former, but not impressive. It had a slight orange flavour with an orange slice added on top. The raw mango mojito had ta tangy taste. It was thick, consistent throughout and very refreshing, but unfortunately the amount of jaljeera masala was so high that the flavour of raw mango got hidden. Still, it was better than the other drinks.

Next, we had nachos. The dish looked very colourful. With one bite, I was completely blown away by the taste. The whole grain nachos were thin and crispy. The topping was of onions, tomatoes, sweet corn, cucumber, capsicum, black olives with a light spicy mayo dressing. The dish was full of flavours. Each ingredient was fresh and juicy. This was the best nachos I had till date. Moreover, it was healthy

Last of all, we tried their salad, which is actually the speciality of pranah. We were confused with the toppings and dressings since the variety was huge. The person who took our order assured that he will make the salad to our liking. It came in a plastic box, with huge quantity. The base was of iceberg lettuce. The fresh toppings were green bell pepper, corn, cucumber, tomato and mixed nuts with chicken seekh as precooked topping. The dressing was of sweet chilli and mango and herbed cheese sauce. It was heavenly! I could never imagine a healthy salad to be so tasty. The two distinct sauces were mixed thoroughly thought the salad to give the same tangy taste. The chicken was soft and well cooked. The salad was a sure winner.

Overall, we were very satisfied with the food. The last two dishes won our hearts. The drinks need to be worked upon. Keeping in mind the health factor, there was no compromise with the taste. A thumbs up to the entire team for that!

A cafe with a difference..we ordered amritsari tikia,roast chicken wrap and dark chocolate and muesli rocks..the food was tasty but it seems they make it more healthier so not too much oily and spicy..They had  an open kitchen so the smoke made us bit uncomfortable so then we opted to sit outside..

It is a pretty place as far as the decor and outdoor sitting arrangement is concerned,but when it comes to food,the whole experience was very disturbing! Probably major portions of whatever we ordered was made with curd and was tasteless :( even the cold coffee was as tasteless as the others.

This place came up with the idea of Soul Food, which itself was pretty intriguing. he space has been utilized well to match the ambiance with the concept. However, the soulful experience may get marred by the traffic noises of the busy street on which it is located.¬†
I ordered a tea, a salad and a dessert. The tea was good, though nothing exceptional in taste or presentation. But the salad, oh my God, was exceptional. Its sure to satiate your hunger and your mind too, with all its colours, flavours and textures. Also, there is ample room for customization, something which I always look forward to.¬†
The dessert was a healthier version of a cheesecake, but just didn't have the magic. Honey in place of sugar in the base just didn't work for me, and hampered the whole texture. But yes, having said so, it is only logical to have reasonable expectations from low-fat desserts.¬†
On the whole, I really liked this place, and would recommend it to anyone bored of the regular cafes in every alley.

Cafe pranah is located in Ballygunge phari opp chinese pavillion. Its a very small place and claims itself to be a healthy joint which is quite true seeing their snack and salad section of the menu. Even they have tea to detoxify. The lemon ginger honey tea and kashmiri kahwa was perfect for the chilly winter in Kolkata. Quite liked them. Service was good. Pricing okay..give it a try

Located near Ballygunge Phari, Cafe Pranah impresses you visually with its stunning interior decor. One of the most decorated cafes that i have seen, Cafe Pranah also provides outside sitting arrangement. I went there only once and ordered Kashmiri Quawah Iced tea. The taste was refreshing, although it didnt seem value for money as you get half glass of ice along with the quawah tea at Rs. 109+ taxes. Its a costly place, as i felt, but its visually amusing.

Ok, so one day I decide to eat healthy owing to the sumptuous meals that I generally have during my short visits to Kolkata. I came across this amazing place located next to a 'dhaba' (ironical as it sounds) offering healthy yet delicious food. The two main items on their menu namely salads and sandwiches were not available due to a miscommunication with suppliers resulting in a loss of inventory! Since I stuck to my word of eating healthy I decided to order some chickpea pancakes which did not impress me much. I suggest revamping the menu since the concept is nice and one which modern day food lovers can relate to.

Came across this place while returning from the Birla Mandir.. the moment i spotted it.. i could recall what its famous for.. yes, healthy food with a twist. I really liked the ambience.. we opted for the outdoor seating.. which was quite comfy.. it was around 9 .. that was supposedly the kitchen's closing time.. so the staff was in a hurry.. yet they were courteous enough. I liked the decor. I like the colorful paper napkins .. but i dont know i quite did not like the idea of serving water in such small plastic glasses. 
We had black coffee and sausage ahoy! And dark chocolate mueseli rocks.
I must say the food tastes amazing also being healthy. I am not really a low calorie diet loving person. I hate the idea of such food. But this place changed my idea entirely. All the items were amazing. I had never known healthy can be tasty . Thank you Cafe Pranah.

A tiny lil austere place at first glance , even the menu might seem full of non conventional mix of things, not so comprehensive to some 

Usp: truly a Pranic healthy food place , take things with a pinch of salt

Happened to meet the owner on my visit, a food blogger and enthusiast who has a thorough knowledge of his work , impressive 

Newly launched : nachos
The tortilla is a home experiment made with five different flours and no refined flour (maida) 

Salad is a one meal dish! Make your own combo , was almost like having subway without the sub 

My mix: Salad: cucumber, jalepinos, ice berg lettuce, herbed cheese sauce, tomatoes and salsa 

Would like to experiment more things there.

Also try: Mandarin magic drink

Post the overwhelming Zomato reviews, I went to the place with high expectations and received a reality check. 
The decor was minimal, service was slower than I would have liked. Ice teas were good nothing extraordinary and so was the carrot cake.
The real deal was the Salad. Out of the world it was! 1 tip. Choose the dressing carefully. Ask for suggestions, they are ready to talk

Today i dropped in with two of my friends to catch up after a long time. The same owner of bon appetite cafes found this new soul touching invention. Cafe pranah promises you healthy and tasty eating which will touch your soul. The place is conveniently located beside "the dhaba" in ballygunge phari area. small but spacious still not invaded by most of the people as saturday evening it was quite empty. We sat inside and liked the decor. The outside sitting is also nice . I liked their menu very much specially the teas. I ordered a chamomile whereas my friends ordered ginger lemon honey tea ( which tasted awesome)  and a mango basil cheescake smoothie. For food we ordered burgers- tuna melt for me and roasted chicken and a thai panner . Burgers are loaded with sauces. Mine was with yoghurt . We loved the burgers . Next time i like to try their salads. Ambience wise cool with good books. So one can spend some alone time. Overall a nice experience. More visits waiting.

This cafe is the unit of Bon App√©tit restaurant and it is located just beside of Ballygunge phari Dhaba. Internal decor is very good. There was a sitting arrangement of 20 people indoor and approx 10 people outside. After reading great reviews on zomato we thought let's have a try on there. We went there at afternoon and there were no other customers. We ordered Chicken Roasted Iceberg Salad with 7 veg toppings which cost 249 and quantity was enough for 2 people. We also ordered Vegan Cold Coffee and Orange mojito. Those tasted good but the salad was extraordinary. Will try again in future definitely.

I was at Cafe Pranah recently, for for an evening snack. The interiors are nice and warm. Their outdoor seating area is beautiful. We ordered an Orange Iced Tea, a Pomegranate Iced Tea, a Roast Chicken Wrap, a Youghurt Parfait and a Dark Chocolate and Muesli Rocks. The iced teas were refreshingly different. The Roast Chicken Wrap with Barbeque and Youghurt Pepper dressing was delicious with a great mix of flavours. The Youghurt Parfait is a must-have if you happen to visit Cafe Pranah. The biscuit base is crunchy while the hung youghurt with honey and the blueberry compote provide a great balance of sweetness and acidity. The Dark Chocolate and Muesli Rocks tends to grow on you from the first bite to the last. The wooden furniture is comfortable and complements the interiors of the cafe. One minor negative would be the absence of a washroom for customers. However, the food was excellent and we had a great time. I look forward to visiting Cafe Pranah more often. Their smoothie machine was not working. So, trying one of their smoothies remains on my wish list for my next visit here.

USP: Very convenient location, Unique Flavours of Iced Teas

Highly Recommended!

This is another cafe in the town that is making its mark in a very short period of time. The entire credit goes to the delicious foods they prepare and the awesome hospitality their waiters show. the Cafe is not very large in size but it is located at a very prominent location just beside The Dhaba near Ballygunj Phari crossing. The place features both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Quality and Quantity of food is VFM.

So today I visited this cafe because I wanted to go with healthy food.
I thought it would be big spacious.But it turned out to be a small cafe.
But that's okay.
Going with the ambience.It was simple and pleasant.
They also keep storybooks and so if you're a book lover..
Its an awesome place for you where you can eat healthy food while reading books.
Now coming with the food.
We ordered a burger. It was healthy and yummy.
Also in drinks..I ordered tropical paradise.It was good but it had more of banana in it than kiwi and pineapple. Ugh
Chowpatty papdi was not up to the mark.I just ate it just for the sake of eating.It wasn't tasty

For all the great reviews, I think this place is underrated. It was quite empty this afternoon and such was my experience previously too. We ordered a classic lemon iced tea and an orange iced tea and a roasted chicken wrap. The classic was THE BEST ICED TEA I've had in a long while. The wrap too was very, very tasty. I would suggest to my foodie friends to pay this place a visit soon. Ambience is great too, with pretty furniture and soft music in the background. It also has an outdoor seating section.

So when a good friend of mine suggested me to visit this 'health food' place close to where i was staying, i waved him off.. Duh, who wants health food? But after a lot of coaxing, when Mr. Bose spent a weekend at my place, i decided to give it a go.. Located at the busy Ballygunge Phari, u step into a different world as u enter Pranah..  As your body starts to relax, u soak in the mesmeric, soft, ambient music.. Its a tiny and cozy place and gives u a lot of reasons to spend hours there.. The salads were perfect (Mr. Bose helped me with the choice of sauces and spices.. if u dont have someone like Mr. Bose with u, the servers' recommendations serve the purpose) Do give the mango basil cheesecake shake a try and be ready to experiment!

Do you know the feeling of coming home after a hard day and finding everything just as you like it, your favourite music and your favourite books and your own comfortable chair? That's what you will feel at Pranah. Add to that a sensitively designed menu with natural fresh ingredients and made by talented chefs. They will tailor the food to your requests. The menu is an exploration of flavours, a juxtaposition of tastes and smells in perfect balance. So come to Cafe Pranah to feel transported to a cafe in Dharamshala or Kasol, only with much better food.

Located at Ballygunge phari beside The Dhaba .
Ambience plays an important for a cafe. We really liked the ambience & the calm atmosphere. The place is very cozy with both indoor & outdoor sitting arrangement. After scanning the whole menu we ordered
Pahadi Corn Masale-daar- it was awesome.
Then the Salami Burger,it contained chicken salami,olives & barbecue.
The Roast Chicken Wrap is a must have.
It was very much tasty & succulent.
The outside roti covering was perfectly cooked & the filling had ample chicken with fresh vegetables.
Lastly we ordered Mango basil cheesecake smoothie. It was really a soothing one.
It really meant " Health & Soul" cuisine.
A must visit for everyone.

Best salad I've ever had in Kolkata.

Located extremely conveniently, (100 m from the Ballygunge Phari), Cafe Pranah was a pleasant surprise. A beautifully understated decor, some really nice books on the shelf, an average Kashmiri Quawah, a super damn awesome salad (with veg patty on top in sweet onion mango, mint mango and mayo dressing on lettuce base) and super polite staff who don't disturb you for hours unless you call them for a service needed.

Must visit, especially if you're vegetarian.

Cafe Pranah...aaaahhh bliss! 

Trust me when I say this, whenever I feel like idling, doing nothing, thinking nothing much, the only place that comes to my mind is Cafe Pranah! The ambiance is totally an escapists delight ;) You cease to live in the city, you fly, you belong there among the mountains.

The soulful Buddhist chants are a pacifier, sipping on to a hot cuppa Himalayan tea, a cold Papaya Peach smoothie, munching on to Chowpatty Papadi, Dill-6 Aloo or Couscous Ensamble, these are pure stress busters! 

One must experience this mind and body, heart and soul journey. Thank you Rahul Arora for putting it right on my way back home from a long day's work, this is sheer respite for me. 

A must must visit for all peace seekers :)

@rahul.arora.1982 I think this is one of the only health cafes in Kolkata. Situated at the centre of the city in Ballygunge,this gives a feel good feeling as soon as you enter. Try their papdi chaat, the healthy way. Their salads are out of the world! A must try. Also the burgers, especially the tuna burgers with healthy wheat flour. The desserts and the mocktails are also to die for. If you have come in for the first time, it is best you leave the choice and ordering to the chef and owner, @rahul.arora.1982

Heard good things about the place, so ordered Kashmiri Quawahs.. Its basically an aromatic tea and came in tea bags. For snacks we ordered Rajma Galawti.. 3 pieces in one serving along with a generous serving of mayo dip.. Loved it to the core. The ambience, the happy food and good vibes made my visit a happy one.. Its perfect for chillng with friends. Looking forward to my next visit.

It's a very pleasant place to hangout with friends. I have visited this place with my college friends in an evening for spending some time.It is located in Ballygaunge phari.We ordered Salami Burger and Lemon Tea.Salami Burger is just superb. It contains Chicken salami,tomato and olives with barbeque. It was amazing tasty and tantalising. I have not tried lemon tea,but according to my friend who tried it was satisfying. 
Ambience is very good, they have both air conditioned and an outside space for hangout with modernised furniture. Staffs are also well behaved. But,yes,little expensive and not pocket friendly.Salami burger is the most appealing item of them.

There are many things to love about Caf√© Pranah.

First off, it has a wonderful range of teas. The Kashmiri qawah with its strong hit of cinnamon is especially lovely; take it hot or cold, depending on the weather and your mood. Plus, bonus points for the orange iced tea.

The caf√© has a wide range of salads, sandwiches, wraps, and more. You get to customize your meal right from scratch by choosing your own toppings and dressings. But if you‚Äôre anything like me, and the ‚Äòcreate your own meal‚Äô option makes you break into nervous hives, Caf√© Pranah offers a series of ready-made combinations as well.

The absolute best thing I‚Äôve eaten here is a rajma galawti burger. Rajma is not one of my favourite foods, but this melt-in-your-mouth rajma patty takes it to a whole other level. Besides, it pairs wonderfully with the multi-grain burger buns.

Caf√© Pranah‚Äôs USP is that it adds fun and flavour to healthy food: That is why the papadi chaat uses baked papadis instead of fried ones. That is why the crostini replaces white bread with a toasty biscuity base (plus, it is heaped with generous amounts of topping; we had the mushroom version and the topping-to-base ratio was excellent!).

I have heard good things about their dark chocolate muesli rocks, though am yet to try one. But I do like the caf√©‚Äôs super-light take on badam kheer‚Äîthis happiness-inducing low-cal dessert is made with brown rice and artificial sweetener.

Finally, a note on the ambience: Despite being located smack in the middle of bustling Ballygunge Phari, the caf√© is an oasis of calm. The big glass doors do a good job of keeping the noise outside, while Buddhist chants playing in the background soothe frazzled nerves. If the weather is fine, sit at one of the tables outside. Then select your meal, order a chilled/steaming glass of tea, and watch the world go by.

This place is the perfect heaven for all the veggie lovers out there. Today this joint became the spot for a long awaited get together for us four. Even though we had already consulted the menu through zomato, we did face serious confusion while ordering. The food here is quite good. The salad was of a generous quantity and a bit pricey too. The burgers were cool, one might even say on the verge of being great. The broth disappointed a bit though, didn't look or taste like a proper broth at all. I found it vaguely similar to the soups we used to have when we were sick. The chicken salami slices which they use in the broth further took away the fun. Diced ones would have been better. Anyway, like i said before, this place is a heaven for the veggie lovers. Although I am a pure non vegetarian and openly hate veggies, but still i consumed veggies today shockingly üòã
So believe me when i say, its highly recommended!!!!! Do visit! They are totally concerned about your health and will serve healthy foods only! 
P.S. The interior ambiance is cool, although a bit small.

Long time planning became successful today, when we four managed to raid the place. God we were so confused with the menu card.. Needed to ask for help atlast..
We tried custom made burgers, salad, broth, coffee, and for dessert yogurt parfait..
The burgers were a complete meal, the salad was scrumptious, generous amount of dressing, chicken and fresh veggies.. Uff loved it, coffee was too strong to be americano, broth was not up to the mark. The dessert tastes heavenly, never imagined that hung curd can taste so well, but the quantity was very very less.
The service was fast, and courteous.
Ambiance was lovely, soothing ..
Most importantly whatever we had was totally healthy so no more guilt bites.
Deserves a lot more visits ..

We happened to be at this place on a Sunday afternoon when rain played havoc on the city. The entrance was flooded and we waded through the water and came in for a pleasant surprise. Very quaint and cosy ambience with good food and awesome iced teas. Selection of burritos and wraps were quite good and varied though the non veg choice is quite restricted. Seems like they cater to the vegetarian crowds more .the service was fine and pleasant with smiling waiters who didn't mind the commotion we created.overall a good experience  and recommended for friendly get togethers for high teas.

The first of its kind.
¬†In the sense that they have¬† included Indian street food as a main part of the menu. Indian Street food in a healthier and definitely tastier form. And at reasonable prices(with respect to what they offer).
¬†Ofcourse its not just that. There are other items too. Chocolate and cheese lovers might be a little disappointed (like me,but I still cant deny that the place is good).

You can choose your fillings for salads,burgers or wraps. They have experimented with the sauces and pulled it off quite well,I must say.
Only one complaint that they dont provide plates seperately which gets a little messy if you are sharing food.
We had Amritsari Aloo Tikki which was spicy and tasty,well-cooked. And paneer wrap which had this amazing Mango Chilli sauce in the filling.
There is a wide range of options in the menu for tea-lovers. Perfect place for an adda over a cup of steaming tea.
Would like to see more desserts in the menu though.

Needless to say,interiors are nice. Plus points for the open counter-cum-kitchen which gives it a very homely feeling.
Though they might boast of an outdoor sitting arrangement,you really wouldnt prefer it with all the noise around. A little more privacy would be nice.

This is exactly the kind of place you would like to take your mom on an evening date. As the name suggests, you instantly feel the serenity the place has to offer. I am really glad such a place mushroomed between the ever increasing hukka cafes of the town. The rajma kabab and salads are really good. So is the honey lemon ginger tea. One of their best offering I may say. Wanted to try the rosemary tea but it wasn't available. Next time probably.

Caf√© Pranah boasting of health and soul food is not something that got me hooked. Located just near Ballygunge Phari, the place does Good salads however, we'd tried sandwiches and some exotica teas which didn't really keep us interested to go in for another time!
Better luck with a new menu I guess!

We walked in for a light meal, and it sure kept up with expectations, though we were a lil apprehensive when we first walked in - the food was surprisingly awesome!@mayank kejriwal. I just hope they could change the way they serve the food- and use proper cutlery and crockery instead of plastic disposables! Prana- with plastic doesn't go too well

This is exactly the kind of place you would like to take your mom on an evening date. As the name suggests, you instantly feel the serenity the place has to offer. I am really glad such a place mushroomed between the ever increasing hukka cafes of the town. The rajma kabab and salads are really good. So is the honey lemon ginger tea. One of their best offering I may say. Wanted to try the rosemary tea but it wasn't available. Next time probably.

A special mention on the serene and pleasant music.. Decor... N specially  the collection of books like by rumi.. Completely  goes hand in hand with their concept...

Location: A stone's throw from The Dhaba; Ballygunge Phari Crossing.

Cafe Pranah has been on my list for quite sometime now and due to some or the other reason failed to drop by. Finally struck off my list on May 14, 2015. 
The AMBIANCE of the place has been quite thoughtfully done with the exterior seating being designed upon artificial grass with bamboo shoots running along the wall till the interior seating stretch¬† with a nice wooden-framed window type bookshelf upon the wood-paneled wall. The counter with bamboo shoots did keep the continuity of the decor. The wind chimes at the entrance, the candles and little showpieces on the wall added as a plus. Overall the ambiance did give a peaceful setup and helps unwind.

The FOOD was spread across low calorie beverages, salads and healthy takes on the top high-calorie dishes. Impressive. From their well-drafted menu, the following was sampled:

- Kashmiri Quawah
The tea bag flavors were spot on! Loved sipping on it. 
Recommended.

- Slide-em' up (Multigrain Burger)
Step 1 (Lettuce selection): Iceberg Lettuce
Step 2 (Fresh topping selection: INR 20 per topping): Green bell pepper, tomato, corn, olives and jalape√±o.
Step 3 (Precooked selection: INR 39 per topping): Wished for a Mixed Veg. Patty but, was struck off as the server informed that if this step needs to be incorporated, only two toppings can be selected in Step 2 and I had opted for four.
Step 4 (Any two Dressing Selection): Kashundi Vinaigrette & Pepper Yoghurt.

The burger was made as per the above preferences and tasted good. Did feel light and healthy on the tummy in contrast to the usual burgers.
Recommended.

The STAFF CONDUCT was polite and friendly serving at a prompt speed.
The PRICES were found to be inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall was a good experience. 
- A much needed joint in the City of Joy to give people a break from the monotonous routine and the hustle & bustle of the city.
- Keep up the healthy work, visiting soon for more. :)

Located at Ballygunge Phari opposite Kwality, I went there for the first time with my friend in a rainy evening.

We really liked the ambiance and Buddhist theme, also the wooden furniture and the calm atmosphere.

After scanning the whole menu, we settled for two wraps - 1 Roast Chicken wrap and one Sausage Ahoy.
Since we are two people, they already divided both the wraps in half and served us.
The wraps were awesome. The outside roti covering was perfectly cooked making it very soft. The filling had ample chicken with fresh, chopped vegetables.
They really mean it when they say "Health & Soul" cuisine.
I found the price a bit high comparing with the quantity they gave but it is justified as the whole item was prepared with healthy ingredients.
I will definitely visit again to try out other items.

Cafe Pranah has brought a revolution of sorts to Calcutta because frankly there are no restaurants in the city that serve healthy food. Right from the ambience to decor, everything is top notch ! Never knew food that is healthy could taste so good! Loved the roasted chicken wrap and the berry iced tea. The icing on the cake was the dark chocolate and muesli rock which was probably the tastiest yet healthiest dessert I've ever had :) Looking forward to going to Cafe Pranah again :)

For a restaurant,food is supreme.But for a cafe,ambience plays an important part.I sometimes note with dismay,that reviews tend to be cruel,almost deriving a vicarious pleasure in running a place down.In truth ,to get a fair idea about a place ,at least a couple of visits are necessary or else like a Sachin tendulkar,anyone including chefs can have a bad day.Or are Calcutta people over critical?Of themselves and of everything around?Being a proud Calcuttan I would like to see the positive of things.This is where a cafe like this is important and relevent.It is different.It has beautiful ambience.A different menu.Brave enough to say they have only black coffee.The outside green patch is beautiful.So are the wooden chairs.
I asked for roasted chicken hamburger,a chaat called Delhi 6,black coffee.Above average taste,brilliant presentation,good service.Cant wait to come back with family.Coz....it's different!

Ambience: perfect
Price: perfect
Taste: perfect
Music: perfect
Interiors: perfect
Staff courtesy: perfect
This place serves the best salad in Kolkata (not only in terms of taste but also quantity...most places charge you a bomb for good salads and serve a protion not even enough for 1)
The oriental tea is a must try. It's the best tea I ever had, it was the 1st time ever that I had tea without sugar. Perfectly crisp crostinis and best and healthiest wrap ever.The best part about this place is that you don't feel guilty about indulging in your fav food items cuz everything has a healthy twist to it without any compromise to your taste buds. Even the dessert we had was awesome and without sugar!!I hope it opens up a branch near my place or more such caf√©s come up in kolkata

I wasn't aware this one is rahul's.it probably came up last year december,close to age old dhaba in ballygunge phari.the book collection-meluha,devdutt pattanaik has rahul's name inscribed in te front page,and that should have ticked me off.But it wasn't until I was leaving the place that he decided to show up looking all busy.anyways,the cafe has very distinct bon vivant yet tuned down decor,open to interpretation.there is a outdoor setting as well.we had a wrap,a mango basil cheesecake smoothie and a yougurt pafait.the smoothie was good,with a discernable honey base.the yougurt was good but less ornate than the regular ones at starbucks.the music and the upholstery did a good job in¬† setting the tone for a nice afternoon treat.

We visited cafe Pranah last Sunday, to my surprise the place was entirely empty, given we went at around 5:30pm which is supposed to be the rush hours. Nevertheless the place is cozy with both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangement.
Unfortunately they don't serve coffee apart from black coffee. So we ordered Lemon iced tea and chawpatti chat for munching.
The food served was well presented and hygienic.
Cafe Pranah is not like any other cafe it's different and unique in it's own way.

Finally a place with health food. Specially good for people who gym and look to eat appropriate stuff. Mango smoothie, chocolate muesli and wrap were really nice.  Don't have too high expectations when you visit there because it's just a cafe and not a fine dining which have proper chefs. Plus whatever they make here is absolutely fresh and refreshing.

Went there with high expectations after looking at all the reviews on zomato. Was a let down. Ordered a chicken burger with the mango sauce. It had shredded chicken in a soggy bun and limp lettuce. The tuna wrap was a lot better in terms of taste and price. The couscous which we ordered with extra chicken and paneer topping was delicious but steeply priced. The cold kahwa was again disappointing as it just tasted like iced tea with a cinnamon stick in it. What i really liked was the waiters who were very friendly and eager to please. Though they need to improve the quality of their food to merit a second visit

Located near ballygunj phari, tucked between the dhaba and Tirumani apartment, this small food joint promises a place to be if you are close by and looking for a decent joint wherein you can just relax and have some mocktails and tit bits. The endeavour behind this cafe is to bring the healthy food to its patrons. and how much they have succeeded in their effort,  only time will tell. As far as my recent visit was concerned,  it was late in the evening, during a busy Thursday I decided to check this cafe out. My work place being a stone throw distance away from this joint, it turned out to be on everyone' s wish list. The place isnt big and they have provisions for outside seating too, which was empty considering the hot and humid weather.  Menu is short and crisp with a healthy choice if food available within each menu category.  We orders a starter which was of mashed rajma beans and roasted on a flat top. It tasted very average but we liked the dip that they served with it. We settled for few variants of ice tea. Loved the basil mint iced tea tho. prices are quite Pocket friendly. Service could be quicker and have a lot of scope for improvement. 

Spoiler Alert: just in case you want to go to the washroom during your dinning experience,  they will promptly suggest you the pay and use washroom across the road. 

Visit once. You never know you might find reasons to visit again. Which is none in our case.

Cafe Pranah is located in Ballygunge Phari.I have visited this place just once after coming back from Office. The place is very small.They are playing yoga kind of music which remember Buddhist kind of places.There is a small book self where u can choose and read books.

Have ordered Kashmiri Kahwah Iced Tea, Chowpatty Papdi, Tikki Burger and Lastly Dark Chocolate and Muesli Rocks.The food they served just horrible.

Service is OK types.I didn't enjoy the food.Not worth it.

I‚Äôm getting married in the next two weeks and all I can think of is food at Cafe Pranah. A year back, my dear friend and amazing chef, Rahul mentioned he‚Äôs opening a health food cafe. He went on to describe what it would be like and I patiently waited for it to open. As luck would have it, it‚Äôs walking distance from my new house and located conveniently on the main road of Ballygunj next to the Dhaba.

I‚Äôve had the salads, the burgers, the juices, smoothies, teas and the papadi chat there and of course the oh so yum yogurt parfait! I‚Äôve been lucky to have someone create the salad and burger for me as the exotic choices leave me wondering on what to take and what not. Pairing the dressings is as important, if not more, as choosing your ingredients. I‚Äôve had the mixed veg patty (mind you, it does not contain potatoes!) with some lettuce and beans. For the dressings, I was suggested Thai curry and milk and pepper yogurt dressing. I still remember the first bite. The crunch of the lettuce, the softness of the multigrain bread and the delicious flavour with every bite. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm longing for now.

Rahul knows his flavour pairings and makes the most tasteless food be longed for. Each of dressings is unique, unadulterated and memorable. I‚Äôve also tried the olive jalape√±o and the sweet chilli and mango dressing in its raw form.

For people who just want to relax with a book and a cup of tea it happens to be a lovely space. Reminiscent of a waiting area of a meditation centre, slow Buddhist chants float in the background.

Aesthetically done interiors and lovely selection of books helps you get the much required me time. A plus point is the outdoor seating area. In a crowded space, he‚Äôs managed to build an oasis of calm. A cute addition is a space at the entrance with dream catchers and tonnes of messages from visitors. If you happen to drop by,  do write your love.

All in all its a pocket friendly place with great food and a calming ambience which makes you wake up in the middle of the night craving for it.

A small cafe near Ballygunj Phari. 

The decor is nicely done with artificial grass and plants. They play good music and that too in a perfect volume.

The service is ok. Friendly but not very professional.

But their food quality is inconsistent. I loved their Himalayan Magic tea. But the Oriental Bouquet or Kashmiri Quawah I tried wasn't of my liking. 

Salad was heavenly one day, but next day we tried, the lettuces were bitter and there was very few veggies or chicken added to it. The sauces were great both days. 

We tried the wrap one day - it was very good.

Went couple of times there after 1 of my friends recommended this place.The location is very proper & the ambience is very special.An ideal place if you're alone & in the mood for a cup of coffee with a book in your hand.
The pranayam music adds to the mood.The concept of opening a health conscious cafe  in Kolkata itself is unique.The foods are not bad if you consider the health factor.The tuna salad tasted average.
The drinks-Mango basil cheesecake & Melon mint medley were too tasty.The smoothies also can be explored.When we went there it was raining heavily & the salad & drink was accompanied by Gulzar's poetry.Yes,they've an excellent collection of books as well.
Plan to revisit many more times :)

Had been eyeing this place everytime I crossed it. Finally visited it for dinner after reading reviews on zomato.

Place was better than my expectations. The freshness of all dishes served.. unparalled. They made the entire thing in front of us. We ordered for Chicken Burgers, Salads and Ice tea. Taste of all dishes was comparable to any bigger outlet/chain.

My ratings...

Ambience.. 4/5
Taste.. 5/5
Value for money.. 4.5/5
Service... 4.5/5

Would definately recommend this place.

Snuck in a quiet corner in the otherwise bustling area, Cafe Pranah is a haven for for those looking for a guilt- free, yet super- gastronomic indulgence. The food is quite filling and wholesome. And the best part about it is that you can come up with your own whacky combinations from a smorgasbord of bases, toppings, and sauces for your burger/ wrap.
My reco: the sweet chilli mango sauce with your burger/ wrap
Get the juices flowing!

I had heard a lot, and I mean, A LOT about this place, personally being a Bon Appetit fan, I decided to pay this one a visit since I was near the area on some work.
Firstly, the decor is very cosy with the bookshelves as in Bon - really is soothing, so is the staff behaviour.

Coming to the food, we ordered a customized healthy salad (enough for 2, yes) with smoked chicken and salami, along with assorted veggies and sauces. The sauces were delicious, and so was the salad as a whole but the QUANTITIES ¬†of chicken were wholly LACKING.¬†
As for the dessert, we ordered the yoghurt parfait with the blueberry compose, which was delicious but finished too damn quickly.¬†
Not a pocket pinch, and definitely fun to come, but the quantities can indeed be bettered.

P.S. yes, healthy too. Very, in fact. xD

Located in the main road of ballygunge phari these different themed restaurant packs a great interior with witty bookshelves and gritty design.coming to the food it has a good ensemble of different type of cuisines...among them the tropical paradise smoothie & different types of wraps as well it has a good corn platter..variety is the key to this restaurant I must say so I suggest it's a cool place to hangout with friends as well as family as price is also comparatively reasonable here.

Cafe Pranah is a cafe with a difference in many ways. The name suits the way it is completely. I have visited this place just once as I'm not from around the area and was satisfied with everything. The ambiance is a very important factor for me and this place has got it all right. It gives the feel of your home with quite a d√©cor of its own. The food is nice and the prices are reasonable. Had I been from this part of the city, I would have been there almost every other day.

Healthy cafe? Oh yes. Healthy from mind and your tummy too. As soon as you enter the cafe, you see wonderful homely ambiance with lots of books to drown yourself into. If you are a book lover, food lover, calorie hater and a home lover, you are bound to like this place. Like? More like love. The peace of Buddha surrounds you all over with a big Buddha statue in the restaurant.

So, I went to this place with two of my beautiful gal pals. Gal pals are an instant dosage of fun. Not that I am saying that guys are not! (Haha). Okay, so we ordered a roasted chicken burger, roasted chicken wrap, a Turkish tuna melt, oriental bouquet tea and a lemon iced tea.None of the beverages were mine, by the way.¬†

We settled in and we were the only one in the cafe and we literally took the homely ambiance to our hearts. We laughed, we giggled, we made fool of each other and lots.¬†

Now coming to the food. The Roasted chicken burger was nice. I changed the yogurt dressing and asked for mayonnaise. Well, a food lover's delight. My friends wanted barbecue sauce and it tasted quite good. I would have personally wanted the chicken to have been cooked a bit more since it smelled uncooked. The tuna melt was quite good too but my friend said that the tuna was not properly cooked. And you have to trust her, she is a chef! The Oriental bouquet was very, very strong. That tea gave my friend a big time headache. However, the lemon iced tea was refreshing.

Cafe Pranah is overall a nice place to sit out and chat and the pocket pinch is also on the steeper side. You want to go out with your friends and have a light meal along with some gossip? Welcome to Cafe Pranah!¬†

I personally don't know whether I would visit another time or not, maybe when one of the diet insect bites me hard, but keep up the good work! Oh and I LOVE the idea of the suggestions being tied outside. In that way, you can decide before getting inside the restaurants whether you want to run or eat! (Haha). No, just a very new idea and makes you feel important. LOVE, Cafe Pranah!

Would it not be better if a cafe that claims to be one catering to the health conscious mentioned the nutritional facts of each food item on the menu? The calories, the protein,,the carbs..even a Rs5 crisps packet mentions that..

Heard from a friend about this place..got attracted with d tagline "healthy cafe" as was told to me by my friend..so I paid a visit with my friends today..
The location of the place is just so good..no need to search..its on the main road..
The interiors is nice..but due to the open kitchen..its was bit suffocative so we shifted to the outdoors after some time..
We ordered amritsari aloo tikka,chicken seekh wrap,chicken crostini,mango cheesecake smoothie and green lemon iced tea and dark chocolate muesli..i liked d food..I felt the concept of food served here is bit different..
You can tie up your suggestions on your way out..
The place is pocket friendly..

When was the last time you went out for a hearty meal without counting on your calories? In this day and age when Food as a concept has revolutionized, introducing tempting ingredients to enhance their yummy quotient; counting calories has become a secondary option. Then again fear no more as Kolkata brings you a haven to wash all your caloric sins away and rejeauvinate a new life with Caf√© Pranah- a one of a kind health and soul cuisine hot spot. Located on the posh locales of Ballygunge Phari, the first impression of Pranah transports the visitor to the serene hills of Sikkim. There is a typical Buddha monastery like prayer flags on the outside, a step inside and you're transformed to this quaint little tea house of the cold mountains- wooden floors and furnishing. What one can never miss on the first visit is a wooden window shaped book shelf with a stunning idol of Lord Buddha shining tall and of course the serenity Buddha chants playing harmoniously in the background.  
From a vast array of salads, healthy teas, smoothies to even healthier chaats, wraps and burgers- a meal here is worth your while and pocket.Do try out their array of Salads which comes with nine topping choices and sauces with four different kinds of lettuces. Another intriguing item not to be missed are their flavorsome iced teas that caters to a fusion of exotic flavors like a Kashmiri Kawah or Rosemary ice tea to name some. The show stoppers however were the homemade multigrain salad burgers, the oatmeal papdi chaat, the brown bread and corn infused Amritsari Tikka and the zero oil savoury crepes . 
How can any meal be complete without desserts and that coming from a health caf√© sure makes it a visit  worthwhile. Go for their Yoghurt Parafit or their Carrot and Thyme Slice. Be sure not to miss out on their smoothie selection and with items like a Morning Glory ( Papaya, Almond and Lime Zest), Tropical Paradise (Kiwi, Banana and Green Pepper) or Cinnamon Apple Pie. 
Basically go guilt free and rejuvenate a new life to your digestive systems :)

So imagine for once... You are on a hill... Somewhere in Ghoom... maybe at the sterling resort itself, sitting in the green patch and eating some nice tea... Or maybe you moved into one of the golf clubs and you are seated there, and around you are the prayer flags that surround you.... Yes on a chilled out winter morning if you visit Cafe Pranaah and if you have some sort of imagination and when your mind is calm, you will actually feel this....¬† To accentuate it even further you smell incense sticks all out.....
My first question to the owner Rahul was ‚Ä¶ Is it real grass? Cause it was that soft.. not the prickly ones but smooth‚Ä¶ He smiles his everlasting smile and says‚Ä¶Nah Carpet grass.
YES... It is a soul cafe.. in the middle of South Calcutta.... At Ballygunge Phari‚Ä¶..
Now that it had touched my soul with the ambience it needed some nice food to take it to the next level‚Ä¶.
Caf√© Pranaah did all that and a lot more‚Ä¶. The Kashmiri Kava was nice‚Ä¶ Well truth be said, have tasted better but for once understand that you are a lot away from ‚ÄúWAZWAAN‚Äù at Kashmir and you would like it sorry actually love it.. I somehow preferred the Rosemary Iced tea a lot lot more‚Ä¶
Now whoever said that whatever you like to have has to be bad for your health was highly mistaken‚Ä¶.
Had the chicken olive wrap and it was amazing‚Ä¶ Not to say the way the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù veggies complimented the chicken and the wrap covering being just perfect yet baked made all the difference‚Ä¶.
The papri chaat had some baked ultra-thin and yet crisp papris and the sauce used in it was definitely what made it stand out‚Ä¶ Unlike any other that you will find anywhere and trust me you would love it‚Ä¶. A chance to fall in love with Papri Chaat all over again‚Ä¶
Now the final one, the one which made the difference, the one which stood out totally‚Ä¶ The salad‚Ä¶ 
My mom would have literally hugged me if she saw how much salad I had that very day‚Ä¶ Crisp veggies with more of olives and nuts along with some roasted chicken (paneer if you are a vegetarian)‚Ä¶ If I thought I new what fresh veggies fell like I was surely taken totally aback‚Ä¶. Crispy lettuce leaves, nuts, onions , tomatoes, steamed corn, bell pepper and olives‚Ä¶ then you get to choose your sauce. It is here that things look so different where Rahul has carefully, beautifully and smartly mixed the things making it look oh so different, made to perfection. The nice sauces on order were homemade salsa, Sweet Mango and chilli, Mint and raw mango, Kashundi vinaigrette, Olive an Jalapeno, Yoghurt pepper, Herb cheese sauce, sweet tamarind and jaggery and barbeque‚Ä¶We got to taste all and say..
¬†My absolute favorite ones are sweet mango and chilli where the chilli considerately neutralizes the mango‚Äôs excessive sweetness, the Yoghurt pepper a spicy rocket neutralized again by the yoghurt base yet, sweet tamarind and jaggery(yes where tamarinds sourness is neutralized by the jaggery) and of course the Kashundi vinaigrette‚Ä¶ Try it out mix the ones and enjoy a nice healthy salad and make a fresh start to your possibly mundane day‚Ä¶ ¬†
Caf√© Pranah has all the elements to surprise you.

Its a lovely place for small hangouts with friends or family. Lemme just cut it short and come to the point:-
Pros -
1) Good ambience. 
2) quality and healthy food.
3) good hospitality of the cafe staves.
4) would recommend my friends to visit this particular place. 

cons :-
1) the major drawback of this particular cafe is that they DONT ACCCEPT CARDS! Its ONLY CASH for them !

Located on the opposite side of Kwality and a little more forward if you are coming from Gariahat side, there lies this little gem of a place. Cafe Pranah..what an awesome 1st experience it was. A very new genre of its kind..Health and Soul cuisine, it basically represents the Subway genre but with ¬†very new twist.

Ambiance - Small, quaint, peaceful. Spiritual hymns keeps on playing inside, nd as you enter the place, it actually kind of soothes you. Tibetan artifacts, book racks, warm lights and furnitures, all these kind of sets the mood.

Food - They have a real elaborate list of teas, we opted for¬†
1. ¬† Oriental Bouquet - Purely a exquisite herbal tea with a flavour of ginger, saffron and a beautiful aroma of lemongrass.¬†

2. Himalayan Magic - Another herbal infusion ,with flavours of tulsi and a very refreshing rose petal aroma.

3. Roast Chicken wrap - Their signature wraps, very light and very delicious. The filling was of bell peppers, herb roast chicken and iceberg lettuce with a barbeque and yogurt pepper dressing. The pepperyness was subtle and could have been increased a bit.

4. Turkish Tuna Melt - Surely the better of the two if you like the distinctive smell of the tuna. Topped with olives, red bell peppers and pomegranate pearls, and a dressing of yogurt pepper and sweet chilli , it had this perfect amalgamation of tangyness, spice, and soft tuna melting in mouth. Must have.¬†

Service - Quite fast, hospitable and polite. Serving time is approx 10-15 mins.

Additional infos - their tea comes with a beautiful liquor and a steel container full of the desired flavor immersed in it. If you are not quite sure of how long to dip the things, ask help from the waiters. The tea wont taste best if you dont get the flavours at the right consistency. They dont put sugar in teas, so feel free to add it from the options of normal and sugar free.

Overall, a wonderful experience.

The first time I passed by this place,  I thought it was yet another yoga place. But soon I came to know it was a new "healthy" food joint. Zomato said it was a great place so decided to visit it. And let me tell you the place delivers what it promises.  Amazing flavours with a healthy serving of health on the side. The food is as vibrant as the owner of the place. Mr Arora,  who we had the fortune to meet had a sense of enthusiasm about the food he served and managed to get us interested in it too. Starting from the refreshing teas and mouth watering salads and healthy burger it was a happy assault on our taste buds. Me a dedicated meat lover couldnt have enough of the salad. The freshness the layers the texture kept making me go back for the next spoonful. Kudos to Mr Arora , I am coming back to systematically go through the menu. Keep the grear work up. A small improvement though. Dont serve the water in those plastic glasses, the classiness of the place doesnt support it.

Awesome first experience!!!!
It was my first experience at a salad bar or a healthy eating joint ,latter suits this better. The ambience is awesome and rightly done. Not overworked. Plus the soft instrumentals suit this place. Coming to the food, we ordered the Kashmiri Qwawah iced tea and Amritsari Tikia. The qwawah was soft and refreshing. Amritsari tikia surprised me. I couldn't feel the spices, compelling me to compare it with any normal eatery with the oil dripping ones.The right blend of spices with the perfect filling and dressing over it, its a must try. We were already huge on expectations and we ordered a 5 topping salad on a romaine lettuce base ans Herbed cheese sauce and barbequesauce dressing.It was refreshing , tasty,light and yet tummy filling.I must congratulate Cafe Pranah for really coming out and putting up a.place like this in Kolkata which is famous for its great street food.But sometimes everyone needs to give that oil a miss.
The perfect joint for a healthy fulfilling and refreshing meal

This is one place that lives up to its name. Food for the Prana or Soul. The overall ambience was very relaxed, peaceful and at once rejuvenating. Easily the best Salad and Burger we've had in town in a long time. The multi grain burger buns with a rajma galauti patty was what one would call a guilt free indulgence. 
Would definitely come back for more of the awesomeness!
Hoping to see a gradual expansion of the menu with a nice quinoa salad, fresh sprouted legumes as an option for the salad dressing among others. 
Bon appetite!

The place is right at Ballygunj Phari. A small cosy cafe with an outdoor seating as well.¬†
Perfect place for healthy junk food :p We had rajma ke galawti which was amazing, especially its dip. (We ordered a second serving as well!!). The salad was also good, though people usually like more dressing but if health is the goal I guess you cannot complain about limited dressing. We ordered lemon iced tea which tasted somewhat herbal. Can't decide whether I liked it or not. The presentation of the food & drinks is good.

The reasons for giving less rating are:
1. They do not have any power back up. We ordered a tea and the power went off so they could not serve it. Finally we left without getting that order.
2. The closed area ¬†was smelling when we went there. We had gone on a Sunday afternoon, and there was not a single other customer besides us, so they had not switched on the AC.¬†
(P.S. We were there for good 3 hours but no one else came.)
3. They have a feedback wall or something which was very nice. (There was a grill with small chits hanging) However, no one asked for a feedback, nor there was anything kept near the grill for us to go and write.

A nice place offering good healthy delicacies which is value for money. The chowpatty chaat iced teas and the wraps were really good, however, certain dishes like the rajma ke galawti kebab can be made better(the dip was awesome though) as found them to be a little too dry. Overall, finally a good place for guilt free gorging for all the health freaks out there.

If you want to eat all the fast foods and beverages and still do not want to feel guilty this is the right place for you. Yes a cafe exclusively for the healthy foodies. The   ambience is good and I specially liked the outdoor sitting arrangement. It is located beside Ballygunge Dhaba. We ordered a tuna burger, roasted chicken wrap, lemon mint ice tea and dark chocolate with nuts. The burger was good and yummy. The drink was refreshing with lots of honey( I love honey). The chocolate with nut felt like the upper crust of Cornato but less calories. I didn't like the wrap much.
 If you love your food with all the junks this is not your place. They have many options in veg but non veg items are limited. The service was very good.

This new cafe at Ballygunge Phari is the new child by Rahul of Bon Apetit fame. Located at the heart of South Kolkata, this cafe offers a stark contrast to all the tall buildings and high rises. It's nicely done, simplistic, yet tasteful. 
The menu boasts of everything healthy. Me and my friend ordered for a chaat, seven topping salad with herb roasted chicken, iced kawah and badam kheer. 
The chaat is a welcome change from the usual ones available in the stores. The iced kawah is the perfect thing to sooth you down when you are tired or stressed out after a hard day at work. 
The salad is awesome, just the way I want my salads to be. The show stealer was most definitely the kheer. It has the right amount of sweetness( not too sweet) and there's a delicate flavour of almonds working throughout the blend. Having the kheer will most definitely give you a "food-gasm". Do visit this place once if you want to taste something tasteful, soulful and different from the usual spicy fare available elsewhere. I'm surely visiting this one again, and maybe Bon Apetit will take a backseat now.

Well they say that the first impression is a lasting one, and Cafe Pranah surely wins here. With its zen like ambiance it is likely to make you feel relaxed then and there. Oh and as you enter do not miss the little tags containing the feedbacks of visitors. Now coming to the food. The spouse had ginger tea and a chicken burger. I had mango smoothie and chicken couscous. We also shared a plate of chicken pancake as starter. Ended it all with a yogurt parfait.  All I can say about the food it does not either compromise on the taste nor the health. Carry cash with you when you visit for that is the form of payment accepted.

I stopped by the cafe to have a quick snack  their Kashmiri Cinnamon ice tea was very good and refreshing I like the subtle flavour of cinnamon, however the grilled chicken wrap was a disappointment the tortilla bread was chewy and hard probably they keep their breads in a freezer. Filling had too much of dressing and kept crumbling, have to learn how to present their wraps. Overall I would go their for tea.

I droped by pranah to meet rahul. He made me taste his upcoming items which was not still in the menu. I had a heath burger with beans nd all. Never did i think that a burger as tasty as this can be healthy too. Write now i am having a salad with golden corn, red yellow and green pepper bell and jalapenos. Dad ordered this and the quantity is huge. With a humble tone he tells me "tasty toh hai, par kya mein itna kha paunga". And i will not shy away from helping him finish off this.
Thanks rahul

First Health food place in Kolkata ! I think the decor,music and feel is very true to the concept.Coming to the food, I ordered a salad with herbed cheese ,home made salsa and mayyonaise dressing .The ingredients and the vegetables were very fresh.The salad was delicious but I would suggest you to add a bit more of the dressing.The quantity is pretty good.Next I had the amritsari tikia which had just the right blend of chutneys which would tickle your taste buds in a way in which you would just wanna have more and more of it ! I just wish they had explained how their food is healthy,because they havent mentioned that anywhere.I knew that their food is healthy because people had told me so.They need to educate their customer about their concept. Also the menu is very limited at the moment (I heard they will be presenting a new menu very soon) .All the very best ,keep your quality intact !

I just visited this place. Food menu is limited but still the food quality is amazing.  I ordered for amritsari tikia which was amazing and was the right combination of all the chuntenys. Next i ordered was soul salad with iceberg lettuce and 5 variety of veggies with mayo, herbed cheese sauce and home made salsa which added a nice taste to the salad . I would just suggest add a bit more of the dressings over the lettuce. Overall a very nice experinece, the veggies are fresh looking forward to being here again. Just one more suggesstion explain the concept behind the cafe that would attract more customers and make them fall in love with this place.
A must visit for all the people of kolkata!! 
A nice change to all the greasy food available else where.

Located near ballygunge Phari, cafe pranah aims to cater to health and soul food, and being one of first of its kind in Kolkata, in spite of having some room for improvement, I feel it could be a trend setter in this segment !!!

Kolkata has always been short on salad bars, but cafe pranah not only gets the salad right but takes health food to an all new level, with choices that won't make you guilty. 

The location is superb. The decor is minimal and yet classy. Overall the ambiance is very soothing and relaxing. The seating is pretty comfortable. There is an open air seating space as well which I loved, though it would be more apt for holidays due to the heavy traffic nearby.

Coming to food, I loved the salad. The veggies were nice and fresh, dressings are all superb, my fav being kasundi, herbed cheese, olive jalapenos. The serving size is good. The amtitsari tikia was good but don't like the papri chaat. The ice teas are superb especially the rosemary ice tea which is to die for. The paneer tikka wrap was decent. The food menu apart from the salads, could be strengthened. I feel the presentation of food could be improved. Plus when the cafe serves healthy food, serving them in plastic plates do not fit in according to me, but that's totally owners decision.

Overall, I loved the place, loved the concept, and sure this is just the beginning !!!!

Very soothing ambience, good food. Fragrant teas are really good. Outdoor seating is pretty comfortable and service is quick.
Would go back again!

Cafe Pranah is chilled out and very McLeodgung like, and they have made me like teas, so I have to say I like this place. The kashmiri Kahwah, iced, is my poison of choice, and the chicken wrap is simple, clean and tasty. The salads are all DIY so you can select what you want ¬†(or not), and add the dressing of your choice - and there's something for everyone in the dressing zone (the olive jalapeno one is my favorite btw). The smoothies here are very nice - some come with the forbidden B-word in my dictionary (Banana!!!), which is sort of my Kryptonite, but well, there's the mango-basil cheesecake which puts me back in the groove.

Contrary to popular belief, healthy food can be tasty and lip smacking. This place does it with style and fervour. Be it the salads, wraps or burgers everything is so light and so tasty, most of it because of their unique dressings. Burgers are not greasy and doled with mayo, like the ones from most of the leading burger chains in town. Salads come in plenty of varities, with 5, 7 or 9 toppings, the main ingredient again upto you to choose from 10 odd varities and the finally a choice of 3 dressings. A pretty neat mix at 220. The interiors are again something that one wouldn't miss, everything is so calm and serene inside. They have a dream catchers wall right at the entrance on the right with accolades from visitors, something u wud definitely stop by to check out. 

Everything is to the T, except the outdoor seating, which can be a bit noisy and irritating as you have a hardware shop and a tyre repair shop right beside. Also, there is no washroom inside, so it can be a bit tricky for some people. 

Barring the two negatives, this place is surely a refreshing change and something that is surely going to make waves in the future :)

Cafe Pranah is another gem of an offering from Chef Mr.Rahul Arora,also the owner of Bon Appetit.The concept of "Health & Soul Cuisine" as they call it is something very new and unique.The owners are out to prove that food can be healthy yet tasty and they do a wonderful job at it.

Located right at Ballygunj Phari crossing,the lush green carpet that is laid down over the entrance is in itself a soothing change from the hustle and bustle of Ballygunj phari.I loved the idea of the green carpet.Once you enter,the enchanting peaceful music,the minimalistic yet blissful decor gives an amazingly different and calming ambience.There is facility for both indoor and open air seating according to your preference.

Coming to the food,they have a range of exotic teas(both hot and iced),soups,salads,burgers,Indian street food and desserts.Among the ones I have had,the hot kashmiri kawah tea is perfect in this winter.The cinnamon in the kawah is not over powering yet goes brilliantly.The Iced kashmiri kawah is equally good and will be my recommendation if you are looking for a cold beverage.The Orange iced tea and the Rosemary iced tea were also pretty good but the Kashmiri kawah was the hands down winner for me in the beverages section.

The salads section gives one the opportunity to make the salad of choice choosing 5 or 7 or 9 toppings and adding dressings of choice.The veggies and toppings are all fresh and healthy.The dressing is where the real fun lies.They offer a wide variety of innovative and unique dressings to choose from.I have been lucky enough to taste many of their dressings and I must say most of them are excellent.The kashundi vinaigrette is probably the best dressing ever and undoubtedly my favourite.The herbed cheese,mango chili and also the tamarind jiggery dressing deserve a special mention.The freshness of the veggies and the unbelieveably innovative dressings make for a sumptuous salad.

The Chicken olive wrap was again totally oil free and very very light.The stuffing was fresh and generous.The Indian Street food on offer here also follow the theme of health food.The Papri chat is unlike any other you have tasted before anywhere.The papris are all baked and the toppings and dressings are fresh and tasty.I honestly could never imagine a healthy papri chat without any compromise on taste.

Finally the Mango basil cheesecake smoothie.It was an absolute treat to the taste buds.I simply loved it and I am sure everyone will.

The owners Rahul and Rohit themselves try their best to look after the guests and help them with anything they require.The prices may be considered slightly high by a few but the quality will surely not let you down.

Overall caf√© pranah is a new concept which some people may need a little time getting used to.But it‚Äôs a concept that was badly needed and that has been almost perfected here.For the health conscious freaks this place is just what you were looking for.And for the others,a hardcore meat lover like me can assure you that this place will not let you down and it is definitely worth trying.You are in for a totally different experience at Cafe pranah and something that you will surely cherish.
Enjoy! :-)

Cafe Pranah - The Health Friendly Food joint which Kolkata (City of Joy) was lacking for a long time.¬†
=======
Location and Intro:

Cafe Pranah was visited today with one of my friend. It is very easy to locate as it's just beside Ballygunge Dhaba at Ballygunge Phari.

Cafe Pranah has a huge board on the top which makes it clearly distinct. As i took steps towards the cafe, i really enjoyed the ambience on the outside.It comprised of few tables and chairs with lighting and hanging decorated bells with incense stick and plants welcoming you to take a tour of the interiors of the cafe pranah. It was very much welcoming and the atmosphere was altogether calm and soothing with well decorations made on the outside as well as on the inside leaving hardly any scope of complaints.¬†

This is more like a healthy food joint. When i say healthy, it means healthy as well as tasty too. The ambience of the place was quite soothing having soft music on the back making you relax and enjoy the calm state of mind. The decor was simplistic with a window like structure which was used to keep books. Anyone can come here and relax over cup of coffee or ice tea and read on books endlessly. It also had minimalistic decors comprising of buddha statues kept on the book shelf.¬†
=======
Beverages, Food ¬†
¬†and Dessert Ordered:-¬†

1) Kashmiri Kahwah Ice tea - Unique, soothing and have become my personal favorite now. A must try for all. The dal chini flavour was perfectly complimenting the tea. If you didn‚Äôt try this, you missed something in life. :)

2) Chicken Burger - Served with ketchup. Quite filling, appropriate quantity of chicken stuffed with lettuce and other vegetables.¬†

3) Vegetable Wrap - A Cafe pranah version of Tortilla. Oil free. Consisting of vegetables and cottage cheese. Amazing, mouth watering and health friendly. I haven‚Äôt had such light wrap every before.¬†
4) Papdi Chaat - Not like the usual papdi chaat you eat everywhere. Again a big thanks to the chef Mr. Rahul Arora for getting a better version for it. #must try.¬†

5) Raisin Muffin - It was prepared with olive oil. How cool? It was really amazing. Inside it was smoky hot and mouth melting.¬†
========
Pros:

1) A very unique concept in the city of joy.¬†
2) Healthy + Delicious Food = You get it here.¬†
3) Serving speed was decent.
4) Soothing and calm atmosphere for having long conversations or reading books.
5) The preparation of each and every item was quite different than usual. Yes, if you like to try new stuffs, this is a must place for you.
6) Ambience with incense stick kept outside with grassy atmosphere and plants was very refreshing and lively.¬†
7) The music was perfectly complimenting the atmosphere.¬†
8) I don‚Äôt know whether everyone noticed it or not. They had deliberately kept a dustbin outside too so that to avoid littering of food stuffs as much as possible.¬†
9) No smoking even in outdoor seating area. (Good for non smokers)¬†

Cons:

1) Could have decorated the menu in a much distinct style.¬†
========
Meal for two: 450-850 max
========
Summary:¬†

Food quality 4.8/5
Food quantity 4.3/5
Taste 4.4/5
Hospitality 4.5/5
Value for money 4.2/5
Hygiene 4.6/5
Ambience 4.5/5
========
Conclusion:

I would first like to thanks and give my best wishes to Chef Rahul Arora to come up with such a lovely health food joint with such unique ideas which were lacking in the city of joy. All the best for upcoming future. I hope this cafe really set high standards for food quality and its servings in the city of joy (as it's needed the most). I hope they try and maintain their hospitality and serve up dishes consistently. Cheers. :)¬†

Location: Right opposite to Chinese Pavillion in ballygunge phari.

First of all a big congratulations to Rahul and company on their second venture. Bon Appetite is my all time favourite and now they have arrived with all new cafe pranah with health food. The concept is innovative and just opposite of bon appetite. Where bon appetite is all about calories this is all about guilt free yet taste bud tickling food.  Rahul himself was present to help us with the orders.  Amazing range of brewed teas. I love the himalayan magic which is rose flavored. A range of salads, oil less wraps and burgers. They have indian street food too which is also claimed to be oil free. So if you are health freak it's a must visit and if you are not its even better
Ambience: Ambience and music goes well with the concept. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. 
Will be returning soon. Cheers!!

my boyfriend spotted this place while driving by and we decided to stop in for a cup of tea. Cafe Pranah is unique. He had a cup of Assam tea and i had a wildberry flavored tea (sweet nothings). while there are many cafes in the city, Pranah offers a variety of choices to tea- lovers. The art of having the tea had a ritualistic pleasure for me, something to relish and not something to have merely on the go. we also had a wrap, and the best thing is that you have free choice to mix and match flavors and toppings. the place has a soothing touch about it. i would really like to become a regular to this place . :)

Cafe Pranah is the much awaited Cafe which has been launched very recently. Surprisingly it is located in Ballygunge Phari, beside The Dhaba. If you pass by it is bound to catch your attention with its drastic contrast in ambience with the surrounding. This unexpected cafe is welcoming and warm. It has an outside seating area as well as inside seats. You may choose to sit outside sipping your tea listening to the sounds of the busy street. Or you may, like I did, sit inside. The decor is earthly and spiritual just as its name promises it to be. There are books on shelves, and idols of Buddha resting amongst them. The best thing about sitting inside is the music. It is a soulful and calming mix of music from Japan,Tibet and obviously India. The best medicine for the over stressed, burnt out souls of Kolkata.
Once you are seated and have appreciated the ambience you move to the food. The menu is exquisite and you may need a little help with it. Rahul played the perfect host and helped us choose, and the servers were of great help too! We started off with Smoothies- the Tropical Paradise and Fruit of the Forest as suggested by Rahul. There are different choice of bases- cream base, yoghurt base or Ice cream base. We chose cream base.The Fruit of the Forest was made with berries and spices like nutmeg which gave warmth in the cold winter evening. The Tropical Paradise was fiesty, with green pepper hitting your taste buds, it is made with pineapple and banana. We then tried a multigrain burger which can be made with your choice of dressing and topping. We chose herbed chicken and veggies like cucumber and tomato with sweet mango and chilli and herbed cheese as dressing. We tried their salad with chicken sausages, red, yellow, green pepper and nuts. And their wrap with chicken sheekh, Kashundi Viniagrette and pepper yoghurt. Rahul helped us choose the dressings and I have fallen absolutely in love with the Kashundi Viniagrette.
After a very long time I can say I have spent a guilt free evening gorging on delicious food. I shall go back to try the rest of the menu. Please visit and have fun :)

Cafe Pranah ..... Health & Soul Cuisine is this delightful Cafe's self styled description and it sums itself up perfectly. This lovely oasis of calm set right at the very hectic and busy Ballygunge Phari crossing is such a delight to step into .... your immediate transported with its peaceful zen like vibe and all the hustle bustle melts away. It a place that is perfect both for someone to go spend some me time or to go with near and dear ones. The menu complements the concept perfectly. Healthy food does not need to be less tasty or low in flavor .... to get delightful layers of flavors and textures while retaining the natural integrity of the ingredients is something that Chef Rahul Arora seems to have mastered.

The Salad Bar gives you a choice of either 5 , 7 or 9 toppings and the freedom to make your own kind of salad with four easy distinctive steps ..... You choose the kind of lettuce / the vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients and a combination of upto three dressings of your choice and viola you have a delightful healthy meal at hand.The Tortilla Wraps and Multi-grain Burgers follow a similar concept easy and yet ingenious and super tasty. There is also some fantastic Chowpatty Papri Chaat , Amritsari Tikia and more all made with healthy (yes you heard me right) ingredients without any compromise on taste ... absolutely yummy stuff and some healthy desserts as well .... the Muffin was wonderful. 

Add to all this some fantastic Smoothies , Teas , Fresh Fruit Juices and Soup and your well on the road to guilt free indulgence.The Iced Kashmiri Kawah and the Berry Smoothie were awesome. 

Cafe Pranah your just what Kolkata needed and if a hard core non-vegetarian like me loved the stuff then you guys absolutely rock !!!!

As you walk past this place, the first thing that draws you in amid all the chaos is a patch of lush green turf leading into a warm and cosy cafe. Even before you enter, you feel a sense of calm. 

The menu is green too‚Äîfull of healthy, delicious food. The salad bar offers a variety of vibrant, crunchy greens from which to choose. There are wraps and burgers, all fresh and crisp. Besides, Calcutta finally has a place that serves a range of exotic teas (both hot and cold) that will relax you with their soothing aroma and subtle but potent flavours. My personal favourite is the Iced Kashmiri Kawah Tea. 

Having had the privilege of tasting most of the dressings, I must acknowledge Rahul Arora's (Cafe Pranah's chef) mastery in flavour layering. Nowhere else will food take you on a journey like in Cafe Pranah. Every bite is a surprise and keeps you salivating for more. And I haven't even mentioned the smoothies yet.

This joint is definitely going to set trends that push Calcutta's food scene in the right direction. Cheers to a job well done!

P.S.: Please make it so that your customers can order/buy dressing from you. Pretty please, with a cherry tomato on top!

My partner had spotted this new place few days back and it was yesterday only that we found a zomato page for Cafe Pranah - did not waste much time and headed there in the evening - turned out to be their first day ...
Great location. Decent seating arrangement ( outdoor is no-smoking as well ). Well mannered staff. Courteous owner catering to his guests.
Menu choice is limited food-wise i'd say. We ordered a berry infusion tea and a mango cheesecake smoothie. Smoothie was nice, though we'd prefer less ice. Tea did not impress much.
Advise for the management - do ensure all the items on the menu are available.
Overall, it is a nice attempt. Appreciate the concept of a healthy cafe, sans the hookah smoke that lingers on most cafes these days. We did have a good time there. Hoping to try out the salads and desserts next time.¬†
All the best for the venture.

Simple ambiance with a warm feel that lightens the tension and food that uplifts you...that's exactly what cafe pranah is all about....¬†The food is healthy to the core unlike the so called famous brands, these guys actually serve fresh stuff & not "refrigerated" food tossed up....Thankfully all their items have a less quantity of mayo in them which is a refreshing change. Starting from the chat which is made out of oats to the salads which has a balanced quantity of all the needed ingredients to the iced teas and smoothies.... the menu will surely pep up your mood yet keep your tummy ever smiling. Perfect place to hangout with your buddies or colleagues over a grub and upgrade their health quotient too.

Located in the heart of the city, cafe Pranah is a place after my own heart for seriously I don't have to calorie watch! Nor do I have to bother about the taste for the Chef behind the menu is the guy behind bon Appetite, one of my all time favourites. Health food never tasted so good, seriously. 
Baked oats papri with out any oil graces their menu. And a salad whose name I forgot, bowled me over. The wraps were good as well. But here I had the best warm tea I've ever had in my life called sweet love, which is a berry infusion type of tea, highly recommended by me.
But beyond the food the decor is serene. The window converted into a book rack has Buddha and that energy permeates all over the place. Will write more as I taste more.... But  go, go, go here!

I'm absolutely glad to be the first reviewer of this place. 
Firstly , I LOVE the decor , it totally transports you to this peaceful state of mind. 
I personally love the book collection of this place and the jasmine tea cups used to decorate the walls. 
Coming to service, again no complain with this one! 
Now talking about food. Well at first I was lil bit apprehensive with "Heath" cafe. 
Heath cafe ? That sounds very very not so yummy. And not appealing to my taste buds. 
BUT , as they say. Never judge a book by its cover. 
I am guilty here , cus all I can say is. I'm absolutely in LOVE with this place. 
Ask me why ? 
Well cus I can eat guilt free ! It's heathy but super yummy food ! 
Quick list of things you MUST try here. 
~ chicken burger 
~ wraps (veg / non veg) 
~delhi aloo chat 
~ Kashmiri kahwah iced tea. 
~ salads (with your choice of dressing, I love the honey mustard and mango garlic) 
~apple pie smoothie 
~ papaya almond smoothie 
~ corn mint tikka 
~papri chaat 
Yes that's about it ! 
Um really , hell no ! Eat everything else ! And you will love it. Cus you can see your food being cooked. And that is what is heathy , heathy is fresh ! 
And also it's extremely light on the pocket. 
So foodies , this place is a MUST visit !!! Dig in ! And eat guilt free !!
