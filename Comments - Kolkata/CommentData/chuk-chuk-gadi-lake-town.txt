This is an average restaurant. I visited this place. Ordered one paneer tikka, masala kulcha, chana masala and cold coffee. Paneer tikka and chana masala was average in taste. Kulcha was not upto the mark. The cold coffee was good but quantity should be increased. Ambience is not bad. You can see the history of railways here. Staffs are very gentle and ready to help. Good Management staffs. Hope visit this place again. But shall not order masala kulcha again.

The food and service both are way below average. Avoid if not absolutely impossible. The menu card is a false pretense because the truth is actually you get none of the mentioned food.

Went late and unexpectedly they were open till late. Staff is good but service was delayed. Food was awesome. Little dhaba style and complete Indian. They served aata tandoori rotis and get plus points for that.

Cozy little resto near the Big Ben

Food: We ordered Chicken drumsticks and Dry Chilli chicken along with a mocktail. Drumsticks were okayish, chilli chicken was not so dry, but tasted well. Mocktail didnâ€™t taste that good, though.

Ambiance: The place is located on the laketown road just after crossing the Big Ben. It is Railway themed. So contains various railway signage and small information about railways. The waiter is dressed as a railway coolie. The menu also contains railway pictures. However, the theme is not enough to impress one. There is a mocktail bar at the end of the restaurant.

Service: Service can be better. The floor manager knows well about the menu and the items available. However, the coolie dressed waiter is a dud. Cash and card both accepted. 

Overall: Nice place to visit. Might visit again if in the area.

Train themed restaurants are not new in town now. And this is really a poor attempt. One of their ac was non functional. Chinese chef was not available. Only dressing up waiter as coolie wont be pointers and that who names items wrong. Although idea is nice the food falls short. Terribly. And the waiting time was killing. Had lasuni murg kabab and dry chili chicken. Both decent i should say. Dissapointment was the mocktail which was whipped like a lassi and introduced as a lassi. 
Improvement on waiting time and food severely required.

Visited on 27th May 2017. Ordered South Indian Food. Service is very poor, having just one staff. Plates were not clean. Sambar masala was not hot. Other food was so so. Will not visit next time.
