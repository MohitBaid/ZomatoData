The food satisfied our taste buds. Ambient lighting and music based interiors are soothing to the eye aswell. :) The servers are polite and thus an overall happy experience. Would certainly like to visit soon again.

Being a 90s kid, I've grown up listening to Kumar Sanu. Just the ambiance and feel of the place is good enough to guarantee a revisit. The food can be worked upon and the service could be improved. They are moving in ghe right direction so keep up the efforts. Dum laga ke haisha!

Great food. Perfect for corporate business with good food in budget and collection of great drinks! A great place to chill over some cocktails and sizzlers with friends.

WE WENT ON A SUNDAY SO PARKING WAS NO ISSUE I  DON‚ÄôT THINK THEY HAVE ANY VALET PARKING.
LOCATED IN A PRIME LOCATION OF KOLKATA SECTOR-5 THE MOST UPCOMING PLACE OF KOLKATA IN RECENT TIMES !!!
AMBIENCE IS GOOD WITH MUSIC AND LIGHTS GOING, WORTH A PLACE TO GO WITH FAMILY .
SERVICE IS AVERAGE THEY ARE A BIT MESSY IN THERE SERVICE NEEDS A IMPROVEMENT FOR SURE!!
YES KUMAR SANU POSTERS ARE THERE BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS OWNED BY HIM SO THEY KEEP HIS SONGS RUNNING ALL TIME NOT A BIG DEAL THOUGH.
DONT GO FOR BUFFET AS THE WAY IT IS PRESENTED IS CLUMSY WELL I CANT DESCRIBE THAT I GUESS YOU GONNA HAVE TO SEE THAT BY YOURSELF.
CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUP WAS NICE.
DONT TRY LEMON CORIANDER SOUP ITS REALLY BAD. DO NOT SEE THE MENU CARD WHICH IS ON ZOMATO THEY HAVE CHANGED THERE MENU CARD.
SIZZLERS THEY HAVE EXCLUDED FROM THERE MENU CARD BUT THEY SERVE ONE SIZZLER, YOU HAVE TO ASK THE ATTENDANT FOR IT.
SO I HAD STARTERS CHICKEN TIKKA, HARILAYI TIKKA AND PESHAWARI TIKKA THEY WHERE NOT BAD THEY WERE INFACT COOKED GREAT.
HAKKA NOODLES AND FRIED RICE WAS NICE TOO BUT NOT THE TANGRA TYPE TASTE BUT IT WAS NICE.
THE GRAVY CHICKEN WAS NICE TO I ORDERED CHICKEN TIKKA BUTTER MASALA.
OVERALL ITS GOOD PACKAGE. 
FARELY PRICED ITEMS WITH DECENT QUANTITY AND GOOD QUALITY.
WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS SURELY RECOMMENDED!!!!

I think the worst buffet i ever had in my life. It was a birthday treat and i feel so bad that it ended with such a disaster. Now coming to review.
Starters:
1. Prawn balls, i could barely find any prawn.
2. Chicken cheese balls - The cheese tasted more like besan
3. Chicken kebab - It was a bit dry, but the only starter i liked
4. Fish fry - It was too oily
5. Soup - It was hot and good
Once we neared the end for starters, welcome drink arrived, how funny!!!!
For the main course, they did setup 2 salad plates in the buffet. One veg and other non-veg with no labels on either. When we asked them about the difference, they had to bring out the cook to identify which was veg and non-veg, which they themselves failed to identify, so we skipped it. The chicken had a foul smell. The mutton was too hard, i could barely use my spoon, so used my hand. The only thing i liked was the gulab jamun, had to fill my stomach with it.
Thank God, i am alive after eating the food. The only thing that deserves the 1 star rating was the ambiance. 
Guys, just opening a restaurant is not enough, FOOD is what defines you who you are!!!!

We went there on Friday afternoon for lunch. Our first shock was to found the restaurant was almost empty. While in Sector V on Friday afternoon, it is an arduous task to find a place to lunch, thought ourselves lucky to find an empty restaurant. The ambiance inside was quite good, it is Kumar Sanu themed. With his pictures along with various music legends of his time. It was playing all the yesteryear‚Äôs blockbuster songs. But, that‚Äôs the only time we felt good inside. Our ordeal started from the moment we started ordering. It has a very limited collection of choices. Though it provides us with a huge bulky menu card, a few of its items were actually available. After several times of hearing ‚Äúthat‚Äôs is not available, Sir‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not available, Sir‚Äù we finally ordered Tandoori Chicken (the easiest and most common dish, which is available even in roadside food joints) and Pan Fried Chilli Fish. The Tandoori Chicken was a disaster, we don‚Äôt even know, what to call it, ‚ÄúBoiled Masala Chicken‚Äù was the nearest, no smoky flavor. Even 80 Rupees roadside shack serve better Tandoori. The fish was not well cooked and was smelling. Next, we tried to order Keema Matar (another common dish), but it was not available. So, after insisting from the waiter we ordered Mutton Dak Bungalow along with Butter Naan. Though, the Naans somewhat ok-ish, but nothing great. The mutton was another disaster. What was served to us should be renamed as ‚ÄúBone Dak Bungalow‚Äù. We are lucky to survive this torture and come back alive. One of our fellow diners fell ill after returning from this place. WE SHOULD NEVER EVER VISIT THIS PLACE.

I visited DLKH on 4th January with my family to celebrate my little sister's birthday. Firstly I want to mention about the decor. This place is really cool and it feels pretty nostalgic with KUMAR Sanu memorabilia all around. Now about the food. We ordered Bhetki fish fry which was absolutely crackling. Another must try was their lachcha paratha and Shammi kebab. I also checked out the buffet too which was also impressive and price competitive. Over all kudos to team DLKH for making our food journey at their place a memorable one. Keep up the hard work going. Hoping to visit your place again. Highly recommend to all food lovers

Pathetic experience..... Horrible food..... Food was served cold and chicken pieces were very stiff and were actually stale.... Waiters very incompetent..... Manager was not accepting the fact that food was cold and he was extremely unprofessional.....825 was the buffet rate and the quality of food is bad..... Flies hovering around and when told,  waiters were reluctant..... Lights were being switched off while we were already present..... Every food was reheated which is never witnessed in a roadside shack too.... When the owner or co owner or dont know wat she is,  was informed about the same she in turn showed the most inferior level of customer orientation and put false allegations on me saying that we have harassed the waiters and the so called manager..... And she has clearly mentioned me not to visit DLKH again..... This is a request to Zomato to help me understand how and when did I harass the waiters there,  am sure there will be CCTV installed because myself holding a respectable position in the society.... This is a threat to my dignity... 

Owner, Co owner..... I demand a validation to this false allegation.....wherein I paid for the food served.... I really feel that you guys have never seen what exactly harassment means..... 

Zomato.... I request your help to make me understand  why the false allegations have been made inspite of serving us cold and stale food and that too by inefficient and ignorant people

One sentence enough:- GOD PLEASE SAVE ME... The worst buffet spread I ate yesterday....in details, we entered at 12.30 pm.. The restaurant still not open completely.. Most of the lights off, waiter told me please come after 30 mins. But we choose to wait here. Then all lights become on and Kumar Sanu songs start.. If you don't know, the restaurant interior inspired by Kumar Sanu... His song, movie poster all around u can find here. The starter they provide on the table... 4 veg and 4 Non-Veg food they served. Mash room preparation, stuff aalu, paneer Tikka and baby corn ok type taste. In Non-Veg section hariyali chicken kabab not well prepared. Too much sour in taste, another seekh kabab preparetion also very bad. Prawn manchurion too much salty and very small prawn they prepared...only fish golden fry good taste. After 1st time, they won't come to our table. I asked for repeat non veg starter. But they told me plz wait for few minutes. 2nd lot come after 15 mins and only 2 piece each.. The buffet price 744+tax but they don't want to serve 2nd time. The waiter went to outside from restaurant if we asked for repeat. We totally lost our pacient and asked for golden fry. But it came after 15 minutes.. We forget the starter and went for main course... We saw lot of main course items were there but we just chose non veg one. Keema curry bogus taste, chicken chap just like HELL. They provide us butter Nan but no proper tasty gravy items were there... Another important thing is that at 1.30 pm, no other foodie found at here. We are the only bakhra.... I normally prefer new and fresh restaurants for buffet. This experience totally destroy my passion for choosing new restaurants. I think they won't found proper customers and for that reason they not prepared good foods....at 2 pm one group were come and they choose Ala karte... I just leave my main course plate and went to desert section... There were no ice cream. Gulab Jamun what they prepared, I made it better taste. Pudding was OK and Sandesh also OK taste. We any how complete our food at 2.45 pm. Totally waste our money and time.. 744+tax...Just like hell. My suggestion is that plz don't go there. Taste, service and money all are bakwas....

With craving for food walked into this amazing place with Kumar sanu themed restaurant to find one of a hidden gem right in front of our eyes. Its location is fabulous, and if u are looking for tasty food and a few drinks then I guess it's one of a stop u should definitely make. We ordered a full bhetki fish sizzler which seemed to be on the winter special menu. And a  couple of drink and to be honest it was surprisingly  a amazing place. They seemed to also have a wide spread of buffet. The decor is a retro style with Kumar sanu songs playing at the background which is quite a pleasing with lunch and drinks.  Will definitely drop over next time in the evening with a few friends and a couple of drinks with some old music and guess the evening will be fab.. Great food and service.. Thanks.. :)

A very nice ambience with nice song screening over projector.Perfect place to visit with you friends and families. Although the food part was pretty ordinary
Non veg were good but veg were not.
D worst section was der breads
Butter naan wasnt cooked even properly.
We ordered afgahni chicken 
Chicken Bharta
Kadhai paneer 
Malai kofta
Masala khulcha

And butter naan
In starter baby corn and cheese chicken 
Started was very good 
Never order malai kofta and naan 
Dey were d biggest dissapointment
On a average a good restro to visit as price is quite low as compared to other big restro in sector 5

Dum Laga K Haisha is the creation of Melody King Mr. Kumar Shanu and I wish the food was that kinda good as his songs.

We went for a buffet menu at afternoon 2 days back and after entering the restaurant I fall in love with the ambiance and the decor. Staffs were friendly too.

Coming to the food we check that most of the items looked very old and dry, including the desserts were looking very old.

From the starters we loved the Fish Batter Fry and it was good rest all the items were somewhat horrible like extra salt, over heated, cheese items has no cheese etc.

Drinks served to us which was complimentary in a 150 ML foam cup which just very bad and really unacceptable and like were are having soda in a road side stalls.

Main course was just like hell I couldn't have it specially the Chinese dishes. Indians are comparatively good than their chinese siblings.

Well that's it, I spent 1488 INR for this shit I ate.

The food was undoubtedly awesome. It was delicious and flavorful, and served hot. I had chicken reshmi kebab, which was served with a complimentary pudine ki chutney, for the starter, and the meat was extremely tender. I took chicken tikka butter masala as my side dish, and again, there was a burst of flavours in my mouth. The Keema naan was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with plenty of keema sprinkled all over the surface. The aroma of the food was A1.
The best things about the place is the ambience, great decor and amazing songs from the 90s.And anyone who's a great Kumar Sanu fanatic, this place is for you!

With a beautiful ambience n the legendary singer Kumar Sanu's songs playing in background this place is perfect for families as well as for a date. Food quality is amazing. Must try dishes are the chicken cheese kabab,fish malai kabab and biriyani. And not to miss the deserts which is like the cherry on the cake.

Been here for a team lunch, ordered fish malai kabab, mahi tandoori kabab, chicken cheese kabab, murg reshmi kabab, vegetable sheel kabab and crispy chilli baby corn in starter the raat of the non veg starter specially the fish are really good but the taste of veg kabab is like dry vegi stuffed with something and served, crispy chilli baby corn is just ok... 
And now come the main course... Garlic chicken, singapore noodles, bhuna gosht, prawn onion pulao, mutton keema, chicken rezzala, garlic naan and chinese chopsuey veg was our order...
First the quantity of the side dish is not adequate as per the price they are charging... Now the taste of the food... I tested each and every item .... Singapore noodles are very much sweet, other items taste wise we can't say very good also not very bad it's ok ok type... I asked the waiter suggest me a spicy side dish he said try chicken Afgani and it come to be the most non spicy dish ..... The taste of prawn onion pulao is good and satisfying among all the above main course...
Will visit again this place for the ambiance, but if the restaurant person is able to view my comments I will suggest him to work on your kitchen for taste and with waiters on service need to be faster....

We went for a team lunch today. The restaurant is very easy to locate. Just opposite to the Backstage restaurant near Webel More. We went for there set buffet menu. We prebooked the restro before hand but they seems to be little slow. The starters were good but soon it got finished. They took 10-15 mins time to refill the starters. The main course was average. Dessert were limited and not as per the menu given. Soon after 5 mins the desserts also got over leaving 4-5 people with no Sandesh.when we asked they said it is not available. Anyways they tried to make up with a free drinks and that was nice. Overall Staffs were good and well behaved, Food quality 3/5.

Located very near to the Webel more in Sector 5, this restaurant is quite easy to locate. The interiors are adorned with singer Kumar Sanu's photos, memorabilia and lines of some of his songs. We visited this place on a weekday with a huge group of office colleagues. We had opted for their buffet spread. The buffet, though on the costlier side when compared to the likes of Chai Break and other restaurants, was quite good really, in terms of variety and the number of items served. Cuisine offered in the buffet is mainly indian and chinese. The starters were good, especially the prawn manchurian, fish orly, mutton sheekh, chicken cheese balls etc. The main course consisting of mutton dakbanglow, garlic chicken, fish amritsari were great too. The desert section had a lot of items and the best was undoubtedly the chocolate montecarlo. Service was decent, though managing a huge crowd can get difficult. All in all a decent restaurant. Will visit again to try some of their a-la-carte menu items like the jugli kebab.

" Dum Laga K Haisa" - Straight out of Bollywood , definitely a unique and new name for Kolkata cuisine culture. Located near Sector V college more near Alibaba. 
¬† 
First thing you will notice about the restaurant is its Filmy ambiance, straight out of 90's masala films- vibrant, colorful , full of life. it instantly sets you for great experience. Interior is dominated by yellow color which is used cleverly.¬† Filmy posters and off course Kumar Sanu's songs will set your mood. 

Now lets come to food- Chinese & Indian Mughlai these two cuisines are offered here.¬† As located at heart of IT office culture we found it totally empty on Sunday evening¬† which is not bad.. ;) . We opted for north Indian dishes which were pretty good.¬† I m totally sold out on their breads. Masala Kulcha & Garlic Nun perhaps best in Kolkata. I want to mention one thing their Masala Kulcha was really Masala Kulcha, not stuffed over sized alu paratha ! Kebab was good , fresh &¬† soft . Pudina chatni deserves a special mention . Staffs are very well behaved. 
I have few observation or suggestions about the place. Size of Kebab pieces or chicken in north Indian dishes can be generous. I find it bit small in compare to other big names. They could definitely have multiple wash rooms which is essential for busy days.
Overall i had a good experience .
¬†It is a charming and well spaced place for hangout. .5 extra star for the interior and service.¬† Definitely a place for recommendation. :)

Absolutely disgusting experience. First of all delay in servicing the food- approximately it took at least 45 min to serve the first dish of chicken kebabs. Next starter along with main course were served even after 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, a person claiming "Director" himself  of the restaurant intervened and tried to hasten the process of servicing but of no use!
Next ordeal was to serve a fish dish, where clearly rotten fish was served to us. We objected and immediately they removed pieces from our dish. They tried to cover up the incidence by offering a special "signature dish" of mutton to us in addition to our order free of cost. Also, finally, when we expressed our grudge, they offered us special 10% off on the total bill. Food quality was not too great and also amount of food in each dish was not sufficient. Recommendation is not to visit such place, which could be awesome experience. It's just a wastage of money and time. Thanks.

It was really wonderful experience being there.
If you are fond of fish drop right now.
We tested some fish and chicken mutton combo kebabs and no words to describe them!
It was pure vetki fish and the tanduri pomfret was mind blowing.

Situated at the main Sector V road near the Webel crossing this is the restaurant of the legendary Bollywood singer Kumar Sanu offering Mughlai & Chinese cuisines.Full marks to its neat & sprawling almost square shape showcasing various achievements & anecdotes of the singer.The bar is not functional yet,so options were limited for mocktails but they served a refreshing Virgin Mojito.After a tryst with a decent Tom Yum soup we chose to go with the Mughlai dishes which proved to be rewarding.Both Dum Ka Jugli Kabab,having chicken kabab inside a mutton covering,featured in the Sanu‚Äôs Signature section of the menu card and Fish Malai Kabab were excellent.The Mutton Biriyani was little flat but Fish Tikka Masala,Chicken Afghani,Mutton Daakbunglow along with Kabuli Naan were lip smacking stuffs.We signed off with Truti Fruiti.The waiters were attentive & the service was prompt.They were playing the iconic Sanu songs in loop but a lower volume level could have made it a more charming experience.And that pice hotel style diluted hand wash besides the wash basin is a boo!Overall it is a place worth visiting in every way.

Very easy to locate if you are going from webel more to college more it will be on right hand..first one will be introduced by K S in the door as door handle for Kumar Sanu which gives you a good vibe from the restaurant and that vibe won't let you down at all.. once you enter you will be welcomed with everything yellow.. started from the sofas to Ac s the theme is yellow..and Kumar Sanu's pictures on all walls with various artists and all Kumar Sanu songs in the background sets a good mood. Now coming to the food...we were a huge group almost of 30 people and we took both mughlai and Chinese
Coming to mughlai there was chicken tandoori which was soft and juicy and was well prepared for main course there was roti and mutton and chicken rezala average and definitely not Arsalan or Shiraz type but ok..dum biryani took lot of time because they were not prepared to accustom so many people so it took time it was light but the rose water smell was too much I felt and you don't get that aroma which will make your mouth watery it was average
Chinese just horrible don't try Chinese there we took pan fried fish which was less smicy on request Nd was good then dragon chicken too salty pieces were too small for main course there was mixed fried rice quality of the rice is average as of foot path yes that is what it was...it was ordinary very ordinary rice hence the rice itself wasn't anyone fav and main course was manchurian chicken I will give a rating 1 for manchurian chicken it gives 8 pieces but if you combine 3 pieces of their manchurian chicken it will give you 1 piece of chicken of Chinatown or better restaurant the pieces were that small it came in small bowls gravy insufficient for 2 people 1 plate is sufficient for 1 person or maybe an adult and a kid max then last but not the least for desert tutty fruity better compared to other foods but again the jam which they gave was way too much which resulted in over sweetening but since it is a dessert comparable ohk and to top that there was a power cut they said it was a fault but later going to my office we heard it was normal power cut so they didn't had their generator running..
So the final verdict
Location- 4 point
Decorations-4 point
Food- 2 points
Overall experience- 3 points

I went to this place with office colleagues on a Thursday. To be frank this was not in our mind as went to try out Kareem's but Kareem's only opens at 19:00hrs.

This is a brand new restaurant in Sector 5 owned by Kumar Sanu and for obvious reasons the entire restaurant is themed with the life of Kumar Sanu - Snaps with other music maestros and stalwarts in the industry, his peers and his life history. The ceiling is decorated with a giant Guitar structure.
One thing I liked about the place that the wall mounted indoor units of the AC have also been coloured and designed as per the specific walls on which those are mounted - shows their detailing.

A big spacious space. And again goes without saying the restaurant only plays Kumar Sanu's song in this background.

Lets come to the food...So that I dont have to write the same thing for all the dishes we tried- let me summarise - all the dishes were too good and extremely tasty and yummy. The fish items were the highlight - Fish items are a definite try if you are visiting this place.¬†

Dum ka Jugli Kebab - basically chicken stuffings inside Mutton Sheekh Kebab.
Fish Malai Kebab
Fish Tikka Kebab
--- for both the Bhetki was rightly cooked and I can again go back for these Kebabs.
Pomfret Tandoori - This was also good.

I will give 4.0 as there was minor hiccup, coordination issue between the serveurs which led to extra billing which we cancelled. I am sure on my next visit I will not face any such issues and if they can keep up this good taste the rating will also go up.

Brand new restaurant in the tech hub of Sector V. All 90s kids are gonna love it as it is owned by and themed after the great Kumar Shanu da.

"Dil pe tere pyaar ka paigaam likh du, aaja zindagi mein tere naam likh du"

Yes, soulful melodies like this plays in the background all the time. The decor is uber cool, with Shanu da's pics in the walls and pillars, very bright color combination and comfortable seating options. The staff is friendly and helpful. Menu includes Indian, Chinese and a few continental options. Bar is yet to open, but will be there shortly.

We had Special Mutton Biryani which was light and good. We also had Baked fish which comes with boiled veggies and french fries. This dish was tasty too.

Good place to hang out with friends. Price is within budget. All Kumar Sanu fans must make here atleast once. Otherwise it will break the man's heart and he will ask, "Tumi ele na, kano ele naaaa".

Chinese just horrible don't try Chinese there we took pan fried fish which was less smicy on request Nd was good then dragon chicken too salty pieces were too small for main course there was mixed fried rice quality of the rice is average as of foot path yes that is what it was...it was ordinary very ordinary rice hence the rice itself wasn't anyone fav and main course was manchurian chicken I will give a rating 1 for manchurian chicken it gives 8 pieces but if you combine 3 pieces of their manchurian chicken it will give you 1 piece of chicken of Chinatown or better restaurant the pieces were that small it came in small bowls gravy insufficient for 2 people 1 plate is sufficient for 1 person or maybe an adult and a kid max then last but not the least for desert tutty fruity better compared to other foods but again the jam which they gave was way too much which resulted in over sweetening but since it is a dessert comparable ohk and to top that there was a power cut they said it was a fault but later going to my office we heard it was normal power cut so they didn't had their generator running..
So the final verdict
Location- 4 point
Decorations-4 point
Food- 2 points
Overall experience- 3 points

I went to this place with office colleagues on a Thursday. To be frank this was not in our mind as went to try out Kareem's but Kareem's only opens at 19:00hrs.

This is a brand new restaurant in Sector 5 owned by Kumar Sanu and for obvious reasons the entire restaurant is themed with the life of Kumar Sanu - Snaps with other music maestros and stalwarts in the industry, his peers and his life history. The ceiling is decorated with a giant Guitar structure.
One thing I liked about the place that the wall mounted indoor units of the AC have also been coloured and designed as per the specific walls on which those are mounted - shows their detailing.

A big spacious space. And again goes without saying the restaurant only plays Kumar Sanu's song in this background.

Lets come to the food...So that I dont have to write the same thing for all the dishes we tried- let me summarise - all the dishes were too good and extremely tasty and yummy. The fish items were the highlight - Fish items are a definite try if you are visiting this place.¬†

Dum ka Jugli Kebab - basically chicken stuffings inside Mutton Sheekh Kebab.
Fish Malai Kebab
Fish Tikka Kebab
--- for both the Bhetki was rightly cooked and I can again go back for these Kebabs.
Pomfret Tandoori - This was also good.

I will give 4.0 as there was minor hiccup, coordination issue between the serveurs which led to extra billing which we cancelled. I am sure on my next visit I will not face any such issues and if they can keep up this good taste the rating will also go up.

Worst food ever tasted in Saltlake. Too much less options in buffet. Veg options was very less. Only the ambience is good, other than that its worst of money. Better to go BBQ or Chai break in the same amount and have delicious and variety cusiene.

Brand new restaurant in the tech hub of Sector V. All 90s kids are gonna love it as it is owned by and themed after the great Kumar Shanu da.

"Dil pe tere pyaar ka paigaam likh du, aaja zindagi mein tere naam likh du"

Yes, soulful melodies like this plays in the background all the time. The decor is uber cool, with Shanu da's pics in the walls and pillars, very bright color combination and comfortable seating options. The staff is friendly and helpful. Menu includes Indian, Chinese and a few continental options. Bar is yet to open, but will be there shortly.

We had Special Mutton Biryani which was light and good. We also had Baked fish which comes with boiled veggies and french fries. This dish was tasty too.

Good place to hang out with friends. Price is within budget. All Kumar Sanu fans must make here atleast once. Otherwise it will break the man's heart and he will ask, "Tumi ele na, kano ele naaaa".

Went there on 29th Oct when the owner Kumar Sanu was there. That was a special day so they offered a buffet of Rs. 1003. It was very good. But as we came to know that they dont offer buffet on other days. Giving 5 star to that day's experience.

A dear friend's advance birthday treat and somehow we were able to make ourselves available for lunch one fine afternoon. And since sector V was our most convenient location we decided to check out the latest news in tinsel town ' Dum laga k Haisha'.

DECOR: The insides are sizeable with ample leg room and the tables spacing is also very judicious so you have enough privacy. The decor is superb and top marks to the designer who colour coordinated the walls and the furnitures very well. They took a calculated risk with sunshine yellow and passed with flying colours. It was the perfect mood lifter for us as it was raining heavily outside. The cutleries, dishes,napkins everything was in tandem with the decor.

AMBIENCE: I am a 90s kid and Kumar Sanu will always have a special place in my heart. Listening to him and Alka Yagnik belt out one good song after another was a different experience altogether

FOOD: We ordered chicken cheese kebabs and Dum ka jugli kebab for starters. The chicken cheese kebab was bang on! The chicken was soft and tender, very juicy and very fulfilling. The dum ka jugli kebab could have been better as I found the mutton a bit too dry for my liking. The mint chutney was great though. And if you are in the mood for a scrumptious lunch I suggest you order the sweet lime soda. Its refreshing and tastes really good. For our main course we ordered the chicken fried rice, corn rice chicken, hong kong chicken and devil's chicken. Corn rice chicken was absolutely fantastic. The corn was fresh and cooked perfectly so was the rice, Chicken fried rice tasted well too, wasn't out of the ordinary. Hong kong chicken too was agreeable, the sauce was of perfect consistency and chicken was cooked well. What really stole my heart was the Devil's chicken. I savoured it to my heart's content. It is really delectable. Perfectly aromatic and has a different, tempting taste that will make it difficult for you to stop eating it. For dessert we ordered tutti fruity icecream, we didn't want any as we already crossed the fine line between eating and over eating, but the Ma√Ætre D (I suppose it was him) insisted and I am really thankful he did because the icecream was absolutely delightful with a capital D. They used fresh fruit and premium quality vanilla ice cream. It really was the perfect end to our hearty meal. The only fault I found was the lack of presentation in their dishes. A restaurant like this and you would expect them to bring some uniqueness to the appearance of the dish but sadly there were none.

SERVICE: There service was prompt, the waiters were well trained and very efficient. The staffs are polite, agreeable and they assisted us with the menu with great competence and whatever they suggested was really up to the mark. And so the .5 in 4.5 is exclusively for them. Their facilities could have been a bit more clean though.

All in all the place has been a great experience for me and I wouldn't mind visiting it again and again.

The place has a pretty good ambience and the atmosphere feels just soothing with those songs in the background. For the starters we ordered Chicken Hariyali kabab which was tender and juicy, the chicken was soft and we enjoyed having it. Next for the starters we were suggested Dum ka Jugli kabab which was Chicken coated with a layer of Mutton, this dish didn't seem that appelaing to me as the mutton layer seemed a little hard and dry. Coming to the main course we had Chicken Butter Masala and Chicken Afghani on our table along with Butter Naan and Lachcha Paratha.. The main course was fine and one of the best preparation of North Indian dish.  The food was really tasty and we were all overwhelmed. So all in all we had a great supper and enjoyed dining at Dum laga ke Haisha. It hits on an average on the pocket. Other than food and pocket pinch, the service was good too. Thank you!

Got to knw about this place from t2 food joint of Kumar Sanu so decided to go there after reading the reviews.
The decor is nice with a musical touch which is obvious and you get to hear hits of Kumar Sanu  the staff is very polite and cordial 
Now comes the food the food is good up to the expectation though the mutton reshmi kebab was very hard we were not able to tear it but as and when we said that they changed the dish with chicken cheese kebab which was soft nd really good in taste.
As per me u should try once in this place

We went to this place for a treat. After reading all these good reviews we were expecting something heavy duty, especially when this restaurant is associated with bollywood celebrity. The ambience is colorful and warm . Bright yellow color instantly makes you feel happy. We ordered fish malai kebabs, chicken hariyali kebab, masala kulcha, mutton do peyaja, mutton bhuna, chicken reshmi masala, methi chicken, mutton biriyani (not kachchi biriyani). Also ordered virgin mojito and lime soda. Each of the dishes were lipsmacking, especially the kebabs and kulcha. The side dishes were good too. Biriyani was just standard biriyani, nothing special. Now let's talk about service. The staff is totally inexperienced, super slow and inefficient. The lime sodas were horrible. When we asked them to replace the sodas, they were just simply confused. After telling repeatedly, finally they came back and said they don't have the sugar syrup any more. So they replaced with coca cola. The service was very slow. We got our main courses served after half an hour of ordering them. Also be careful with the bill. Mutton kebabs which were costlier has been billed instead of chicken kebabs. They have deducted the amount after we pointed that out. All the points are for food only. 0 point for service. It has to improve to retain customers.

I would recommend the Prawn Biryani and Tandoori dishes to try at this place. Kumar Sanu themed Club resto bar brings back so many memories of tunes of the bygone era. My only request is to increase the quantity of each item. Great place.

Super bad ,third class,worthless,tasteless,bad service what else should I say.....I visited this place on saptmi..but finding it absolutely empty during such a festive tym I did n feel like sitting so left.. today I finally checked into this place with a frn from Delhi.My honest feedback is in the first line of this review absolutely disaster u can say.The manchow soup that v ordered(special request pure veg) smelled terribly of egg .V even tasted for confirmation n was sure there was some element of egg in it..plus the noodles that's served with the soup I suppose should be crisp ,were boiled noodles dipped in oil...I literally pressed it to check n even showed it to the waiter n manager who had to agree..then came in the crispy chilly baby corn...My friends plz don't order this item...they fry it raw...so once u taste it it will feel like something raw is just soaked in hot oil...nor crispy nor tasty not edible...v din wanna order further n paid n left...but my suggestion..these ppl r using brand Kumar Sanu and giving shit service..avoid this place.

The new restaurant which opened it‚Äôs doors just before the pujas takes us back to the retro era as soon as you enter with it‚Äôs music and decor. The decor is inspired by Kumar Sanu with his many songs, trivias on him and his pictures with other celebrities. All in all a colourful place !
Now coming to food, the Prawn Biriyani is a must try ! The Crispy Chicken was a bit less in quantity. The Badami Kebabs were scrumptious ! Even the Golden Fried Prawns were crispy and yum !
The Garlic Chicken tasted a bit salty for my taste . 
Even the vegetarian dishes were really tasty !
But all in all the food quality is at par with the various other restaurants in that area.
The service is good but the waiters were a bit clueless about the menu and had to keep going back to ask the heads.
A great place, recommended for family !
Enjoy.

After getting tired of pandel hopping me with my 3 ither friends came to this place to have lunch on 'ponchomi'..i saw this one on 'zomato' as a newly opened one and it's based on the theme of the famous legend "KUMAR SANU",beautifully decorated place with photoframes,unique style of wall decoration with coloured bottles etc.

The most important thing which drew my attention was the name 'DUM LAGA K HAISHA',cause it's a movie name and i'm sure not only me but many of you have seen this and no doubt loved it too‚ù§

 Location is very easy,just beside alibaba at sector 5 saltlake / opposite of Bakstage.

When we went,were greeted nicely and after having a table i was checking out the place,my friends also appreciated the place and they said it very nice, the songs played were by 'KUMAR SANU' and it created a perfect ambience..i was also singing with those songs and we had too much fun..

Not much people were as it was totally new one opened just 4 days before that and we came to know this from the manager of this restaurant itself.

We took the menu and ordered these items-
1. Sweet fresh lime soda- It'a must one in my every visit to a restaurant.
2. Lacha paratha- had a great taste.
3. Masala kulcha- best ever i tried,this one won my heart.
4. Chicken tikka butter masala- went well with those paratha and kulcha. 

Had a delicious lunch over here and no desserts were available because they could not make such arrangements and many things were to be done properly as i already earlier that it was newly opened one.

Hope to go there again to experience dining in a properly settled restaurant and to have much more fun that we had already.

The starters are awesome and the ones which are Kumar Sanu‚Äôs favourite should be tried!
The kebabs tasted prime and delicious.
The ambience is great with big space.
The most important part is service. I am impressed by the personalised service which I hardly find in even most popular restaurants in Kolkata.
To conclude I would say, go and taste the music along with the food. You will surely find the rhythm of 90s at par in the food!

I went to this plan on a durga puja night as all the famous late night eateries were heavily crowded. This is place is opposite to backstage near webel more in sector 5, saltlake. The place was large with assorted sitting arrangement. I am not sure whether ot was due to the usual festive rush of the city or not but the service was very slow. I waited almost 25 minutes to get a seat (which is absolutely fine) then had to wait more 30 minutes to get a menu card and another 30 for waiter to come and take your order. I ordered tandoori chicken and chicken hariyali kabab which were really good. Theu were cooked well and perfect balance of spice coating served with green pudina chutney. Then I ordered a chicken biryani and kadhai chicken with it. Biryani was ok. I found salt to be very less and the rest of it was ok. But the kadhai chicken I ordered was a disaster. I am.not sure how it actually tastes but surely not what I had. It had a weird tangy taste and chicken was not cooked well. I could not finish that. Apart from this thr ambience is good and they will play kumar sanu songs all the time as that is the theme.

With the excitement of trying out food from new restaurants, I planned to take home food on the occasion of Durga Puja Navami. The ambience is as per expectations with background music of Kumar Sanu being played. There is a bit of history about Kumar Sanu being displayed too. I chose to order Chinese for my family; ordered crispy chicken, pan fried fish as starters and chicken fried rice and fish in hot garlic sauce as main course. No complaints on the quantity which is commensurate with the prices they charge. However disappointed with the quality. Crispy chicken was not great and moreover in both the starters they give too much of carrots and beans. The fish items were relatively better than the crispy chicken and fried rice was ok. Next time planning to try Indian dishes.

We enjoyed delicious fooding items with very reasonable prices and of course sanu da's romantic songs over there. Please come to the restaurant definitely.....I just want to describe one words regarding this fantastic restaurant,  " Kuch Na Kaho, Kuch Bhi Na Kaho"......

It was a very good experience to visit Dum Lagake Haisha, a newly opened restaurant at Sector V yesterday. Foods were excellent. Wonderful ambience. Spacious. Good interior. Above all we enjoyed Kumar Sanu's song.

The d√©cor is good and the people were courteous. But those are the only good things. What's a restaurant for if the food doesn't live up to your expectation!!! Because you do expect a certain quality when a renowned name like Kumar Sanu is associated to a place!!!Raw and over salted fish and bland rice made us lose our appetite. But the manager didn't charge us for the food we complained about. However,the purpose of going to the restaurant got defeated. Competent authorities must take care of the quality issues. Won't recommend it to anyone,sorry :(

Being a die-hard fan of the legendary singer, I decided to lay my foot on this nascent restaurant. Was pleased and satisfied by the greeting of the service men and also by the space it provided.
Waiting time was usual, not on the longer side though, and I spent my time roaming around collecting trivia about KS. You can almost find a gist of the Wiki page on KS, there. 
The ambience was nice and decor theme was colorful and jovial. Food was OK, but since this was my debut visit, won't comment on it yet. 
Would be waiting for the club and bar to open and get to meet my idol, some day,there. Yes, this might be a surprise package which they'll introduce shortly.

Today we went to this newly opened restaurant by Kumar Shanu. We had a good experience. Good decor and good service. We took Jugli Kebab as starter. It was a combination of chicken and mutton seekh kebab and tasted excellent. We ordered Kacchi Mutton Biriyani and it was heavenly. Soft mutton pieces and flavorful potato added to the exquisite taste of this light biriyani. The amount of rice in Biriyani could have been a little more for the price. The chicken sukkha side dish was okay. The restaurant staff was very courteous and we got a complimentary virgin mojito.

Quality of food is very nice. One of the best in Sec 5, Quality of food is far better than rest in Sec 5. I have been there twice and definitely visit soon again.
