Such a bad experience. After the given time limit, they are calling me n asking me to cancel my order. N the reason they gave was because many orders are in queue they cannot deliver my order. I have never seen such unprofessional ppl. This is the 1st time i ordered from this restaurant. N it turned out to be a bad one. I am definitely not going to recommend this restaurant to anyone else.

This place offers good breakfast from 7:30 am onwards, with prompt service. Undoubtedly, food is available early in the morning thus preventing us from starving, but the quality of the food is not satisfying. 
The Green salad was delicious and up to the mark, whereas the sandwich wasn't just bland but also unappetizing. 
Yet, good regards to the team. Looking forward to a little improvement in the quality and quantity.

As the name suggests, this place offers you the best breakfast. It opens really early. I had ordered via Zomato and the order arrived real quick. If you are a VEGAN, this place has a whole lot of options: healthy salads, sandwiches etc. The packaging was great. The veggies were fresh and the sandwich was very tasty. I ordered the Veganism Sandwich and an exotic salad. I would suggest this place to everyone if you want to have a healthy breakfast.

I ordered sausage frittata n bacon omelette with chicken sandwiches. Sausage frittata n bacon omelette were outstanding. Sandwiches were also good. Delivery was pretty late May b due to puja n heavy rain. Overall a good experience.

Ordered online here on 4th of august 2017. Loved the concept of proving a sumptuous whole breakfast, specially the timing when most of the food places are closed. Food is as promised. The sandwitch and omlette tasty and fruits decent. The delivery was also on time. Would like to order here again. 
Just would like to suggest to management to add a brown bread option for sandwiches.

I was so lucky to be their first day customer.
Foods were so lip smacking that made my morning a special one.
Price is pocket friendly and the packaging was very innovative.
