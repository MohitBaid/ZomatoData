This place is a takeaway food joint situated on the sakherbazar crossing. This place is situated near to my coaching classes so had visited here a many times. I have tried their chicken and egg roll. Both the rolls are average in taste. So for me its 3.

Located opposite to the lane of Behala Thana on the right, while entering the lane.  The specialty of this outlet is mainly rolls. Love their rolls stuffed with enough filling of chicken sheekh kebab.

One of the chilhood fast food center in sakherbajar. I Used to alwasy compare their rolls with Haji's. I remember how much I used to love the mutton tikia and tandoori rooti. Yes am having food here since the egg rolls used to cost just Rs. 8 and Tikia rolls for Rs. 13. 
Today also I brought a packet of biriyani from the place. THe food and the staffs are awesome. If you are searching for a fast food centre in sakherbajar, this is the place you wanna go.

A takeaway, this is behalas answer to Park Streets hot kati rolls. Biryani, which is okay, is also available. Things move fast here,living up to the fast food tag and the rolls are better in taste than hajis.

This place is located near Behala Thana and you can see this place when you move towards Parnashree. A very small place serving rolls for a long time. They also give Biryanis in a very reasonable price. I have had rolls from here many a times and they make it decent. But to be honest there are many other places where you would get better rolls from here. I had a Egg Chicken Roll which I mostly prefer, the paratha was just okay, the chicken chunks could have been more. I didnt have anything else from here apart from rolls so I cant judge them on that.

This takeaway counter serves good and decent quality rolls and thats it. That is its specialisation. They biryani they offer is of so-so quality. You might give their rolls a try. Located just next to the gopinath sweet shop.
