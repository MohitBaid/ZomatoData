We tried the weekend buffet and it was pretty good. The spread was nice for the price. Though their dessert didn't impress me that much , their starters were pretty amazing. Specially the fish item that they served for starter. If you  Looking for pocket friendly buffets your search ends here...

This was on my bucket list for a long time so the expectations were high. In the end it was disappointing. I took my wife on our marriage anniversary. The ambience was good. We started with #ChickenDimSum which was so poor that they changed it themselves. Then we ordered #HakkaNoodlesMixMeat. We were confused about the side so we approached the waiter for his recommendation and I clearly informed him my preference like Pork in a Non-spicy gravvy. They served us #SlicedPorkinChilliPlumSauce which was so hot that we couldn't able to eat. When I ask the manager then he informed that pork items are not available in less spicy gravvy. Also the sliced pork were like toasted bacon. It was really disappointing. Then the manager offer us a complimentary ice cream which is not a good sign I believe. You simply can not offer free food if your main course sucks. Can't recommend to a friend.

Wall is the place to be if you have a great taste in Chinese food and have some money in your pockets.
Yes, good quality chinese comes with a price at the Wall. The lunch buffet though is quite scrumptuous and resonable, although they should experiment with different items other than their regular ones.

So this was my second visit to The Wall. Owing to Christmas eve they had a few special duck dishes on their menu. We tried the Pecking Duck(full) which is basically a dish from Beijing. It included an entree, a soup and main course side, all cooked from the same duck. The entree was the traditional pecking duck where we had to make a roll out of the roasted ducks with crispy skin, the chinese pancakes, veggies and the hoisin sauce. Even though the dish was on the sweeter edge, it was something new and definitely worth trying. The soup was basically the salty duck broth, the presence of bones was not appreciated but the flavour was rich. We had Pad thai noodles and hot basil noodles along with Schezwan duck and Assorted pepper duck. All of which were simply amazing. The Pad Thai noodles is a must try for everyone. Like always this place keeps its promise and delivers truly wonderful authentic asian food. :)

The ambience is good. Behaviour of staffs is good. Foo0d is good.l tried there weekday buffet. It is nice. The quality and variety of starters is exellent. But main course is so so . There is no much variety in  main course and the taste is also ordinary. The desert section is rather very good.The overall experience is good and worth every penny.

This is my second visit in Wall, which is located in Southern Avenue. I had visited it once before. It was my birthday and boyfriend decided to give a treat to some of my and his close friends. We went for the buffet. But other than that we ordered for 4 beers. 

Coming to the starters in the buffet we were given 2 chicken starters and 2 fish starters. Since there was no fish starter it was a little disappointing me since one of my friends doesn’t eat chicken. However one cannot complain regarding the starters. 

Coming to the main course, there was one chicken one fish and 2 veg side dishes along with rice and noodles. 

The desserts had 3 different types of ice cream, Darshan, brownies and kiwi mousse. 

The only complaint I have is that there wasn’t any fish starter which it had during my previous visit. 

The buffet costed Rs 400/- per head including GST. The ambience and the staff are always nice and would look forward to my next visit.

The food was authentic chinese. Went there with a friend to try their lunch buffet. They have different buffet menus everyday. We went on a Friday. It comprised four courses: Sweet Chicken Corn soup; Cheese corn, Tandoori Alu, Chicken Dumplings, Chicken Lollipop; Veg Fried Rice and Noodles; Chicken Manchurian and Mustard Fish; Kiwi Souffle, pastry and different flavours of ice cream. Each item was very good. The staff was courteous and very attentive.

Visited this restaurant yesterday for lunch. The buffet spread does not have a gamut of options, but every item is absolutely exceptional. There were two veg starters, two non veg starters and two kinds of soup. For the main course, we had rice and noodles, chicken  and fish. There were also two vegetarian options.Dessert was brownie, ice cream and an orange souffle.

I really have nothing to nitpick and criticize. The staff is polite and helpful. The food is light and delicious. The ambiance just exemplifies the dining experience to a level of excellence. 

Great place and will definitely visit again!

It is located near to the Deshapriya park. If one goes towards Southern Avenue from Deshapriya park 'The Wall' will be on the left side lane. This lane also has 'The Xrong Place' and 'The Tolly Tales'. You may face problem with parking now-a-days because they doesnt allow parking anywhere near the restaurant. You have to park almost at the end of the lane. It is not a problem of the restaurant but the person from the KMC does not allow so and they don't have a proper reason for that. 
The interior is well designed. They have managed well in a small space. Serene music always plays in the background. The staffs are extremely courteous and helpful. They even once let us have a smoke outside after the startes for few mins. They will guide you with every menu. They have offers of (1 free on 1) on few drinks like old monk, blenders pride, antiquity blue and etc. They also have a special offer on a new drink (I forgot the name but it was whisky) 5  60ml drink at 500. 
Coming to the food we have visited this restaurant 6 times and always opted for weekdays buffet. Here I will review for a monday buffet(11th september 2017) and a wednesday buffet (13th december 2017) and the pictures are only from monday; but the menu gets exchanged and changed so one may or may not get the same items. In any weekday buffet one will get one chicken soup and one veg soup, two veg starter, two non veg starter, Vegetable Hakka Noodles, Egg Fried Rice, two veg side dish, two non veg side dish, Darsan, desert of the day with or without chocolate sauce and one or more ice cream flavours.
11th september 2017 (Monday)
We had Chicken Lung Fung Soup, Deep Fried Corn Curd, Onion Pancake, Chicken Tai Pei, Pepper Wrap Chicken as starters. The soup was clear and mild spicy chicken soup. Deep Fried Corn Curds were square in shape and it was soft and succulent. It was the best among the starters. Onion pancakes were like small traingular patties fried in oil, it was little spicy. The chicken tai pei was spicy ones and Pepper Wrap Chicken was like miniature versions of rolls. One had to remove the papers around it. All the starters tasted really good.
In the main course we had Vegetable Ball Manchurian, Cauliflower Kung Pao, Hupak Chicken and Fish in Chilli Ginger Sauce. I don't like vegetable much but the Vegetable Ball Manchurian was spicy and tasty. The Cauliflower Kung Pao was tangy in taste so I didnt liked it much. Hupak chicken had flat small chicken fillets in light gravy which tasted sweet and sour. The Fish in chilli ginger sauce had stolen the show that day. Soft succulent juicy pieces of fish in light and mid spicy gravy. The fish almost melted in mouth and tasted heavenly.
The desert of the day was chocolate pastry and in ice cream we had only vanilla ones. 
13th December 2017: 
We had Chicken Tom Yum Soup, Fried Vegetables, Fried Tulip Wontons, Chicken cheese balls and chicken lat mai kai as starters. The soup was again light and clear but a bit more spicy but with very little amount of chicken. I mean I could hardly found 2 or 3 pieces of small chicken. I gues they should just increase the amount of chicken in soup. The fried Vegetables were a little bit spicy but were great in tastes. It had cauliflower and few other vegetables. The fried tulip wontons looked great (unfortunately I forgot to click any pictures that day but there are pictures in other reviews) and it was full of mashed vegetables. It tasted average. The Chicken Cheese balls tasted good but it could have been little more soft and cheesy. The chicken lat mai kai was the best amon the starters. It was spicy and tasty. 
Coming to the Main course we had Mafu Tofu, Chilly Vegetables, Hupak chicken and Chilly Fish. The Mafu Tofu was tasty and the pices were juicy. I didnt tasted chilly vegetables. The Hupak chicken was same as before. The Chilli fish again just steals the show. It was again soft and juicy and tasted really awesome.
This time I found brownies in the deserts with chocolate sauce, and 3 flavours of ice cream - vanilla, strawberry and chocolate. Brownies are perfectly hard and perfectly soft, rich in chocolate with almond, cashews and nuts and tasted mind blowing with the chocolate sauce and scoops of vanilla or chocolate ice cream. One cant be satisfied with only one piece of brownie.
Their vegetable noodles are not tasty, they are bland but tastes good with spicy gravy. Instead the egg fried rice tastes good. The darsans are always crispy and perfectly sweet.

Me and my friend went on a weekday for a buffet lunch. First I would like to tell about the ambience. It was superb. The environment was too good. They were playing some background music also, which was great 😊.

Now, I am giving a brief description about the food. Unfortunately I forgot the names. In the starter there was chicken soup. After that, two veg items , two non veg items. All were outstanding. In the main course, there was egg fried rice, veg noodles, chicken and fish. I liked the fish item in the main course. In desert, there was Darsan, Brownie, Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream and Mousse. It costed 375 /- + tax

According to me, it is one of the best Chinese restaurants in kolkata for low cost buffet. The food quality was extraordinary, the staffs were so well behaved and they were very concerned about their customers. I would love to visit there again 😊😊😊.

It was in my bucket list for a while, ultimately had the opportunity to visit it today. I had booked a table before hand through zomato so didn't have any problem getting a place. We opted for their buffet menu which was quite resonable.
The menu goes:-
1) spicy chicken baby corn soup
2) corn cream
3) some item with potato
4) chicken dip sum(basically momo)
5) chicken lollipop
6) hakka noodles
7) egg fried rice
8) spicy cauliflower
9) mixed vegetable
10) chicken manchurian
11) fish in garlic sauce
12) darshan
13) icecream
14) strawberry moose

They served the starters, which were quite tasty though didn't much njy the potato dish, but the rest specially corn cream and chicken lollipop were awesome. In the main course the noodles and rice were as expected, the speciality was the fish, i enjoyed it the most. The chicken was equally good. In the desert section the darshan and ice cream were good but didn't like the strawberry moose(desert of the day), thats the only item i found required a little development.
The one other point is, it would be better if the starters are also available at the buffet table.
The staff were very helpful and cooperative and the ambience is perfect for family and businesses meets.
The buffet is quite pocket friendly for foodies(Rs 394/- in weekdays) and worth a try.

It is located not too far from Deshapriya Park. A good place for hanging out with friends or family. I went to this restaurant with 5 of my friends. We opted for the lunch buffet. Their service was good and so was the food. It would be good to mention that all of us ate to our fullest potentials (sometimes, we were discussing amongst ourselves if we will be asked to stop eating), starting from the starters to the dessert. And per head billing was around 410, which I must say is pretty less considering the amount of food we ate on that afternoon. This place surely brings up a lot of memories. I would like to re-visit it.

I have never reviewed a restaurant as low as I am reviewing this, based on my buffet experience here.
Considering there are so many amazing buffet options coming up in Kolkata, this place really needs to provide better quality food and a more decent spread.
And to imagine I went there to have my birthday lunch, ugh!
They provide:
Soup (I had insisted they take it back untouched because not a fan, but they said they couldn't. And moreover, it wasn't good enough so I don't even remember what it was.)
Two veg starters (potato something, and a sesame bread thing. The potato dish was okayish. The bread sesame fried thing was extremely acidity inducing).
Two non-veg starters (a chicken fry with lime leaves and a chicken basket with coriander. The first one was a little too sour but okayish. The second one was probably the only one of the two good things in their entire spread).
Two staples (veg noodles, egg fried rice. Veg noodles were okayish. The fried rice was plain bland. Absolute disaster, don't know how someone can go wrong with fried rice!)
Two veg sides (don't remember their names, pretty much tasted the same as each other, and not in a nice way).
Two non veg sides (a fish dish, which was the only other good dish, although they use Basa and not Bhetki but that's okay since their price is low. And a chicken dish which was pathetic.)
Dessert (Brownies with ice cream. Dense but crumbly brownie, not the dense spongy kind. Again, cannot imagine how someone can go wrong with brownies. Ice cream was store bought).
I can understand the basa and limited spread because of the low pricing, but at least make the dishes tasty, please!
The ambience was good, staff was courteous, which is just why I gave them 3. Based on the food I'd probably give them 2 because only 2 dishes were good.
Please do more justice to the Zomato rating. Please.

One of the best Chinese buffets in Kolkata, I guess. First time I visited the place I was amazed with their food quality and also with their Buddhist theme decorations. Infact I visited the place once again in the same week.
OK let's come to the menu:
..........Starter........ 
Chicken Manchaw soup/ Veg soup
2 types of chicken starters
2 types of veg starters
............Main Course.......
Noodles
Egg fried rice
Chicken
Fish
Two types of veg side dish

Perfect place for a weekend gateway.Ditch the buffet and go for the ala carte option if craving for some Japanese delight.Nothing special about the buffet though, same as  other Chinese buffets in town.
Must Try: tempura prawns

We opted for the buffet on a Thursday (Diwali). For its price range, the buffet was good. From the buffet spead liked the Lat Mai Kai, Thai green curry and Darsan. So ordering a la carte with these are a good option. Only downside - the staff's behaviour was definitely not up to the mark. May be working on a holiday makes you lethargic and grumpy. Also, Refills for the buffet didn't happen at all for one dish we wanted - was a big disappointment.

Located in one of the lanes off Sarat Bose road, The Wall is one of the best places serving excellent Chinese food in Kolkata. I have had both a la carte as well as buffet from this restaurant. The teriyaki chicken is recommendable as are most pork items from the a la carte menu. Coming to the weekday buffet, I have visited twice. It consists of a non veg soup, two veg and two non veg starters, a veg and a non veg main course, two veg side dishes and two non veg side dishes and darsaan, ice cream and dessert of the day. The starters have always been excellent. Special mention goes to the tulip wantons available on Thursday and lat me Kai and the chicken drumsticks available on Monday. The main course is slight disappointing with Vegetable haka noodles and Egg fried rice being the only options. Perhaps it would be better if one of the main course was spicier such as chilli garlic fried rice. Among the side dishes there is usually one chicken and one fish side dish every day. Whatever be the side dish, the fish is always remarkably tasty. From both a la carte and buffet experience I have to say they really cook fish well. Dessert of the day sort of depends on luck. If there's brownie you're certainly lucky since it's a dark chocolate brownie which is not too sweet and light enough to allow you to indulge in 2nd and 3rd helpings. 
Despite the ambience and food being excellent, my rating of 4.0 is due to the staff behaviour. They are quite frankly snobs. When I visited with family they were extremely courteous but when I went with a group of friends from college ( and we were not a rowdy bunch), they were extremely brusque, not serving the starters properly. Some of us were slightly late than the others and the staff had to be told at least 3 times to repeat the initial starters although no one had started on the main course. I think this discrepancy should be corrected as a matter of professionalism.

Nice decor and everything.
But sorry to say I found it a bit overpriced.
We ordered one rice dish and one side dish. The bill was 1000 or something.
The quantity was hilarious. Very small quantity.
The taste was good. But nothing worth 550 or so.
After waiting for 1 and a half hours we were given a tiny table infront of the kitchen where we had our food with terrible odour coming from the kitchen.

Well we had the most horrible experience at the wall..on 26/10/2017 well the horrible experience was two folds.

1. Firstly we were overcharged for two scoops of ice creams @240 per scoop. As to which when asked the manager replies that the scoop of “Nolan gur” ice cream is same as a the sundae mentioned in the menu. Well in menu it’s 180 bucks for any choice of ice cream scoop. 

2. Well the misery begins next. Two aged ladies seated next to our table were given the toughest of times possible , and alm that they wanted was some food from the kitchen without onion n garlic. How difficult could it have been? But the waiter generously refused to serve them and they had no other options but to vacate the premises.

The manager nor the chef had any courtesy to attend the table. Thus the wall starts to crumble.

Visited JANUARY 2017.Really Impressive with the variety of Items of this place and worth mentioning is the Quality of the food items.

It was My friends Anniversary celebration and Get Together at Lunch was planned.

Not a Big restaurant though but could host around 50-55 pax simultaneously.

Ambience was fantastic.

The Buffet was customised from their regular menu's on the day.

Starters Included :- Veg Spring Roll, Fried fish, Chicken Kababs followed by Veg/Chicken Sweet Corn Soup.

Main Course Started with 3/4 varieties of Salad like Russian Salad,Veg and Chicken-meyonese Salad.Veg Fried Rice with Chicken Hakka Noodles with chicken Hunan Style, Praen yellow curry,Lamb Szechwan Sauce and Fish in Oyester sauce were the main dishes.

Deserts consists of Darshan, Caramel Custard,Chocolate brownie and Ice cream (choice from 5 varieties) were offered.

Lamb and Prawn(though the size of the prawns needs to be looked into) was awesome alongwith the starters.

Food Quality=4.5/5

The ambience is a 5/5. The music, the lights, the aroma in that restaurant is just wonderful. The staff is very congenial and would help you with the menu.

The neatness in the hotel must be more taken care of. Stained napkins and spotted table clothes will render the experience to low despite the niche space The Wall is trying to capture.

For customers expecting a Indian Chinese fusion this place may not appeal. It is strictly Chinese/ Japanese unadultered.

I was very much excited to visit this place as this is one of the few restaurants that offer buffets under 500 inclusive of tax ( 413 on weekdays ).
The ambience was good, the place being well decorated. The staffs were too much polite and generous. 
Coming to the food, we had two non veg and two veg dishes in starters. While the non veg dishes was really enjoyable, the veg dishes were equally disappointing. 
The corn roast was extremely oily and the veg spring roll wasn't good at all.
But the two non veg dishes made that up. ❤
Coming to the main course, we had egg rice and veg noodles, both weren't good. The noodles were better comparatively. 
The fish and the chicken was delicious, the fish being the best. 
Coming to the desert, ice cream nd brownies along with darshans were there. They were good enough. 
Overall, it was good but could have been much better.

Really bad experience during the puja time. We went there on the Ashtami of durga puja with friends and had  wait for a table for 45 min which was quite okay as I Understand the rush during the pujas.
But what really disappointed me was the quality of the food as the fried rice they had served us was burnt and the burning smell was coming but as we were really hungry we had it. During we were hving our dinner nobody came to our table to ask the quality of the food and when we later told them about the burnt fried rice, they instantly put the blame on us that we should have told it much earlier and now anythng cannot be done which made us feel that we were asking for free food which was quite insulting to us.
I ordered a drink MaiTai which tasted like an orange juice rather than a cocktail with rum. No balance in the drink at all and not mixed properly.
I understand the rush during the pujas and the crowd in the restaurants but the service personnel should be trained well to delight each guest they come across in their place because in kolkata durga puja is the only time when u get so many business and they also need to be trained regarding how to talk a guest.
Really bad experience and never would like to visit this place in future.

I visited this place twice. They keep on changing their buffet menus unlike haka. That's why I uploaded pictures of two buffet menus. The food was brilliant. Only the fried rice and noodles lacked taste otherwise the other items present on the menu was good specially the starters.The ambience and the behaviour of the staffs were also good.Buffet is available only for lunch, dinner buffet is not available here.
I would recommend this place to each and every foodie.

A horrible experience. Food was simply disaster so the service. Staffs are extremely confused and it was pretty much clear they are not trained enough to handle puja rush. So the ultimate result is confusion. Even after opting for a-la-carte the staff was pushing us to opt for buffet. In starter we ordered Lat Mai Kai- chicken was too dry and I dont think chicken was fresh one. In main the Lamb item was decent can't say it was good but the veg fried rice was only plain rice with hardly any vegetables. And there was nothing to consider the dish as chinese fried rice. We were a group of 6 people out of that 2 were veg. They ordered one soup, had just one spoon and it was again decent not something appreciable. We ordered coke or thumbs up ( don't remember exactly) but there was no fizz and nothing. Didn't even try out the noodle as I was already pissed of by that time. Pathetic experience after waiting outside for almost 40-45 minutes in such humid evening.

Quite a gem of a place and with awesome varieties of dishes which will surely leave you in awe with this place. The Wall filled the gap of an authentic restaurant serving Oriental & Pan Asian cuisine outside five star ambiances with some extremely classy interior. from interior to decor to subtle and very comforting ambiance, everything is just perfect and so very well worked upon.  Interior is so well crafted, cool and quirky graffiti with proper lighting will make you fall in love with The Wall at the very first sight. This place is located in Southern Avenue,near Telephone Exchange. They always on the move to create innovations in food. Again they are coming with the Innovative menu for Upcoming Durga Puja. I and my fellow foodie friends were invited there over a food tasting session.  They introduced to us various types of delicious foods.

The starters were probably the best part of the buffet! The main course was satisfactory, the dessert being usual but tasty nevertheless. 

The interiors are very aesthetic and the staff quite courteous. All in all, a 4 rating!

One of the worst experiences of chinese cuisine in the City Of Joy which is so renowned for its vast fleet of restaurants.
It was on the Maha Ashtami night when I alongside 4 of my very close friends decided to visit this place and try it out and feed our hungry souls.
We ordered mixed fried rice, pork fried rice, thad pan kai for side dish.
I have to say that every thing was literally so bad in this restaurant, it didnt met our expectation at all because we had heard a lot about this joint.
The rice was not properly cooked , it was burnt out, didnt had any taste at all, and so was the thad pan kai chicken.
The overall experience was such a pain , wont visit the wall ever.

The Wall lives upto its name of being a Boutique Chinese Restaurant. The Pujo Special Buffet had an excellent spread of delicacies that truly gives you that Pan Asian Experience. The best part of the buffet was the quality and flavour of the food. The dishes were simple yet sumptuous enough to make the taste buds dance to its tune. The starters were amazing especially the Szechwan Fish. The main course had an amazing combination of Chicken, Fish, Prawns & Crabs. The chicken and the fish were cooked to perfection. The crab meat had a nice texture. The desserts were delicious as well. The blueberry cheesecake was amazing. Though, the service was a little sloppy towards the end however the same was secondary. One of the most unique and the best buffet i had in recent times !!

Opted for their pujo buffet, this was the most disappointing lunch I've had at a place. The only plus points I've given them are because they provided seating arrangement on a sultry summer afternoon 😅. The noodles were half boiled,and when we complained to the waiter,he simply brushed it off as if we were lying. The main course was average, the brownie hard ,and only vanilla ice cream without even chocolate sauce.
This place is a sore disappointment!

Visit to this place with friends during pujo .A meal in between pandal hopping. We ordered Chinese food.though they also served Thai and Japanese.Our order being on the veg was so so as I have very high standards of vegetarian Chinese food in Kolkata .Our meal consisted of Pimento fried rice,veg spring roll with was very oily,Oriental salt and pepper American corn which had fresly grounded black pepper which was the best I have tasted,then there was pan fried noodles not up to what I have already eaten and same with spicy dragon noodles a different name for chille garlic noodles.Have tasted far better  vegetarian Chinese food.But for the non veg loves you can try because the place was full of people eating it maybe that tastes better.the ambience and the service was indeed good.Rates are reasonable and plz do not hesitate to ask for offer if payed by card as we got a good discount on card payment.Happy eating 🍜

Went for a weekday buffet and the experience was delightful.
The weekday buffet costs 413per person including the taxes.
The starters and soup is served on the table and we loved the starters. The soup was a bit too much gingery but it didn't taste bad. For starters loved the red pepper chicken and the mixed veggies in pepper salt. For the main we had egg fried rice, noodles, some preparation of fish & chicken which I forgot the name of and veggies in green gravy.
The veggies had a distinct coconutty taste which didn't go well with me. Loved the fish. Absolutely amazing quality. The chicken was good too.
For deserts we had darsan and ice cream.it was perfect and couldn't have been better.

The behavior of the staff was great and they even asked us several times about the food. The ambience is perfect and would love to try their a la carte someday.

We went there 2 times, both time for the weekday buffet. One on Monday and another on Thursday. The ambience and hospitality of this place is unquestionable. But I found that there weekday buffet is of an average quality particularly the main course. On both the days 1-2 items of starters were superb and one cannot resist multiple helpings.
In the main course the rice and noodles were generally bland which I found disappointing.
On Monday we got brownie in the dessert section which is my favourite so I didn't mind taking a couple of those. But on Thursday there was a sort of a pie with banana which didn't go well with me.
I would still love to visit this place again to try their ala carte since I have heard a lot about it but please do something about the main course :)

Went for a weekday buffet and the experience was delightful.
The weekday buffet costs 413per person including the taxes.
The starters and soup is served on the table and we loved the starters. The soup was a bit too much gingery but it didn't taste bad. For starters loved the red pepper chicken and the mixed veggies in pepper salt. For the main we had egg fried rice, noodles, some preparation of fish & chicken which I forgot the name of and veggies in green gravy.
The veggies had a distinct coconutty taste which didn't go well with me. Loved the fish. Absolutely amazing quality. The chicken was good too.
For deserts we had darsan and ice cream.it was perfect and couldn't have been better.

The behavior of the staff was great and they even asked us several times about the food. The ambience is perfect and would love to try their a la carte someday.

Went there for lunch buffet...pocket friendly buffet I must say...Ambience & decor was stunning...Love that 2 Buddha statue...Staffs were courteous.

now come to buffet..Starters was so good..1st they served soup, which is normal chicken corn soup but tasted good...There was 2 Veg items- Fried potato & Sesame Toast & 2 Non-veg item- Chicken tulip Wantons & Hunan chicken...sesame Toast & chicken tulip was awesome...perfectly fried.

Main course was also good...there was Egg fried rice, Hakka veg noodles, 2 gravy mix vegetables with baby corn which I love so much...& One fish item which tasted great!! & One chicken item.

Now come to dessert...which disappoint me so much as a chocolate lover! There was 3 item in dessert...darshan, only vanilla icecream...icecream was good but I miss the chocolate sauce! & Brownies which were over baked! After complaining to managing staff they gave us another brownies..which was yummy!

Overall I want to say it was an affordable buffet & good enough!! I gave a long review because as a 1st timer like me some people go to The Wall after checking reviews & according to my point of view this restaurant is slightly overrated!

If you love Sushi then The Wall is The place for you. This is not the first time I have been to this place & every time I am impressed with their hospitality. A unit of the Savourites, The Wall opened in 2007. They have maintained their standard ever since. The ambience is amazing. The staff is always ready to help you choose & you do not need a deep pocket to eat there.
What more could a girl ask for!

We went for the buffet on Friday afternoon. The place is easily accessible with a soothing decor and enthusiastic and courteous staff. Coming to the food part; Starters were good especially the chicken tulip that was on the buffet menu that day. Main course was average. Nothing spectacular. But the fish cooked in some Pan Asian sauce was good. Desserts included darshan, vanilla ice-cream and some chocolate mousse which being the "dessert of the day" was very average. Buffet price is reasonable. So trying it sometime will not be a bad option. 

p. s. - including more flavours in the ice-cream section would be highly appreciable.

We went for the Buffet. It was standard. The starters were amazing, specially the chicken tai  pei..even the deep fried corn curd was delicious
The soup was great too
The main course was average, tending to good. The hakka noodles, though veg, was cooked great, the fried rice lacked seasoning, the hupak chicken and fish in chilli ginger sauce was above average
 Dessert was standard, ice cream, darshan and choc pastry. 
Considering the price of the buffet, it was pretty good! :)
413-with tax

I have definitely given a high rating to the Wall because of its interior and work culture! A very sophesticated restaurant serving very good chinese and asian buffet. Not only buffet, their A la carte options are also quite good. Well, first coming to the interior, a very well decorated and clean eatery that gives excellent service to the customers. I was highly satisfied with the way they welcomed and served us. The weekday buffet is not bad. They give very good buffet  menu options only in 350Rs per person. The starters, main course and desserts were all worth the price. Food quality is good. I quite liked the ambience and would definitely wish to visit this place over and again. Higly recommendable!

Visited the place on last Wednesday. We reached around 12:50pm and we were told that almost all the tables are booked except one and they are not willing to allow us even(they literally mentioned that). Anyways,we got a seat. We had to wait for approximately 25 mins to get the soup. 
To be honest,the staff were inadequate and extremely horrible. We had to wait for 15 mins for the next item and if you want something,you'll never get. I remember asking them for chicken cheese balls for 4times which they never served. We all were furious. I mean how you treat your customers? No ethics? They skipped one item they showed in the menu,but who cares what we want? They were running from here to there but no one was actually listening to us. 
Coming to the food,the starters were tasty but they were serving us very little quantity and if you ask again,they ignored.! I guess they don't understand the meaning of buffet! 
The main course was very limited. Just one noodle,egg fried rice,chicken in garlic sause and a fish item. That's it! 
Only the fish was tasty. The chicken was horrible. And moreover the way they delayed in bringing the starters,our appetite was gone. 
There was actually nothing in the dessert section. Just a brownie and vanilla ice cream. The brownie was hard and had lumps. 
I went to the place after seeing the zomato ratings I don't know how they scored so well. I felt horrible there. I will absolutely not suggest anyone to go there because it's like insulting yourself even you pay money. I would definitely want a proper justification for how they treated us and the other customers!

Located opposite to tolly tales and beside xrong place, the wall is easily accesible. Went there for the weekday buffet which comprises of a soup five starters four main course dishes and three deserts to cap it off. Tastewise everything was good enough except the egg fried fish which was bland. The fish in the main course was the best of the lot. Dessert of the day though keeps changing. Chocolate mousse got finished by the time we reached the dessert section and was replaced by brownie which was a bit of disappointment. Staffs r courteous and hospitality is top notch. The buffet cost 413 including gst.

Went there with my squad to try out their weekday lunch buffet! Located just opposite to Tolly tales and beside Xrong place this place was easy to locate. The interior is nice and the music was good (tribal) Now coming to food there were around 12 dishes including starter, main course and dessert. The fish was good. There were two demerits though. The first one is, the fried rice that was in the main course tasted bland and was not at all up to the mark and the second was by the time we reached the desert section the desert of the day- 'Mousse' was exhausted and we were served with brownie! The exhaustion of the the mousse was really disappointing and didn't ever expect such an incident to happen at such a good place where they serve you buffet! Other than that the hospitality and the ambiance was good. The workers were all really courteous and polite.

After reading all good reviews me and my friend went there.first of all the ambience is pretty good.we tried the weekly buffet worth 350 with taxes.i went there with a lot of expectation but I am really disappointed.there were more veg items than nonveg.
Starting with a soup was ok.it tasted good.then comes chicken cheese ball in the place of red paper chicken.that was overall ok.momos were soft.spinach and cheese roll was also good.the fried veggies were very ordinary with lots of chopped garlic.then comes the horrible main course.the noodles was not hot at all and tasted very ordinary.the egg rice was ok.the vegetable in hot garlic sauce was ok but the cauliflowers were raw.chicken tangra style was disgusting.in fish latchu there was hardly any fish except coating.the worst dish of the day was vegetables in green curry.there was only 3 items in desert.darsan was ok.brownie was good.only one type of icecream of vanilla flavour was there.overall it was not worth the money.i am really very disappointed.they need a improvement in their main course.

One of my favourite chinese spots in kolkata. It doesn't look much from outside, but inside it is a different affair and the food is worth your money. 

The food is flavourful.

Since I mostly start off with a bowl of piping hot soup, the crab meat sweet corn soup was pretty good.

Their Torini Teriyaki is a favourite. The sauce is really nice and sticky. It is sweet, so those of you who do not like the idea of chicken to go with a sweet sauce should stay away from it. But those who like dishes like chicken in plum sauce and many of the like will enjoy this dish. The sweetness is not sugary so if you pair it off with some rice or noodles the sweetness will not be overpowering. Do not have it just by itself though ! 

Their golden fried prawns are lovely too. The coating is nice and thin. Not at all clunky stuff which takes away the charm of beautiful large golden fried prawns. 

My overall experience with them has been great. Both their service and food are commendable. Perfect fpr going for a nice family dinner. They also have a buffet so you can check that as well.

The delivery took 2.5 hours and the pad Thai was the worst interpretation I have every had. The pad Thai is just spicy (its supossed to be sweet and tangy) and was made using Chinese condiments and there was nothing Thai about it. The noodles were raw. Never order here this place is a sham.  

To the management : Learn how to cook and give proper service before opening up a restaurant.

The ambience is likeable, with soothing chinese instrumental music playing in the background. The food quality is good, but a bit overpriced. The staff did their job of taking orders and serving and nothing more. Maybe a bit more of warmth would help win and retain more customers.
Most importantly, they should refrain from raising questions on the customer's review. The impudence sort of ruined the whole experience. 😡😔

An authentic pan asian restaurant in Dr. Sarat Banerjee Road, next to Xrong Place and opposite Tolly Tales. I have been there with my family and had a wonderful gourmet delight. For starters we had sui mai prawn, chicken oriental pepper salt and crispy fried fish in spicy chinese parsley sauce. For main course we had Chinese Fried Rice, Pan fried noodles, That Pan Kai Chicken anf Sliced Chicken with Pak Choy. We ended our palatable journey with chocolate cigar roll and chinese jasmine tea. The hospitality is really commendable. Try it to experience for yourself. 😊🖐🏻

The Wall is located opposite to Tolly Tales. We opted for the weekday buffet lunch. They have set buffet menu for different days of the week. The buffet menu for Thursday comprised of : 
1. Chicken manchow soup
2. Stir fried vegetables
3. Spinach cheese spring rolls
4. Red pepper chicken
5. Chicken dimsum
6. Veg hakka noodles
7. Egg fried rice
8. Chilli chicken tangra style
9. Fish latchu
10. Darsaan
11. Vanilla ice cream
12. Dessert of the day

The starters were pretty good especially the red pepper chicken. In the main course I liked the fish latchu. The dessert options were limited though. The darsaan was good. 

The staff was very courteous. Excellent behaviour on their part. Very helping and well mannered. 

Would love to visit again.

The main course consisted for a Chicken and a fish item both were awesome. Only the desert section is where they can improve on. The darasan and the desert of the day were good but adding a few more sauces and few more flavours of Ice cream would be wonderful.

We went for weekday buffet lunch which was damn cheap at Rs.413 ( per person ) inclusive of taxes.
But honestly speaking, apart from a couple of starters, the buffet spread was pretty average. I would prefer paying a little more and have a better chinese buffet than this. The main course was absolutely bland and everything tasted the same. I am sure that their ala carte preparations are much much better than the buffet menu. If I had to rate this restaurant just on the basis of taste , i would rate it hardly 2. But a point extra for their extremely courteous staff and management. I am not reviewing each and every dish in the buffet as already there are many such reviews; but yes if you are a fan of bland chinese you might like it otherwise stay away from the buffet and stick to ala carte.

P.S. one awesome feature of this restaurant is that they serve 1:1 drinks all day long from 12.30pm to 10.30 pm and at a very reasonable rate. So thats a bonus.

The Wall is a nice little place situated in Southern Avenue in a calm and beautiful neighborhood. Walk in here alone or with your pals and you will be delightfully taken aback by the decor and the quality of food.

We visited this place on a rainy Saturday afternoon and we tried their buffet. The starters were pretty decent and the service prompt. What's worth mentioning is the fact that their main courses are really good and they were cooked to perfection..

The soothing ambience, the calm oriental music really cooks up a nice ambience. Do drop in at the Wall if you have a craving for a nice oriental buffet..

Everything about this place impressed me from the moment I reached there.

Being located at such a fantastic area, this place serves one of the best Chinese and Thai combo food.
We went on a Saturday and opted for the buffet lunch.
The fish and the chicken in the starters were magnificent. The main course was equally good and the chicken and lamb portion was finger licking good.
The desserts were limited and kind of okay.

The staffs were so courteous and so attentive. Interior decor was superb as well.

Overall a very nice place to have decent food with friends and family.
Highly recommended!!

The daily buffet - a good chicken sweet corn soup, pepped up with some red chillies was a much welcome deviation from the otherwise bland affair associated with sweet corn soups; starters included chicken cheese balls - deserves a definite second helpling, the other chicken item and two veg items - all fried (including the balls) barely score a pass mark. Avoided the veg hakka noodles (wonder what that means!!!); an average egg fried rice (rice was of excellent quality though), an average chilli fish were the other two items on offer along with chicken with capsicum - easily the star of the menu. Darsan, ice-cream and a strawberry souffle were the desserts on offer. A good value for money at Rs. 413 per person all inclusive.

'The Wall' is a sophisticated fine dining restaurant known for its Pan Asian delicacies. Starting from the music,interiors, cutlery everything is so suited according to the theme. 
Regarding the items which one should try without a miss is Steam boat. Won't mention much about it except the fact that this dish literally compels me to visit this place time and again. 
Regarding soup- one must either go for Tom yum or Lung fang soup. Lung fang soup is a thick soup with Chinese veggies and majorly shiitake mushroom finely chopped with ginger adding to the flavour.
Haka noodles is average. Had ordered crispy chilli potato which didn't really go with the noodles and was nothing special.

Probably the second restaurant in my life which I'm giving a 5. And rightfully so. This restaurant was in my area for the last 10 years and I had no clue about it. Thankfully Zomato introduced me to The Wall. For the money you are paying for the buffet, you get mouthwatering food along with an exceptional ambience. The fish that they serve during the buffet is beyond comparison. Their hospitality is comparable to the best of restaurants. All in all, I couldn't find a single place where I could've criticized them. They deserve all the plaudits for giving us an experience to savour. A must visit for people looking for sumptuous food at an astonishing price.

We were quite late for the buffet. But better be late than never. The buffet was exquisite and every item was good from clear soups to darshan.
I hound the Hunan chicken a bit dry but still everything was good. The fish was delicious.
₹413 including all taxes.

Simplicity meets quality at this restaurant .
I had gone to give a birthday treat here  and I was a little sceptical about the budget .But I have to accept that the buffet is absolutely worth it ! There were 3-4 kinds of mouth watering starters followed by the main course which consisted of both noodles and rice dishes along with veg and non veg side dishes.
Venue - Situated on the same lane as Xrong place in Deshapriya park this place has a very pretty decoration with the statue of Buddha adding to it's Serene ambience.

Ambience- There are three Chambers making it a pretty spacious place and the a very soothing music in the background.

Quality and Quantity of the food are good and well satisfying.

Services- Prompt servicing and good behavior of waiters .

Pocket pinch (Lastly but not the least )- The place is moderately priced .I will really suggest you to try the Buffet as it is very affordable and good ! 
You must visit this place at least once .
Good place to go on a lunch with friends or family or even a date !

The only glitch was the sweet dish that I was very disappointed with and hence my rating .

The Wall is one of the best places to visit for Chinese Cuisine. Once inside you will feel at home. The subtle taste of the food...the delicately prepared dimsums and fish in Black bean sauce is light on the palate but tasty. You should not miss the Hazelnut sundae if you have a sweet tooth.

After eyeing this place since a long time we could finally visit it on a Wednesday for their weekday lunch buffet!

There was a non veg soup, 3 veg starters,2 non veg starters. For main course there were 2 veg and 2 non veg sides. A vegetarian noodle dish and another non veg rice dish followed by 3 desserts. Following is the detailed description of each item -

1) 🍎Chicken sweet corn soup(2.5/5)- it was a clear soup having sufficient corn and hardly any chicken, which was absolutely tasteless! We added a lot of pepper in order to add some spice. After adding Soya sauce I felt it tasted a lot better.

2)🍏 Fried baby corn(4/5)- an amazing starter! They were crisp and flavourful- were very different from the usual crispy chilly babycorn- yet very tasty! Impressive!

3)🍏 Fried tulip wantons(4/5)- this starter is beautiful to just look at! It has a crispy tulip shaped outer cover with fried wantons as its filling! Good dish!

4)🍏 Fried vegetables (3.5/5)- cauliflower and a few other vegetables fried- these too were crispy and tasty!

5)🍎 Chicken Cheese Balls (4.5/5)- the best starter of the day! Piping hot Chicken balls with an inner core of molten cheese! This was the only spicy starter- even though the spice quotient wasn't very high!Highly recommended!

6) 🍎 Chicken Lat Me Kai (4/5)- small pieces of fried chicken with a flavourful covering had a unique taste! A great starter!

We also ordered mocktails that weren't a part of the lunch buffet and had to be ordered separately-
♦ Mint memories(3.5/5)- as the name suggests it's a minty drink- that has a heavy texture! In The first sip it tasted medicine like- but from the second sip onwards it tasted good! A perfect drink for the mint lovers.

♦ Fruit overload(2.5/5)- I disliked this drink- as it was very syrupy and medicine like to me- but my friends seem to have liked it a lot! So I guess people who like syrupy drinks can give this a try!

Coming back to the buffet, the main course comprised of the following-
1)🍏 Veg Hakka noodles (4.5/5)- a really well made dish to the extent it overshadowed many non veg dishes with its flavours! Highly recommended!

2)🍎 egg fried rice (3/5)- it was a very average dish...for the first time I preferred a noodle based main course more to a rice dish!

3)🍏 mafu tofu (4/5)- it had a thick slippery gravy with vegetables and tofu! All in all an extremely flavourful dish!

4) 🍏 chilly vegetable (2.5/5)- I didn't quite like the taste of the gravy!

5) a chicken side the name of which I forgot! It was one of the best dishes of the day! There were thin boneless pieces of chicken in white gravy- which complimented the veg hakka noodles really well!perfect for those who don't prefer spicy dishes!

6)🍎 chilly fish(4.5/5)- an amazing dish indeed! The spicy gravy and the juicy fish tastes amazing! This dish was so popular with the crowd that even after making frequent visits to the serving table, all I could see was an empty bowl! A kind friend of mine agreed to share his portion of chilly fish with me- and so I could taste it! Management should look into refilling the dishes as soon as it gets exhausted!

For desserts there was-
1)vanilla icecream(4/5)- just the regular metro vanilla icecream!

2) darsaans (5/5)- darsaan with vanilla icecream has always been my favourite! Their darsaan were great! Crispy, sweet to the right extent and tasty! Do give this pair a try!

3) dessert of the day(2/5)- this space keeps altering! While we were feasting on the main course vanilla soufflé was the dessert of the day! By the time we finished off with the main course to start with the dessert- the vanilla soufflé was replaced with brownie! The brownie was hard and after having darsaans it so didn't suit the tag of "dessert of the day"!
We spoke to the manager as we had booked a table on the previous day and so were disappointed on not being able to taste the vanilla soufflé!

Chocolate sundae(5/5)- this was the complementary dessert that we received! This dessert was from the A LA Carte menu and was an extremely sweet gesture from the management! The dessert was superb! It had chocolate icecream topped with choco chips , caramel bits,chocolate sauce ,and chocolate roll sticks! The dessert was sweet enough to drive away all our complaints! Brownie points (+0.5) for the initiative the management took to make us happy!

All in all an amazing lunch buffet to try within a budget! Recommended!

This place had been in our wishlist since a long time until recently we ticked it off. This place is located in the alley just opposite to the Barista Lavazza adjacent to Marco Polo near Deshapriya Park. We had opted for the weekday buffet and it was truly a great experience. The decor is good and the ambience along with the soft music will give you a very positive vibe. We had selected the non-veg buffet and following are the items which were being served to us:



Starters: 

Non-veg Soup(3/5): It was too bland for our liking. Had to sprinkle a lot of pepper and salt on it so as to make it a little better. The blandness proves the authenticity of the dish as actual Chinese dishes are indeed a little bland. We, being used to having Indian version of Chinese food, have different expectations from Chinese dishes. Nevertheless, it was a wholesome soup.



Chicken Cheese Balls(4.5/5): These were extremely tasty. The balls were soft and had a cheese core which enhanced the taste by a huge margin.



Fried Baby Corn(4/5): Soft and juicy. Slightly spicy which complements it well.



Fried Veggies(3.5/5): These were good too. The veggies mostly comprised of cauliflower.



Veg Rose Wantons(4/5): As the name suggests, the wantons had a rose shape. It was crispy and slightly spicy. It tasted good.



Chicken Lat Me Kai(4.5/5): This was another great dish they had served on that day. Deftly prepared with very soft and succulent chicken pieces.



Main Course:


Veg Hakka Noodles(4/5): The noodles they had was extremely tasty. Perfect blend of spice was the u.s.p. of this preparation.



Mafu Tofu(4/5): This preparation was good. It was slightly spicy and complemented the noodles really well.



Chilli Vegetables (3.5/5): This preparation was so-so. It did not impress me much. However, the gravy was delicious. The veggies somehow seemed to be tasteless.



Chilli Chicken in Tangra Style(4/5): The gravy was very tasty with average-sized chicken pieces. It best complemented the Veg Hakka Noodles. It wasn't spicy at all, but the taste was something I loved.




Egg Fried Rice(3.5/5): This is one of the most commonly made Chinese dishes, but the one we were served was definitely not up to the mark. It seemed a bit too dry. The Veg Hakka Noodles was far better.




Chilli Fish(4.5/5): This was probably the spiciest dish amongst all the buffet items of that day. This gravy was perfect and so were the fish pieces. They were very soft and juicy. The Fried Rice being not so good, this item was a saviour as it tasted good with the rice.



Desserts:



Darsaan(4.5/5): Very crispy and juicy. Perfectly made darsaans. Tasted heavenly with the Vanilla Ice-cream.



Vanilla Ice-cream (3.5/5): Just the regular vanilla ice-cream. Nothing very special about it.



Dessert of the day: A Vanilla Souffle or a Chocolate Brownie(what you get depends on the availability at that time)
Chocolate Brownie (2.5/5): We were unfortunate that by the time we decided to try the dessert items, the Vanilla Souffle went out of stock. This might sound strange but this is what happens in the dessert section. This is the daily incident for the weekday buffet I guess. Hence, we had to settle for the Chocolate Brownie which was one of the worst Brownies I have ever had. On complaining about this to the manager, we were being served a Chocolate Sundae which is a part of the a la carte menu.



Mocktails:(**not a part of buffet, hence you have to order it separately**)



Fruit Overload (3.5/5): This drink was too syrupy and had a medicine like aftertaste. Nevertheless, it was refreshing.



Mint Memories (3.5/5): This drink was slightly better than the drink mentioned above. This too was syrupy but the medicine like aftertaste wasn't there for this drink.




Chocolate Sundae(4.5/5): This was a complementary dessert offered to us on the manager's recommendation. We felt deprived when we were told that the Vanilla Souffle won't be available anymore. We had to settle for the Chocolate Brownie which was really poor and couldn't be the Dessert of the Day by any means. We sincerely appreciate the gesture of the manager. This dessert was one of a kind. Probably the best sundae I have ever had. The caramel bits with the chocolate chips and chocolate sauce made the item extremely delicious.




All in all, a very nice place. The interiors are classy and so is the ambience. The weekday buffet is really cheap and the spread also is a little less. However, the best part is that, almost all the items they serve are top-notch and this is what would ensure that you have a good meal. The spread being less won't be very evident when you have the food. The dessert part is something you should be aware of as the Dessert of the Day gets out of stock very quickly and you would then have to be happy with a consolation dessert (like the Chocolate Brownie in our case). This is certainly not desirable. Hence, whenever you see that the Dessert of the Day has been made available, get a few your yourself and have it after your main course is over. Otherwise, you might be deprived of it. A must-visit place for every foodie. I would love to visit this place again for trying out their Pan-Asian buffet which is served on weekends.

Location is so easy to meet. Decoration is nice. 
Bar plus restaurant.
I tried weekday  buffet...it is 350 plus tax.
On the Menu: 
Soup and starters will be served on the table.. maincourse  selfservice.

1. Chicken manchow soup - 4.5/5 type taste 
2. 4 types of starter 2 veg and 2 non veg:
      Fried vegetables -it was very nice..
      Cheese spinach roll - average.. spinach flavour          was overbursting 
       Chicken dimsum- or momo... trust me it was so soft and tasty.
       A chicken starter- forgot the name , was spicy, boneless small pieces.. was nice.
3. 2 veg mains and 2 non veg mains :
      Chilli vegetables- not so good
       Chilli chicken in tangra style -gravy was very good.. chicken pieces were small.. 
      Fish latchu- soft soft fish.. 3/5 rating type.
AND

Veg noodles 
4. Darshan
5. Desert of the day- a cake or brownie with walnut

THE END OF MENU..!
Some cons:
No chocolate sauce.. only one type of ice cream.
Very limited main course. Desert menu too sort.!

Went on a weekday buffet meal.350 plus taxes...(422 per head).it was good..for soup of the day non veh they served the manchow soup ..the soup was good but it was little cold.soup should always be served piping hot.they did not even serve fried noodles with it.next were the salt and pepper vegetables which included fried vegies like babycorn..potato.deep fried in tempura and seadoned with salt and pepper..it was not that good
.next up was the veg cheese and spinach roll.it was nice..the red pepper chicken was sweet and spicy..it was good...the dimsums was the only started served piping hot and steamed to perfection...the maincourse had very limited options..i dont much prefer egg fried rice so they served veg for us straight from the kitchen..which was great to taste...the tangra style chilli chicken was too sweetish and had almost no chilli.the fish was sweet and sour and cooked well...the veg thai curry was nyc..the color was too light..it also had less cocunut and gravy portion..not too authentic..veg hakka was nice..hot and sour veg was cooked well...the desert had some brownie which was soft but very dry...and they had vanila icecream and darsaan..more variety is definately reccomemded..the food was overall satisfying..but should be served more hot.and they should offer some drink with thr buffet..otherwise from the price point of view ..good   ....and service and staff courtsey is very good no doubt about it....

A wonderful place with nice decor ! Staffs are cooperative and service was very good!  Buffet is pocket friendly ! Starters and the deserts were nice but not the main course!  This needs some variety and improvement.  If are thinking for giving your friends a grand treat in pocket friendly price obviously go for it 👍

Had our hopes high after reading the Zomato reviews but turned out to be quite a disappointment. We had Drums of heaven for starters which was ok taste-wise but too less in quantity. For quenching our thirst we had ordered kiwi lemonade, flaming sun and beer which too was average. The real let down was the main course- Singapore rice noodles and bhetki fry in Thai sweet chilli sauce. Both the dishes had an awkward smell and I doubt very much the quality of the fish. It tasted nothing like bhetki and eventually led to acidity and stomach ache.
The staff were friendly but we had to call them multiple times before they took our order or brought the cheque, so much so that we ran out of patience to have dessert. Not an experience that I'd want to repeat especially because the neighborhood offers a rich choice of great places to eat in.

Situated in the southern Avenue ,it is a bit cheaper than than its competitors.has good ambience and service.i have tried the buffet there. it was great I must say for the price point.the starters(chicken cheese balls,chicken lat mei kai.,veg tulip chicken sweet corn soup etc) were very good and there was a variety of new items.the main course(nveg hakka noodles ,egg fried rice, chilly fish ,chicken coriender.,) was kind of bland.the deserts were nice(vanilla ice cream, darsan, brownie.-was hard and there was no chocolate sauce.)it had a bar.with happy hours. Too....yeah ;) .(must try the buffet @421 weekdays)

The ambience is pretty decent. Service on the better side. Where they lack is in the quality of the food on offer. We went for a Sunday lunch buffet. It's supposed to be the best buffet a place can offer. Their best was just not good enough. 
Buffet doesn't include a welcome drink. Big let down. Non veg soup was appetizing. Except for the stir fried fish rest of the starters were nothing better than decent. When you have a limited starter menu hit it with your best shot. Missed opportunity again. 
Main course had nice spread of dishes covering a lot of proteins. The prawns were quite good. Lamb was juicy enough. Hunan chicken didn't impress. Best of the lot? The stir fried veggies. Salads were a joke though. 
Desserts are supposed to be the king of a buffet. Not here. Speaks volumes when the best thing on offer is the vanilla ice cream. Went well with the darshan though a flavored syrup was missing imo.
They also need to work on the seating. Atleast the table we were seated wasn't made for a buffet. Everytime something was served the guy seating inside had to reach out with his plate.

All I can say.
Any Lazy day at home, any occasions or any other normal day.
Wall is my family's first choice.
From Tom Kha,Tom Yum & Laksa. Torrino Terriyaki, Katsu, Fried fish in pepper sauce, drums of heaven. Burnt Garlic fried rice, Sashimi platter, Ten vegetable pan fried, Babi Kepap, Japanese mild spicy chicken, fish in ginger sauce.
All of these are worth trying.

As this year is my internship year, I would be visting a hell lot of resturaunts and so decided to give authentic reviews in Zomato. Lets start off with The Wall, currently the cheapest buffet in Kolkata.

Food: Considering the price it was awesome. But my friend thought the fish was little smelly. I really enjoyed the meal. Just a suggestion in veg starters something made of corn would be a good option. And in chowmein proper chowmein instead of spaghetti would have been better.

Ambience: Top class ambience. Full marks on this.

Service: This is the reason I deducted half marks. It was not upto mark. They are not as professional as expected to be. I had to ask for the starters time and time again. 

Anyways a great place to hang out when you want to satisfy your tummy without affecting your bank balance too much.

Lips making Chinese food on the offing. This is one of the places that serve south-east Asian cuisine in Kolkata. So one can get a mix of dishes from Japanese, Thai, Indonesian, seafood and standard Chinese food.

 Decoration is nice and well maintained lovely place . The interiors are well decorated with Chinese themed paintings and warm lighting . The soft Thai genre music adds to the wonderful ambience.

The wall has come up with a special Jamai Sasthi menu to celebrate the love and bonding between a mother-in-law and their son-in-law. The delicious menu to pamper your son-in-law will be available from 30th may to 4th June at The Wall restaurant’s outlets at Sarat Bose Road , Southern Avenue , Kolkata.

We Panchphoron group were invited on a food tasting event.

Growing up, everyone gets scattered here and there. After puja'16 , 28th may was the date i was going to meet my school friends again. After going through a few places, we (6 of us) finally decided on this place.


The Wall..!!
We had booked our table a week in advance but with the amount of seating arrangement, i don't think it would have been a prob even if we had not! The ambience is every nice and they play soft tunes which is very soothing.

The starters were served at the table and they were delicious! Even the chicken soup! I'm not a soup person but trust me, it was way too good to miss.

The main course was decent with the best part being the Turmeric prawn preparation! Never had that before and it tasted quite good! Come to think of it, all their fish preparations were very very good!

For dessert they served choco pastry, orange mousse, darshan with vanilla ice cream (best one) and a soft sweet which tasted decent.

Overall the place is worth it considering what they charge for the buffet!

While going through Zomato for a place to have Chinese, stumbled upon the Wall. The menu was very inviting and also had some superb reviews from the fellow foodies. So went for Sunday lunch. Initially thought of ala-carte but with the buffet having so much to offer, couldn't resist.
Decor was pretty nice with dim lights and oriental music playing in the background and comfortable sofa seats.
Coming to the food, started with Non veg Manchow soup but they did not serve it with the fried noodles which is my favourite part. It was a little disappointing though the soup tasted pretty good. Next were the starters starting with Corn cakes, baked sweet corns with bread and cheese. For non veg they served Schezuan fish, Manchurian chicken and lemon basil fried chicken. All the three were really tasty and none could be ignored.
For main course they had a lot to offer but stuffed with the starters hardly had much space left to fill in. Two types of salad, veg and non veg, veg chow and egg rice, stir fried vegetables, green chicken curry, thai chicken curry with coconut, fish in oyster sauce, prawn with veggies in white sauce and lamb curry. I liked the Prawn a lot, fish and lamb was also good.@ The thai curry had too much coconut for my liking.
But for bongs, no meal is complete without the sweet ending. Desserts were few, Darshan with icecream, brownies, butterscotch cake and a coconut cake. So all this for 700bucks was pretty cheap but quality wise it was top class. Will definitely go again to try the ala- carte menu.

Very elegant ambience coupled with Asian fine dining makes this a personal favourite. I tried the Chahan which was a Japanese styled fried rice, slightly sticky and wonderfully fragrant. The Crispy Fried Fish in Spicy Chinese Parsley Sauce was a unique dish with very strong flavours and very well cooked fish that was just the right amount of crispy. Finally the Japanese Mild Spicy Chicken with Sirachi Chilli Sauce complemented the rice very well.

Coming straight way to the business, if you want to have a japanese and chinese mixture then you should definitely drop by this place. A japanese delight along with a chinese topping is really awesome.
I have ordered chilli pork as starters and lamb in massaman sauce and egg wrapped fried rice as main course.

The most charming thing that I have found out is Chinese music. It was just too good to set up the tempo for the rest of the evening. So I would recommend everyone to put this in their list. I will definitely drop by this place in coming days and have some sushi over there. Till then sayonara.. 😊😊

Do you love the concept of Buffet? The Wall would satisfy the buffet need providing with some delicious starters along with the mouth-watering main course dishes. Desserts don't go out of the list too. The usual buffet timgs are 12.30PM to 3.30PM in the afternoon and 7PM to 10.45PM in the evening. Besides an attractive buffet menu one can even try out their popular Pan-Asian delicacies. The mindblowing decorations inside make it more enliven. Thus,The Wall would provide a voracious eater with some excellent dishes at a decent price.

This outlet is located in sarat banerjee road, diagonally opposite to tolly tales ( devd restaurant). I have tried food from here twice and both the time it wasnt good enough. The staffs are not as attentive as they should be when you take buffet. The hotel has a policy of serving starters and soup on the table for the buffet but even then you have to ask them again and again to serve you. The food taste wise is okayish but quality wise I wasnt sure about todays fish item. Taste is just like haka. Alacarte service would be better I guess. Otherwise its okay.

My first visit to this place and it is extremely satisfactory. The starters have an item called diced chicken which is finger licking good. The other appetizer was prawn cheese ball which is one of the most unique items I had. In the main course we took 10vegetable noodles, lamb (which was made as per my taste), and That Kai Chicken which was cooked to perfection. We ended the dinner on a sweet note with darshan served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The  dining experience​ was accompanied with courteous behaviour from the staffs. :) 
Thank you.

Chilli basil prawns were the best with big prawns in delicious sauce with cashewnuts adding the bite. Then Mixed hakka noodles and Schezwan Chilli Chicken were good enough. The noodles were filled with all kind of veggies and meats. Highly recommended.

Went there to have lunch buffet. Combed through reviews in Zomato and seemed a good option to try out. However, was massively disappointed. The starters were decent, but the rest of the buffet was a big let down. Not much option to choose from and the dishes were not upto the mark. Especially the prawn dish: too much sweetness and too much coconut milk killed it. It basically tasted and smelled like dairy product, did not get proper taste of the prawn. Only veg noodles and fried rice to choose from. Accompaniments were also not good. Dessert section was limited as well. The ice cream was almost melting.
The service was excellent to be fair. Timely and courteous. However, people go to a restaurant for the food and if that's not upto the mark, good service alone cannot uplift customer experience. The bill for 2 persons is roughly 1500/- and we expected better quality and variety. Unless they improve on these, will not recommend this place to anyone.

The Wall is very well decorated with Buddha statues all over the place. Eye pleasing ambience, warm light, play Japanese music in the background which perfect suits the ambience. Food was very good and absolutely delicious. One of the best Japanese food one can get here in the town and they know their job well and can guide you according to your choice. Staffs were well mannered and services was prompt.
Overall the place is good if you want to try authentic Japanese and Chinese food. Would surely love to

Well a Big one ticked off from my list on the day of Bengali new year.we went there to celebrate 2 occasion.one was my 20 years(2 Decades) of friendship with my school friends & the other was Poila boishak.I had booked the table for 3 two days before through Zomato itself.But there was a let down from Zomato,which is they didn't mentioned about any Discount I was elligible to, although I was.Anyways Coming to the ambience We are greeted by a statute of lord Buddha, getting Inside first thing we would notice is the Buffet area with some designed cloches,also a sleeping buddha near the window.the place is decoreted with red shandeliers giving a touch of that Asian feel,also the background Japanese music was an add on.So a huge 4 out of 5.We had planned for their steam boat and the non veg Sushi boat,but the manager informed us we won't be getting the discount of 15% on the steam boat.still we opted the same.The concept of the Steam boat is simple you get all the ingredients.we only choose the soup between Tom yum or Chinese clear soup.Its a live Preparation in front of the customer.So coming to the food.They provided us with kimchi salad & fresh cured salads.The Sushi boat consisted of 11 pieces of sushi.4 veg 6 non veg.2 of each salmon,prawn,crabstick.they were accompanied by pickled ginger and a green paste ball wich was very pungent like mustard.each of them were really yummy.next we had the steam boat ready by the time they had a arrey of ingredients to go into the soup starting from baby corn, mushrooms,to lamb,chicken,pork.It was a big thumbs up.we also had fresh lime.in dessert we had Hazel nut sunday & star anise apple pie with vanilla ice cream.yet again the pie was a hit with loads of raisins and nuts.So a 5 out of 5.Service was also prompt with friendly suggestions.so a 4 out of 5.Bit high on the price but it's a must try.Hope to visit soon.

If you are an ardent fan of chinese food, then "The Wall" should definitely belong to your bucket list. From starters, to main course and then desserts as well as the mocktails, each and everyone of them are incomparable. The lat mai kai is one heavenly starter with perfect crunchy to chewy ratio. Prawns, crabs and fish main courses are more preferable than chicken ones. You should definitely try their fried ice cream for desserts and I guarantee you will fall in love with it. 
P.s. Ala carte section is far better than the buffet.

Location - If you are coming from deshapriya park...You need to take Sarat Bose road and need to take the lane for shwarma nation/xrong place(Sarat Chatterjee road).. and if you are coming from golpark side ,take a right turn from lake stadium,walk a bit and you will find the wall  in the next lane of go Lebanese. 
Ambiance - The wall is very well decorated with Buddha statues all over the place. But I did not liked the music collection as instrumental  and Soft music goes contradictory with a place where full bar is available but again the statues of Buddha and the music goes side by side ;so it depends on your preference.. The bar counter is magnificent to be mentioned.. You will find a great variety in the bar specially in single malts!   Tall chairs are available here.
Food ordered- Started with drinks and starters(chilli pork) . service was fast and overwhelming. After settling for good drinks and starers we went for the main course.. I just loved the nigiri sushi which contained four kinds varieties of meat(crab,prawn,tuna,salmon)!   Next we took szechwan fried rice which was wonderfully  prepared.. and that pan kai(a sweet..Sour and hot combination of chicken with gravy)
In the dessert we took a Sundae and tutty frutty.
Recommendation- Please ask the attendant if you are not sure about your choice .. They know their job well and can guide you according to your choice.
Special mention- Superb Service!

We celebrated our 29th Anniversary evening at this authentic Chinese Restaurant. Located at Sarat Banerjee Road  and Sarat Bose Crossing, the Restaurant had very nice decor. It was a Monday evening and the place was quiet empty. We started with crab meat sweet corn soup. Soup was well balanced with good amount of crab meat presence. It was followed by Tempura style prawn. The prawn was good in size. There was five prawns served with sagoo noddles crisp and tempura deep. The prawn was very well prepared. In the main course, we had burnt ginger, capsicum and egg fried rice with coriander and Kronjee Crispy Chicken. The fried was superb in taste. Chicken serving was more than adequate. We being moderate waters could not finish the food and had to pack almost one third for our son. Food was very good. Service was excellent. Price also as per standard of this kind of restaurants. Nice place to have authentic pan Asian food.

Opted here couple of days back for buffet lunch with my hubby to try their continental cuisine but sadly they had Chinese only to offer. 
Located in Southern Avenue at the opposite side of Tolly Tells 📍🐾
On starter they offered us
Chicken soup - Tested average!
Red peppers chicken - Tested really good 👍
Chicken dim some - ( What we know as chicken momo) Tested good.
Veg spinach rolls - Ah couldn't be better honestly! 
Veg one more item I can't remember - Was an average!
We ordered two drinks separately which tested average but presentation was quite good.
On main course it was a huge disappointment! 
We tried to eat the items be it fried rice or chicken Tangra but all of the dishes tested bad so couldn't really eat or enjoyed any of them! 
So we headed for desserts where we found only ice creams, darsan and brownies.
Ambience was cool, quite, neat and clean with a background music. They have bar also to offer you.
Service was quite good and helpful, prompt and attentive. But they offer you one tiny plat and you need to eat all of your foods onto that which I found uncomfortable!

Please note : *They don't offer you any complementary drinks you need to order that separately. Prices have been upgraded. Zomato is showing old prices.
Currently buffet costs ₹350 + Tax and Vat ( Weekdays )

Overall experience was as 
Foods : 2.5/5
Service : 4/5
Ambience : 4/5
Our bill was of ₹1012
They add Service Tax 6%, Vat 14.5% 

Hope you find it helpful! 😁

Steam cooking lends itself well to the restaurant’s concept of providing tasty and healthy food. Contrary to the belief that steaming means blandness, the flavour, aroma, colour and texture of all ingredients are intact when steam cooked rather than fried or boiled in water. A far higher level of nutrients, vitamins and minerals is retained than by other cooking methods. Steamed dishes are healthier and more nutritious.

This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the city!
I've been here for a la carte on some days and for buffet on few other. I'm not exactly fond of their buffet items,however, it was wholesome and worth for the money I put in. I totally recommend a la carte items like konjee crispy lamb, lat mai kai chicken, pan fried chilli fish, teriyaki chicken, mixed hakka noodles and mixed fried rice. The dessert platter has changed since the last time I paid them a visit so looking forward to trying out their cigar roll soon!
Well done, Team👍👌

Visited today for lunch buffet(17th march friday). Staffs were courteous. The non-veg buffet costs Rs 422(including tax). At first we encountered with a chicken soup followed by a veg starter(all photographs below) then chicken tulip, veg dimsums, and one more chicken starter. The starters were average not too good nor too bad. At main course there were veg noodles, egg rice One veg side dish, one chicken item,  and one fish item. Main course is good. And finally at desert there is a pudding, ice creams vanilla, chocolate and strawberry and Darshan.desert is as usual good. Spend our day very well and ambience was great with comfortable seats! 
A great buffet indeed at reasonable price. it would be very great if there is drumsticks at starter in replacement of the other one(personal opinion ). 
A must visit resturant  and hope to see much improvements in future.

The Wall is in my bucket list from last 7-8 months and finally I went there for lunch and had a buffet.

Located beside to the Tolly Tales, this place is very neat and clean, ambiance is very soothing. 

We order fruit flavoured mocktail and fresh lime soda (which was not on the buffet menu).
Their happy hours is only selected to 4 types of alcohol.

From the starters first they served hot and sour chicken soup ehich was fantastic. Later they served veg spring roll ehuch was okeish. There after they served pepper chicken with chicken dimsum... Pepper chicken was very good. Dimsum was average.

On main course there was plenty item but due to heavy intake of appetizers we tried egg fried rice, garlic butter fisg with schezwan chicken..

Desserts were served later on, 3 types of ice cream with darsan.

Just one word.. WOWWW!!! You will get something which is not easily available in Kolkata. Those Japanese and East Asian dishes are so great!! I went with two other friends to try Japanese food only. Our strict goal was not try anything other than Japanese. We had Ebi fry and yakitori in the starters. Sushi is definitely a must have Japanese food and they serve it beautifully. In the main course we tried chahan (Japanese rice) and mild spicy chicken with sirachi chilli sauce. All these items are so mind blowing. Only thing is the price is on a little higher side. However to get something which is not easily available, priority of price can be lowered. I forgot to mention. They served a German beer named magpie which I tasted first time. It's smooth but strong. Try this once if you are beer person.

Visited this place with friends and family. Very nice ambience and very courteous staff.
We ordered a simple Tom Yum soup which was quite nice. We then ordered chilli cheese mushroom for starter. It was absolutely amazing. Though I would have liked it more if the chili was more prominent.
We then ordered the sushi boat and steamboat. Sushi boat had around 6 types of sushi. I enjoyed the tastes a lot. 
It was my first time to see the steam boat being prepared. One should try it if they want something new.

This place must be one of the best Asian fine dining restaurants in the city. I've been there around 3-4 times in the past few years, and they only seem to be getting better. The ambience is wonderful, refined elegance. The food is exceptional and served by friendly and helpful staff. My favorites - ten-vegetable noodles,  non-vegetarian steamboat. The latter,in particular,is a must try- heavenly combination of delicate broth being simmered live at the table and served with a very generous helping of your choice of meat and vegetables. The steamboat alone would have made me want to return to this place again and again; however, it doesn't hurt that everything else in the menu tastes wonderful too. The crispy fish and crabmeat in spicy basil sauce is also a wonderful choice of side-dish. I haven't tasted anything here that I haven't liked and I look forward to sampling the sushi menu next time.

This place is located near Tolly Tales. It has great ambience and interiors. They even play Japanese music in the background which perfectly suits the ambience. Tried the Lung Fung soup which was good. The Chilli cheese stuffed mushroom was delicious. One should definitely try sushi over here because you usually do not find it in many restaurants. We tried the Veg Sushi Boat which was really good. We also ordered the Chilli pink pepper drink , which was again good. Then for main course we ordered the Veg Steam Boat which is a pot of broth, vegetables, noodles and dumplings and they make it live. Though my friends liked this dish, I found it a bit bland.Overall the place is good if you want to try authentic Japanese and Chinese food. The staff is courteous but the prices are bit on the higher side.

Had dinner on a Saturday evening here. Liked the ambience and the decor. The staff is well mannered and prompt. Coming to the food, we had the lung Fung soup which was a cloudy soup with mushrooms. It had ginger in it which enhanced the flavours. We also had the cheese chilli mushrooms which was awesome. For the mains we had the vegetarian steam boat. It is basically a one pot dish which they make on the table itself. You can see exactly what which vegetables and greens and dumplings and noodles and sauces went into it. A little tip- order it with the starters itself as it takes quite a while to cook. Also one portion is good enough for 5-6 people.  Overall a good place with good food.

Visited this place last sunday. It's located in the same place where xrong place, tolly tales bar cum resturants are located. Went there for try there buffets. 

1. From the entrance gate to serving food or water each and every time there stuffs are show manners and behaving us like a guest. 
   
     "After finishing our starter buffets, there stuff clean our entire table and make it like a new table and then they asking to us for start our main course  right now or later?" 

2. Decoration is nice and the buffets dishes are quite unique and well maintained. Lovely place with slow music. 

3. Food is awesome from the soup to dessert. They have huge buffet list which is MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR FILL YOUR BELLY. 

THANK YOU GUYS FOR MADE MY SUNDAY NOON SPECIAL.  WANT TO VISIT HERE ON WEEKDAYS FOR  BUFFETS.

Visited The Wall this afternoon for a binge session with friends... We opted for the Pan Asian Buffet on offer since the menu of the day seemed quite good... 
First up was a delicious hot and sour chicken soup followed by a wide range of starters thankfully served at the table... The starters included Crispy Chicken in Chilly Basil Sauce, Veg fried Turnips, Chilly Garlic Fish and Chicken Dumplings... All the starters were well prepared and very palatable... 
The main course had a sumptuous spread that included vegetable and non-vegetable salads, Veg noodles, mixed fried rice, Prawns in Butter Garlic White Sauce, Thai Chicken in Yellow Sauce, Hot Garlic Fish and Lamb in Oyster Sauce... Almost all the dishes in this course were spot on but the Prawn was the  winner hands down... Almost full by now, yet being a true Bengali, we never really can resist something sweet... So coming to the sweet ending, the desserts were pretty basic but good and included Chocolate and Strawberry Tarts and Darsaan with choice of ice-cream... All this at around 700 inclusive of all taxes and it was indeed a steal deal... 
Coming to factors other than the food, this restaurant can boast of a fantastic decor and lovely ambience... The happy hours offer on the drinks menu is an added bonus... Just order all your drinks within the window and save a lot of money... The service is quite prompt and the staff pretty helpful... All in all, they are doing justice to the Savourites brand... Would definitely like to visit again to try some of the signature dishes off the buffet...

A very nice restaurant at a convinient location...celebrated parent's anniversary here...they were quiet happy with this idea...the best thing about this place to me is the service provided by the waiters...so understanding and hard working...the ambience is very nice...but for a restaurant with such a high rating their food quality is not up to the mark...I would be happy to recommend this to other people and go back there myself if they improve on the basic food items...from the momment we entered we felt this was going to be a good experience and it was but it could have been nicer if they made the food a little better...even the pocket pinch was justifiable to us...

One of the good places for oriental cuisine. Located on a small street near lake kalibari. The inner ambience as well as the traditional Chinese music offers the perfect atmosphere. Ala Carte as well as buffet both options are there. Went for a sunday lunch and we went for the buffet. To start with the chicken lung fung soup tasted little salty but manageable. Chicken salad looked fresh but taste was not so great. Coming to the starters the battered fish fry and veg spring roll tasted dull. But non veg dishes made the day. Panfried chicken well cooked and tasty. The winner was the japanese teriyaki chicken- a little bit on sweeter side but quite succulent and soft. On main course the fried rice- rice quality should be improved. I liked the thai green prawn curry as well as the hot and sour fish. For sweet dishes nothing much to get overwhelmed except the blueberry souffle that gave a tangy twist. In short, a good place, staffs are courteous but improvement on food section is needed.

This place is located inside the lane opposite Deshapriya Park Barista outlet and lies a few feet away from Tolly Tales and The Xrong Place . The interiors are well decorated with Chinese themed paintings and warm lighting . The soft Chinese music adds to the wonderful ambience. The buffet here is totally value for money , and each item on the menu tastes great . The items were mostly vegetarian though. An array of starters including wanton tulip , lat mai kai, chicken cheese balls and crispy fried chilli baby corn were served to our table by the waiter .   Then the main course had to be self served , and included veg Hakka noodles, egg fried rice , two veg items - one including paneer and the other baby corn , and one chicken item. The desserts too were awesome , and consisted of Darshan , warm Brownie , with a choice of vanilla , strawberry and chocolate ice cream . The drinks are to be ordered separately and is served from the bar to the table . The waiters are extremely courteous. Payments may be made through cards. Overall , we had scrumptious meal at pocket friendly prices. Would surely love to come back !

The main course is equally tasty and has a spread of veg, chicken, fish, prawn and lamb. Something for everyone. The dessert doesn't let you down. Choice of icecream and other delicacies end the experience at a new high. A place I recommend highly to foodies of Kolkata. Special thanks to my wife Nehaa for telling me about this place.

Got our hands and mouth dirty into their buffet spread. ( Special Navami buffet Menu in picture attached)

Comfortable chairs and sofas..  all together its just wonderful..  Coming to the food part...  We didn't order much varieties.. Bt the items we had were really tasty...

Arguably some of the finest Pan Asian food I've ever had. The Wall brands themselves as a boutique dining experience, and I can fully understand why. There's a massive difference between paying for good food, and paying for a good experience and this is exactly what the wall showcases with a vigour.

The restaurant, last I remember, was much smaller than it is now - which is always a good indicator of the correct road chosen. The service is professional, warm and in tone with the overall feel of the restaurant. The decor employs the conventional warm tones a restaurant would normally do. Coupled with light, East Asian music, the tone The Wall sets is extremely comfortable. The furniture is perhaps a little difficult to work with; not the most ergonomic in terms of making space for a menu card. Regardless, cutlery and crockery considered, The Wall is a fascinating specimen of a restaurant.

The food is what a pan asian restaurant must excel in. While it was obvious that the fried stuff would be good, I wasn't particularly fond of the sushi. Most people recommended the Nigiri and I could understand why, but there wasn't enough in keeping with the rest of the dishes. I wandered in during a Duck Festival which was going on. The Peking Duck was fantastic, as were the staples. In my comfortable opinion, if you're to try out food here, go for:

1. Basil Noodles (Prawn and Chicken).
2. Lat Mai Kai.
3. Babi Kecap.

...with a side of a Casablanca or a simple wine.

The Wall is without a doubt on the more expensive side, and we managed to rack up quite a bill. A dinner consisting of 2 staples, a chicken and a pork side, a couple glasses of alcohol and a starter should come to around 3000. But this is a 3000 well spent, I'll gladly wager.

Ambience/Interiors: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

This is one of the places that serve south-east Asian cuisine in Kolkata. So one can get a mix of dishes from Japanese, Thai, Indonesian, Malaysian cuisine and standard Chinese food. We tried a mix of Thai and Indonesian items and the taste was impressive, almost matching the authentic taste and flavor. We saw sushi being served - it is to be tried in the next visit. The ambiance is good, though nothing extraordinary. Some more separation between the tables would have been good - giving more privacy to the customers. The service was ok. 
Their weekend brunch is on the list to do the next.

I love this place and today's experience here was great. They've recently renovated the place and they took a ridiculous sum of money as taxes but the food was great. Ordered prawn tempura maki and a chicken soup both of which were excellent. Their bar is also reasonably well stocked. The waiters and the staff are all extremely courteous and polite and I would definitely recommend this place.

I happened to visit this place on 31st evening with my family for dinner. We went ahead with the buffet menu.
The menu had good variety if choice the fish and chicken served as starter was really yum specially the sweet chicken dish dipped ij soya sauce served with seasame seeda is worth a mention.
However we were not that impressed with the main course the rice and noodles seem pretty ordinary, the green prawn curry was close to bengali delicacy chingri malaicurry. The only item worth a mention was lamb dish.
However I would advise the management to look int the main course buffet menu for better taste of food.
Overall it was a good experience dining at The Wall.

We visited yesterday. The place is average. The ambience is really nice. However the price they charge qualifies for fine dining, which did not reflect in the food. The Vietnamese summer roll was nice really like it, and the Hot Basil Noddles was very good as well. But most of the other dishes was average. The other appetisers and soup was most  average and the drum sticks were not up to the mark at all. They tasted like regular home cooked food. So over all an average experience.

We opted for the week day lunch buffet. The ambience of this restaurant was awesome with a light Chinese music in the background. The staffs were courteous.
Coming to food we loved the starters. There was chicken manchow soup, spinach spring roll, a vegetables fry, pepper chicken, and chicken dim sum. All of them was satisfactory.
The main course was not that interesting but what more we can expect for a 300/- buffet. There was veg Hakka chow, egg fried rice, two veg sides and one chicken side. Tastewise it was so so.
In the dessert there was daarsaan, chocolate browny and 4 flavours of ice cream.
Overall price wise it was a pleasant experience. Would like to visit there again.

This s my second visiting at The Wall..starters are absolutely tasteless this time..fully disappointed with their starters..no complimentary drinks..in the main course veg  noodles and fish were good..but fried rice is just dull and the chicken manchurian tastes horrible..even the quality of the chicken was dull..Desserts were Average.. overall very Average experience this time. I will not prefer anyone to choose this type of buffet at 422 when The restaurant like Haka offers great buffets at 435..

The Wall is a restaurant specializing in Chinese and Japanese food. Located near the intersection of Sarat Bose Road and Southern Avenue, beside Tolly Tales and Xrong Place it's a pretty good joint serving delicious authentic Oriental cuisine. 
The week day lunch buffet is priced at 361 and it's absolutely worth it. With a variety of starters, soup, main course , the food was in all, pretty good. The ambience was okayish , not too good , not too bad. The food was served hot. The only discontentment I had was just one non vegetarian main course and the veg starter was slightly undercooked. 
Although obviously not at a par with the likes of the premium buffets in town, but for its cost, flavor and overall experience I'll give this restaurant a 4/5

The wall is one restaurant that I have been waiting for very long to visit. My expectations didnt go wasted. I had superb fun here. The ambience is fab. The staffs extremely well mannered. We had opted for buffet. Though very few choices yet amazing taste. Chicken Tai Pei was my favourite.

I am a little amazed at the high rating of this restaurant, to be very honest. The only time I have visited was for a relatives pre-wedding party. We had opted for the buffet. The food was ok, nothing to write home about, to be honest. But the cost was extremely high. For the amount we paid, the overall yield in terms of quality and service should have been much better. But it was some years back and I am not sure if they have improved in the meanwhile.

Sophisticated. Simple yet extremely delicious. I visited this place with my group of friends yesterday. Absolutely loved their Drums of Heaven( best till I had ) . We were also told that there was a 1+1 offer in the beers and so we took advantage of that. Later we had also ordered a cocktail Gin and Sin which turned out to be fantastic. 

The restaurant has a very warm ambience with hanging lights available on Pepperfry. The service is efficient but I was disappointed by the simple fact that they didn't provide us our drinks until our food was ready( although we requested them to ) . 

Pricing is moderate and the place came across as a family restaurant and not exactly an awesome place to hangout.

I have never been a big fan of Chinese cuisine but now i am and this place is responsible for that. I never thought that a buffet @ 300 bucks would be so good. The food was delicious especially the starters and there was a wide array of desserts at such a low cost. People who like pan asian cuisine should definitely visit this place. 
Looking forward to dine here soon.

I never expected my last day of Durga Puja to get ruined like this. Food is the main thing of every festivals/occasions.

We planned for a Chinese buffet and according to zomato rating we decided to go to 'The Wall'.
I really regret taking this decision.
The quality of food was so so so horrible.
The service was bad too. The waiters were lazy and not interested for those having buffet.
Only the interior was good. But what will I do with the interior when the food is so cheap n tasteless!!!!!!!!!! I really don't want to write anything more.

How the hell did people rate the restaurant so much???
Or they intensionally make the buffet taste horrible??? God knows!
We didn't eat much. It was a disaster!

Will never be visiting this cheap and stupid restaurant.........

Well it's really a place where u get value for your money. Awesome ambience and  a prominent location. The buffet is really good. They served us duck roast, fried fish and drums of heaven as non veg starters which were really delicious. In the main course u get noodles and fried rice, salads....some tasty veggie dishes and prwan, duck, fish , chicken. There are seven deserts as well which were also good. Chocolate sauce was missing with the ice cream. And yes u don't get any complimentary drinks. Bar is available. And this pink pepper chili mocktail is something new.....though a bit spicy but really tasty.

The Wall has always been one of my favourite dining places nearby my home. Here specifically I enjoy the long dinner since the ambiance is calm & stewards give you lot of space to eat your course at your own pace.

Since it is a premium fine dining (mostly South East)Asian restaurant, one should not complain about their price v/s quantity. But I would suggest to try their delicacies / specialities in bits & pieces, sharing with your partner, rather than ordering a typical tried-&-tasted full course.

For Cocktail connoisseurs, you can try out some authentic mixes as well.

The Wall is like a hidden gem. Not visible from the main road, on lake road next to xrong place. Serves good chinese food. 

The ambience is nice,warm and authentic. 
The food is equally buffet. They have a huge spread in buffet and that too at a very reasonable price. 
In ala carte i tried:
1. Prawn in oyster and basil sauce - tasted good. 
2. Chilli chiken- yummy indeed
3. The garlic pepper chicken- white gravy. Taste was perfect. 
4. Chicken hakka noodles- good quantity and taste. 

Overall a good experience. The service was nice. Well mannered staff and the manager/captain made the servicd better by interacting with us to know if we enjoying the meal. Overall  great.

Had high expectations from this place but alas it turned out to be a disaster on my first visit. Had gone for their buffet. The starters seemed to be quite unique and tasted good specially the Corn Toast and the Veg Spring Roll. But when it came to the main course, all the items (Fried Rice, Noodles, Veg and the Chicken Side dishes) turned out to be a complete mess. The food lacked taste and the gravy was bad too. Besides, the staffs were not at all co-ordinating and within an hour of our visit, they gave us the bill when we were in the middle of our main course. The service is bad. Unlike other buffets in town, this one really disappointed me the most. Nevertheless, the dessert menu was not that impressive comprising of Darsan, Vanilla Icecream, Brownie and a Lemonade Cake which is actually very mainstream. Besides there is lack of management too and availability of the items. You get half of the starters at your table and the rest along with the maincourse food which you have to serve by yourself. The icecream again is available at their bar counter. Therefore, dissatisfied.

Needs improvement.

Except food everything is just great. Staffs are courteous, ambience is good, they serve food to your table in buffet.
Good enough!
I was there for lunch, so, I opted out for a buffet, which was very much pocket friendly too. The starters were good and had variations but the main course had only 3-4 items, egg fried rice, noodles, one gruesome veg side dish I forgot the Japanese name of this dish, in Bengal we call it shukto.
One chicken side dish minus taste. Again dessert was completely satisfying, the mango souffle, darshan and ice cream helped a lot to keep up my mood.
When I filled up my feedback form suggesting to increase main course dishes, the manager personally came to me and enchanted me with a nice conversation. Though I could completely feel his irony but I couldn't rate their main course less than a disaster.
One can give it a try only if they want to enjoy a good ambience and less bothered with food.

"Very Very Bad Experience"
Came to have buffet on 10/10/16 Price was set at 675+tax:
Booking was at 7:30 pm under M.Biswas
Ambience: Ok
Service : VERY POOR Have to ask for Ice Cream twice, as there was no open counter for ice cream. You have to ask for a Ice Cream. They were not serving both. AND giving after repeated reqst. Never Had such POOR buffet experience in my life.

The FOOD:

The STARTER:
1. Deep Fried Corn Curd: What it was I cudn't understand It tasted like some lump of flour. Totally bland.
2. Cheese and Spinach Roll: It is the only edible starter they cud provide.
3. Hunan Fried Chicken: Man never had such 3rd class chicken starter in my life. It was COLD , STIFF and DRY. Had to chew hard to swallow. I also told the waiter there that it was cold he stired it and said it was ok...!!!??
4. Fish In Chilli Mustard: What the hell it was I don't Know. None of the spice of the Spices entered the fish as a result it was totally bland.

The Soup:
1. Chicken sweet Corn Soup: It was nice but I had its Better Variety at Mainland China

The Main Course:

1. Chilli Chicken: I have never had such 3rd class tasteless chili chicken in my life. I think the CHILLI Chicken they make at the road side shops r better. And it would be an insult to Chilli Chicken if we Compare with the ones available at Bejing/Bigboss/ Kimling of China town. "The Wall's Chilli Chicken" was an insult to the dish itself.

2. Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce: It was " Ok" in taste though some what bland and lacked the character.

3. Fish in Hot Basil Sauce: Another Disappointment of a dish. None of the elements could be tasted. Totally Bland.

4. Prawn in Butter Garlic Sauce: Though cud smell the butter, but there was a huge synchronization in the dish. The Prawn was rubbery in texture and smelt fish.

5. Chicken Hakka Noodles: Chicken in this noodles was an occasional occurrence.

6. Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice: It was nice but failed due to lack of proper side dish to go with it.

The Dessert:
1. Passion Fruit Cheese Cake: It was really good and the only item which I liked. Without it I wud hav to return home in empty stomach.

2. Mississippi Mud Cake: Another insult of the name mud cake it tasted more like a brownie on a tart. It was very dry. Really a disappointment.

3. Vanilla/ Strawberry Ice Cream: What to say about it had to ask for it.. and was given even after asking twice/ thrice. I have never had a buffet where you hav to ask for Ice Cream. And Quality was not good to it was not homogeneous had ice crystals in it.

4. Darsan: It is nothing but a variety of jibe goja which we bengalis r used to having at puri.

Experience:
1 VERY DISAPPOINTING : We booked table for 5 but only two us ate there because, they where more interested in cleaning the table for the next customer than they were interested in serving us. 2ndly the items were really bad. So called two other friends asked them not to come. Another friend who came late asked him not have nething there.
" I was having my Ice Cream while chatting with my friend waiter came and removed the dish front of me" I don't know what kind of service is this.????????????
2. I Recommended this Place after seeing the review at Zomatoe. IT IS THE WORST BUFFET EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME & MONEY.
3. Will NEVER EVER GO TO " THE WALL"Manojit Biswas Kushal Honeybee

The Wall is a beautiful place for having a peaceful lunch and dinner with delicious food, top notch service and eye pleasing ambience.. We went there for weekday lunch buffet which was for 362/- A.I. The variety of food at this price is praiseworthy.. They provided us with one type of soup, 4 starters- 2 veg starter and 2 non-veg, for main course there was egg fried rice, veg fried rice, veg noodles, veg manchurian, another veg side dish and one chicken side dish.. For desserts there was a tart and 4 types of ice creams..

The Taipei Chicken served as starters was delicious.. It was crispy and perfectly flavoured.. Another starter was Steamed Chicken Dimsum which was served with black bean sauce.. It was also very good..

The main course was also good..
The only disappointment was the dessert section.. I had expected brownie bt the tart thoroughly disappointed me..

Overall a very good experience and will definitely visit again..:-)
____________________________________________________

My recent experiences with this restaurant is not so good. They might have increased the options of main course on offer but to me the food has degraded taste wise hence decided to change my rating.
Will visit again in future and after that decide whether to restore my previous rating ☺
Happy Fooding ❤

We went for the weekday buffet, it was very good according to the price, veg items were not good though so I would recommend vegetarians to not go but non veggies can absolutely go and have an excellent time.
The items were veg spring roll, assorted chicken with some sauce, chicken hot and sour soup, chicken momo, chicken fried rice, veg noodles, schezuan chicken, mixed vegetable with tofu sauce, vegetables with sweet corn or something. The dessert section had 3 flavours of ice cream, pudding, brownie, a crispy sweet thing i don't know the name of that. But it was a lot for only 370(inclusive tax), so it worth a visit.

One word 'awesome'. A hot aftrnoon..some shaolin music playing, some people in black and red greeting you and you have a buffet @ around 360 with taxes..what more do u want! The starters were superb to start with. Specially the chicken baby corn soup and the lat mai kai..the main course was nice. I didn't like the mofu tofu that much but the vegetables in black bean sauce was just terrific. The best part was the desserts.. darshan, ice cream  scoops and some brilliant , soft,mesmerizing brownies..i loved it. The staff were very well behaved.. full 5/5 for this quality of a buffet at this price.tagline_see you soon..the wall.

had the best buffet till now at such a low price, staffs were very well trained , went for a weekday buffet following the map , was easy to find. it all started with a wonderful chicken sweet corn soup, then we were served tulip wantons and szechuan  vegetables . wontons were the only thing i disliked . but the szechuan fried vegetables were delicious . then came the non veg starters which include chicken cheese balls and lat mai kai. both were superb . in the main course we had hakka noodles egg fried rice. chilly chicken mafu tofu vegetables in black bean sauce . everything was near to perfection. in the dessert section they served 3 flavours of ice cream darsan and a chocolate cake (expected a brownie though but didnt get it). nothing to complain . will surely be going there soon again .

Oh its so tough to pen down the experience at "the wall"....just overwhelmed,and feel is like " out of the world"..its my first attempt at any restaurant in the southern avenue area...I visited there with my buddies on 14th September..yes the star attraction is the buffet...I mean its the best Chinese I ever had..
Let's start from the starters_the soup just prepares your taste buds for more..the baby corn and the lat mai kai was too good..(loved the baby corn and lat mai kai so much)..then came cheeseballs..(p.s.just try the garlic sauce because its too awesome)..now in the main course we had veg noodles,egg fried rice,mafu tofu,chilli chicken,vegetables in bean sauce..oh yes I repeated the main course twice because my appetite was calling for more!!!!!...finally who can forget the dessert...yum yum yummy...we had brownies,darshan,scoops of vanilla,chocolate,strawberry...these seriously made the feeling"out of the world"..
Finally summing up,I am very very pleased and satisfied with the buffet of "the wall".. Also I must mention the price is more than reasonable in a metropolitan city like Kolkata..I am eager to visit here next time soon..

18th Sept 2016: This was my second visit in last 7 days and more so to try out their buffet spread. And no , I am not regretting my decision even one bit. The buffet spread was very compact and tasteful. At least better than those huge buffet spreads where once u try all and decide which one to go for more helpings you are almost full. Among the starters the Japanese dish Chicken Katshu was extremely good. Onion pancake was an innovative one. The main course was very intelligently designed with equal share of prawn chicken fish and lamb. I am not a lamb fan ( I am a mutton fan) but I never had such tasty n soft lamb before. The prawn was very very tasty and the chicken preparation was awesome. Probably the only thing they need to improve is the dessert part. Apart from Darshaan all other were just about ok types. Overall highly recommended because at 595/- + taxes ( ₹ 716/- ) this is extremely value for money. Have put up pic of the buffet menu for reference. 

13th Sept 2016: Was not much hungry and wanted to Hv some light food for dinner. Went to the Wall after many many years. The interior is still the same but looks lot more vibrant n soothing to the eyes. The Japanese cuisine place is being modified into a bigger bar area. The arrangement was comfortable. 
We tried only 2 dishes , Crab meat sweet corn soup and Tordin Terriyaki chicken. Although both were good but I have become a complete fan of the Terriyaki dish. The chicken were tender and juicy. The portion was quite a value for money. But yes all may not like this dish as it tastes more towards the sweeter side. I am ready to visit this again n again for this one dish.

The ambience was quite good and the starters good but the main course could have had a few more items! The desserts mainly including ice creams of 4 different flavors were wonderful!

Visited this place with five of my friends today for my birthday treat. We had opted for the weekday lunch buffet which costs Rs. 300/- plus taxes (rs.360 approx). 
Coming to the décor, they have a simple but nice decoration with very soothing and ample lighting. At the entrance, there is a statue of lord Buddha. Sitting area is spacious and comfortable. The beautiful Asian music playing in the background gives the vibes of a serene Buddhist monastery.
Now, coming to the menu.. we had chicken sweet corn soup,two veg and two nonveg starters which were namely wonton tulip, crispy golden vegetable in schejuwan sauce, chicken lat mai kai and chicken cheese balls. None of these seemed to be anything extraordinary but good to me. But I liked the crispy veggies the most among the starters.
For the main course we had, veg fried rice ,veg Hakka noodles, chili chicken,mafu tofu, veggies in black bean sauce. All of them except the rice and the veggies were not at all edible to me. The mafu tofu somewhat tasted like maggi noodles.
The dessert part was very good. We had strawberry , vanilla and chocolate ice creams. Darsans, brownies. The brownies were the best which I have ever had. Perfectly baked, perfect sweetness,perfect texture , perfect aroma... it was just too good to explain. The darsans too were out of the world in taste. Again the best darsans I have ever had.
If I ever visit this restaurant again, it will be for their brownies and darsans and the ice creams too.

The wall is now one of the distinguished places in the city to serve fine quality oriental cuisine.  And every fine dining restaurant has opted to provide an option for the food enthusiasts to go for the buffet experience which normally enables one to have as much food as they want . Among oriental buffet we have the much acclaimed Mainland China , Haka but somehow I feel The Wall has one step above of the others . Terming the experience as a Weekend Brunch , the restaurant provides a wide array of dishes in the buffet and some of them are really really good . 

° Location :- You have to go to Lake road Ccd . And then take the line which is located before the particular lane where Lake road CCD is located .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

° Food :- I will straight away get to the real deal I.e the buffet . The restaurant provides some decent dishes in the starters and a wide variety of items in the main course . But , not all of them are good . You have to be well informed as to what to really have as much as you want and skip the rest . So, following are the dishes i would recommend and also the ones I will ask you to skip .

-------------------------------------------
STARTERS
------------------------------------------
1. Chicken hot & Sour soup ( 3 / 5 ) :- Not the best of start as the soup was very salty and spicy at the same time . Yes, there were some generous amount of chicken pieces and a good amount of basil leaves . But I would recommend a sweet and sour or a chicken clear soup .

2. Corn Toast ( 5 / 5 ) :- ohh my god . These are really really yummy and crunchy . These are pieces of fried toast with corn in between . The crunchy square pieces were absolutely heavenly in taste and you are bound to have a number of them . This has to be the best veg starter I have ever eaten .

3. Szechwan chicken ( 4/ 5 ) :- Another nice starter . This time these are strips of chicken cooked in spicy Szechwan sauce . The strips are not fully covered rather are tossed with the sauce which makes them really yummy . You should not skip this one .

4. Chicken Dim sum ( 2.5 / 5 ) :- These are you regular chicken momos served hot . But somehow they failed . Really disliked the filling . Yes, it had a lot if chicken but somehow they got the flavor wrong . You can skip this one .

5. Hunan Fried Fish ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Absolutely top class fish starter . These are crunchy fried fish fillets covered with cornflower, but the coating also had lemongrass in it therefore the flavor was amazing.  They were basically lemongrass flavored fish nuggets which you can have loads of them . A must recommended dish and I absolutely loved it .

Therefore , as you can see from the above review that most of items in the starter were fantastic . This, is the part where The Wall scores really high .

-----------------------------------------
MAIN COURSE
----------------------------------------

1. Chicken fried rice ( 3 / 5 ) :- Was expecting a lot from the main staple item .But , it was a no show . Basically the fried rice was really dry with lesser chicken pieces . The flavor of the dish was really poor. You can rather skip this one .

2. Chicken kung pao ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Nothing extraordinary . The chicken is cooked in orange ginger sauce . The pieces of chicken were soft, okayish but still not a remarkable dish .

3. Fish chilli sauce ( 3 / 5 ) :- They tried hard to prepare this one but didnot succeed . Inspite of the chilli , it was not spicy and once again the flavor of the dish was average . The fish was of decent quality but you won't like to have much of it . Was really looking forward to this dish though but it turned out average .

4. Prawn Garlic pepper sauce ( 4 / 5 ) :- Finally a good dish . The prawn pieces were really huge.  The gravy was perfect . White gravy with a decent flavor of garlic . The dish is mild spicy which goes well with the prawns . A must try .

5. Lamb Massaman curry ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- This is a stunning dish.  The lamb pieces were soft and tender . The gravy had a different flavor to it consisting of mainly lemongrass . This really went fine with the tender square pieces of lamb . Too bad the rice was not good , but this dish will surely make your day . Absolutely , paisa wasool stuff.


So, with this it can clearly be noted that the main course is pretty mediocre like the other buffet spreads.  But the prawn and lamb are the real saviours here . Those 2 are really fine dishes 

-------------------------------------
DESERTS 
-------------------------------------

Not a fine desert spread but after a whole hearted starter and almost good main course it is recommended to try the following items .

1. Blue berry cheese cake ( 4 / 5 )
2. Darshan with ice cream ( 4 / 5 )

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The restaurant boasts a pretty awesome ambience and the staff is absolutely thorough professional in their duty. We are floored by their hospitality . So, if you are planning to give a visit and check out their buffet you can check the above items and have a try . You will have a decent experience . 

Following points are to be highlighted in regard to the buffet :- 

1. Really nice starters .
2. Lamb and prawn make the superstars of main course . Other items are ordinary .
3. Okay deserts .
4. Beautiful ambience and courteous staff .

Next time , I plan to go for an Ala carte since it is akways preferred over the buffet but still the buffet will be a decent experience .

If you are somebody who wants to try out various cuisines and specifically looking for South East Asian authentic dishes, then The Wall cannot be a miss at all! Starting from the 12th of August, 2016 and continuing till the 28th of the month, The Wall celebrates Hazuki Fudo Matsuri – the Japanese Food Festival. And after being invited by The Wall management and getting to taste the authentic dishes hailing from the Japanese cuisines, I would recommend all my readers to visit The Wall and taste the exotic and distinct Japanese dishes and get amazed by the unforgettable taste and freshness of the platters. Moreover, the delicate flavour and the minimalistic use of oil and spices in the dishes make them a great-to-go on the health aspects and also a must-try! So, the latest post on my blog is the Japanese Food Festival being celebrated at The Wall. Read and enjoy!

Hazuki Fudo Matsuri - Mouthwatering Japanese Food Festival at The Wall..!

A restaurant which has been serving authentic Pan-Asian cuisine since their inception. To honor and celebrate, one of the most loved cuisines in the world, The Wall is organizing a Japanese Food Festival to cater to the tastebuds of the food appreciators from August 12th to August 28th. For a city, which has hardly seen any proper Japanese serving restaurant, outside the boundaries of that of the 5 star hotels, such cuisine was almost non-existent and out of the reach of common man. However, The Wall, with its affordable pricing and authentic cooking, has made it all possible for people like us to savor this international delicacy.

Our group PanchPhoron was invited over to try out some of the dishes from the festival special menu. This was my first time at The Wall. I’ve been to their express outlet in Acropolis Mall, & found the food pretty good compared to the food court setting. Finding the restaurant is easy. People know it by name, for the uninitiated it’s in the same lane as Xrong Place & Tolly Tales. The facade is quite unsuspecting. But once you enter, the place behind the glass window is a completely different environment. The eatery is divided into few sections, with regular seating & a special themed section. The themed section with its frosted glass walls & low seating arrangement is reminiscent of oriental setting. The awesome natural ambient light coming from the frosted glass makes the place so much like a house with paper walls. I couldn’t stop clicking pics of my fellow group members! Enough of lights, coming to the food. We were served the following items, each of which looked so great, whether they tasted as great was the thing to find out!

There is something about japanese food that sets the bengali taste-buds on fire. traditional cuisine of japan is based on rice with miso soup ans other side dishes.with an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. side dishes often consist of fish,pickled vegetables not only that also vegetables cooked in broth.for them fish is a very common thing for their every day life. often grilled or sometimes served as a raw like sushi or sashimi.vegetables ,sea foods are also deep fried in a light batter like tempura.basically japanese foods is gastronomical delights with a boundless variety of foods.apart from rice their noodles preparation also great.japanese cuisine has many simmered dishes as fish dishes.their on of the most famous food is sushi.apart from that they has an indigenous form of sweets called wagashi. recently i was invited by The wall management to taste some lip-smacking dishes which they introduced their japanese food festival. located near southern avenue. here you will find some lovely delicious foods like sushi,sashimi,steamboat along with the very best of pan asian delicacies.it is a very delicately flavoured cuisine with minimal use of spices and oil  which is tasty as well as healthy at the same time. it is the exotic beauty,distinct flavour,unforgettable taste,freshness and mouth-watering.we had some lovely dishes started with,

Have been to this place a couple of times in the past… they are supposed to serve a killer buffet on Sundays and recently we went to one of those… place is easy to find as it is now in the same lane as Xrong place, calif and tolly tales… 

The interiors have been done up well though I don’t think for all the years they have changed their interiors too much or at all… they earlier used to serve a stew which was made on your table but it is not that good any more… 

First things first… the people are nice and they try to be friendly… but the back drop is that they are rigid in their ways and sometimes you need to explain them 3 or 4 times and there is a major chance they might say no… like we are vegetarians and they were serving too few items for us… we asked them that can we take the buffet if you add some things to the menu… the person on the phone and the reception agreed and then when we got there they did not know what to do… so clearly tell your specifications to them…

Coming to the food… their food is very very good and authentic oriental… there is no mixing to satisfy an indian taste buds… it si made as is how is… there is a small issue for vegetarians for sure asd this place I realize should not be our first option… their varieties in Veg is very low and you have to really eat what you get which is no fun… over all the soups salads and gravy and all is up to mark and makes an enjoyable meal…

The pricing of this place for sure is on the higher side and will pinch your pocket espeacially when the options are on the lower side…

I, along with 2 of my friends decided to go out for some nice lunch on a rainy afternoon. A friend had suggested the weekday buffet and we decided to try it out today. It's a small quaint restaurant near The Xrong place and bang opposite another new place called Caliph in Southern Avenue. There's a black stone Buddha at the entrance and a lying Buddha in gold just at the front desk. We were invited by a nice soothing music, almost like a lullaby! 
The weekday buffet is priced at Rs 300 (+ taxes which comes to Rs 370 approx). It consists of 1 soup, 2 non-veg starters (chicken cheese balls and lat ma kai) and 2 veg starters (vegetable tulip and schezuan fried potatoes), noodles, egg fried rice, tofu and a mixed vegetable and chilli chicken for main course. There was darsan, chocolate brownies and 3 kinds of ice creams (chocolate, vanilla and strawberry) for desserts. 
The chicken cheese balls were right out of the oven and very tasty and the lat ma kai was very fresh and perfectly fried! Although the vegetable starters were not that appealing, the nonveg ones and desserts more than made up for them. 
Overall I can say that it is good value for food and I would definitely recommend people to go and give it a try.

I love buffets and The Wall offered the perfect chance to go for an affordable lunch buffet. Priced Rs 300+ tax (total approx Rs 360), the buffet consists of good food at a quiet and calm restaurant. The buffet offers 4 starters, soup, 3 main course, and 5 desserts. We were very pleased with the quality of food and the polite staff. Had a great experience!

Visited the wall on a weekday after hearing about it's reasonable lunch buffet offer. The place is very calming. The ambiance is very soothing and sort of designed to make you feel calm. There's a beautiful statute of lord Buddha leisurely resting as you enter. The lighting is dimly lit and the seats are very comfortable adding to the calming vibe. Coming to the food, since we went on a weekday buffet it didn't include any sea food. The buffet comprised of spicy chkcken soup, 4 starters: 2 non veg (chicken cheese balls, lat ma Kai) and 2 veg, in main course they had veg noodles, egg fried rice, tofu, some other veg dish in black pepper sauce, chilli chicken, for dessert they had ice cream: vanilla, strawberry , chocolate. They also had darsan and brownies with chocolate sauce. If you go by the cost of the buffet I'd say it was a fair deal. Good food. I would particularly point out the non veg starters. It was fabbbb. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive. The place has happy hours from 12:30-3:30 on most alcohol items so that was a bonus. 😊 very happy with the experience!
Will try out the weekend buffet soon where the offer sea food.

After getting great reviews, we went to The Wall to try out their weekend lunch buffet. Our expectations were high and we were quite disappointed..
1. The soup was good.
2. Starters- Other than the chicken dimsums, the other starters were all fried stuff.. not even tossed in any sauce.
3. Main Course- The prawns had a thick coating, the lamb did not taste good. Only the fish was nice..
4. Almost all dishes were given a lemony lime flavour either in form of zest, lime leaves or lemongrass which at a point of time became overpowering.
5. Lastly, Desserts were good.. although i feel they should provide chocolate sauce..
The service was good.. But we were not at all happy with the food..

Very cheap buffet on weekdays, with 4 to 5 starters, 3-4 main courses and 3 desserts.
All the starters tastes very good, in main course i only tried 2 dishes and that was good too. And in dessert just tried the ice creams.. 
Since it was a weekday that is why it was very empty and the ambience was very calm.
Overall a good visit.

I have been hearing raving reviews about this place from 2013. Always wanted to go but couldn't for one reason or the other. Finally when I went, I was for disappointment
We asked our server to explain what we should order. He told us to go for chicken lat mai kai & prawn chilli basil sauce as starter. Schezwan chicken rice & That Pan Kai for the main course. We went along with request for medium spicy. But the food was too spicy for us & not at all delicious. We found it greasy with sauce.
Service wise it was awesome but the food not good. My bill being 2500/- but with the quality of food..am not going back there in future.

Visited this place for a weekend buffet. The place is nicely decorated & with light music playing in the background it created a convenient atmosphere to enjoy food. The staffs are well behaved ready to serve with a smile. They serve the soup & starters at the table . We started with chicken manchow soup & it was really good. As for starters teriyaki chicken is fantastic , dimsums are good too . The pick of the lot was the fish starter, the fish was so fresh & tasted heavenly.Coming to the main course veg noodles & mixed fried rice were very good though I would say veg noodles was better. Fish in coriander sauce, chicken in red sauce, prawn in turmeric sauce & Singaporean lamb comprised the main course dishes & each one was tasty & mouth watering. Though I mainly prefer non veg dishes but I must say the fried vegetables were simply too good with generous portion of mushrooms, baby corns, broccoli etc . The pastries in the dessert section were ok with darsan being the pick of the lot. We also had 4 types of ice creams to choose from. I missed sushi & lat mai kai in the menu but considering that no restaurant will provide all their best dishes in buffet menu I will say that the buffet is quite generous. Overall a very pleasant Pan Asian food experience with definite pledge of coming back .

An awesome experience. Starting with the food..its quantity, its quality, its price(363/-).. too good,the behaviour of the staffs were good too.Enjoyed the buffet thoroughly along with slow nice music which adds an extra chinese flavour to the total thing.
CHICKEN CHEESE BALLS ..a must try item there.One would hardly dislike it.

You know that the food is good when even non vegetarians eat the veg dishes and happily agree to more veg dishes despite the variety they offer! Authentic dishes at par with international standards ! For starters the chilli cheese stuffed mushrooms and vietnamese summer rolls are yumm (nom nom nom). The veg Sushi Boat is a good compensation for those who yearn some Sushi with that soy sauce dip and wasabi!! Three treasure mushroom is delectable and a must try!! Noodles and rice are standard.Take the servers reccommendations for them. 
Desserts are missable , nothing unique after the wide variety of soups,starters and main course you miss seeing lemongrass icecream .. lime kafir galangal sorbet which other pan asian restaurants usually offer!

The Wall is located right beside Xrong Place and has a wonderful ambience for a date or a family outing. 
Delicious Pan Asian cuisines are its speciality but sad to say that service we got was below par. During a buffet lunch the most important thing is spacing out your starters over a space of time and on proper dishes but the service failed at both at this restaurant. Moreover, the waiters in an attempt to keep a constant eye out for our requirements, made us feel rather uncomfortable by their stagnant stare. 
Nevertheless, the food was delicious especially the starters and dessert was pronably the most value for money buffet lunch I have ever had. Great filling and delicious food at just 362 per head is a brilliant deal.

The Wall,totally seems from inside and out that it's a pure Chinese cuisine with excellent ambience of authentic japanse soft music and dimmed lights...

Food was good...tasty according to what you order.. I ordered Lat mai kai(it's just nothing but a fried chicken tossed with herbs and sauces) and a flavoured lemonade mocktail(which was more like you are having limesoda though I choose the green apple flavour).Then in the main course we had egg wrapped fried rice which was very nice and delicious with that we had gung pao prawn (more like a chilly prawn with nuts in it)tastes non spicy..
Lastly I must say go and enjoy the ambience and food alltogether because it's the right place for a couple to spend their quality time and food.😍😍😍😍😍

Been there for a belated birthday celebration. Though they call it pan Asian buffet, it lacked varieties. We missed sushi in buffet. At least one of a kind sushi was expected. Apart from that all the starters were mind blowing. It was just perfect with awesome flavors! On the main course the lack of variety is noticeable. 2 Salad, 1 chicken, 1 lamb, 1 prawn, 1 rice, 1 noodle was not enough to call it pan Asian. The fillers were late too when the main course bowls were empty. In dessert pastry and ice cream was too main stream. We expected some exotic Asian dessert.
Now coming to the score, for ambiance it will get 5/5 . Though sometimes music pitch was too high, I personally think that they should work on there sound system. The choice of music was perfect to create the ambiance.
For food quality they will get 4/5.
In service they need to be more prompt apart from being courteous. 4/5 for this.
Cost to quality: 4/5.
Would visit again to try sushi.

Birthday treats are a great opportunity for exploring great places which are kept bookmarked in our list for a long long time!! :P 
Hence landed up here last week on two of my friends' birthday treat.
Buffet didn't look very much appealing, so went for ala carte. For starters we ordered lat mai kai, crispy prawn balls with cheese and Thai crab cake.. and all of them were just mind blowing!! Lat mai kai was a spicy chicken dish with lots of herbs.. prawn balls gave that awesome feeling of cheese exploding in your mouth with every bite.. And all this took our expectations to a li'l too high level. 
Then for main course we ordered Singapore meifoons, roasted duck hokchoy and lamb massaman curry.. meifoons were average.. lamb was ok.. and then disappointment creeped in.. the duck was the costliest and the most disastrous dish that day.. had a weird burnt n not-so-fresh smell! 
Ambience is undoubtedly beautiful.. waiters are very courteous.
Overall, it's a good place serving varieties of cuisines with a nice peaceful atmosphere.. 
Had a lovely time dining out there with my bestest friends!

Went for a weekday Buffet lunch at the wall. I had high expectations, and this place sure didn't disappoint. In the vegetarian section, one gets a soup, 2 starters, veg noodles, veg rice, 2 main course dishes and 5 desserts(3 being ice cream). 
Having given a 5 star, one expects perfection, however there are 2 areas where the wall faltered. Firstly, the steamed momo served for starters could be replaced with another dish, or maybe fried instead. Another minor problem is that the 2 main course side dishes were a bit similar (as if the same vegetables were prepared with different gravy). A little diversity is welcomed. However, neither of the above mentioned points are a deal better, and both dishes tasted fine. 
The baby potato served during the starters was excellent. Same goes for the brownies as well which I prefer having with ice cream. 
The staff was top notch as well. They were courteous, kept repeating the orders, and very hospitable. 
All in all, a must visit.

The Wall, located in one of the lanes of Southern Avenue close to Xrong Place and Tolly Tales, is the probably the first name which comes in mind when it comes to an fine dining oriental restaurant in South Kolkata. The Wall had always been my personal favourite for its authentic dishes and of course the stunning ambience. The Wall has always been innovative with its menu and had come up with various food festivals. Recently, I was invited here for the inauguration of Thai Food Festival. Well, speaking of the ambience and decor, a path laid with pebbles leads to the entrance from the main road. A beautiful black deity of Lord Buddha in meditation sits next to the main door. The interiors are classy and elegant. A golden statue of Lord Buddha in resting gesture raises the elegance of the place. The seating area is huge and has around 3-4 rooms to accommodate many customers at a time.

Placed near Tolly Talkies and shawarma station. The wall is one of the best in terms of ambience and flamboyance. Coming to the food, we only tried buffet so this review doesn't really reflect other food items on their menu. The starters were a mixture of average dim sums and pathetic cheese and spinach roll. Though little, the main course was a hit. Apple tart was indeed a good end to the average buffet.

The Great Wall (of China) be so majestic and vast! Oh. Sorry.
I mean The Wall (of Southern avenue) is so majestic with wide range of delicacies. :)
Tbh, I wanted to try Japanese cuisine for a long time and this was the place that came up.
Now wouldn't you feel wonderful when you wanna have Japanese vibes and you enter this place that lures you in with Japanese traditional flute music ? I did. That was the first strike of awesomeness.
Crossing the buffet section, we were brought to a place that has those low tables and seats (Japanese style again) and those grazed glass sliding doors. Entire place is flamboyantly ambient.
Times when your imagination gets a touch of reality, even a lil' bit, you can't help but be impressed.
The main part. Yes. The dishes.
It was like a theatre. Not only the dishes were beauty on a plate, but they excelled in taste too.
Fortunately, we got such an amiable staff who responded to every whimsical and curious questions of ours with a peck of smile and explained like a Sensei (Jap for teacher). x'D
We started with 'Yakitori', a Jap style grilled chicken skewers but with skin. Grilled to perfection, this secretes juices with every bite you take.
Then came the 'Nigiri Sushi', which had four choices of filling- salmon, tuna, prawn and crab. Since it was our first time to Sushi palace, we were warned if we could handle raw fishes or instead go for boiled prawn or crab as novices. We chose prawn.
Wow. Just the presentation. The contrast of colours! White rice with veg and prawn stuffings, served with pink coloured ginger, green ball of mustard and a Jap soya sauce as a dip on a wooden oval plate - Treat to eyes! Not only that, a plate accompanied them with complementary tuna and salmon to try a bite. x'D
'Egg Wrapped Fried Rice', the show still goes on. A fluffy yellow dome, you pierce and it explodes to fried rice with meats and veggies.
Along with that 'Japanese Mild Spicy Chicken with Siachir Chilli Sauce' delectably covers your palate to provide a completely harmony.
Been long, since I enjoyed a meal beyond satisfaction.
Need I say more ?
Just go there. The Wall, stands out like The Great Wall of China in the battlefield of Chinese and Japanese cuisine or Pan Asian to be precise.
I'm going to participate again! (:

Heard a lot about this place. Finally went there on Saturday for a buffet lunch with one of my friends. In starter there were items of fish and chicken and chicken dimsum. The fish and dimsums were really tasty.
In the main course there was hakka noodles, chicken fried rice and there was a preparation of chicken, fish, lamb and prawn. The prawn and noodles were good but I didn't like the rest of the items. There were 4types of desserts which were also not upto the mark.

Will keep this one short and simple, so here goes: Service is really good, staff are very polite, food is decent(try the crispy chicken hunan style) just wish that in the buffet they would hav more items but for 362 bucks(inclusive of taxes) I cant complain much! Nice place to have a bite if you guys are around.

Having heard so much about the place, The Wall was on top of my places to eat list! 
The entrance was cute with the walkway neatly done and the sleeping Buddha to greet you as soon as you step in! The ambience was easy on the eyes and music serene. However the place looked considerably small. 
Coming to the food: 
Sushi is always expensive regardless! 
Chinese was on my palette. Nasi Goreng is a complete show stopper! It's food on its own! I din need any other dish to side it! However I did order the 10 vegetable pan fried noodles which was just another pan fried noodles from any other place! The conjee crispy lamb was spicy which it shouldn't have been. Overall it was good but disappointing when you have your hopes pinned high and know that this place has a 4.3 rating. However, the sushi could be crowd puller. 
One liner: The wall has crevices, though it's still holding strong :)

An authentic continental restaurant in the city. However, many people will not like it as the particular toungh taste is not there which we bengalies especially like. I have ordered for susi platter and squid platter. If you are accustomed to those then only order. Othewise it will be a trouble for you. The ambiance is awesome and also the service.

My absolute favourite place in Kolkata to try authentic pan asian cuisine. Not your standard "multicuisine" food which generally turns out to be one big jumble of nothing so great. The Wall has won me over with finger licking food, great ambience and out of this world friendly and well informed service. It definitely is not easy to win me over, but these guys have managed to do just that!

Went for dinner on a Monday, got a table as it was quite empty. The ambiance transports one to a buddhist monastery with soft music of bells, gongs etc. There is buddha statue at the entrance as well as a fountain. Red and black colours spread all over the place.We ordered crispy prawn cheese balls served with fried noodles which was a delight to eat, noodles were perfect as was the  cheesy middle prawn balls with the sauce. Next we ordered Nigiri sushi, the waiter was very helpful in guiding us choose the sushi and ways to combine and eat it as well. It was my first sushi experience and the fish was really well marinated to go with sticky rice and wasabi and the sauce. Liked all the fish varieties of salmon, crab stick, prawn and tuna.For main course ordered chicken in bulgogi sauce, Chahan and Chicken Hot Basil Noodles.The chicken bulgogi was spicy and went well with noodles which had varied veggies. The chahan tasted different as suggested by the waiter and was a stand alone dish. In all, we liked the ambiance and the caring staff and overall the food served both in terms of quantity and quality was fabulous. Would come back to try their buffet as well as other on menu.

The WALL, a restaurant which is synonymous with quality and elegance. Located close to Xrong Place, there might be very few foodies who may not be aware of its existence. Serving affordable buffet comprising of some lipsmacking dishes all throughout, this restaurant has already proven their worth in our hearts and mind. The Chef is a well acclaimed personality and has wide experience in global cuisine. The interior is quite spacious with comfortable sitting all around. 

The interior is beautifully decorated with lights all around. The paintings, the statues, the feeble yet the powerful light coming through the transparent walls added a magnificent hue to the atmosphere. Decked with comfortable sofas all around, this place truly offers you a world class ambiance at a meager compensation listed against their delicious food offerings. 

The service is straight up to the mark right from noticing what needs to be replenished in the buffet to which guest may need filling up his glass of water! We were invited here as a part of our group ‘Panchphoron’ for a food tasting event of their recently launched Thai Food Festival. And I must say, I was delighted that I came over here. The quality, the quantity, the food, the service, the ambiance, the atmosphere, the vibe; every little thing added to our experience and made it a memorable one! 

Following is a brief list of what were in store for us. Starting from traditional dumplings, to flavored rice, the menu covered extensively the likes of crispy vegetables to stuffed chicken to Prawns, ducks, fish, crabs, lambs in delicious curries. Not to forget the vegetarian options comprising of exotic vegetables followed by desert resembling Thai heritage.

Starter (Non Vegetarian)

1) Sakhu Sai Moo (Tapioca Dumpling Stuffed with Pork & Peanut)

2) Pandan Gai (Pandan Leaf Stuffed Chicken)

3) Satay Pla (Fish Satay with Peanut Dip)

4) Chow Tom (Minced Prawn Lemon Grass)

Starter (Vegetarian)

5) Toong Tong (Crispy Vegetable Money  Bag)

6) Tod Man Khao Pod (Corn Fritters)

7) Hei Phad Prik Heang (Stir Fried Water Chestnut & Cashew Nut)

Main Course (Non Vegetarian)

8) Khamin Goong (Prawn in Turmeric Curry)

9) Gaeng Pet Ped Yang (Roasted Duck in Red Curry)

10) Gaeng Garce Pla (Fish in Yellow Curry)

11) Pu-Pad-Prik Thai Dum (Stir Fried Crab in Black Pepper Sauce)

12) Poo-Phad-Prik-Yang (Crab Meat with Roasted Curry Paste)

13) Nong-Kae-Kub-Hora Palae Prick (Lamb Shank in Chilli Basil Sauce)

14) Ho-Mok-Pla (Steamed Curry Fish Served on Banana Leaf)

Main Course (Vegetarian)

15) Pad-Pal-Ruam Mit (Thai Vegetable Delight)

16) Phad Kra Prao Khao Phad Warn (Stir Fried Morning Glory)

17) Pad Preau (Thai Sweet & Sour Vegetable)

Rice

18) Khao-Pad-Curry Gai (Non Vegetarian) (Thai Vegetable Rice with Curry Flavor)

19) Khao-Pad-Supprot (Thai Pineapple Rice)

20) Thai Jasmine Rice

Dessert

21) Tub Tin-Grob (Jellied Water Chest in Coconut Milk)

22) Khao Neeo Mamuang (Sticky Rice with Mango)

Let us not be fooled with this extensive list. Each and every item they had to offer was prepared with utmost simplicity. Its like having a meal back at your home. The chef knows what he is doing and knows what might suit the palette of his customers. The service, as said before is top notch and other than may be shelling a few bucks, there is hardly anything you could complain about this place. A must visit restaurant for every foodie, I surely would keep this in my list for a revisit for its sheer brilliance.

SAVOUR THAINESS ( THE THAI FESTIVAL) is currently going on for a duration of 3rd to 19th June at THE WALL PAN ASIAN RESTAURANT and for the launch of the menu PANCH PHORON group members were called so the experience of authentic asian food was the motive of the day and for that we were guided to the place of the lay out of food from the entrance .As we were inside ,the place looked magnificient and very calm and soothing atmosphere was maintained and observed here making eating experience nice and comforting. The interior and and decor takes you to a proper asian place with its lights and chandeliers dim and nice,  the blue led light on the floor is very eye catching as a glass structure you can stand on also is very creative.Seening the tables and seating arrangements one can easily feel very relaxed as the restaurant has available tables for almost everyone during peak hours too who drops in and hygiene is maintained overall ,very well organised too.I liked all the wall paintings and statues signifying the cultural roots of the food in this restaurant which is what every authentic restaurant should do ,make you feel you have entered a place what you have expected it to be. Every culture has its own signature style and values which is displayed and shown on its food making style and taste .Thai food as most of us know is the main food of THAILAND so people in Kolkata usually dont get to eat authentic food for a good price that suits ones pocket compared to the 5 star properties ,the saviour always has it mention when there is no scope and THE WALL is doing that spreading the beauty of THAI CUISINES. So how to get here if you are looking to visit this place any time soon ,well its very convieniently located near southern avenue post office area and if you live near south then you wont have a problem as its a well known restaurant .Now what exactly is the menu holding this time is a long list of food which are - 

NON VEG STARTERS - SAKHU SAI MOO which is a pork dumpling made with peanut & in tapioca way ,PANDAN GAI which is Chicken made in pandan leaves ,SATAY PLA which is Fish and served with a dip of peanut mixture,CHOW TOM which is Prawn minched with lemongrass and served in  a tray .

VEGETABLE STARTERS -TOONG TONG is a money bag shaped fried snack made with the same way like wantons are made and stuffed with veggies,TON MAN CORN FRITTERS is a crispy fritters made with corn and yellow in colour,HEL PAD PRIK HEANG was a curry made in vegetables with water chest nut and cashew nut.

MAIN COURSE NON VEG - KHAMIN GOONG was a turmeric curry stuffed with prawns and yellow in colour,GAENG PET-PED YANG was a red curry dish and had a roasted duck pieces cooked in it ,GAENG GARCE PLA was a yellow colour curry stuffed with fish and had a strong aroma to tempt for,PU PAD PRIK THAI DUM was the crab curry made with a lot of pepper and black sauce,POO PAD PRIK YANG was crab meat roasted in a curry paste,NONG KAE KUB HORA POLAI PRICK was a lamb cooked in chilli basil sauce,HOK MO PLA was a fish curry steamed way and served on a banana leaf .

VEGETABLE MAIN COURSE - PAD PAK RUIM MIT was a vegetable side dish made with all vegetables in a thai style,PHAD PRAO KHAO PHAD WARN was a vegetable dish in a stir fry way,PAD PREAU was another vegetable dish sweet & sour thai style.

RICE - PHAO KHAD CURRY GAI was a vegetable rice made in thai style,KHAO PAD SUPPROT was pineapple rice tasted sweet and little sour and the colour was yellow,JASMINE RICE was made with the aroma of jasmine Thai style

DESSERTS - TU TIN GROB was a coconut water milk served in small cups filled with small jelly like soft eatable dessert,KHAO NEEN MAMAUANG was a sticky rice and serevd with mango pieces on it .

Well these were the THAI FESTIVAL menu available however apart from these we tried the regular buffet menu which was CHICKEN TOM YUM SOUP,SAGO MANGO COCONUT,MOCHA MOUSSE,FISH YELLOW CURRY,MIXED VEGETABLE GREEN CURRY,CORN AND GREEN PEAS IN CHILLI GARLIC SAUCE,PINEAPPLE RICE,VEGETABLE HAKKA NOODLES,CHICKEN DIMSUM ,CHICKEN ASSORTED PEPPER,VEGETABLE SPRING ROLL,TOD MAN KHAO POD.

SO all these were very good from one from another and it kept a certain standard and authenticity in the food manner to overall presentation ,so its a must visit especially during this THAI FOOD FESTIVAL time as you will get a good value and have a great time feasting here.

Nice place ..You're welcome with special Chinese tea with a catching aroma! The food is prepared with great care and with the priority to be wholesome and full of flavours. The tofu in black bean sauce was just incredible. The Darsaan was just too good which was accompanied by a nice big scoop of rich, creamy vanilla Icecream topped with honey and sesame seeds. With soft music in the ears and great ambience, this place is perfect for families, friends and basically all kinds of people to hang out with.:)

A really nice experience... preety valuable hospitality.... The decor is very decent with a classy touch to it.... In simple words the food is preety tasty... The non veg sushi platter with wasabe paste and pickled ginger is quite an eye appealing and tasty product... Chinese and Japanese is more recommended than thai... The steam boat as a main course in highly recommended... A very new style of presenting food that is enjoyed even by the guests... The staff was really presentable and free to get into a discussion...
Overall a good experience... highly recommended if someone tries to consume something out of the track leaving behind China town and mainland China. ....

Definitely one of the finest chinese restaurants in town.went there on a sunday afternoon so settled for weekend lunch buffet.It includes soup, chicken ,dimsums, fish, mutton , lamb ,prawn.all the dishes were cooked to perfection. so basically for 715(inclusive of taxes) it is a win-win situation for the customers.torino teriyaki that was a chicken starter deserves special mention.it was juz instantly  melting in the mouth.The dessert section could have been better.it includes one or 2 pastries ,darsaan and mediocre quality butterscotch ,chocolate and vanilla flavoured icecreams.will definitely go back to try their ala carte menu.
P.s a must visit for all the chinese lovers.

The Oriental-speciality restaurant, The Wall is a place where you’ll get to taste exotic dishes,,, like Nigiri Sushi, Maki Roll, Teriyaki nd dim sums,,, which one normally finds in 5* hotels,,, but not that expensive...... Their offerings are delicious,,, nd if you have a weakness for Japanese food,, you could try the Tempura Platter, Miso Soup with Tofu, assorted Sushi and Grilled Chicken Teriyaki.... Popular in the Chinese menu are the Sui Mai, Crab Claws, Crab Rangoog nd Chicken Soong, Fish in Spicy Oyster Sauce nd the Barbecue Pork Chops.... They had introduced Bento Boxes in both veg nd non-veg options,,,, but unfortunately nd surprisingly these Bentos are not meant for takeaways....

I find this is one of the best Chinese that I have had in Kolkata. Though there are bigger names for chinese in Kolkata but The Wall is definitely right at the top. "Authentic yet Indian" is the  perfect three words to describe the chinese food here. Thumbs up to the place also for the ambience and soothing music that they play in the background.

My second visit to The place and I must say that this place is "beyond under a shadow of all doubts"....one of the best, if not the best, in Kolkata serving Oriental cuisine. The ambience is excellent with some amazing oriental music being played. We felt transported to a different world, a world with no hurries, no tensions.....an amazingly peaceful world that The Wall houses within its four walls. The service and the behaviour of the staff is beyond compare. The standards that they set are there for everyone to see, to learn and to follow.
The food was so refreshing.....so delectable...every bit of it. We ordered Prawn Chilli Basil Sauce and Zhang Jiao as starters. The prawn chilli basil sauce and the zhang jiao was finished no sooner was it served. The list of starters that they provide is very different to the mundane list of starters that most restaurants in Kolkata have to offer. For the main course, we ordered Hot Basil Noodles, Chahaan, Prawn Bulgogi, Japanese Mild Spicy Chicken with Sirachi Chilli Sauce and Four treasure Vegetables Hunan Style.
Each and every item was unique in the truest sense. We signed off in style with the desserts providing the icing on the cake. All the dishes had something different to offer, making this meal one of the best in recent memory. 
Great going and keep it up to the management of The Wall.

I have been to the Wall thrice and each time, I have been bowled over by the awesome food. The extensive variety of authentic chinese food at its best arouses the foodie in you!! Among the soups, I would recommend chicken lung fung soup and chicken lemon coriander soup. The other starters which I loved were Ebi fry, pan-fried fish with crispy leeks, crispy duck five spice, congee crispy lamb and crispy prawn balls with cheese which I highly recommend. The main course favourites are egg wrapped fried rice ( a classic), that pan kai, gung bao prwan, japanese mild spicy chicken witj sirachi chilli sauce and sliced lamb in hong kong style. Among the desserts, I have only tried darsaan each time..so can't comment about the others!! The staff are very polite and helpful and service is commendable. Kudos to the chefs and the management!!

One of the finest restaurants in South Kolkata, The Wall simply amazed me with its sober ambiance, delectable buffet and courteous staff members. If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, then The Wall is the apt place for you. The buffet no doubt is excellent with varied starters and the main course too is brilliant. Loved the chivalry among the waiters, who ensured that every diner was given utmost priority.
The only problem is that the buffet is available only during the weekend and not throughout the week!

An overall a memorable experience!

The Wall just amazed me with each and every thing I experienced today. Right from the food to the behaviour and knowledge of the staff everything seem to be right on the money. I can easily say this was one of my best buffet experience in the town. Mr. Ajit, the manager of the place is doing an excellent job with his team. It was very difficult to find a flaw here. This place gives some authentic Pan Asian dishes which you will rarely find in the town. The buffet comprised of Thai, Chinese, Japanese and Continental dishes and each and every dish was splendid. I rarely give such comments to a place, but this place deserves it.

Location:
You can find this place just a few steps away from Tolly Tales in Deshapriya Park. The other simple way is to follow the Zomato Map.

Ambience:
The ambience was classy and simple. The place was simple, clean and spacious. As you enter you can see a big Gautam Buddha statue outside. And when you enter you again see another statue. They play some good soft Chinese and Japanese music which will give you a good vibe.

Service:
The service and the hospitality has been excellent. Each every staff had a smile on their face with knowledge of each and every food they were serving. They were polite and keen to help you whenever you needed. Truly, this has been one my best treatment from a restaurant. Special mention for Mr. Suresh and Mr. Pankaj who were just too good with their work. And 0.5 points for them.

Food:
These were the delicious food I got in the buffet:
**SALADS**
#Vegetarian Salad: Sweet and Sour taste with some fresh and juicy vegetables.
#Non Vegetarian Salad: Chicken Salad with veggies and spices. It tasted quite good.

**SOUP**
#Chicken Hot & Sour Soup : The soup was decent but not in the level of the other delicious things which we had here. The chicken chucks were good in numbers, but it could have been little thicker.

**STARTERS**
#Okonomiyaki Veg : A Japanese Pan Cake as they said when I asked about the dish. This Japanese dish was superb. It was made with various vegetables with cheese over the top.

#Chicken Dim Sum: This is the traditional momo which we have. "Dim Sum" is a Chinese word. The taste was too good. The chicken stuffing was good and it was juicy which made it tastier. They gave a Black Szechwan Sauce with it which really gave a boost.

#Szechwan Chicken Wings : These chicken wings were different from what we generally eat. The outer layer was crispy and the interior was juicy and soft. The taste was heavenly. The sweet and hot sauce which they gave complimented well.

#Panko Fried Fish : Another Japanese starter which knocked everyone was out. The best out of the best in the starter section. The crispy crunchy exterior and the tender interior was just enough to drool over it.

**MAIN COURSE*

#Chicken Fried Rice : Very light with minimum spices making it absolutely perfect to have with the side dishes.

#Vegetable Hakka Noodles: A bit too dry but the taste was good. A noodles cant be compared with the other delicious dishes they had in the menu. Can be improved a bit.

#Stir Fried Vegetable : Various Vegetables together served with some sauce and spices. Taste good.

#Vegetable Yellow Curry: Little spicy, little soury but good in taste. I am that fond of veg dishes though.

#Garlic Pepper Chicken : White coloured Chicken with garlic pepper. Tasted great. Loved it.

#Fish in Black Bean Sauce : I loved the preparation of fish. The fish itself was of great quality and it was soft which melted in mouth.

#Prawn in Szechwan Sauce: Nothing extra ordinary. But whatever it was it didnt disappoint.

#Lamb in Hot Garlic Sauce: Just "WOW". It was the best of the afternoon. One of the best lamb dishes I have ever had. The boneless lamb in the hot garlic sauce made me awestruck. I had a lot of this.

**DESSERT**

#Darsan : A crispy Chinese sweet dish popular all around the world. Nothing special about it.

#Sankhya : A Thai Dessert made with coconut and coconut milk. It was unique and I loved it.

#Chocolate Pastry: The pastry was good. The chocolate layers were rich and I liked it.

#Caramel Custurd : Didnt impressed me much. Was soft and tender but the sweet proportion was lil less for my tongue.

#Butterscotch Tart : Tart base with butterscotch cream over it. Tasted Decent.

Last Words:
A must go place for all the Asian food lovers. You will enjoy each and every dishes here. Everything seemed to be just perfect here. A great place to visit.

4.5/5 deservingly.

A place for delicasies...Go for the Thai dishes. They have a unique and genuine thai flavour that is difficult to find around kolkata. The food is mouth watering and will appeal to any foodie with exquisite flavours like that of lemon grass and pepprr and chillies and more.. The interior is also well decorated but the service could have been better, so could be their collection of wine. The tum yum soup was yummy so was the pad thai chowmin(must try)
For starters we had Golden fried praws(a version of the famous bengali fish kabiraji) dice chicken in assorted pepper which were nicely done. The lamb items and the fish in black bean sauce were well prepared and could be an option too. The best of all was the dessert..the chocolate hazelnut sundae. The taste still lingers in my mouth.Loved it.

The best place to have an Oriental buffet. They prepare the best Thai curries, be it prawn green curry, chicken red curry or the crab yellow curry, all are delectable. Even the starters are succulent. Even though  I am not a sushi lover but still I enjoyed their sushi platter. The hospitality of the staffs are commendable.  Kudos to the team !!!

Last year in the month of October we visited this restaurant. Ambience is nice, Presentation is good Service is excellent. For starters we ordered Drums of heaven it was quite good. For the main course we ordered Torrino teriyaki, Fish in black bean sauce and veg fried rice. The fish preparation was very delicious and was new to us but the Torrino teriyaki chicken was not that tasty as we thought., but it was very nicely decorated with vegetables and soya sauce, though somewhat it tasted good. The veg fried rice was nice. Lastly we ordered hazlenut chocolate sundae for our desert. It was quite tasty and yummy;)  Overall its a nice place and one of the best restaurant in Kolkata in terms of Chinese/japanese or thai food cuisines:)

After much deliberation my parents and I decided to visit The Wall. A lot of people had praised it and it had rave reviews on Zomato so we thought we'd give it a try and it really, really lived up to our expectations. The service was outstanding. The people were courteous and food arrived really quick. We specifically told them that the items had to be less spicy and they made everything to the T. We ordered the Pan fried fish and it was the right blend of sweet and spicy. For the mains we ordered Chicken Pad Thai noodles, burnt ginger coriander rice and the chicken in black pepper sauce. Also, they give a lot of free Kimchi. Also, since it's IPL season they had a 1+1 offer on drinks. The food tasted amazing and the portions were pretty good. We ate our fill and there was still some left over to be packed. For dessert we ordered the tutti fruity and the fried ice cream and both of them were absolutely spot on. Really, really blown over by the service and the food. Would recommend everyone to give it a try.

The taste of the food was awesone. Would love to visit the outlet again. Behaviour of the staff was also amiable but then they misguided us to take extra food. Or else be it their pricing or the taste - if you are talking chinese these guys seem to be on the way to the zenith.
One thing I must say about their SteamBoat - an asian delicacy is that it must be tried by esp those who are health consious and do not have an oil tooth. For it had almost no oil, hardly any calories but a lot of protein and vitamins in it, with a taste that couldn't have been better with such nutritional value.

Went there with my fiancée and to my surprise everything was top class.
They were very much pleasing and well mannered. More than the food I loved their hospitality which seems to fade away these days with restaurants growing big. Will keep visiting here whenever I can :) 
There was a smart guy who came up to our table and explained us about the offers during the ongoing IPL. 
Sorry, I don't remember the names but you all were awesome.

It was easy to locate as the locality is filled with several new and old restaurants. Much is happening in this area and more are coming up. Never too crowded it is usually easy to find a table. The place has great ambiance once you enter the restaurant. This place is adorned with the artifacts of Buddhism. The place is marvelous and has quite a lot of seating arrangements. Tom Yam soup is real Thai flavour. Pan fried fish, Black bean sauce chicken good taste. We also tried the Sushi which is not so good as expected. So please try only Thai food, not Japanese food. Outstanding food, spacious & clean dining room, genuine Chinese lamps & decoration, gracious service, reasonable cost make this a win win outing for the family.

We were craving for Chinese and finally we found it in The Wall. It was easy to locate as the locality is filled with several new and old restaurants. Much is happening in this are and more are coming up.

The entrance is cool and instantly takes you to a peaceful atmosphere. Basically set with the Buddhist styles this place is adorned with the artifacts of Buddhism. The place is marvelous and has quite a lot of seating arrangement. Each seating is very very spacious and you will not feel the shortage of place anywhere.

We had Chilli Cheese Stuffed Mushroom, Golden Crispy Vegetable Spring Rolls, Ten-Vegetable Pan Fried Noodles, Chocolate Cigar Roll. Everything except the dessert Chocolate Cigar Roll was amazing and we simply savored every bit of our fooding. We did not like the Cigar Roll as it was deep fried and filled with chocolate. The chocolate was fine but why something has to be fried and that too in a dessert. We simply did not like it at all.

All in all it is a very lovely place with beautiful decor and service. Very good food and very spacious enough for our kid to enjoy the sofas. Highly recommended by me and must try out.

I had eaten at The Wall on multiple occasions and every time the experience was great barring this time. The taste of the food is great, don't get me wrong. I had initially rated the place a 4 but changed it to 2.5 tonight! 
To begin with the staff - If you talk to them in English they don't follow! But when you talk to them in Bengali, they respond in English. They were utterly confused about where to sit us and we're mixing up drink orders.
Then the food arrives which is very good in taste. Just the way you would expect at The Wall. Our Pork side dish had multiple strands of hair in it! When reported the Staff made a surprised, confused and sad face. I guess they were really "sorry"!
Finally they offered us complimentary desert due to the hair found, which I obviously refused (such greatness)! I would be back to this place and hope to change my rating again, but I do expect the service to be better!

Nyonya Food Festival at The Wall

Celebrate the rain with the first of its kind Nyonya food festival at The Wall, located at posh south Kolkata, near Deshapriya Park. Nyonya food, essentially Malaysian, is in a unique gastronomic realm of its own – with specific and subtle nuances of tastes and flavors, quite undiscovered still in the city’s culinary world.

Salads & Cocktails Festival at The Wall

This spacious restaurant close to southern avenue takes grub to a different level. It’s pretty hard to go wrong at The Wall, even though they boast an extensive menu. The food here may not be fancy, but it’s clearly prepared with heart. The Wall is a all time favourite when it comes to sating those oriental cravings. Celebrity Chef Sushanta Sengupta flaunts his handiwork and dedication to presentation through sophisticated tapas with modern twists. The innovative monsoon special salads & cocktails are even made using fresh ingredients selected by chef himself.

A lazy Sunday afternoon, and I was looking for a good Chinese buffet joint, not expensive (like Mainland China etc ..), but, with a decent enough quality. Stumbled upon “The Wall” near Lake Statdium. I never knew that they offer a lunch buffet spread, though I’ve been there before, around 4-5 years ago.

Off we went, our family of 4 and after a couple of wrong turns, parked right in front of the restaurant. Technically it is on Sarat Banerjee Road – if you are travelling from Deshapriya Park crossing towards Lake Stadium, it is the penultimate left turn, one before the go-lebanese left turn.

The security guard was cordial enough to help me park my car. It has very well decorated walls and high quality sofas and cutlery. Though, the place is not huge, you do get the hang of a nice Chinese interior, with models of Buddha and photographs creating the nice ambiance.
 

We went for the lunch buffet which was a mix of Chinese and thai entrees, with soup and starters being served on the table. They had egg drop chicken sweet corn soup for each of us and pan fried fish, veg sauted with black pepper, thai fried chicken and chicken dim sums for starters. Liked the rich ginger and garlic marinated taste of the chicken of all the items. Very well cooked indeed.

For main course, they had a nice spread with a chowmein, a chicken fried rice, a veg stir fry, a corn Manchurian, a hunan chicken strips (white gravy), a fish in chilly garlic sauce, prawn in turmeric sauce and boneless lamb schezwan. I was pleasantly surprised with the Prawn in turmeric sauce, to be honest ! ! It reminded me of Chingri Malaikari ! ! Again, all the items were very well prepared. I liked the balance of taste created with clever usage of garlic, ginger and curry / fish paste. Fish was of very high quality, which was surprising, considering everywhere else we get the staple basa fish (which carries no specific taste, whatsoever ! ! !).

For desserts, they had chocolate brownies, sankhya (thai pumpkin coconut custard – delightful !), caramel custard, choice of 3 ice creams(vanilla, strawberry and chocolate) , chocolate truffle cakes and darsans.

A very hearty and satisfying Chinese lunch buffet indeed. With 595/- per head.

I must say, this is clearly a winner in this part of the city with the price point and the quality of food.

One small suggestion to the "Wall" team – it would be great to have a complimentary cold beverage added in the lunch buffet. This is pretty much the norm with most of the lunch buffet offerings, and would greatly add to the good will.

P.S – They do have a bar as well serving alcoholic beverages.

Verdict – Such a delightful Chinese-Thai  lunch buffet with a fairly competitive pricing – 4.5 ! !

I would say, this is one of the best Asian food you can find in Kolkata. And not just any Chinese restaurant calling themselves Asian joints, this place sells some authentic Asian food. From the entrance to the reception to your table and the whole buffet, will give you the complete feeling of the far East. They serve the starters on the table with the complimentary drink and then you have to go and pick up the main course. The food tastes and smells amazing. A huge collection of Deserts which surely get your hunger back after the whole menu. They even keep gigantic prawns and crabs in their main course menu which is hard to find. 

Surely a visit for all Asian food lovers.

Has done fair justice to the exotic far east menu. A little on the costly side in case one is trying sashimi/ sushis but worth the taste.

The Wall is one of the very few places in Kolkata that offers authentic Chinese and Japanese food. It has got an ambience to cherish with your kith and kins. Located on Sarat Banerjee Road, The Wall stands out unparalleled in offering a great time. The food is concocted to perfection. We had crab cakes (okay in taste!), fried basa in parsley sauce (just amazing), mixed meat stir fried hakka noodles (though it is of less quantity, the taste is just mind-blowing), pepper chicken (spicy and brilliant), mushroom with bell peppers in spicy hot garlic sauce (though not in the menu, we craved for mushroom and they customised it for us) and fresh lime soda sweet (refreshing). The staffs are extremely courteous and make meticulous effects to save you from the dilemma of what to order. The ambience is calm and cosy, with great decor and finesse. Overall a good experience. Word of advice, weekends can might get crowded here, so prior reservation is recommended.

The first time we visited this place, was when it opened the very first time. We were not too happy with the food, even though sushi and other Japanese delicacies were served. It had to do with acquired taste I guess. But this time, the visit was much more pleasant and heart warming. They have renovated the whole place and made changes to the menu too. The food was extremely good and the service was very warm. It was a good experience. The quantities are good also and price range is mediocre. Nice place.

okay now I really wanted to visit this so renowned pan asian restaurant since the the I came to know about it and today was the day. the place is really easy to locate. it is located in the opposite lane of Sarat Bose Road post office beside another well known name Xrong Place. the ambiance and the interior decoration was really a pleasure to my eyes. especially the figurine of Lord Budhha at the entrance deserves a mention. now coming to the food I was a bit disappointed as it didn't meet my so high expectations. we ordered for chilli pink pepper and fruit overload. chilli pink pepper was unusual one with a twist of flavour whereas the second one was a common one. then we had lat mai kai as starter which I found too similar to the variation of crispy chicken. then we had nasi goreng with that pan kai and chicken dimsums. all of these items were above average only. the staffs were well behaved and very prompt with the service. the price lies at higher end considering the amount and quality of the food. overall I had a decent experience at the end of the day.

The Chinese is very good and light. Not the general oily stuff you get in most places. Other than that you have some good indianized hot pot and sushis which are palatable. Would not recommend coming here for authentic Japanese cuisine, but to try a more palatable south Asian cuisine.

I went to this place on a new year's eve for a nice dinner and couple drinks. This is one of the older restaurants in town and awesome for a classic evening or a date may be.

Food: Slightly overpriced but very tasty, lamb felt a bit dry but chicken and noodles/sanghai fried rice were great. Desserts are good too try chocolate hazelnut sundae.

Service: Service was quite fine. No complains.

Ambiance: Above average ambiance very hygene good place to have a family dinner or date I guess. Don't go with your friends group for a ramble.

Verdict: Recommended for evening with family or a date and for fine Chinese quisine.

I had been there sometime a couple of months ago with a couple of my friends.The Wall, is a Pan Asian restaurant which covers cuisine from most parts of Asia. The insides are b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l! I have heard a lot about this place and have come to know that they serve great Sushi. However, we opted for the buffet as I wanted to try that out too - Sushi is not included in the buffet.

I was not disappointed. I was apprehensive of trying out the asian dishes at first, but, to my delight the food here is very tasty. Although, the options in the starters and the dessert section aren't too many, the items in the main course makes up for it. However, as I am BIG fan of desserts, I would recommend them to include more options.The staff are very courteous and in our little chit chat, we were asked if we came all the way down Southern Avenue just for The Wall. "Yes, we did.  A friend recommended!".I hear the place serves great a-la-carte. I will re-visit and try that out next time :)Overall - 4------------

The wall happens to be the place where i tried  sushi for the first time in my life, and i was disappointed. I am writing this review after i tried sushi elsewhere because earlier i was under the assumption that probably sushi is not my cup of tea as that's what the nigiri sushi here made me believe.However barring the sushi, the wall happens to serve pretty decent food. I love their steam boats and a lot of their starters.Overall this is an above average restaurant.

A beautiful and well spread Pan Asian restaurant just beside the well known pub Xrong Place in Southern Aveneu..this is one such place which makes you fall in love with them for be it their delectable pan asian cuisines or the warm hospitality of the staffs or the very much apt warm decor with light asian music playing in the background. 

We visited a few days after Christmas so they were having a special seafood festival going on. On the suggestions of the manager we decided to go for a whole fish fried in chef style. Forgot the exact name of the fish but what came tasted a lot like Bhetki but immaculately cooked into crispy chunks of fish meat in a tasty black bean sauce. The presentation was beautiful nonetheless. You can get an idea from the picture better. We took a starter of aromatic duck in five spices along with the before mentioned fish. As for the mains we opted for plain hakka mixed noodles and mixed rice so that the spicy taste of the Pork in Chilli Plum sauce doesn't get overshadowed..(I will surely visit again for their much talked about Nasi Goreng) 
Fresh lime soda kept our meals get going. Overall definitely one of the better places in the city for lipsmacking pan Asian delicacies and quite Value for Money.

Topped off with a hot desert of date pan cakes served with smooth vanilla ice cream .Good food with an excellent decor and peaceful ambience

I went to this place with really high expectations as it comes highly recommended but unfortunately, for my family and I, The Wall did not deliver. Yes, the food is good but not great. The Chilli Pink Pepper and Blue Heaven were good in the Mocktail section. We had the Chilli Pork, Lat Mai Kai and Dice Chicken with Assorted Pepper. The latter two were good. Their Fried Rice is better than Hakka Noodles. For mains I would suggest the Thai Red Curry and Garlic Pepper Chicken. The Apple and Star Anise Pie was, however, disappointing.

The ambiance of the place and service is above reproach but the food didn't quite hit the mark. The price is reasonable for the quantity of food provided but I personally do not feel the same about the quality.

Once again buffet..this time on a weekend. The spread was of usual Pan Asian type...nothing exotic, but food is of good quality. Starters consisted of Mongolian veg spring roll, fried fish, green chilli chicken and crispy chicken. Mains included Indonesian mutton curry, chicken mishu, butter garlic prawn and cantonese coriander chicken. last two dishes were most impressive. Rest of the items including dessert are just ok. Darsan was not that crispy. The buffet lacked originality, but as said before it's quality is commendable and is value for money....I would personally like some exotic dishes in both starters and mains to establish an unique identity of sorts
... otherwise there is the risk of getting lost in the crowd....

This was my old review...I am still not changing my rating ....
Went for a Xmas buffet lunch. Great buffet spread including 5 convey dishes including prawn, crab and pork. Crispy panko fried fish as starter was excellent. Nonveg salad was flavorful. All in all a nice experience - however, the dessert spread was not impressive. Considering the price the buffet is quite commendable.

Located in Southern Avenue, just a minute's walk from Xrong Place, The Wall indeed excels rather brilliantly in its Pan-Asian offerings. The Chilli Pink Pepper mocktail they serve is just 'ooh la laaa!!'
The tempura platter they offer is crispiness at its best. Another thing worth mentioning is their fish in oyster sauce. The place is very much spacious and the decor is also very authentic.

Not being too overtly harsh but this place has managed to disappoint me every time that I've visited. Also, being a major fan of South East Asian cuisine I find the food to be spiced very differently than what you would expect. My honest opinion would be to review the combination of spices in some of your dishes. The location (next to a kick ass pub) and decor are their main strengths and am sure does a fair deal in terms of footfall and revenue generation.

The best place to indulge in Japanese and Sea food in town. The sushi served is a class apart. Being a vegetarian I started with "Tofu in basil " starter. As usual it was outstanding. Moreover if u are a non veg Japanese food lover u can't ignore this place. The sushi served here is a class apart with appropriate proportions for serving of two. Ask for Sushi boat which has a combination of various sushi and maki rolls. Additionally in the main course you should go for Steamboat ( enough for 3 people). The interesting part is the preparation of the dish for which you are asked to change your table which has a stone base to resist the heat of the burner. The dish contains a combo of pork, chicken, salmon, fish and lamb together with vegetables and mushrooms. Additionally glass noodles, spagetti and noodles are added in the mixture. The mixture is boiled for around 15 mins. You may add a glass of wine to add to the meal. If you are a vegan you may opt for a veg garlic rice along with crispy chilly fried potato with gravy. Trust me you will love it. However if you can still have some space do indulge yourself into Apple pie Cake and brownie with ice cream. The desserts are a must have just like a cherry on a cake.

One of the restaurants in the sarat chatterjee the new food hub of kolkata the wall is a great place to dine with family with friendly staff and good ambience it also serves japaneese and thai along with chineese which offers choice and the cuisine and quality are very good. My pick would be lime coriander soup,mixed fried rice,sliced lamb and tutti fruti as dessert.

I visited The Wall during Durga Puja 2015. I was searching for a cozy place with good, no gimmicks food and it's exactly that. We availed buffet and there was huge spread of Pan Asian dishes comprising chicken, lamb, prawn, crab and pork. The food was awesome and hospitality was very good. My five year old daughter's plate was complimentary.  I would love to visit this place time and again!

Last evening, checked in here with one of my friends as we were strolling by. It is located a couple of steps ahead of Xrong Place, if you enter from Sarat Bose Road. The place was empty on a Monday evening. The decor was very nice, and the waiters welcomed us with a warm reception.
We had a Fish in chinese parsley sauce, over a couple of drinks, and the believe me it tasted quite awesome. The service was prompt. The price, judging by the food, (though we had only one of there specialities) is quite moderate. Would surely come to this place again an try their special asian buffet.

When we think of Southern Avenue their are two things that come to our mind: One is the beautiful Lake area and second the number of restaurants that this area has probably only second to park street. Located in a quiet by lane is a lovely restaurant The Wall. They serve lovely chinese cuisine. The mocktails that we had ordered (Orangeade and Fruit Overload) were lovely. I would like to take this opportunity to probably inform my vegetarian friends that TOFU is a close substitute of Paneer which even i was not aware. We were looking for chilli paneer in their menu but could not find it. It was then that the guy taking our order told us to try tofu. We ordered a preparation of Mix Vegetables with Tofu and Hakka Noodles. I can safely say that i probably loved the Tofu more than the Paneer. The preparation was perfect. Even their noodles tasted divine. If you happen to be in this area give this place a try. Even my non vegetarian friends swear by this place. They just love the food that they serve here.

I was a bit apprehensive about this place as my friend did not really like their buffet spread but still I wanted to give it a try on shashti afternoon. They had special durga puja menu which was priced at rs. 750 +tax. The spread was very nice and I was really satisfied with their selection of buffet. The place is minimally decorated and the ambience was quite warm. The staffs were very polite and quickly served us drinks which was included in the buffet. The chicken soup was really the star. The Malaysian vegetable roll was average in taste and after having one we did not repeat it. Chicken cheese ball and chicken tai pei was yum but the fish turmeric was okay in taste. Though the starters were not great through out but the main course was great. Each and every item was wonderfully made and the quality of food is mentionworthy. The veg items were tasty but the best items according to me were chilli pork, crab devil sauce and prawn green curry though so many days have passed I still remember these dishes. Fish in chilli mustard sauce and szechwan chilli chicken was also good along with the fried rice and noodle. Then again the dessert section was a bit disappointment as it was not an innovative spread. Desserts being my favourite part in any buffet I look forward to it but the only item which was yum to the core was the hot chocolate soufflé as the chocolate inside was practically oozing out. The Darsaan and ice creams were usual but the worst dish of the buffet was the lemongrass creme brulee (worst brulee I had). Nevertheless one of my puja lunch was quite enjoyable and I would come back to try their other items. The rating is solely because of their main course items.

Beautiful place. You might think that this place is expensive but absolutely not. It is reasonably priced. The food being brilliant and the Bhetki Fillet in Parsley sauce, Cheese and Prawn Balls are amazing. The sweet and chilli dip that they serve will compel you to eat the prawn balls more than you can fit in your stomach. The Chicken Lat mein Kai is absolutely stunning as well. And if you have a sweet tooth then you should go for the Nolen Gur ice cream. Beautiful place to visit with your friends and family.

The wall is one name that's been around for sometime in my house in Kolkata but we were not able visit due to my infrequent presence in the country. 

To begin with, I was skeptical more so after having eaten at places like Ocean Basket (Mauritius). But be it their sushi, thai green curry, to their buffet menu, I leave with a stomach and heart overfilled with joy. Special mention for their Lamb in szechwan sauce. Perfect match of aroma and taste. You tend to be more hungry for it after you have it. 

Ambience is decent and staff very cooperative. I recommend The Wall whole heartedly

Located on the road just opposite the Airtel Shop on Lansdowne, The place is not difficult to spot as the entrance is very unique. The Wall is one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. It serves both Chinese and Japanese although we only ordered Chinese dishes. The decor and the seating arrangements were good but I found it uncannily similar to another Chinese restaurant in South Kolkata, Krystal Chopsticks. We ordered 

Chicken in choice of sauce (Rs 385)

Mixed Chilli Garlic Noodles (Rs 405)

Chicken Chinese Fried Rice (Rs 315)

Mixed Chinese Fried Rice (Rs 345)

Crispy Fried Fish in Parsley Sauce (Rs 425)

Vegetable Hakka Noodles (Rs 325) and 

Nasi Goreng (Rs 335)

There is no complain about the quality or the quantity of the food but I would rate this restaurant 4 stars only because the Mixed Chilli Garlic Noodles was more like American Chopsuey. I don't know whether they served a wrong dish or not but this was definitely not good. Nasi Goreng was excellent and so were the other dishes. Mr Ali, the server, was very friendly and helpful. I would love to come back here again but refrain from ordering the noodles again. 

TIP: Try to come come early on weekends as it gets very crowded and you may have to wait in the lounge area for 15 - 20 min

I got to know about The Wall from a friend who happens to live in the building just opposite the restaurant.

I have been to The Wall quite a few times till date.
During my first visit, we had the lunch buffet, which was excellent, especially the Oyster in Black Bean Sauce. That is one tasty memory etched in my mind forever.
That was just the beginning of the journey, as every time I have visited this place, it has never failed to surprise me or my taste buds.

Coming to the restaurant itself, its located in a very convenient location, and the place has sufficient seating arrangements, so you rarely have to wait to get a table. The ambiance is decent, with good mood lightning.

The food is definitely the highlight here, its downright excellent. Pretty much every dish I ordered here till date, they have not messed up any of it.

Pricing is a bit on the higher side though, keep that in mind while visiting.

I will definitely keep on visiting this place whenever I get the chance. And readers, if you havent yet, just go, no questions asked.

The Wall is located in one of the bylanes of Desapriya Park. The ambience is elegant and sophisticated and the waiters are well-behaved. Although when we went, the AC wasn't working, but prompt service from the management ensured that the AC was functioning. Coming to the food, we ordered Lat Mai Kai, Chicken Fried Rice, Fish in Black Bean Sauce, Sliced Chicken with Pakchoy. The food was delicious and the best thing was the lightness of the dishes. The dishes were prepared with very little oil such that the food was not heavy on our stomach. Will definitely be going again soon. Ting! :-)

Ambience superb.People and management very courteous and helpful right from the onset.Now coming to the food - we ordered Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken Taipei and Pan Fried Fish in Wassabe Sauce in starters.For the main course it was Non Veg Hakka Noodles , Fried Rice , Japanese style spicy chicken with Chilli Pink Pepper and Fresh Lime Soda as wrap ups.All the delicacies were yummy.Due to the festive season , the menu was limited.So could not order some trademark dishes. Would love to visit The WALL soon.Keep up the great taste.

amidst the beautiful decor, the prompt stuff and the beautiful traditional puja special dhak music, there was a little disappointment, I. e the food. checking the grave reviews on zomato, with high hopes, I went there, but don't know what went wrong, may be rush of puja. apart from the starters especially the drums of heaven, and the dunstan mostly because it was way too sweet for my palate, I return with no other dish taste in my mouth. with fried rice, the rice went terribly wrong, may be bit old to use, the prawn was way too indian, though I am not complaining, but seriously, I thought it was pan Asian, the chilly fish was insignificant, and the crab, it was just another dish to lengthen the menu. in desert the cake was way too dry nd a sweet dish was there, which may be as old as a chivas regal, but doesn't taste like it.
now it's evident that I don't like the place, but still being optimistic about it, and would like to visit after the puja, in a non festive day, so that I may say, that it was just a bad day during the puja, it's not always.

We visited this pan Asian restaurant on saptami afternoon and we went for the Pujo buffet which was priced at rs750(exclusive of taxes).  The ambience and the decor of this place is commendable and the staff were very helpful and cooperative. Now coming to the food, the fish that they had prepared for the main course tasted horrible along with the burnt garlic rice which was abit hard!  Apart from these two dishes, the chicken taipae and the grilled chicken in potato stick stole the show for me along with the pork and the crab dishes!  For this price, i felt that they could have done abit better with the buffet especially in the deserts section!

Tried the puja buffet on saptami. In the Cheese ball onion taste was overwhelming the cheese flavour. Fish turmeric was bland and poor fish quality. Soup and chicken Taipei was out of this world. Again burnt garlic rice had an overwhelming smoky flavour. Noodles was palatable. Fish in chilli mustard sauce had a unique taste and quality of fish was better.  Other dishes were not unique or great. Prawn green curry was cooked in coconut milk and had a distinct flavor.  Darsan and hot chocolate soufle was good. They served metro dairy vanilla ice cream. Overall welcome Asian experience in gariahat area. Lots of scope for improvement food wise. Ambience and facilities were great. Next time will try their sushi.

Heard a lot about this restaurant so I took my friends today for dinner. The restaurant is very spacious and the decor is quite commendable. We ordered chicken noodles, mixed fried rice, Japanese mild spicy chicken and chilli babycorn. I somehow felt the quality of food could be better given the prices of the dishes. The chicken preparation and the rice was below standard.. Though the chilli babycorn was good... But I have to say the service personnel were really very friendly and professional and they made us feel absolutely homely... My only concern is the standard of the food and I would request the management to take care of it..

I went here for Saturday Dinner with a group of friends. To be frank I was already quite full before even entering this place as I had heavy snacks in the evening, hence couldn't try much of their delicacies.

The ambience and decor of the restaurant is quite good Buddha Statues, Laughing Buddha models / showpieces and Chinese clay models used to decorate the passages of the restaurant. Lighting is apt for the place. There are multiple rooms which enables the tables not to be clumsy which is now a big problem for many proper restaurants and a hallway where the buffet is arranged.

The staffs are cordial, suggestive of the menu and cooperative.

We didn't try buffet so cannot comment on that. In a la carte We ordered Chicken Lung Fung Soup and Chicken Hot and Sour Soup which was quite good in taste and sufficient for two in amount if you are planning for three course meal.
In main course, we opted for Singapore Rice Noodles with mixed meat and Sliced Chicken with Pak Choy. Singapore style preparation is a new for me and I liked the preparation very much.

We had Nalengur r Ice Cream for dessert which needs no special mention as its one of my favourite.

Overall very nice place to lunch / dine. Will look forward to my next visit.

I tried Nigiri Sushi, Chicken Lung Fung soup, Burnt Ginger with Pimento fried rice, Japanese mild spicy chicken with sirachi chilli sauce and Chocolate cigar roll for dessert. I really enjoyed the food. The colors, smell and overall preparation was really exciting on the taste buds. One thing on which they should look into is the ambience which I personally felt was not up to the mark. I will go again for the buffet spread again.

Visited The Wall with high expectation by referring to so many earlier reviews. However things turned to be different. The ambiance was very average if we compare the same with other Asian restaurants in city. 

In beverages we had mocktails like Orangeade and Chilli Pink Pepper. Orangeade is Vanilla ice cream blended with soda and grenadine syrup on orange juice base. Chilli Pink Pepper is an invention itself with chillies and pepper punched with pineapple juice, grenadine syrup. However the drink was not chilled but served at room temperature, this dampened the mood.

In starters we had Lat Mai Kai. The dish claimed to have chicken nuggets but majorly batter nuggets with less presence of chicken and overdose of salt.

In main course had Chicken Szechwan Fried Rice with Fish with Black Bean Sauce. Only main course saved my day. Fried rice is nothing new in taste or extraordinary but fish dish was winner for the day. To compensate they served us complimentary Chocolate Brownie with vanilla ice cream

Staff was courteous. Price is on higher side. Bill for two came INR 1603 inclusive all.

Overall too good and is my all time favourite...just come back to the restaurant, whenever I think of eating out...by far the best Chinese in town and can say this as I've tried and tasted food from ALL THE RESTAURANTS of kolkata...
Whoever did not come here, guys,u r missing out on something....IT'S A MUST TRY JOINT...people I've recommended have loved it...Both from India and abroad(whenever they come down,do visit The Wall)...
Well one more information about this restaurant is that,my mother who is had an operation and can't eat anything apart from dal n rice and is not allowed to even touch outside food as it doesn't suit her,is only allowed food from this particular restaurant...thanks a ton....
And please get the squid as the squid tempura is my all time favourite...Please, it's an ardent request and please do not transfer Joy,the service guy as he is simply too good,nevertheless all of them are equally good...but just have a comfort zone with him...

Just few days back I visited The Wall with a friend. The place is quite easy to locate. We went there around 2.30, as their restaurant closes by 3:30-4:00 we had to order altogether but the staff was quite courteous and attentive. So for starters we ordered the prawn chilli basil sauce and laska gai, both the dishes were really tasty, the portions served were enough for two. While our main course was getting ready we had time to catch up on girl talk and sip on our fresh lime soda. For our main course we had the burnt ginger and pimento fried rice and the szechwan chilli chicken. I personally didn't like the szechwan chicken but the rice was warm and pretty good. Next came in my favorite course, the desert, we ordered for the chocolate cigar role and it was amazing. Our bill was quite reasonable.
Overall the experience was good enough to plan for a second visit :)

The Wall; This place has some amazing food. 

Our Attendant- Pankaj
Ordered for... 
1. Drums of heaven ( tossed in chilli plum sauce)
2. Hot and sour Szechwan soup (Sour n spicy) 
3. Japanese mild spicy chicken with Sriracha chilli sauce ( sliced chicken with crab meat)
4. Chinese mixed fried rice.
5. Blue lagoon 

Everything above were amazing except the drums of heaven. The coating was way too much and was chicken less. I don't understand even after complaining, the answers are like "this is how we make this dish, coating is important..." 
Though the staffs were courteous, but I would have liked if they have remade the drums of heaven and gave me the bone and corn flour with some chicken... (sarcasm)

Otherwise, I can go ahead once again!!!

Thank you

Good ambience though looks small from the outside. Buffet lunch only on weekends - buffet much cheaper than a la carte. Fir starters had duck hok choy suggested by the restaurant - was expensive and not value for money. The tom kha doup was good if you like sweetish Thai soup in coconut milk. Main course was pan- fried and hakka mixed noodles. The pan - fried was good with lots of veggies and toppings. The hakka was dry and totally avoidable. The chillipork was overrated and tasted just ok. Service was good. The restaurant manager seemed knowledgable. All in all I am not sure if the a la carte is value for money though the buffet may be..

Went for dinner with friends last Saturday. This is my fourth time here. Their weekend lunch buffet is very good. Pity it's only for lunch and not for dinner :-/ 
Anyways coming to this dinner... Had chicken lat mai kai and fish in parsley sauce for starters. Both were pretty Ok... Nothing out of the world. For main course it was Nasi goreng, hakka noodles, Japanese chicken,  fish in basil sauce. I actually wanted to have the Nasi goreng... It's a Malaysian rice dish served with prawn crackers and poached egg. Taking suggestions from the server we ordered the Japanese chicken with the Nasi goreng. The Nasi goreng itself is so so so very tasty.... You almost don't need a side dish... But the anyways the chicken was also very tasty... Whitish creamy nutty gravy. 
The noodles was normal. The fish in basil sauce was good too. 
We did not order any dessert because in a previous outing at the same place had disappointing experience with the desserts. 
Overall a good experience... Would visit again.

Try the duck, the Teriyaki chicken (didn't think I will ever recommend a chicken dish, like, ever), the pork in plum chili sauce (*faints at the memory*), and the jasmine rice. Finish it with apple and star anise pie. Trust me, you will not regret a moment of your time. The best pan Asian cuisine I've had in a very long time. Wow. Just.

Me n friend were in a bus going to rashbehari but suddenly without any reason we got down at deshapriya park. It was lunch time n app searched nearby restaurants, n finally decided this one. 
We chose non veg buffet n a pint of beer. Food was awesome. Starters blown up my mind. Desserts are awesome too. Don't wanna use much words, just go n visit as soon as possible.

I have visited the place 5-6 times and I always had a good experience. Favourites include veg sushi platter, chilli basil tofu, baby corn and water chestnut in dong style, veg spring rolls, Thai red curry and pad Thai noodles. The portions are big and are priced at relatively reasonable rates.

The Wall !! As good as the Pink Floyd classic album with the same name ! Delicious food,consistent in quality ,enormous quantity and amicable service define this restaurant . To top it all is the peaceful ambiance aesthetically done.We have visited this restaurant several times and it never disappoints us . Starters that I would recommend- chilly cheese stuffed mushroom ,Pork spare ribs,crispy prawn balls with cheese,crispy duck five spice (and the list will go on :-) ) . Main course items that I would recommend - 10 vegetables pan fried noodles with mixed meat ( a meal in itself ! ) ,Lun Woo Yuk See(pork dish) ,sliced lamb hongkong style,roasted duck hukchoy,japanese mild spicy chicken  with sirachi chilli sauce (you can try others too ,those won't disappoint you either, I hope).Dessert is the only weak segment out of the 3 courses items comparatively. Nothing out of the world dessert items but one can try the Darsan and choc hazelnut sundae . Happy eating !

I went to Wall to attend a friend's birthday invitation. 
I am amazed with the kind of ambience they provide. Now taking about the food, I opted for Chinese preparation being a Chinese lover. I loved the chicken and prawn delicacies. Sorry I just can't recapitulate the exact names right now. The veg rice was okayish though. 
But the dessert took the cup away with their wonderful pudding and mousse preparations.

Yesterday me and my sister dropped by this place in pursuit of authentic pan asian cuisine. And everything about this place seemed alright. Good ambience,good decor,okay sevice,nice servers. But the food though which should be the epicentre of any restaurant was above average just. The food was way oily I mean 3 kinds of food items we ordered and all of them were oily and so today me and my sister are suffering from stomach bugs. So enter this place at your own risk. Good luck 👍

One of the finest Chinese & Seafood restaurants in South Kolakta. It is near my office but never got chance to try it but last Sunday went for Dinner with friend & believe me it was just Awesome.......

Ambience & interior was really good and so clam to have a perfect dinner. 

We ordered starter lat mai kai and still I am feeling the taste. For main course we order Pan fried Prawn noodle and   Deep Fried Whole Bhetki with sweet and sour sauce and it was just too good with his tangy taste. 

Want to visit again....... :)

Terrible experience. We walked in to a half empty restaurant. The tables were not clean and the floor was wet.

Salmon sushi- rice was overcooked and salmon wasn't fresh.wasabi and soya were very subdued and mild in taste. Soya tasted like salt water.
Chicken yakitori- was chewy and tasted like tofu.
Chicken lat Mae kai- was crunchy & tasty.
Pork fried rice- quality of rice was bad. Rice had a yellow tinge which was unpleasant.
Garlic prawns- prawns were rubbery and had no flavour of the garlic.
Pepper chicken -- was a very average dish, something a street hawker could cook up in minutes.

Place reminded me of a run down eatery which is on the verge of closing. Was a terrible experience. Even the valet parking is not free. Will not go back.

A great place to be for Pan Asian grub. Mainly Japanese, Thai and Chinese. It's very popular for its lunch and dinner buffet but my suggestion is to avoid the same as the same is routine Chinese which all are aware of. Try a la carte and you will be surprised with their variety. They use very authentic ingredients and that makes them different. Very reasonably priced and potions are huge. For meal of two I am sure you are going to pack some back if u are planning a full course meal. Run by 'savourites' of 6 Ballygunge Place fame, the place is a must visit for Asian food lovers. By the way do not miss their Sushi!

YESTERDAY WE VISITED THE WALL RESTAURANT SOUTHERN AVENUE FOR TRYING OUT THEIR BUFFET MENU FIRST TIME. THE  DECOR IS NICE AND THE STAFFS WERE GOOD, BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS  I THINK THE BUFFET FOOD WAS PRESERVED FOR SO LONG TIME OR ANYTHING IS WRONG IN IT AS WE GOT A STOMACH PAIN AND FILLED VERY MUCH UNCOMFORTABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER EATING IT.WE HAVE TRIED A LOT OF BUFFET RESTAURANT IN KOLKATA LIKE SARSON,MAINLINE CHINA,FLAME AND GRILL,IVORY KITCHEN,BAR BE QUE NATION ETC MANY MANY TIMES BUT NEVER FACED SUCH A PROBLEM BEFORE.

This place is locatedvery near to southern avenue and tops the zomato list for pan asian delicasies. So visited this place to taste their buffet platter but came to know that its available only on weekends so we dicided to go with with lat me kai for starters and japanese mixed fried rice and japanese mild spicy chicken. Well I must say both of them went really well with each other. For dessert we had Darshaan. Well i had Darshaan before too but was impressed with the amount they offered us. It was more than enough for two people to share n moreover they also offered 20% discount on the billed amount which amounted to 1268 bucks
Overall an experience worth having again

The Wall is quite near my place so I am a regular vistor at this restaurant...have lots of fond and wonderful memories associated with The Wall...It is located in the lane just opposite to the Sarat Bose Road Post office. Though from the outside it doesnt look a very big restaurant but once you enter you come to terms with its spaciousness...it can comfortably cater to the needs of about 50 odd people. The starters here are delicious..Lung Fung Soup and Chicken Lat me Kai are amongst my favourites..in the main course the Mixed Egg wrapped friedrice is also amazing . In general all the items here are absolutely delectable and a treat for the taste buds!! The staff here is also very decent and well mannered...overall a great place to be and simply one of the very best!!

Another restaurant I wanted to visit for a long time. Twice came close to go there with a friend of mine but had cancelled because of time problems. This time also it seemed as if I'd be cancelling at the last moment. So decided to go alone because I was hungry and had reasons to celebrate. Not difficult to locate. After entering you will definitely like the decor. Serves more than 40+ people at any given time. I came to enjoy the lunch and found not too many people were there. They don't serve you buffet during weekdays, didn't know that. The staff were very helpful while I was unsure about choosing the menu. I ordered Singapore Rice Noodles with shrimp and Qhaizhau Chicken without any appetiser. The food came after 15 mints or so. Found the quantity to be sufficient for two persons. Singapore rice noodles - good, you'll be more than satisfied with the quantity as well as quality if you're going alone. I absolutely loved Qhaizhau Chicken. It had a certain flavour in it, might be due to the sauce that makes it absolutely delicious to taste. I was so impressed with the food that I decided to order Sushi too because I could still eat after all. I ordered Nigiri Sushi where they serve you 4 pieces with prawn, salmon, tuna and crab stick. Sushi got served after fifteen minutes. Simply loved them. Specially the ones with salmon, the one with tuna was missing. The maiden Japanese adventure there was rewarding for the taste buds,I must add. Loved the food,servicing, decor, atmosphere . No negative points at all. Cost me 1050 rupees. But you should bring someone along with you, I'll definitely not come alone next time. 4.5 stars.

Went to this place today. We had the buffet. The starters were good , particularly the fish. However the main course was OK. The waiters were well behaved. The desert was good. The ambience is also OK nothing special. Overall a good restaurant but alas not a great one. I would recommend this place for those who like authentic Chinese cuisine. But for those who like Indian Chinese like me ,their are better places available in the city.

After hearing great things and reading rave reviews on zomato about this place, i was very excited on being invited by a friend for a treat yesterday. Thumbs up to the management for the decor of this place. The ambience of this restaurant is of top notch.The staff are extremely courteous and service is excellent. But having said that, the rest of the experience was dissapointing. We went in a large group and opted for their buffet menu. The starters included a clear soup, salt n pepper fish, chicken drumsticks and dimshums. Apart from the drumsticks(served along with sweet chilly dip) all other dishes were simply average in taste. The fish was very bland,the soup was way too spicy and the dimsums were dry and tasteless. The drumsticks were good and the sweet chilly dip was really awsome. Frankly i was quite depressed with the taste of the food. The main course was even more disastrous. The non veg salad was pathetic...the fried rice and veg noodles were plain and simple with nothing innovative...the coriander fish was delicious(the only good dish)...the chicken dish(five spiced chicken),the prawn(cooked with cashewnut and coconut) and the lamb(way too spicy) were simply just off the mark. I really feel the management should look into the buffet spread and definitely increase its standard asap. The desserts however was a saviour. The darsan and ice cream were okayish but the caramel custard was a winner. It was a beautifully prepared dish...all soft and succulent and the custard melted inside the mouth blissfully. Since the taste of the food was dissatisfactory,i felt the place to be overpriced. I am not sure about the a la carte but i would definitely not recommend this place for a buffet spread.

Entering this restaurant and waiting for our seat was a pleasant experience, thankfully had to wait for few minutes. Sunday afternoon around 2 pm and the restaurant is jam packed. That itself is a good sign. We decided to opt for the buffet. It is worth it. 595 plus taxes is good for the variety of food they offer in the buffet. My sister wanted to try squid so we ordered oriental pepper salt squid and it was AMAZING. The chili pink pepper mocktail is a must try for everyone. The little kick one gets from the chili at the end is mind blowing.
The chicken starter in the buffet was really good. The fish was ok type but the vegetable starter was just bland. Not recommended. The chicken soup was really good. Now the main course. The non veg salad was bland as well. But the noodles and rice and all the non veg main dishes were winners. Especially the prawn dish. So one gets to have chicken, fish, prawn and lamb in the main course. Coming to the dessert section, darsaan and vanilla ice cream tasted the same way it tastes every were. The caramel pudding needs a bit more sugar. At least for me. But there was this warm fried thing whose name I forgot. That was yummy. Especially if you had it with the ice cream. So over all it was a great experience. I forgot to take the pictures of the main course dishes though. 
Today ( sashti) I visited the restaurant again and we opted for al a carte menu. Really good food. We had diced chicken with peppers which was yum and tasty,  the chilli pork was fine, I have had better. We took steamed rice with red thai chicken curry and chili garlic noodles. All the food was great.

What more do you need when you have an awsome lunch on a rainy day...at The Wall...Its been quite sometime that i was thinking to visit this place and yesterday finaly the chance came...The ambience is great from the moment you step on the pebbles laid beautiful pathway to the sitting arrangement specially the couches given my love for them :P .After taking almost half n hour to decide we ordered with a few suggestions from the staff who by the way i think has a good knowledge about the dishes.We started with the crabcakes and fresh lime sodas. Next arrived the Sigaporean rice noodles and spicy chilli lamb( sorry for not writing the particular name...i could barely pronounce it :P)....The rice noodles was very light with a tangy flavour that stays in ur mouth and the chilly is really hot :).They have a great buffet too and on weekdays if u visit they have happy hours on drinks....Luking forward to visit soon..Great job guys

This review is about two visits combined into one review. The first time I visited this place I just loved it and so the second visit to this place happened within a fortnight.

Located in the southern avenue, one will not have any trouble in finding this place. The ambiance of this place is also nice. In both the visits we were seated on the innermost seating place which is nice. However on the second visit there were a few glitches. First one of the AC was not working and second from the second AC there was water dripping from it which was not not so nice.

Coming to the food, we had ordered Chicken dim sum, Crispy friend prawns, lat mai kai, Tom yum soup,Szeehwan Chilli chiken and Chinese friend rice with some drinks. The dim sum was nice, lat mai kai was heavenly, Chilli chicken was in the perfect blend and the fried rice. The soup was really really nice. However I was not able to get the steam boat as it was not served at that point of time. 

Overall nice experience with nice food.

We have visited this place around 3 to 4 times and each time, it has been an amazing experience.
The food was very well done and the service was impeccable. I would recommend the lat mai kai and the nasi goreng with the crab meat in garlic butter sauce. 
This place has become a favorite in Kolkata and I would very much recommend it to friends. I don't even visit the other Chinese places after discovering this place.

This was my second visit to the wall. Last time I heard about the Steam boat but couldn't have it coz there was no table available. This time we got in early at around 7:30 and went for the Steam boat. It's basically all veggies and meat cooked in a steaming pot of stock. Everything is your choice... Veggies.. Meat...noodles...

We were apprehensive but the taste was pretty good. :) and it was filling as well as super healthy. Will visit again.

Visited The Wall today after a long long time and I must say I am equally impressed and their standard hasn't dropped a bit(in fact one might feel enhanced)..Since we had Japanese before so we opted for the Buffet spread as it looks quite impressive..It has a total of 2 salads(1 non-veg),2 soups(1 non-veg), 3 starters (2non-veg), 2 staples(1 non-veg),6 main courses(4 non-veg) and 4deserts..Coming to the ambiance it is as always elegant,classy and comfortable though nothing extravagant or anu specific thematic decor, the seating is actually quite extensive over 3 dining rooms and the Buffet spread out on the narrow corridor..The service is as usual flawless, ever attentive and well behaved staffs, just don't give you a chance to complain, they know what you require specifically..The spread tasted:
Salad: Loved the non-veg salad, a cold-cut salad made with fish,it was spicy and tastefull..
Soup: Chicken Manchow soup served in non-veg,normally I am not a big soupy guy, but this actually tasted way better,loved the seasoning..
Cheese Spinach Roll: Again for a hardcore non-veggy guy this tasted nice..love the assortment of spinach and blending of cheese..crisp,non-greasy..
 Fried Chicken with Sweet Ketchup: A crumb fried dish with a strong presence of gondhoraj lemon or kaffir lime..loved it..
Pepper Fish: Again loved the strong flavours of pepper..only felt it a bit too salty for my pallete..
Chicken Fried Rice and Veg Noodles: Both were okayish sort of..nothing extraordinary about them..just the usual one..
Shredded Chicken with Hunan Sauce: A white based gravy,it was way too bland..A white sauce would indeed be non-spicy but guess don't feel any flavour in this one..
Fish with Black Bean Sauce: Loved it..quality of fish was good, a spicy,tangy brownish gravy,goes well with your noodles..
Prawn Yellow Curry: It has a good presence of lemon grass and coconut milk,it tasted quite nice,flavours that won't attack your taste-buds..
Lamb in Devil's Sauce: Honestly I don't prefer red meat other than Pork in a Chinese sauce,but surprisingly this felt better..lamb was soft and juicy..
Veg Manchurian: The regular veg balls..goes well with the Rice..
Darsaan with Ice Cream: Loved the crispness of darsaan..just the right amount of sweetness..Only thing I felt they should have served Chocolate sauce with vanilla Ice Cream..
Caramel Custard: Loved the consistency of the dish,nice,fluffy..also the sweetness was a little less just the way I love it..
Mango Souffle: Easily the best desert in the spread..also the best one I had in  a long time..Seasonal mango itself taste so great..and they hit bull's eye..
Overall loved the spread..there weren't uncountable items..limited items but each prepared with equal care and perfection..making the experience a fulfilling one..Overall pocket pinch is Rs.715/-(incl tax) per head..
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5

Probably one of the finest Chinese restaurants in Calcutta, The Wall not only impresses you by the presentation of food and excellent quality but also by the ambience it creates with those perfect lightings and soothing music in the background. 

Add to it they also provide 20% discount on the billing amount on weekdays wherein lies the actual fun.

If you wanna try out sushi for the first time go for the Asparagus Tempura Maki. It will surely revive your taste buds.

A place worth visiting!!

I visited The Wall for a second time on a quiet weekday afternoon with a friend. It wasn't crowded, so we managed to get a table without prior booking.

We ordered crab meat cakes and pan fried fish with crispy fried leeks for starters along with 2 bottles of cranberry Breezer. The crab cake was mildly spicy, juicy and came along with a sweet honey chilli dip, which complemented the dish well. The fish was definitely a good choice, it was crispy yet light, perfectly sweet n spicy to the taste buds. The only dampener in this dish were the crispy fried leeks. They were bitter. Much bitter than one can imagine. We had to keep the leeks aside and enjoy the dish.

We ordered Nigiri Sushi for the main course. Four kind of sushi came on a single platter- crabmeat, salmon, tuna and shrimp. I am a sushi lover, and found the sushi here just ok. The sticky rice wasn't as sweet as it should be, and the salmon and tuna slices where slightly thick and rubbery. The crabmeat sushi was the best among the lot. I have definitely have had better sushi. The first time I had Futo Maki, the seaweed wrapped sushi, which definitely is a better option than this one.

Pocket pinch is moderate, with more towards the higher side. But definitely a place where i would gladly return for an oriental meal.

Not so great place for vegetarians.
Average food.
Gloomy interior.it feels as if a residential flat is turned into a restra.
Horrible service.u Hv to wait around 20-25 after each course of meal.
N best part is they couldn't get us the deserts even after 25min of ordering n then we cancelled it.

Normally I write reviews within a fortnight of visiting a restaurant.. For some reason, I completely forgot about this one, and its been atleast 2 years, if not more since I last visited the place.. I remember we had a dinner buffet, and the spread was better than Mainland China.. The noodles were great, the chicken preparations were easily one of the best.. The ambiance, I also remember was very quiet and nice.. I look forward to visiting this place again.. :)

Suave decor, light background Asian score and if ones lucky, they might get discounts too. The place can be quite crowded at times since it's well patronized, would advice to reserve tables beforehand

For a family get-together my brother chose The Wall as the venue.
Located at Sarat Bose Road, opposite to Marco Polo in a small lane.

Beautiful Ambience. Golden Buddhas everywhere giving an enchanting look.
Service: Prompt and helpful.
Coming to the food, we tried many things.
We took Heavenly Blue from the mocktail menu and in appetisers:

1)Duck-Its the second best appetiser I liked after the lamb.
2)Lat mai Kai- Pretty nice
3)Ebi Fry- The prawns were fresh and succulent. Sauce was good.
4) Conjee crispy lamb- its an absolute delight! Yumm!

For staples we kept it simple :
1)Egg wrapped Fried Rice- Nice flavour
2)Chicken Hakka noodles- Good old hakka noodles. 

For Main course we had:
1) Szechwan Sesame Chicken- Heavenly flavours. Melts in the mouth taste.
2)Yue Heung Yeung Yuk See- Haha the name is long but the taste is ever lasting. Beautifully cooked shredded lamb in amazing sauce.
The price is definitely on the higher side but I think its completely worthy. 

My visit to the Wall has been worthwhile with these amazing flavours teasing my taste buds and giving my foodie mind peace. 

Visiting soon again.!

Absolutely pathetic! We went for a buffet for saturday lunch. The tomato coriander chicken soup was quite impressive. However the quality of the fish for the starter was not good at all. They had fish in chilli mustard sauce, where the cram was thick. Moreover the food that was served as the first portion was previously made and microwaved n served. The chickn dumplings were good. There was nothing special abt the main course. The only good preperation was stir fried vegetables due to good quality oyster mushrooms n the earthy taste coming frm it. Other than this none of the non veg maincourse were good. The thai green curry lamb was undercooked and the same gravy was used as base for a veg preperation. The mango mousse has a loong way to go in terms of coming close to a mousse.. Although the ambience, music n staff put up a good show, food was a major turn down.. We generally try out new places based on zomato rating- however The Wall was my first bad exp for a 3.5+ zomato rating! 700 something per plate wasted!

I visited wall on my Birthday with friends which happened to be just yesterday. This was my third visit, my last two being in 2011. We were welcomed by a very warm and soothing ambience with light instrumental music playing in the background. Coming to the food; we ordered Crunchy Fried Chicken (staff recommendation), Lat Mai Kai, Nasi Goreng, Singapore Rice Noodle and That Pan Kai (both staff recommendation). The appetizers were delicious with Crunchy Fried Chicken becoming our favorite. Singapore noodles was very light which turned out to be a great combination with That Pan Kai (which was on the spicier side).

It being my birthday, my friends had got a cake from outside and the staff happily obliged to get it served for us. I owe it to them for making my birthday memorable.

Overall verdict: Must visit for food lovers! This place has some amazing pan Asian dishes!
We're definitely coming back to try out more!

Excellent. Be it the food, the ambience, the service, The Wall is top notch in every aspect. You have that typical south Asian cuisine flavour that makes their food one of the best if not THE BEST in Kolkata. Extremely well decorated and and an apt place for a family outing. Went there for dinner with my family and thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. The hakka noodles are amazing. So are the recommended dishes. Truly breathtaking experience must say.

This place is very good. They have good amount of space. The staff were very very polite and helpful. We overshot their lunch timings and yet they served us happily. We went for buffet. The starters were soup, dimsum, fish and in the mains there were chowmein, rice, lamb, prawn, fish, chicken. And for dessert there was darshan, brownie, ice cream and mangoes. Prices were slightly on the higher side. But the money was worth spending. The ambience was also really nice with buddha pics around.

We were here for a college reunion gathering at lunch. I would score this place very high for the reasons below, which I think are key components for customer delight:
1) The ambience is quite calm and soothing.
2) Awesome food...we had taken the lunch buffet.
3) The service staff were very courteous

Would certainly visit again.

Having read about this place in a column, I decided to try it out for my birthday dinner. Its tucked away in a Southern Avenue lane, just opposite Marco Polo. The ambience was quite nice, the waiters were helpful. We ordered vegetable spring rolls for starters, Chahan, Hong Kong style lamb and Pan fried noodles for the three of us. The rolls and the dip were delicious. My parents loved them. I really liked thevChahan also which is a Japanese style fried rice. It was good, different. The lamb was not upto the high standards of the rolls and the Chahan. It was alright. Not bad, but not mind blowing either. The noodles, on the other hand, disappointed. The salt was a bit off and the vegetables were cut too big to pick up with the fork. But, I will like to go back there and taste some more dishes. The quantity they give is very good. The place has intrigued me and I hope they will capture my imagination totally the next time around.
(Really recommend the Vegetable Spring Rolls.)

At Rs.595+ tax, The Wall provides the best Chinese buffet in town, second only to Mainland China, Gurusaday. Finding the place can be a little tricky. Once inside, it's bigger than it appears with two connecting rooms and excellent Chinese decorations.
The chicken dimsums and the fish in coriander sauce starters are awesome. The main course could be improved upon. The noodles, especially. You should not miss the desserts they serve as they are unlike any that we are used to having.
Hope to visit again soon and try the sushi.
A few dish recommendations: 
chicken bulgogi - amazing sauce in which small diced pieces of chicken are cooked!
Singaporean chilli lamb - a excellent starter 
Egg wrapped fried rice.
The nasi goreng fried rice is great but cooked in coconut oil, so it may not be preferable for everyone.

The wall is located in Sarat Bose Road beside Xrong Place.One Sunday Afternoon we planned to go out for Lunch.Already we booked the place for 3 for buffet lunch.The entrance u can found a Buddha Idol and a fountain which looks very nice.The Ambience of the place is very cool as well the place well decorated.

Firstly we ordered a Bottle of Wine for Drink.Beside that we have Thai Soup,Momo,Babycorn.As there is less veg items in Veg,so we have one choice to order . So we ordered Mushroom in Black Bean Sauce.

Main Course we have Fried Rice,Veg Hakka Noodles and Manchurian.Lastly in Dessert we have Chocolate and Lemon Grass Mousse,Vanilla Ice-CeeM with Darshan and Brownie.

Service is very Nice.The food was totally excellent and the dessert ate really Yummy.

Coming to food: they offer nice starters, only hope they increase the variety offered for starters. 
Main course I found was average with not much to dip your fingers in. 
You can freely experiment with desserts. 

I would have loved if they start treating their weekend and holiday menus with more care and variety as they charge extra. 

You can a nice environment and hopefully less crowd.

I walked into the restaurant on the labour day afternoon in a mood to sway out my tiredness with some great food,coz the reviews heard and read about this place!!!

We ordered the buffet lunch.. 
They serve the starters in table which is nice.. Among the starters we had chicken hot and sour soup, veg spring roll,chicken dumpling and black pepper fish .. The starter was hit and tasty...

Then came the main disaster 
The main course.. 
There was chicken fried rice and mixed noodles along with a lamp dish, a chicken dish and a fish dish.. The entire main course was cold and wierd.. Did not like it much...

Then came the dessert? 

Awesome caramel custard
Cake

Dessert was really good.. 
Might not visit a second tym!!

Moreover they provide 20% discount on the bill on weekdays.
The ambience and the service of the waiters were awesome. Like I didn't order for any thing the waiter only suggested and all the dishes were like simply super like.
Now coming to the moktail the one they suggested for my dad, they said that was a specialty and yes it was really special a moktail with a hit of chili and sweet in it (Chilly pink pepper).
Then came the starters all were very very good specially the CRAB CAKE, FISH ORIENTAL PEPER SALT and the CRISPY FRIED FISH IN SPIECY CHINESE PARSLEY SAUCE.
Again the prawn balls with cheese was very very good.
Now coming to main course Chinese fried rice chicken den den Japanese mild spiecy chicken, Mon char chai Muichnay deserves special mention.
After this was the desert Chocolate hazelnut Sunday was very very good but the thing is ' NUT PARCEL WITH VANILA ICECREAM ' was awesome the flavour of it the preparation didn't have any comparison.

I will highly recommend this place, as I am superbly impressed with the kind of food this place has to offer. Beautiful decor with nice and pleasing light Asian music which plays in the background without overpowering ones conversations. 
The food is very authentic and has really good portions. Very courteous and attentive staff. And it is quite pocket friendly too. 
All in all it was a really pleasant experience.

I feel sad that I have been here for more than 6 times but I had no fancy photos. This place is something which is really good with both old and new. Yesterday I went there for spending a quality time with my family . And this place is surely which I will recommend. Starting with the appetisers lat mai Kai and crispy fried fish cooked in spicy parsley sauce. The last one is a bit spicy but the food are just INCREDIBLE! And you can even try their Tom yum soup or hot and sour schezwan chicken soup which is also good. I ordered sushi, to check on how it tasted. It was a DISASTER..! Trust me, if you have tried it once you will never try it another time.The sushi is layered with a sweet sticky rice, then toppings like tuna or salmon fish or chicken even you can choose crab. The sushi which I tasted was Futo maki.Now going into the main food that pan Kai chicken is what I loved here, even the crab dishes are yumm.  Schezwan seaseme chicken is one of mine favourite. Spicy dragon noodles was a dish I will recommend and as I love the aura of basil I landed upon basil fried rice is a must. The ambience here is something very nice well decorated and the small path filled up by cobbler pebbles will really tempt your heart. Then entering there is a reception with a small waterfall which is serene. There are 3 to 4 rooms where you can choose to have your food. Even buffet is also available here. It's something I love from the ambience to its food.. It's really a WORTHWHILE VISIT with your near and dear ones.

Since i happen to be a chinese buff ,i had always wanted to visit this place.. Its location is pretty prominent. i went there at around 12.50pm,hoping that the staff would not be well organised to receive us(as had been the case for many a restaurant),but was Impressed to find everyone ready for us.. 

The staffs are extremely courteous..decor has a unique oriental touch with soft music.. I must admit that this is one of the finest pan asian restaurants in the city..be it the ambience,the food quality,taste and even the style of serving( I Loved it!!)..

Coming to the food,the taste of each food is awesome!! We tried Tom Yum soup,Lat mai Kai,That Pan Kai,Chicken hakka noodles...and all seemed perfect..with good quantity as well..
I would personally Recommend Lat Mai Kai...Its superb..
Hoping to visit again soon,to taste some other dishes,including sushi( which i havent tasted yet)..

You really can't complain regarding anything when you visit the place. The food, the service, the decor, anything. Being in midst of one of the food streets in Kolkata, the place surpasses all. Even the mocktails are better than many places I have been to. A great place for the foodies to visit. The pocket pinch is to be considered,  yet highly recommended.

I'm not at all a Chinese food buff but this is one place which makes me go weak in the knees for Chinese as well as Sea food! A classy and serene restaurant in my neighbourhood, The Wall lives up to the expectations of both new and old customers, all the time! The folks are well acquainted with the menu and are super good at suggesting! I've tried squid for the first time and sushi for the second time here and I must say I was impressed! The weekend buffet is an experiece to kill for! Such an assortment at a very competitive price.

Went out for dinner with my family. This restuarant is located little inside from main road. So not very easily located by a passerby.
Since I was late in arriving, the manager took great care of my family giving them complimentary drink to wait.

The ratings as per my views :

Ambiance : 4/5
Service : 3/5
Food : 4/5

Ambiance was very soothing. In the entrance there is a small garden type with marbel pavements...which is absolutely lovely.
There is a big waiting area and then the rest of the place. Very nicely arranged. 

Service was fine only. 

Food was very muc tasty. Chinese food itself tasted diffrrent. We ordered soup for starter and rice and noodle and 2 chicken platter and darsan with ice cream and Moon cake for sweet dish. The cost was average for 4 people. Not at all costly.

I would really suggest people to find this amazing place and visit to have wonderful eat out experience.

Happy eating guys :)

I have visited The Wall a multiple times. What draws me back there is a combination of food, ambience and service. It is one of the best places to enjoy a proper Japanise cuisine. On one of your visits we experimented a lot with raw ingredients and ended up regretting. So dont experiment if you are not sure . Order cooked food which are delicious as well. Its not cheap but not overpriced as they provide high quality. I am planning a visit anytime soon.. may be you should too.

The first thing that strikes you when you enter this cozy little restaurant, is it's calm & peaceful ambience. The Buddha figurines and the muted gold decor, all added up to the instant liking  I had for the place. The Sunday afternoon buffet was pretty impressive too with a good assortment of non-veg starters and entrees comprising of bekti fish fry, prawns, chicken and lamb. Service too was quite good. I would definitely recommend others to try The Wall if they want to relish some sumptuous pan-asian cuisine on a lazy weekend.

The Wall is a restaurant I've been dying to try out for a while. Its perfect location, promise of 'authentic Oriental cuisine', and unusual fare would attract any Kolkattan gastronome! Unfortunately, the prices as displayed on Zomato highly exceed a student's budget.
However, my sister and I jumped at the chance to visit the restaurant on March 12th. It was our parents' 25th anniversary and we weren't throwing a party. We needed to celebrate, and how better than to splurge on good food?
We agreed that quality was our top priority, and based on the reviews of other Zomato users, we were on the right track. And, Chinese cuisine is the safest for the older generation, right?
It was pretty late in the evening when we reached, and the first thing that stood out was the music. For a minute, I was transported to a bamboo forest in China. It was melodious but not distracting, just like the rest of the decor. I loved that the lights were neither dazzling nor too bright: I understand that the romantic element is an important part of any meal, but I find it extremely uncomfortable when I can barely see whether what I am poking around is a potato or an egg. We took a while awkwardly trying to handle the menu. The waiters were extremely patient as we giggled and frowned over unfamiliar names. Eventually, we decided to go all out with the "Pan-Asian" idea and ordered the Thai Crab Cakes, Prawn and Vermicelli Soup, Japanese Mild Spicy Chicken with homemade Chilli Sauce, Chinese Chicken Fried Rice, and the Malaysian Style Seafood Noodles with XO Sauce. To be fair, they left no scope for complaint about any dish, or for their service. Everything was cooked to perfection, and the quantities served were more than adequate. Personally, I felt that although the crab cakes had a fine flavour, they could have healthier options without deep-frying them. The prawn and vermicelli soup was a little too bland for my palate. I'm a little afraid of Japanese food in general, as so many chefs can turn it into a nightmare. I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the chicken! The fried rice was light, but well seasoned. Seldom have I seen rice grains boiled to such a beautiful degree! We were all taken aback by the Seafood Noodles. I cannot compare the taste to anything I have ever eaten in this city. It was unique, but not essentially in a negative way! We were full, but a couple of items on the dessert menu caught our eyes. We ended up ordering the Traditional Chinese Moon Cake with Plum Sauce and the Chocolate Hazelnut Sundae. A chocolate sundae is always my dessert of choice, and it was happily devoured. I eyed the moon cake : It looked suspiciously like the fruit cake I hate. My curiosity got the better of me, though, and I don't regret that it did. I don't know how the Chinese eat their moon cakes, but if it tastes like the one we ate that night, then they are a lucky people! I'm glad we washed everything down with water--every dish had a distinct taste that didn't need to be diluted with that of any drink. The interior of the restaurant forms my ideal of a space where I can cherish food to the fullest. Dinner for 4 cost us ~Rs. 2500 that night, and I think every penny was well-spent.  My parents loved it, and we were all so satiated that we were grinning when we left. I would love to visit The Wall again, sometime soon, and I know that I now have the courage to pick anything at random from the menu, and know that it will please my taste buds and heart, just the same.

Went there with no pre idea abt the place, located the place via google map. Easily accessible. On first impression , it was dammn impressive ambience. No less than mainland china. Its was weekday lunch time not much people. We took buffet for two. I must tell the fish & chicken prep were excellent . we ask thrice for it. For my taste fish was better. In maincourse food was decent but the crab were utterly disappointing it had got taste of coconut flavor. Which i liked is there variety of deserts. Its was pleasurable experience at The  WALL. Surely worth a second visit..

The Wall, a boutique Oriental  restaurant in South Kolkata is again an old favorite. Close to Southern Avenue, this place has been converted from a residence. The menu here has lot of special dishes normally not available in standard “Chindian” eateries in Kolkata.

The Tom Yum Seafood soup here was tangy with a generous portion of prawn and other seafood. The day was very cold and the piping hot and spicy Thai soup really warmed us up for the meal ahead. The starter we took Lat Mai Kai was superb too. It  was essentially boneless chicken pieces along with veggies fried in a chili based oil.

The Indonesian Nasi Goreng was presented very well with an egg on top and looked very appetizing. It had stir fried rice, chicken and seafood in a spicy sauce, and combined well with Moan Char Chia Mui Nay, a Cambodian ginger based chicken dish. – though I found an overdose of black pepper powder in the latter. 

Apart from this aspect it was a satisfying meal, and cost us around Rs 1400 for three persons.

I love Oriental Cusine and The Wall does complete justice to that. Ordered Duck (dish of the day) and Squid. Both were brilliant. Wanted to try the Peaking Duck but the personnel failed to inform that it was a 3 course setup by itself and we had already started on the soup by then. Only reccomendation would be that it should be mentioned in the menu itself. Would definitely be back just to try it. Also the Kimchi was among the best I've ever had.

'The wall', the name itself sounds impressive?  Right? Off course it is. be it their experimental food or flawless service or innovative interiors,  everything is soo soothing.  We were looking for a place for some drinks and dinner and thought of exploring this place.  Having not been hearing a lot, we were keeping our expectation very average that they managed to exceed. The drink menu had fairly decent collection.  Only thing, they don't have a good collections of wines. So you have to settle for something else if you are a vivid wine connoisseur and would want to pair it with each type of meat. Menu is elaborate with exotic dishes of South east asia. You can experiment a lot and it won't disappoint you. My personal favourite in starter is chicken wrapped in pandang leaves and basil fish. For the main course you can choose from pad thai to thai curries. Very few places where you can expect a good sushi. Prices are decent and will not burn a hole in your pocket.  Oriental instrumental music will surely keep you upbeat. 

Highly recommended for a dinner date. Expect a top notch personalised servicr.

We found this place on Zomato. It was a little bit difficult to find this place as it is in one of the lanes next to Sarat Bose Road. This is a spacious restaurant with many tables, so we did not have to wait at all. One look at the menu and we decided to have the sushi platter and steamboat. The Sushi was decent and though it was pricey compared to other stuff on menu, I don't think good sushi can get much cheaper than this. The Sushi was good and was served with good wasabi and soy sauce. We liked pretty much all types of sushi on the platter. The steamboat was also great, it was a melange of many ingredients and it was cooked just right. All meats and seafood tasted great. We ordered the Chinese clear soup base which is bland and we had to add some chilli sauce to it. Next time we will try the Tom yum soup base.

It surely is now on my favourite list.

Dropped by The Wall on Holi night with family. We went there due to great reviews on Zomato itself, and the place sure didn't disappoint. The decor and ambience was nice and relaxing. The food was exquisite with delectable taste, and the service was courteous and helpful. We ordered a Non-Veg Steam Boat (Tom Yum Base) to get us started, and the main course consisted of Gung Bao Prawn and Pad Thai. Pocket pinch was at a respectable Rs.1690/-, more than value for money. Each and every item was superbly prepared, with adequate quantity and satiated the taste buds perfectly. The Non-Veg Steam Boat was a revelation.They prepare it in front of you with ingredients of your choice. Though it takes a bit of time, it tastes authentic and is quite filling. We had Fried Ice Cream for dessert (on the house), and it was certainly better than my previous experiences with the dish. Kudos to the management, the staff and the chef for making our dining out experience delightful. Will surely drop by in the near future. Thumbs up!

Sushi means Japanese and by Japanese I mean The Wall!
Undoubtedly the best Japanese food in Kolkata! It was a good place with Amazing food! So just one warning to not order much cause the food is super heavy.. After eating just a little you will be full..One more thing wall is famous about is the steam boat ,They actually fry vegetables in front of you kinda like stir fry....Their sushi!! Wow! The Sushi was fresh and of course was awesome.... The Wall is arguably the best seafood you can get in Kolkata!

I visited this place with my hubby during the puja 2014. A nice place to dine with friends and family. Though we had to wait in a queue as it was festive season but they were very much well organised & managed so we did not have to wait for long. The food and service were good.

When it comes to Chinese food, this is a place that tops my list. I have a soft corner for this place because this is the only joint that promised me 'MSG' or Ájino motto free food during pregnancy. Have been here a score of times, without complaints. Their dishes are innovative and succulent. 

For starters, you can pick from a crispy water chestnut fritter or chilli Tofu basil. I tried their Chinese New Year menu recently and the tofu with sesame is a must a try. Main course favourite includes hot basil noodles, three treasure mushroom, thai curry and burnt ginger fried rice.

Though not available all year through, their toffee walnut is a must try. Apart from this, they keep the seasonal nolen gur ice=cream too, though it has nothing to do with Chinese food.

Don't forget to ask for the complimentary Jasmine tea and get a discount from the Solitaire Telegraph card. As a vegetarian, prices range from about 550-600, which is good value for money.

I visited The Wall with a sole purpose of trying out their seafood. The decor is good with lighting just about perfect to spend time with family or your partner. We ordered two appetisers- chicken latme kai (if im not mistaken) and a crab dish..the chicken was tender with perfect blend of spices..the crab meat tasted ok and it could have been lil softer..the taste of the spices were missing.
We ordered chicken fried rice and chilli prawns foe the main course..Quantity was sufficient.The prawns were big and well cooked..Fried rice is my all time favorite so my brownie points foe that too..
Little heavy on the pocket (with alcohol) the food and ambience is sonething you can look forward to!

The Wall definitely ranks as one of my top restaurants in the city. It's been consistently serving great Pan-Asian food, from my first visit. The ambience is classy and comfortable, the staff are pleasant. Quantity and quality of food are good. This is a fine dining experience I would wholly recommend. They occasionally have short food festivals, spaced throughout the year. These are worth trying out. Particularly liked their sushi festival, a few years back.

Words cannot do enough justice to the level of satisfaction, this place provides me and that too each and everytime. It never fails to delight me. The wall is not too much about the ambience...but instead it dwells upon the more important aspect - the food.  Most of anything else you will love the soups here...definitely try the mandu guk...blv me you may end up ordering another one... the waiters are quite friendly and courteous, but thats not a differentiating factor nowadays... what sets the wall apart,as I have mentioned before , is the quality and standard of their servings..its worth each of your penny..and surprisingly it wont hurt your pocket too much either... you can be here all giggling and gulping in with your friends and also your family, as the ambience is such that it somehow caters to both the kinds.... All in all it has veen a wonderful experience each time I have stepped through those foot marbles and submitted myself to the deliciousness.....

One fine Sunday evening , we were looking for a cozy place to taste some oriental food. While crossing sarat bose road she pointed out this place. Entering the restaurant we were impressed with the interior. It was around 7:30 in the evening and crowd started build. The crowd was mostly family people. It was very nice to see a group of senior citizens enjoying there evening. We ordered a soup , pan fried fish and gravy noodles. Soup was tasty. It was clear and light one. Pan fried fish with licks was really nicely cooked. It was basa fish. Gravy noodle was made of ten different Chinese vegetables apart from chicken and egg. The quantity was appreciable and taste was delicious. I would love to come back to this place and try other dishes.

The first thing I must mention is that the restaurant staff is wonderful. Throughout our visit they were polite, cordial, and nice. The service is quick. 
When comparing the dishes to other restaurants, you will notice that you are getting amazing value for money. The buffet, which consists of extremely good food(more on that later) is comparable to restaurants which are much more "high class", and the pricing is significantly less. 
The buffet, which we ate, was wonderful. Available at the time was-
A wonderful cake.
Vanilla ice cream.(INFINITE ICE CREAM, YOU GUYS)
Darsaan.(EAT IT WITH THE ICE CREAM)Crab.(GOD IS REAL)
And a bunch of other stuff with fancy names that tasted like it was from god's dinner plate, except it was god's birthday.

Oh, and for those of you who care about that kind of thing, the toilets were clean too.

TL;DR-GO THERE, EAT BUFFET, BECOME FAN, BE HAPPY.

I'm extremely impressed with this place. 
From the decor to the service and of course the food. All of it ! I'm extremely impressed with all of it!!! 
I love the decor, it's very clean and chic. It keeps it simple yet so elegant. 
Service is really good, well behaved staff and helpful too when it comes to picking and choosing food. 
I came here with my date and I was kind of lost after seeing the Thai section cus I loved everything. 
But I had to choose, went for pad Thai, red curry chicken and Chinese traditional plum cake. 

Pad Thai - this was well cooked! 
Had all the flavours in place. Not too much of lemon grass or Tamarind. 
Red curry chicken - this is something I love in Thai cuisine and I was so happy cus this place did not disappoint me. 
It was very very well cooked. Red curry had all the flavours! The coconut was just right the chicken was well cooked the spices were in place. 
One perfect dish!! 
Coming to the dessert, I was slightly disappointed. The Chinese plum cake was a bit too sweet for my Taste. 
Nevertheless, I'm surely looking forward for a second trip. 
And the billing was very legit. The bill came up 1200 with alcohol and taxes which I found legit.

In one word simply awesome.. I just  cant forget the Nigiri Sushi and non veg Tempura platter...ah divine!!quite authentic representation of Japanese cuisine..for main course i had Korean style mixed sea food with szechwan fried rice, which was too spicy for my pallet...the combination of both was not such a good idea i guess...but nevertheless they immediately changed the side dish for us...so a thumbs up for their service..will love to comeback again and again..my thoughts of turning vegetarian are really at stake with such seafood temptation...

I had been eyeing The Wall since the time I first visited The Xrong Place as the two are located just beside each other. Ever since, whenever I visited Xrong Place (read: once-twice a week), I thought of going there for dinner but i would end up stuffing myself beforehand. Atlast my wish came true and my partner and I ended up at The Wall during their Duck Festival. We went with the motive to try out their duck. Since it was our first time with duck, it took some time to decide and finally we settled for The Peking Duck. It was a 3-course meal with soup, starter and the main. For beverage, we ordered a fresh lime soda (salted) and pina colada mocktail (His Favorite). There was no pina colada in the menu but the waiter was sweet enough to provide us with it. While we sat sipping our drinks, our food arrived. First came the soup. Though it was written Clear Soup in the menu, it wasnt a clear soup. There were a lot of leafy veggies and duck. The duck wasnt boneless. So had some difficulty in having the meat because duck is anyways a hard meat. The Duck Clear Soup was okay. Then arrived our starter, Duck Stuffed Pancakes. It wasnt pancake-y at all. It was more of taco. Coming to think of it, it was actually Duck Taco. Anyways there were four small breads, a sauce, shredded and roasted duck meat with cucumber and some sprig slices. We had to assemble everything and take bites. So i made the 4 tacos by putting the sauce on the breads, then the duck and veggies, rolling them together and taking bites. It was the best part in our meal. We wished we could get some more but since it wasnt a 3-course buffet, we got none. In the end arrived our main course. Rice and duck curry. There was a variety of sauces to choose from for the gravy. We couldnt decide and the waiter suggested us one sauce (i dont remember) saying it would be MEDIUM spicy. Like really? You call that MEDIUM? I had to end my dinner all teary eyed and sniffing. It was, in acceptable language, FIERY! On a positive note, the quantity of the dish was enough to feed 4. Lots and lots of duck in a gravy of bell peppers, onion and that damned sauce. Jeez, it was hot enough to kill. Though duck is a hard meat and it gets chewy, the meat there was good. Not-too-hard! No desserts because the main course filled up my partner and i was too teary to try out anything else. Our bill came to 1700rs. I would like to visit again and try out food from their regular menu but i will DEFINITELY not trust the waiter to choose a dish for me. Maybe then my review would change. The ambience is quiet and i liked it. Nice place to dine with family or that special someone. Cheerie!

this was a runaway date with the unicorn, so we crashed into this place... the serene waterfall at the entrance is a lovely feel...once you enter the subtle yet classy interiors welcome you with soulful touch of the oriental music calming your nerves. Lovely comfy seating with low tables. 

We chose to go for a beer,breezer,chicken red curry,pad thai noodles & traditional chinese moon cake with plum sauce.

Food:: Normally thai chicken red curry is consumed with rice but we wanted to go for something different. A delicate dish like red curry can make or break your appetite but kudos to the chef that the spices & its aroma was totally infused to the hilt keeping the balance such that it hit the palate perfectly . The pad thai noodles too was a bigtime tumbs up with mild aroma & taste touching the right chords and creating a lovely combo.

The traditional chinese moon cake with plum sauce was simply delicious normally the crust become to hard,but out here it was mild and not a problem to break or too hard to chew,topped up with the cherries and sauce turned it into something delightful and not to forget the icing on the cake the scoop of vanilla ice cream along with it.

The staff & their service was top notch,extremely friendly & helpful,very well trained ,kudos to that.The only grievance I have would be against the house cleaning & management, your property is amazing,its a must visit for us now,as we are looking forward to your buffet ,but please make sure the sofas are not torn, the one I was sitting on had its seams torn,it doesn't come across well with your reputation to spoil your loyalist with such awesome & epic food. 

The quality & quantity of the dishes is more than sufficient to suffice for two. Also the pricing came to us as a surprise. 1 beer+ 1 breezer+ Pad Thai noodles +1 Red Curry + 1 Dessert = 1400+ (inclusive taxes) 

A MUST VISIT.

I visited The Wall on a hot summer evening in 2012 April. It was very hot and really needed something to refresh my mind and soul. I am happy that The Wall didn't disappoint me. Easily located on a Southern Avenue bylane - The decor is simple, staff is very user friendly and the ambience is beautiful.

It says Boutique restaurant and I must say the Chinese and the Japanese had a finesse touch to it. The seating arrangement is divided into three sections and aptly decorated. The ambience light is beautiful and the music in the background enhances the overall experience.

We started off with Golden Fried Prawns and Pandan Leaf Chicken. It is one of the best golden fried prawns that I have till date. The coating and the spices is just perfect.

We ordered Japanese Spicy chicken and Chahan in main course. Both were good. Chahan is a sort of sticky Japanese rice but I really liked the texture and the different use of spices rather than regular chinese sauces.

We finished off with Nut Parcel which is nothing but honey glazed walnut and vanilla ice cream.

Overall a very satisfying experience and I would love to be back again at the Wall.

They offer authentic Chinese. Chinese the way it should be. 
I found the price pretty reasonable for the kind of food it offered. 
They need to improve on their pan fried noodles however. The Gravies, for me, were the stars of my meal. 
The ambience is decent. Nothing very fancy. It's simple and soothing.
I found the staff particularly friendly.

Our daughter loves sushi and seafood. So visited this place a couple of times. The decor tries to too hard and the seats are uncomfortable and the lighting dim. Such frills generally signal bad food. But the food is actually good. The sushi and sashimi are good. The rice are aromatic and delicate and meat entrees are tasty and served nicely. The service is also good and the waiters help choose your meal which usually turns out well. The only problem sometimes, are other diners. In this country where some people have little regard for other people's  comfort and space, noisy and inconsiderate behaviour may sometimes completely ruin your mea. But the restaurant can do little about it, I guess. The Japanese are so particular about their atmosphere and their little rituals that one understands why one needs needs peace and quiet while enjoying one's sushi. The decor with the sunken tables and the cascading waterfall outside your window is bliss. The music however was some Western song which was discordant. So was the behavior of some neighboring diners which managed to put us off on one of the occasions. Other times, the combination- space, feel, food- fell into place and the experience was unforgettable.

I had been hearing good things about the place for sometime and managed a visit only yesterday attracted by the duck festival. Nice ambience and the layout is not cramped. Service is good and the staff courteous and friendly. Price wise - not a load for a weekday dine out with business associates.  Being my first visit - restricted myself to traditional fare without being adventurous and ending up with a sour taste. 

Tried the prawn tom kha soup which was full blooded, fragrant and excellent. Settled for drums of heaven - again well made in a full blooded sauce with lots of pepper and flavours. Went on to savour the duck hong -kong style -  crunchy and with all the goodness and flavours of the street food of HK.  The portions served are adequate.
Noted to visit for the Peking Duck on the weekend.

Parking is a bother and suggest valet parking.

Special occasions call for a special place.It was the birthday of one of my very close friends and we decided to celebrate the occasion with a visit to this place which was on our individual wishlists for a long long time.The wait to finally visit The Wall was absolutely worth it as we enjoyed a sumptuous dinner.

Situated conveniently in one of the lanes off Sarat Bose Road just beside Xrong place,The Wall with its overall ambience justifies the boutique restaurant as they call themselves.The interior is very tastefully decorated.The seating arrangements are divided into three sections all of which are slightly different but nice and elegant.The music playing in the background is very soothing.On the whole there is a touch of class in the ambience and decor that we liked a lot.

Coming to the food,we ordered a Salmon Sushi,Thai Crab Cake,Nasi Goreng and Barbeque Pork ribs.None of us were overtly experienced with sushis but we loved the salmon sushi which we got for ourselves on recommendation from the staff.The presentation was brilliant.The taste was nice and fresh.The Wasabi and soya had a nice bite to it yet not too hot.The sweetish dip that accompanied it was also really nice.The Thai Crab cake was also pretty good.I could actually chew on small pieces of crab and that I liked.It was just a little too salty for my taste.The Nasi Goreng was uncomplicated but very tasty.The Barbeque pork ribs consisited of two generous sized pieces and the sauce was extremely rich and I absolutely loved it.The pork was also cooked to perfection.For dessert we had the walnut ice cream.It was decent but not as good as the main courses.Overall we were extremely satisfied with our meal.

The staff were courteous and very helpful.They were happy to provide suggestions but not overtly keen with them suggestions and that I liked.The service was slightly slow but the quality of the food more than made up for it.The portions of the dishes were quite appreciable too and more or less sufficient for two.The prices are understandbly slightly high but for me the quality,quantity and the experience on the whole justified the price tag.

In short The Wall impressed me a lot with the quality of the food and the ambience.This is a place that I will surely recommend and visit again to try the other offerings.
Enjoy! :)

Before the winter festivity picks up from December, trying out the Japanese Food Festival at The Wall was perhaps the best way to warm-up. 

Apart from savouring an array of authentic Japanese cuisine what draws one to the food fest is the Bento Box, available in both veg and non-veg variations. Fret not by the cost, since it can be shared by two. Plus you get a complimentary beer with it, so it’s a steal deal! There’s a special Bento designed for kids too (keeping their portion size and taste in mind).

The a la carte menu is surely a paradise for seafood lovers. Try the Ekkaa Yakumi (diced squid cooked with pickled vegetables and Japanese seasoning), Kaisen Kushiyaki (grilled seafood skewers, squid, prawn and octopus served with plum dip and salad) and Ebi Kimuchi (prawn with Japanese homemade sauce).

If you are allergic to seafood, but are a meatlover, go for Yasai No Nikumaki (veggies and mushroom wrapped in thin pork fillet) or Lamb Butayaki (sliced lamb in Japanese soy, butter and mushroom). There’s Niniku (Japanese garlic fried rice) and Yaki Soba (egg noodles) to go with them. 

A meal for two would come for Rs 1,500 (approx). 

P.S: Don’t miss out on this one, since these is surely not worth a miss! Also, there's happy hours from 12:30 to 3:30pm and 7-10:30pm on weekdays.

When I heard people from Belghoria visiting this restaurant & encouraged by zomato's rating we visited this place. We ordered chicken clear soup, basil fried rice, pad Thai noodles, whole bhetki fried & tossed in oyster sauce, nolen gurer ice cream & nut parcel with vanilla icecream & honey. Pad Thai & bhetki was awesome. Dessert was yummy. Fried rice was ok. Price was reasonable compared to other pan Asian restaurants of the same standard. Service & ambience was superb.

We went on Bhaiphota and we opted for buffet,starters were very good and worth of mentioning about the crab dish which was awesome. However the noodles could have have been better. New time I will definitely try for a-la-carte.

We visited this place during Puja. But since we were not in a mood for buffet, we asked for A la carte, only to be curtly and reluctantly told by the waiter that it will take quite some time for individual orders. We didn't mind(as we could understand during pujas it can take time), but it seemed the waiters were more than just reluctant to take orders. Now coming to the food. The drums of heaven was just about mediocre, but the noodles were below average and so was the chicken.
Previously I had heard many positive reviews about this place, but to be honest I was disappointed.

I have been twice to this place. The place has a soothing decor. though its pretty full even on weekdays, its not that noisy.

 I loved prawn spring wraps with Thai sweet chili dip. 

The pan fried fish with crispy leeks was quite different from the pan fried fish you get at other places. I really liked it. 

The tom yum soup was not a very big hit. I have had better tom yum soup elsewhere. 

What I absolutely loved was the Japanese mild spicy chicken with homemade chili sauce and chahan (which is a Japanese fried rice with shrimp and chicken). The combination of this rice and chicken was too good.

I also tried out their Japanese style stir fried noodles i.e. eki soba which was pretty good.
The staff is courteous and food is served in short time, even on weekends. Their food quantity is also good. Even though the price is a bit on the higher side, the food and ambience is worth it.  Overall, I loved it and will definitely not miss a chance to revisit.

For desert, I had the date and raisin pancake which was also pretty good.

Me and my gf went here for dinner in puja... Have to wait more than an hour, which is understand during puja. We wanted a-la-karte, but was forced to buffet, as they told us it'll take more than an anothr hour for a-la-karte to begin. Except the starters we dint like the other food & very disappointed after seeing such a high rating in zomato.

We visited in a group of 10 during the pujo. We opted for buffet. We started out with chicken n fish fried items. Both were damn spicy and in no terms close to Chinese cuisine. The baby corn cake though was OK. The main course had all - from chicken to veg Manchurian to crab to prawn. But none tasted good enough. Only I liked the prawn preparation. The rest were pretty tasteless and ordinary preparation. With tax our per head cost was 900/- which was bit too much atleas for the quality n taste offered. We could have had a pretty descent buffet spread in that cost or may be less , elsewhere. For me it was the very first experience at the outlet which went pretty bad.

It is situated in Sarat Bose Road...very easy to locate(beside xrong place). According to zomato cost manual of Pan Asian cuisine,it's medium costly (: . Other than cost the benifit of hanging in this restaurant is that , they serve alcohol. As I couldn't find any other place other than Pan Asian ITC,which is most costly pan asian/Thai cuisine,The Wall was my automatic choice.
Coming to food.... they serve the quantity of food which is more than enough for two people. I went there to taste sushi. Started with Martini Vermouth extra dry and my mate 'T' took a large Rockford. Then Tom yum chicken soup came to my table. No longer had I finished the soup than they served Oriental Pepper Salt Squid(which is my fav)..tasty and crispy...just perfect to take another drink. This time Smirnoff large was my choice with Lime Cordial and ice. My partner is no less than me while tasting delicious food,she repeated another whisky and ordered a Chilli Pork for both of us. Now as we came down to main course from starter we are almost full so didn't streach it long and orderd Chilli Garlic Noodles and A Tofu in Garlic Wine sauce. I'm a first timer of Tofu. I dint find it that good but yes people can try if they want cause its healthy( it tasted like boiled rice balls dipped in white sauce and so soft that one can swallow with only tounge). Sadly we were so full that couldn't order sushi ): . But yes Sasthi 2014 lunch was mind boggling as the ambience of the place was smooth with Japanese background music and soft lights.... hope i can go there again soon to taste Sushi. (:

The wall is my new favorite place in the city for chinese food. The flavours are beyond amazing. I went here today itself and i ordered the tom yum soup, it was very fragnant and delicious with a touch of lemongrass in it. I had the sheWan prawns, lat mai kai chicken amd crispy baby corn for starters and all of them were great in both quantity and quality. For mains, i tried the japanese mild chicken dish with chicken garlic noodles. I was very impressed with both. I highly recommend this place to the foodies.

It was a cold fight between me n my fiance as he was stubborn at visiting a restaurant in Park Street whereas I wanted to try out The Wall..and I converted! But whats more important is that at the end of the evening he loved the place. The best thing about this place is the cosy feeling it gives you..very decent and relaxing look from outside, and the warm feeling when you get in. 
We were seated in the inner part of the restaurant where they had a soothing decor in blue lights and relaxing chinese instrumental music. We had ordered yakitori, crispy conjee chicken and Nasi Goreng. And we got what we wanted..a deviation from the regular chinese food, but no compromise in taste and quality. They served the food in sumptuous quantity, sufficient enough for two people. A perfect place if you wish to spend some quality time with good food.

Located in Lake road just beside Xrong place. The ambience is awesome and pleasing to eyes.. The most important attraction though is the Food.. Their starters are great specially the Lat me Kai, Chili pork and Tempura platter. I didnt like Sushi though.. I loved their Chicken fried rice and Ten vegetables pan fried noodles in the main course and the side dishes are decent too.. I havent tried their buffet though.  The prices are on the higher side though but the food is worth paying the price. Service is quite fast and efficient and they serve you well.. Go here if you like Pan asian delicacies :)

Have been there twice recently and am fairly impressed with this outlet. Service is good. Staff is very cordial and polite and speed of service is quite good. Ambience is also nice with the entrance being very nice with a Buddha statue donning the entrance. And now coming to the most important part-food. Do try the sushi's. They are good even though the servings are small. If wanna try rice do try the Egg Wrapped Fried Rice or the Nasi Goreng, both are really good. Gung Bao Prawn and Crispy Fish and Crabmeat in Basil Sauce are both very good. Do try them. Deserts are also good. Do try the Chinese Mooncake with plum sauce and ice cream. The wall is strongly recommended.

Went there today evening at 7.30 armed with a groupon coupon. We ordered the following:

1. Chicken lung fung soup - tasty but nothing out of the ordinary, loaded with ginger which I happen to like.

2. Lat Mai Kai - a deceptive dish of crispy fried chicken that looks ordinary at first sight. But once you start eating it, you get the familiar texture of Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, but with chicken. Really quite delicious and makes you go back for more.

3. Burnt ginger pimento rice - fragrant, lovely and light. I am a big fan of thin grained rice and this was just perfect. Also, it had no carrots or any other such home-style veggies, which I really dislike in Chinese rice. Portion was also pretty great.

4. Fish in chili oyster sauce - absolutely delicious. Not at all corn-floury, and quite tender. Had a nice flavor from the oyster sauce : a welcome variation from the many restaurants where every sauce seems to taste alike. Also, they give around 8 to 10 pieces!

5. Darsan with vanilla ice cream - the portion of ice cream seemed a little less, but mostly because of the generous helping of crispy and not overly sweet wafers. The last time I had this dish was in Mainland China: their portion is quite small and doesn't come with complimentary ice cream. So, big thumbs to The Wall. Both my companion and I were completely full, but we managed to finish it because it was just so light .

6. Fresh lime soda - quite good.

We also ordered a beer ( which came with another one for free, it being Happy Hours ) and it was really reasonably priced. Their liquor taxes really surprised me, as the Rs. 160 for 2 bottles came to Rs. 168 after taxes! 

The place has a wonderful and relaxing ambience. Their service is quite good, except that they served the starter with the soup, which was strange. At one point they seemed in a hurry to serve the main course even though we are both slow eaters. They said they needed the table for other customers. I had a feeling that this might be because we were using coupons and not ordering a la carte. Thankfully, they left us in peace after that, and we finished at a leisurely pace. 

All in all, a really lovely experience. The fact that we got all this for Rs. 649 ( not counting the beer ) thanks to Groupon, just made my day as I'm a big sucker for discounts! I will go back there again, only for the Happy Hours if nothing else! And I'm yet to to try their Japanese selection, which I'm quite excited about. 

I cut one point because of their strange behavior during otherwise impeccable service, the ordinary soup, and because the fish was a little heavy on the salt for my taste. Cheers and bon appetit!

The Wall has got a tagline of being a Chinese Boutique and rightly so. Good ambiance, friendly staffs, great food in a nicely located place. We did not experiment much as we are not too fond of seafood. We stuck to the basics like Dimsum, Fried Rice and Japanese chicken sides, all of which were excellent. Our feast ended with a nicely done Apple Pie and Vanilla ice-cream. The price is a bit on the higher side but the food quality pretty much compensates for it. Good job, The Wall, hope to revisit soon!!

P.S. 
1. The lightweight cutlery set instantly caught my attention as they were very easy to handle. 
2. The security staff was very friendly and even offered to put the lights on in front of the Buddha statue so that we can get a nice snap. I really liked that friendly gesture.

I recently visited The Wall restaurent for dinner, which had been on my wish-list since a very long time. I arrived at around 18:45 hours and was stopped at the gate by the security guards, who told me that the restaurent opens at 19:00 hours. Although I knew the timings of the restaurent, I requested to atleast allow me to sit inside. I was refused and the experience hit me hard. I hope the management would take note of it to prevent such incidents in the future, considering the fact that customers coming to their joint come for a treat rather than sit to gossip.
I waited for 15 minutes and went inside.
The interior of the restaurent just bowled me over. It was splendid. Beutifully decorated.
We had the following from their menu:
Laksa Gai Soup: A Thai-styled soup blend of chicken strips in coconut milk broth, was simply divine.
Pan-fried Chilli Fish: Although a bit spicy, but tasty
Hong Kong Style Chicken with Chilli Garlic Noodles: Combination was superb.
Vanilla Ice-cream with Nut Parcel: for desert summed up my evening.
The visit was simply worth every penny spent.
A must-try outlet.
Rating reduced to 4.0 for the bitter experience by the security personnel.

Service - 4/5

Food - If you're a fan of Japanese cuisine (SUSHIII) and/or an otaku then get yourself a try here. I love how they keep it honest to the cuisine(s) without Indian-inzing the food. The taste is true and authentic and you WILL be satisfied

A great place to have Chinese food. went on a Saturday afternoon. Buffet was available. was little sceptical but when I saw the menu, was eager to go for it. Chicken lemon coriander soup was delicious, starters like chicken chinese ball, szechwan veg toast, fish pepper salt all were tasty. The main course was awesome. Chicken in barbeque sauce, fish in oleander sauce, prawn in hot garlic sauce, crab yellow curry..everything was better than the other. couldn't stop eating. The dessert part had caramel custard, brownie with ice cream and darshan..our stomachs were full, but we wanted to keep eating..a good tasty joint. go there for quality chinese food.

I visited this place a couple of months before and wish to visit again....I'm a big fan of Japanese food and culture.....That`s the main reason this place attracted my belly....And i must say this place lived up to its reputation.....

The decor was excellent.... so was the ambiance....I was more impressed to see that a middle aged Japanese couple entered this place.....This simply means this place serves authentic Japanese food....no doubt about it.....Judging from the decor it was giving an look of a real Japanese restaurant...

The food was equally brilliant.....I went for dinner and i had alacart....I had Tom Yum soup, appetizer, Eki Soba noodles and Nigiri Sushi......The sushi was really exquisite.....The bill was also moderate.....and I heard pork here is really delicious....

So if you are a Japanese fan, even a Chinese foodie, then its a MUST VISIT place for you....

There is a reason for the low points. And that is, they give Groupon deal holders a kind of shoddy deal. They are capable of far better and indeed serve a good meal at the restaurant to regular customers. But the whole point is if they give sub-par food to deal holders, I wonder what kind of promotion is being carried out.

Having made prior reservations we reached there. Managed parking by the road, as they do not have valet parking facilities. We were immediately seated. The restaurant itself is not terribly well done. A large room and a smaller one. The decor is almost functional.

We presented our coupons and were given a special menu to choose from. This contained very run-of-the-mill Chinese food, which is meaningless as they serve good Japanese and other cuisine.

We I asked for a whiskey, and this came in a glass like the ones I use at home. A thin layer of it charading as a chhota-peg. I had to ask for some accompaniments (I Noticed he had it and didn't serve it initially).

We had the Chicken Lemon Corriander Soup. A tad salty but nice, With iot came the Chicken Salt and Pepper. It was just like the Lat Me Kai but with larger pieces. What is the point in having two almost identical dishes in a limited menu? The quantity was decent though. Next was a Crispy Vegetable in A chilli Plum Sauce that was ordered a-la-carte. It was very nicely crisp veggie pieces in a tangy-spicy sweet sauce. We both liked it. I asked for a Fresh Lime Soda as did my wife. It was in a smallish glass but decently made.

The main course consisted of Chicken Pepper Garlic. It was rather awful. Hard pieces of chicken in a thickish white gravy that did nothing for the taste-buds, and just cause some annoyance. With it was a Vegetable Hakka Chowmein. Standard fare, which I think was served in a lesser quantity than what they would serve regular customers.

Then it was time for dessert. The deal said two portions but they claimed it was one portion, claiming the portions were large and people wouldn't be able to finish it. Sounded like a feeble excuse. Well at least they could have given two scoops of the icecream, since it feels rather cheap to share one. We had the Nut Parcel with Vanilla Ice Cream and Honey. The parcels were four squares, each crisp and filled with a pate of date, nuts, sweet beans and something else. Nice, but a sesame-ish or a caramelly flavour added would make it nicer.

Service was fairly decent. I always sense a coupon-holder attitude from the staff in places and it only goes away when one refuses to take things lying down.

I reiterate... I wish they had a more imaginative menu option for coupon holders, one that would actually showcase their specialities, instead of them having to cater for an office lunch they were not being paid much for.

We started with corn pakora and butter pron fry....awesome, then my fav. dish CHILLI PORK....every byte melts in mouth, taste was so supper that i can't forget it till now. Then come tom-kha soup. I tried it many different places but no one can match with this one. Veg rice and noodles goes awesome with their chilli fish and Japanese mild spicy chicken...last but not the least ICE CREAM, WONDERFUL...we are 2 busy 2 enjoy the food that we forget to take a quick capture. We warm thanks to those guys who make moments more wonderful with their awesome foods....

B and I were here to celebrate something special. I was jumping for joy because I was to have my first ever sushi is Kolkata. I had been churning up an appetite all day long, and boy it was worth the effort. The restaurant is quaintly tucked off Sarat Bose Road, far from the madding crowd. There is a sense of zen-like peace as you enter, a perfect place to spend quiet, lingering, delicious moments.
The reclining Buddha welcomes you as you step in. The staff is friendly yet composed. I had been revising my order in the head three days in advance, so it went quick. We ordered Lat Mai Kai for starters, it was good. Next was a chicken dim sum, looked authentic, tasted delicate and flavorful, the kind where the flour outer covering is so thin you can see through it. Then came the sushi, Futo Maki, with salmon and nori and some very cool wasabi. I was fairly impressed and polished the dish in no time. The plating was awesome, with pretty chopsticks et al. 
Then we ordered egg wrapped fried rice and japanese mild chilly chicken with home made chilly sauce - both were quite good, but we had stuffed ourselves by then. However I did not want to budge without trying the dessert, so we ordered Coconut pudding (they don't do it now). It was awesomeness!
The pocket pinch was on the higher side 3500 Rs for two, but it was worth it, and there was a lot of food too! I surely want to come back for the buffet soon!

Visited this Restaurant yesterday only with a few family members. As soon as you enter you are greeted by their manager which is actually a very good and impressive stuff. Instead of placing tables at every corner they have kept the portion at the entry vacant. As far as the food goes we ordered Lat me Kai, Prawn Pepper Salt and Minced Prawn in Lemon Grass for starters. Lat me Kai is a bit different from what you get everywhere but it tastes really good. Both the prawn items were very tasty but the real deal was the Minced Prawn item. I was having such kind of a dish for the first time and enjoyed it massively. The Pan Fried Noodles and the Lamb we took for Main course was good but could have been better. The Darshan at the end was simply mind blowing. Perhaps the best Darshan i had till date. Highly recommended. And yes the portions of every dish was quite good and is sufficient.

This restaurant came up at a time when our city has not yet risen to the concept of “raw fish” (common interpretation of SUSHI ) and which is precisely why it  is close to my ASIAN food loving heart ! I visited them during a japanese food festival when they had this whole array of TERIYAKI DUCKS AND FISHES  along with SUSHIS . What can I say .. my taste buds had a ball ! the only downside of this nicely done up and good food serving place can be their staff who were really not so polite or versed about their food for that matter ! However, that is rarely a reason to miss your share of jap food !

If you have decided to climb this Wall do not forget to take a ride on the 'Steam Boat'. It is heavenly! You can choose your soup and the meat and veggies that you want to go in - it will be cooked on your table. Be it winter, or a rainy day or a hot summer afternoon....I bet you will LOVE it. Nasi Goreng, an oriental fried rice with shrimps and chicken and Japanese mild spicy chicken was our next order. Both the orders won our heart. Wanted to try few more dishes but was too full for further adventure. But will be back soon and climb the Wall again.

I went to The Wall last night basically I rate  place by its 1. Service 2. Food 3. Price and 4. Ambience

1. Service was excellent. I have no complaints what so ever. However, since the place was not crowded me and my girl got good treatment. I have to go once again on a busy day to really test the service. For the moment they deserve a 5/5 from me. And I dont give five untill I am really impressed. 

2. Food was good. We loved 2 out of 3 dishes they served us. We ordered lamb shezwan dry chefs special for the starters to go with our drinks. I chose the pork chops in barbecue sauce and pepper, and asked for a noodles to go with it they some hakka noodles.
Lamb was 4 out of 5. 4 is really good I my books. It had good quantity.  The taste was fresh and full of flavours. Fried cashews and flavoured mushrooms was a good touch.
I would give the pork also a 4 out of 5. Quantity and tatse was good. When I tasted it, first the sweetness and the smoky flavour of the barbecue sauce hit me, then in the next moment the pepper in the sauce started to work its way up and that with the nice and juicy chunk of meat along with a little fat. All that tatse came to a perfect harmony.
The noodles was a disappointment. I hoping it were some thing better than the noodles at a buffet. It was also a little soggy and not really worth a try. However, I will give them a chance to do better next time in this department. 

3. Price is nested somewhere in the middle ground. The range is somewhere between 300 to 500 per dish and sushi starts at 1100. Its not as expensive as some restaurants which are just hype. 

4. Ambience is good. Wish the seating was more comfortable and cozy. The music was good and the decor was really good however concentrated mostly on the front. Lighting was soothing. And not good for taking pics with the phone hehe and thats why the poor pictures lol.

The Great Wall of China was initially set to be made entirely of wontons until it emerged that builders couldn’t resist eating their handiwork and the structure would prove futile against enemy appetites. Today we declare war on ‘The Wall’ with empty bellies. The ambience & decor was very eye catching, sitting arrangements also extremely comfortable. 

The place was not too crowded so we could just sit back and enjoy our food. We ordered ‘Laksa Gai’ & ‘Tom Yam Gai’ soups as appetizer, followed by ‘Chicken Pepper Salt’ & ‘Pan Fried Chilly Fish’ for starters along with ‘Rockford Reserve’. 

 Laksa Gai soup was just too good. Among starters Chicken Pepper Salt was tasty but Pan Fried Chilly Fish was excellent. Don’t get me wrong anyone who had followed my reviews knows I love some finger licking dishes that aren’t always the most healthy but oh so good! 

In main course we ordered ‘Pepper Garlic Chicken’, ‘Fish with Chilli Oyster Sauce’, ‘Burnt Ginger Pimento Fried Rice’ and ‘Basil Fried Rice’. The spices and flavours in Pepper Garlic Chicken & Fish with Chilli Oyster Sauce just blew my mind. Basil Fried Rice & Fish with Chilli Oyster Sauce combo was truly an exotic pleasure. 

For desserts we tried ‘Darsan’ & ‘Nut Parcel’ with ‘Vanilla Ice Cream’.  MAN oh MAN Darsan was heavenly & Nut Parcel was sweet, crunchy and so delicious!  They melt in our mouth, so soft and yammmiiii. ‘Darsan’ & ‘Nut Parcel’ will surly make you coming back for seconds and thirds! Overall a wonderful & memorable experience, this place really worth a visit.

Well I have been here couple of times and have enjoyed the food there.
The ambience is nice and so is the music and decor. Coming to food, it is above par excellence. We ordered 
green apple lemonade - was fizzy n refreshing. 
Conjee crispy lamb and chilli pork for starters - the lamb was nice n crispy but the pork was simply mind blowing, juicy n soft n saucy.. Yumm
Burnt ginger pimento fried rice- had d subtle flavour of ginger and colourful bell pepper 
Gung bao prawn - preparation was ok, but the prawns were pretty big n 6 in nos in one plate
Babi Kecap - this was the killer. Best pork dish I have had till date. Soft juicy pork cooked in soya n rice wine sauce.
Chocolate hazelnut sundae and tutti frutti for dessert - Tutti frutti had actual fruits unlike other places where u get only apple n papaya. Choc hazelnut sundae wad the perfect ending to the perfect dinner.. Nutty n chocolaty n crunchy 
Would have given a 5 if not for the price

I have been going here on and off for for over two years now.

The food is excellent, the chef excels at all he dishes up.
For a time this was one of the few places that served japanese food and this was as good as the chinese served here
The sauces across cusines are delicate, and servings generous.

Highly recomended

I visited this place on a late Saturday afternoon for lunch. This was my third visit and as usual this place never lets me down.
i just love their buffet spread. the seating lounge they have in the mid section is cozy and I can spend hours there eating from the scrumptious buffet  and chat with my friends. The food from the buffet is tasty specially the Soup, Starters, Balinese Chicken and Exotic Veg something they have. And at the end Darsaan with a dollop of Vanilla ice scream just makes my day.
this place is very neat and pocket friendly considering the great buffet they offer. Some day i would like to try their a-la-carte menu and especially the Sushis .
Only I would be happier to see some changes in their spread of buffet.

My first time and to my delight, it was indeed a pleasantly delicious visit. A soothing ambiance with ear pleasing music in background.  I am sure, like me, you will be highly impressed with the interior of this place which gives your eye a tasteful visual treat all together.

Ambiance:
As mentioned; the atmosphere, the space, the background music, the interiors - perfectly fit  be it a complete family treat or a couple-night dinner or even a friends-gossip-hangout corner. Everything at par. Elegant, magnificent would be the right words.

Food:
Before talking about the plate, lets talk about the menu. What isn't there which you want? From Sushi to DimSum, from Japanese delight to Thai delicacies, you will find every mouth watering item tempting. We, a group of four, ordered for Lat Mai Kai (Chicken nuggets) and Chilli Cheese Stuffed Mushrooms as appetizers followed by the main course Ten vegetables pan fried noodles & Moan Char Chia Muichnay (A Shredded Chicken preparation - Cambodian Style). All the former three dishes were unique and differently tasting while the last one was just another chicken preparation with a tangy twist (nothing extraordinary yet tasty). The chocolate hazle nut icecream was also good treat but again nothing so uncommon in flavors.

Hospitality:
Nothing too great but yes a caring service off-course. I am sure if the people, serving the dishes, have had a smile on their faces, the experience would have more unprofessional and friendly.. let's say warm.

At the end to wrap up, for "Kaw Paiso Group" (That's what we named ourselves while filling the feedback leaflet) this place has definitely been added to our favourite hangout place. For people/friend who have patiently read this article, this place is getting a highly recommendation from us! :)

Great ambience. Good food. Good service. A thumbs-up for the Japanese section- pretty neat I'd say. The prices are a little steep but not so much. The foods worth it. A meal for 5 of us with 3 bottles of Jacobs Creek plus starters+main course came to about 2k per person, which is still lesser than many star hotels in the city.

OMG! This place is just rocking. Please please please visit this place Ladies and Gentlemen. This is the finest place for thai food. Yes its a bit expensive but its worth it. The ambiance is just fantastic with awesome hospitality. Don't forget to try the unique dish of this place, Steamboat, though there is no boat associated with it. Each and every item they have is awesome. But if you visit this place do try something on Pork. They cook some real good pork. The Wall rocks.

We went for a meal on a boring Tuesday night only to be pleasantly surprised by the ambience and even more so by the delicious food. Every item on the menu we tried was excellent from the Chinese items to the laksa soup to the sushi. The staff was overly welcoming and the mojito was sweet and refreshing.
All in all, by far one of the best pan Asian restraunt in town..would urge everyone to visit for the excellent food and value for money. Cheers to team wall.

This is by far amongst  the best chinese joints in town and pretty underrated for that matter. I have been a regular here since the time it opened up and have rarely had a bad experience. This place wins hands down vis- a- vis  a red hot chilli pepper or mainland china (talking about vegetarian food strictly). They do keep tweaking their menu every now and then which has its pros and cons.

I have not been here since their new menu has been introduced so will only comment on the items that are still there.
Their tom yam soup is good. In starters their chilli basil tofu, indonesian steam rolls and crispy spinach are excellent. So is their sushi.

In main course their 3 treasure mushroom is simply outstanding ( and quite hot too), they used to make tsing hoi potatoes and devils choice on special request which they have stopped ( please dont do this). Their green thai curry is pretty good.  
So is their burnt ginger and pimento fried rice and chilli garlic noodles.

For desserts their toffee walnut was the second best in town after chinoserie. ( but the one at taj costs approx Rs600 and theirs was under Rs200). They serve fresh and naturelle's nalen gur ice cream too which any gur lover would definitely love.

Our bill is generally always in the range of Rs500-600 per head. For this price range and for the quality of ingredients they use ; i find this very reasonable.

But i would request them to re introduce the following items: Popiah cones, crispy spinach, toffee walnut, devils choice and tsing hoi potatoes.

Recent visits:

An absolute must eat in their starters:

1. Szechwan veg parcel: It is remarkably delicious, corn & water chestnut dumplings, deep fried served with black szechwan sauce. Each dumpling served on a spoon. Must must must have.

2. chilli tofu with basil: If you like tofu, you must eat.

Main course:
1. Four treasure veg hunan style: for those who cannot eat spicy food.

2.hot basil noodles: must eat to believe it. Very well flavoured with lots of exotic veggies.

Dinner @ the wall turned out to be good experience.

Drove my Ma, Mashis & Mama to this restaurant for a light chinese dinner. The decor was of a typical mid level eatery, with comfortable seating. Though the ceiling needs to be immediately painted.

Anyway, a beer, couple of green apple margaritas & soups were ordered. The beer wasn't as cold as desired, though they did try to get a slightly cooled 2nd. The margaritas were alright.

Some, being forced tuesday vegetarians, we were limited on choice, yet no so much, as this place has a relatively wide choice for vegans.

After the soups, we ordered for main course: Ten vegetable pan fried noodles, chinese hakka veg noodles, basil rice, thai prawn green curry. 

The basil rice was subtly done, and went very well with the yumm green curry. The vegans seemed quite content with their soups & pan fried noodles. Pocket Pinch - 4k

All was good till @ valet parking I realised one has to pay for the parking @ corporation rates !! Management can't pay for a 20 rupees parking against a fnb bill of 4k! Strange but true.

i recently visited The Wall. I thought the ambience was kinda ok... but the food was exceptionally awesome!! we ordered nigiri sushi which totally changed my outlook on sushi... the 5 spice spare ribs were mouth-watering and left me with a feeling of must-visit again!! the lamb rendang was oriental, in keeping with the original recipe (i had seen on discovery the very preparation of this dish) and I could feel all the flavours on my pallate... For those who don't know, rendang is an intricate and complex dish, with the dominant smell of lime kaffir leaves, and coconut milk... the chef had done justice what with the balance of flavours!! and i must mention the waiter recommendation helped a lot.... the prices were a bit on the higher end... but i was over-all extremely satisfied over my choice of the dishes... only thing i would like to suggest the authorities is to increase the menu on the seafood section and add octopus and mussels to it! ( Im an ardent fan of octopus)... i can't wait to visit again..and thanks to The Wall for such a pleasant experience!!

We tried the Sushi and Sashimi plate here and the non-veg steam boat. The fish was fresh and not smelly like some of the other so called Japanese joints in Kolkata. The steamboat presentation was nice but something could have been done to prep up the ingredients as they did not appear to be fresh. The decor is nice and so is the ambience in the inner section. I highly recommend the Sushi here.

The Wall is a fantastic fine dining restaurant. The atmosphere is serene with a darkish setting and soothing music. The food is fabulous and the service is outstanding. Although we had a choice of buffet, me and my friend choose to have a la carte. We started with prawn dumplings and  complimentary green tea (which serves as a palette cleanser by the way). Main course comprised Hakka Noodles and Fried Chicken in Red Gravy. The quantity was enough to s satisfy two people and the pocket pinch was Rs 1300. In conclusion, a definite recommendation.

To start with, The Wall is situated at one of the prime locations in South Kolkata. Finding it won't be a problem. Coming to the decor and ambiance of the place, The Wall gives the customer a comfortable and soothing experience. Special mention of the chairs are required. Though huge, are extremely comfortable. Now the main thing, the food - Its just perfect. We had ordered Manchow Soup, Tang Tong for starters followed by Crispy Chilly Potato with Burnt Ginger & Pimento Fried Rice. Finally we ended the session with a Darsan. The crispy chilly potato was out of the world. In fact all the food items stood well on account of both quality and quantity. The staff are extremely cordial and well behaved. Trying out the Manchow Soup is a must. Lastly, the only lax we felt was the quantity of the vanilla ice cream in the Darsan, could have been a bit more. Overall a wonderful experience. Truly a foodie's paradise !

For quite a while, I loved the buffet at The Wall. The very first time, I was blown away by the sushi and teriyaki Chicken starters on offer in the buffet. But over time, they have moved away from Japanese influences, leaning more towards Chinese in their buffet offerings.
I would suggest going for their a la carte menu and trying their Japanese food... Oh the heavenly teriyaki chiken.... Happiness.

Only good thing I found about this place was that the staff are courteous. Apart from that, the food is nothing great as compared to the price. I foind the price quite high? almost comparable to the likes of main land china.

note that it is only the ground floor of a residential house and so sitting arrangements and  ambience are not that great.

In short, this could have been ok had the price was less, else I wouldn't recommend it. '

This is a great joint in a very unexpected location.
I first tried it after visiting Xrong place located next door to this place and have been a regular ever since.
They recently changed the menu so my review is based on the earlier menu.
They have a great selection of dishes that are out of the ordinary and do have a unique twist on differant flavours. Their selection on dishes although limited, spans not just chinese, as the same suggests but also has a variety of thai, japanese and fusion dishes.
Recently had the hotpot and found it to be superb. For those looking for a very authentic experience, you may be a little disappointed as as the noodle and rice dishes have a bit of 'park street' flair but still very nicely made and most importantly, good quality.
Definitely worth becoming a regular for foodies.

Those who are not well acquainted with the roads and by-roads of South Kolkata may find it a bit difficult to get to this place. It might take some pain for you to get there, but trust me the pain will be worth your while. The staff are not the most well trained people but are definitely welcoming, helpful and courteous. The decor is quite appreciable as well, especially the seating arrangement in the middle of the restaurant. I have been to this restaurant many a times and to be honest have never been impressed with their buffet spreads. If you have time on your hands, sit back, relax and order from their ala carte menu. Start with the Som Tum salad. Its sweet, tangy and hot with all kinds of textures that you can think of. The sushi here is not quite what you would get in Singapore or Bangkok or maybe even in ITC Sonar's Pan Asian but at that price the sushi is definitely good. I have tried and enjoyed the nigiri sushis and maki sushis each and every time that I have been there. In appetizers definitely try the Singaporean spare ribs which are generous portions and really delectable. I have been meaning to try the steamboats since a long time but somehow I haven't gotten around to trying it. That is mainly because I am tempted to order the Babi Kecap each and every time. The lamb in masaman curry is decent. To be frank I have had better masaman curries in Kolkata. The jumbo prawn dishes are good and so is the crab but with the crab availability is often an issue. I have tried the Nasi Goreng, the Japanese rice, the pineapple friend rice and basil fried rice all of which I have enjoyed immensely. The date and raisin pancakes and the coconut custard are the only desserts worth having here. Overall I really like this place and I would definitely recommend it to all you. Also try some of their mocktails during the summers which can be quite refreshing.

The Wall is possibly one of the best standalone chinese restaurants in Kolkata. It's also probably the closest you'll get to authentic chinese food. I've been here countless times and can't recommend this place enough.

Naturally it is a bit indianized, but far less than the likes of Mainland China or the typical Tangra indian-chinese fare. The place has all kinds of exotic ingredients and also serves japanese food. 

The "steam boat" here is amazing - it's basically pho: a hot pot with all kinds of ingredients - fish, dumplings, squid, prawn, lamb, pork and veggies. The soups here are great - both tom yam and tom kha are rock solid choices. This is also one of the few places you can get miso soup - I'd recommend trying miso with chinese vegetables.

Lots of choice for main dishes, there's also a decent selection of thai food. The sushi here is great too (bit pricey though). There's the yaki-tori : a japanese version of a shashlik kebab which is nice. Just one thing, these guys don't serve beef.

TLDR: If you like a slightly exotic chinese dinner and love non-veg cuisine, this is the perfect destination in South Kolkata.

Visited the place for a second time after a long 5 years. My first experience was quite terrible and hence the big gap. 

This time, it was much better - food wise at least.  The baby-corns with water-chestnut  were a delight. 

The staff is very polite and courteous. 

There was a strange smell in the restaurant which was a big put off.  May be they could do something about the hygiene.

Located near xrong place, The Wall is a widely known name and although it was on my agenda for quite some time, i managed to make a visit here not before this sunday with my wife. I had gone there convinced of an amazing dinner but i had a mixed experience.

Food: 4.5/5
Decor & music: 3.5/5
Hospitality: 2/5

The restaurant has a great entrance and the decor inside is simple. Music playing was pretty soft and soothing belonging to the chillout genre. The tables are moderately spaced but the seats are very comfortable. Overall it provides a nice ambience. The food on offer is chinese, thai, japenese with prices being very reasonable. The person attending us was knowledgeable and polite though with some kind of attitude that seemed more of an arrogance to me. Nevertheless, i would thank him for clarifying  misconceptions i had about a few chinese and japenese preparations.

Coming to food, it was just great. The tempura platter is pretty nice though i haven't had it elsewhere to compare. the clear soup was a bit salty else it would have been great. The burnt ginger and pimento fried rice was nice and i loved the exotic vegetables in chili garlic sauce that was simply awesome for some 225 bucks. The chocolate souffle and caramel custard both were really good. The presentation of food was nice too.

The bill was bought to us just after dinner even without asking if we wanted to have desserts, which was disappointing !!! But on communicating the feelings, they did serve complimentary desserts but i did not like the overall attitude. Moreover the    guy who had been attending to us all the while should have approached and clarified to us after the confusion which dint happen.

I think the place has done all the hard work to get a 4.5 but going by my experience, it does need to fix a few glitches !!

I had read all the rave reviews and wanted to try this place for a long time. I went their for the lunch buffet thinking that i'll get to try the variety that they offer.

I must say that they had a very good spread. The starters were being served on the table. They were fresh and absolutely delicious. The crispy american corn is to die for. All the starters were amazing. 

But when it came to the main course and we picked up stuff from the buffet itself, we found that everything was absolutely cold. And cold asian food does not taste very good. It is my advice to them that if they are serving a buffet, they have to ensure that the food is piping hot till the last customer has eaten. I am sure the food would have tasted great had it been hot but sadly i can't say the same for tepid or cold food. 

I must mention that they served two main course dishes on the table which was freshly prepared, hot and pretty delicious.

The desserts were not worthy of a mention. They were their just for the sake of it.

I am sure if i go in for an a-la-carte selection it will be really good.

The staffs are very friendly and they will help you to for your selection of starters and on trays . Must try ten treasure tapestry noodles, barbecued pork chops and roasted duck with sauce of your choice. 

I went there once during the pujas and tried out their buffet. I Must say that there was nothing special in it. The food quality was very average and its was not at all worth the money.

The Wall offers a lovely lunch buffet. All the items served are well chosen, tasty and made with care unlike in many other places which offer a set meal. Out of their al-a-carte menu, I remember liking their hupak style chicken. The prices are reasonable. Its location is good too. It's very accessible being only a minute's drive from deshapriya park, yet, by being inside a quiet lane it's away from the hustle n bustle and mitigates the car parking hassles.

Yesterday i visited wall with a friend of mine, i found the place packed, and lots of people were waiting for seats, however i did not have to wait for a long time and within 15 minutes my friend and i got a seat. Well i wanted to experiment new dishes and so i ordered the sushi which were of 4 types one was sushi with salmon the other sushi with squid, sushi with prawn and the last one with crab. Well i dipped the sushi into a the soya sauce and ate the sushi. Viola! the sushi tasted lovely. 

Then we did not waste much time since it was already closing time and so we ordered the Lamb with the musaman sauce and the chicken yueng ye pen both of which were lovely. We also ordered the crab meat soup and split the soup one into two. We ordered mixed hakka Chowmein. All the items were really good. The Chicken red curry was out of the world. Liked to compliment the chef for this fabulous preparation. I was really impressed when we were told that the darsan which we had ordered was complimentary by the management at Wall. Darsan with ice cream is my favourite chinese sweetmeat. 

I would like to suggest few things firstly the table cloths had a stink in them and so this needs to be looked into. Secondly i feel the dishes are a bit overpriced i do understand that the management needs to make profit but it should not be too exhorbitant. The music at the restro needs to be more soothing and relaxing, i guess the management were airing jazz music sounded like chick corea & electric band... which i feel is not suited to the ambience of wall rather if the management could play instrument music from bands such as Four Play, or artist like lee ritenour, Pat Matheny and Larry Carlton the ambience would be really soothing for the customers. It would be nice if the management served a bowl of chips or nuts to the customers while they are waiting for their ordered to come should they order drinks.

The wall has always been one of favourite restaurants on sarat bose road, i quite like the ambience of wall, the statue of buddha at the entrance of the restaurant transforms you to exotic thailand. The green curry rice that we ordered was just like the one i had near nana's. Even the chinese food that was served such as the red crispy chicken was well marinated and tasty. The fresh lime soda had the correct blend of salt and sugar. Although the soup that i had tomyum soup could have been better.

Just came in reading the reviews, the reception guy is rather grumpy and was visibly annoyed that we din make a reservation. Asked us to wait for half n hour.after 15 mins i went to him to enquire about our table, and came to know that our name was not written, which is outrageous- anyways hoping for some good food. Would post further if its worth the wait and callous attitude in the reception desk.

Is it really that good that everyone claims here !!! I am not sure :(
The 2 times I visited and going by my nature explored every new food I could (lots on the menu), found some to be excellent and then there were some which were not so excellent.

If the management people are listening : This is not 'The Wall' I knew since last year. I visit your restaurant almost from the day it started its journey. Appreciated its ambience, quality of food, behavour of the waiters and their service since then. Recommended this place to  many of my friends and family members. Happily accepted the 'Savourites Membership Card'. Probably can claim to be one of the oldest members of the group. Many of the restaurant people know me by name ( both in 'The Wall' & '6 Ballygunge Place'). I visited the Bangalore outlet whenever I had been there too. This is just because of your food and good conduct. But unfortunately, due to poor selection of staff, that image of your chinese/Japanese outlet has started fading out of my mind. If steps not taken accordingly, I think it will affect the volume of business in coming years. So please visit your Sarat Banerjee Road outlet frequently and try to take a direct feedback from the customers. I do not want to blame anyone by name, but please take care of the people who are constantly helping you grow bigger.

A near perfect. I just can't complain about anything, for this restaurant, except for their beverage list. Food is great, a bit different. We tried their shushi,  chili pork and the one that deserves specific mention is their singaporean pork ribs, one word for it: Excellent, a must have according to me. The main course is also pretty good, the quantity specifically. The quality of food and knowledge of their staff is worth mentioning.
Overall: Excellent.

I had lunch here with my family on August 11th and all of us opted for the weekend buffet. The Wall has very sophisticated interiors that will you give you the feeling as if you are dining in some traditional oriental setting. The restaurant also plays soft oriental music in the background which enhances the ambience of the already highly pleasing restaurant. Since we were in a group of 9, we dined at the family room which too is very well designed.The buffet had a large spread of dishes starting with 4 different types of starters( one fish, chicken,lamb) and a delicious chicken noodle soup. Out of the starters, the chicken noodle soup along with the schezuan fish were absolutely delicious. Now on to the main entrees, all of the dishes were good. What tasted the best to me were the Chengdu chicken, thai green prawn curry, manchow fried rice and garlic fish curry. These dishes were mouth-watering and all of us kept on going back for refills. Although few of the dishes were a bit more spicy than normal, the taste was fantastic. The service from the waiters too were excellent. We were attended to at every step and we enjoyed ourselves extremely. Worth the money spent and we left deeply satisfied.

The real good oriental buffet. Every single preparation is so tasty and distinctly different that you'll definitly notice this. Not like other buffet spreads like you don't even bother about the sauce, they know the oriental art of sauce and also the art of freshness. The sauteed vegetables and vegetables in a white sauce were so different that you can differentiate them even on a closed eye. Very diverse buffet spread and very  reasonable price. Anybody with a Chinese tooth will love love love this place. Well mannered and helpful staff, gr8 drinks, splendid weekend buffet spread and that's not all. They offer wonderful japanese shushi and tempura too. Very promising restaurant.

I have visited this place quite a few number of times and found it to be great. The last time i visited, a week back, i was quite disappointed. To my surprise the waiters were insisting that we (3of us) go for the buffet. Dont they realize that a buffet spread is/should be (only) an option to the customers to take or not to take.  Otherwise they should stop the Ala-carte menu on the days they have the buffets. Better yet they could have told us this while we entered.
We ordered two chicken drumsticks, and a pan fried chilli fish. The drumsticks were nice, but i was personally disappointed with the pan fried chilli fish. I thought they would be crispy outside and soft inside (thats what i thought pan fried meant) but they were not.  I didnt like their taste either, as i thought it would have a tangy taste to go with our booze, which didnt happen.
As a change from previous times, none of the staff approached us while we were eating, but we could see them standing and chit-chatting in the waiting area. 
Overall a nice place to be if "The Wall" can maintain the same standards that they had once set.
Little over priced though. 

My score - 3/5

Very tastefully designed interiors and nice location, this is a place worth going for people who live in this part of the town and doesn't really want to drive all the way to the Park Street, considering the food served here is no less than what is served at Park Street in terms of quality.

I am vegetarian, so not sure of how are  the things with non-veg Dept but whatever I ordered in the Veg was easily mouth watering. A couple of things mentioned in the menu, was available and that was quite a disappointment though. If there is a large group sitting in the private dining section, you might have to wait a bit for service, which is understandable to a great extent.

Overall, a place worth going once in a while and a few of their in-house recipes are seriously good and a must-have on every visit like Chili Cheese Stuffed Mushroom and Veg steam roll. You will come back home - filled and satisfied, and there is not even a hint of doubt on that.

Went there on the recommendation of a friend. We were there for a family dinner, occasion being the birthday of my beloved wife. Thus, wanted to visit a place with a nice ambience, good food and overall a relaxed atmosphere without being too much overcrowded. "The Wall" did not disappoint at all on all these counts. The interiors are nicely done, neat and clean. Quite comfortable seats where one can relax and spend time. The menu has quite a lot of options, ranging from Thai to Japanese. Average drinks menu though, but the cocktails and mock-tails make up. Overall a good experience, staff are polite and they serve you with a smile on their face. Would recommend others to visit and would definitely return many more times.

2. Friendly staff, they were very helpful.
3. Chicken and coriander soup was good.
4. Yellow prawn curry was delicious.
5. Stir fried veg was also decent.

2. Dimsum was not hot at all.
3. Dessert was disappointing.

Overall a good place for going with family. 
Food for 2 with liquor will cost aroumd 1500

went there with my family of 6 and opted for weekend lunch buffet @570 including taxes.
the ambience was simple,not that exciting,i felt it was more like a flat with tables n sofas in the rooms,the kitchen was used as the ice cream serving section and middle passage used for the buffet table.
the waiters were well behaved  and homely.quickly they served us with chicken soups,and several helpings of starters which consisted of crispy babycorn and fried chicken in lemon sauce..both were tasty..but a few more options with lamb ,fish, or prawn starters would have been better.
we went ahead with the main course,started with 3 salads,noodles,rice, vegetable with mushroom,chicken,fish,prawn n crab side dishes.all were decent,fish was fresh,ingredients were of good quality,but we didnot find anything extraordinary!
next the desserts were all my favourites...chocolate brownie,vanilla ice cream,and chocolate shouffle
i needed nothing else!one suggestion would be to add chocolate sauce with the brownie.
but two of my cousins were not chocolate lovers and they had no options.pastries or puddings of other flavours,cut fruits,sweets should be included.
we got ten tapestry noodles and that pan kai packed n liked both.
the price per head was like weekday lunch buffet at mainland china with a better ambience and variety !
 improvements can be done in starter and dessert section but overall a nice experience :-)

I was planning to check this place out for quite sometime now. Visited today with a friend who has gone there quite a few times. Very nice decor and located in a prime location. Staffs are very warm and well behaved. Food was however alright. Chicken Hot and Sour Schezwan Soup was the best and really enjoyed it. Chicken Chinese Fried Rice was okay, nothing special. However That Pan Kai (Diced chicken in grounded pepper sauce) was lil deceptive. It was nice in taste but I couldn't differentiate that much from a Chicken Schezwan Dish or a Chilli Chicken. Would love to come back once more for trying their lambs and if that goes well, then they must very good. Lamb can be tricky. Other than that, price was reasonable.

From the ambiance to the locality to the food, it is all about pleasing the senses. The Chilli Pork is so succulent and perfectly spiced that we never miss it in any of our visits. The stewards give good suggestions. This is one of the favourite joints of both the spouse and I, especially the spouse since this has been one of the very few places in Kolkata (up until the recent times) that served sushi and also offers a touch of Japanese cuisine along with their Chinese and Thai fare. It is difficult to review each food item for there has not been one that we have not liked, yet that is. We also enjoy their steamboat fare which is nothing but a one pot meal that is soup based -- very apt if you have been watching your calories.

You will get a lot of exotic Oriental options which you'll not get in other restaurants in the city. Pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side, but it's worth it.

Having tried The Wall several times, I've sworn never to visit it again. Every time I have been there the experience has just gotten worse. The ala carte is appalling. There is too much tomato flavouring in every 'crispy' dish you call for. If you question the server or the manager on a particular dish he is unable to mention how it is prepared or what it would taste like.  After ordering it takes a minimum of an hour to get any food to the table and a minimum of 15 minutes to get anyone to notice you even in an empty restaurant.

Though the mushroom pepper salt has always been outstanding, the poor service, the inedible main course and hardly delightful desserts have always left me with a sour taste.

The prices are on the higher side but the food is fantastic so you wouldn't really mind. The staff are very cordial and cheerful. All their cuisines are nicely prepared and a must try. Their Oriental Pepper Salt Chicken is very nice. 
Their desserts too are quite unique and pleasing to your tongue. Overall I enjoyed the meal and rate it 4 from my side.

I have never had better Chinese food than here. It was a great discovery for me. The Japanese Ebi Fry that we ordered were simply out of this world. Their unique concept of "Steam Boat" is an experience all together, where you make your own soup with vegetable, meat and condiments. Its amazing.This pan-Asian restaurant offers exotic dishes that one normally associates with five-star places.... Nigiri Sushi, Maki Roll, Teriyaki. You can order the Sui Mai, Crab Claws, Crab Rangoog and Chicken Soong, Fish in Spicy Oyster Sauce and Barbecue Pork Chops from the Chinese menu. There's the ubiquitous dim sums too. The Tempura Platter, Miso Soup with Tofu, assorted Sushi and Grilled Chicken Teriyaki is a good choice from the Japanese section. The Wall is a pleasant surprise for foodies... as are the prices!

Essentially, I eat at a place at least 3 times before reviewing it. But as they say, a restaurant is as good as its prawn preparations. And the prawn here is just above good. Not excellent, but good. Pretty good. Can't say i liked the fish, chicken or crab here. They all taste a little flat. Ambience is good. So is the decor, except some tables are pretty hard to get into. Non alcoholics should totally try the mojito. Not sure, if I'd go back to the pace or recommend it to anyone.

A friend and I decided to go to The Wall a few days back and we met up around 8.30. We immediately ordered Pot Stickers, and it came in soon, piping hot and tasty with a lovely soy-based sauce, very similar to what you generally get abroad when you order pot stickers. Our other starter was chicken pepper salt, and it was really light and tasty too. 

Off to a flying start, we decided to order California Hand roll and pan fried fish next. Although the pan fried fish was tasty, I found it slightly too salty for my palate. However, my disappointment was with the sushi, where the prawn was not up to the mark. However, I noted that they have made the previously five-six piece a plate sushi into two-piece plate, which I found was a good way to lure in new customers for Sushi. 

Our main course was Burnt ginger fried rice and Fish in Black bean sauce. Both of these items were warm and tasty, and restored faith. Our bill was quite reasonable for all this and cold drinks.

Good place to have a quiet and satisfying Meal. Was there on 15th Evening with some friends and all of us had a great time. 

We started with Pepper Salt Prawns and a fish starter... both were equally good. For dinner we opted for a Fried rice and a chicken side dish. Both were greatly appreciated by all in the group. 

The portions of both starters and main course were generous.

The only problem - that I have just noticed -  is that they have made a mistake in the Bill.. they have charged us twice for one of the cocktails that we had there. I am sure it was a mistake. I will call them up and speak about it.

Overall a very nice place to be in.

I have been here several times. it's a nice homely place, quiet big, spacious and serves very  good food. The quality and taste of all food is very nice. Everyone here has already said that. I will love to include one more, that is 'The Steam Boat'. It's a must try. The chef would cook the dish on your table. The raw vegetables and meat will be taken to you, you can choose your favorites. Then the chef will start cooking. He will first serve the soup with veggies then gradually he will serve the meat, seafood and noodles. The whole thing would take nearly 40 mins to complete and it is very delicious and healthy. It can be a complete meal.

I visited the restaurant with my family on 23/1/13. We opted for the buffet lunch. At Rs.375/- plus taxes it was a steal. The fare included fried chicken, noodle salad and crisp fried potato as starters, followed by chicken lemon coriander soup, fried rice, noodles, stir fried vegetables followed by fish, chicken and prawn. For dessert there was ice cream and chocolate brownie.All in all, it was excellent fare. The service was very good. The atmosphere was enjoyable. I will definitely go back to try their a-la-carte menu next time.

located near southern avenue, sarat bose road crossing, it's a bit difficult to locate as it's in a lane, not on the main road. we went for dinner on 31st night. they took our booking over phone and we opted for the 31st night special buffet. food was awesome, specially liked the crab and prawn preparations, sushi and lemon chicken soup. both children and adults enjoyed their dinner. ambiance was nice, sober. alcohol is a bit over-priced.

I loved this place. The ambiance is adequate, nothing spectacular. The service is good, the waiters are helpful, though a bit more detailed information about the food would have been appreciated. My mom asked the guy taking orders what a massaman curry was, and his reply was "it's a type of Thai curry". Duh! But this is nitpicking.

The food was almost uniformly excellent. The Singaporean spare ribs was a spicy delight, a chicken salad (I forget which one) was munchy goodness, and the massaman curry was a revelation. They also had a nice selection of alcohol, including cream liquors and single malt scotch, though choice in wines was very limited.

With generous amount of alcohol, the cost came to around 1300 per head, which is a bit high, but without alcohol it's not totally unreasonable. Would definitely visit again!

Sakana Teri Yaki, Tempura platter, Golden Fried Prawn, Oriental Pepper Chicken for starters, Lobster in Oyster sauce, Eki Soba, Chicken Tsui or Hupak style for main course. I'm so stuffed by then, desert is skipped. I would have also recommended Steamboat, but I believe they ran out of Steam ;) errr! I meant they are out of gas burners folks ...

This has been a great creation from the house of Savourites. While you're there look out for Biswajit, great dude, awesome manager. Chef's good too, I think he makes Japanese stuff quite well; had some experience one says ...

Avoid seating in the centre zone not comfortable. Of late some bright scientist decided to put some blue lights on the floor; don't ask me why, apparently someone tripped :) dam light is to tacky and hurts your eye. In any case seating isn't cool and I would avoid if I were you. 

Enjoy the meal, but make a reservation people else you just might get disappointed when you get there. Cheers.

Contrary to the previous posters I found the food at this place average,overpriced & pretentious,tried mainly the Thai dishes which were disappointing to say the least,Thai red curry only tasted of coconut milk & missed the subtle flavours of the herbs which I had pointed out to the steward ,he couldn't offer me an explanation though.Paad Thai was way too sweet with bits of rancid peanuts thrown in for good measure !
Also tried the dim sum of prawn & lamb variety as they supposedly have a dim sum festival going on,four smallish dim sums were offered which costs 185 Rs,the prawn one tasted of pork fat,the lamb one were eatable.Chinese Hakka chicken noodle didn't disappoint though & the garlic pepper chicken needed more vigour !last but not the least was hugely disappointed with Chilli Peking crab which wallowed in thick sweetish gravy & did not pack a punch for me,I had tasted better chilli crab in my friendly neighbourhood place !I have lived abroad & have had the good fortune of trying different cuisine,to me these so called boutique eating places ( The Wall markets itself as one ) are a huge con,they may be appealing to people with limited exposure to different cuisines ,to me sadly it did not make the grade at all.

Brilliant experience. The food was awesome and coupled with the very warm service provided by the staff, the experience at The Wall was tremendously satisfying. The yakitori and sushi definitely deserve special mention.
Anybody wishing to sample some amazing Asian dishes ought to come here without fail.

The ambiance was perfect, the service was excellent and above everything, the food was unbelievably delicious. Did not expect to taste such authentic Japanese delicacies in our very own City of Joy. The prices too were affordable. Overall, an excellent experience. Cannot wait to visit once again!

The Wall is undoubtedly Kolkata's best standalone restaurants for classic Pan Asian food... a must try at The Wall are their "Steam Boats" which is as authentic as it gets...I also love their Thai Green Curry with its classic spicy , coconuty  flavour is perfectly done and is awesome with steamed rice..yum..yum..yum!

Some friends introduced me to this place and I am glad they did.... I think its built up quite a following in south Kolkata and is one of the few places that serves Japanese food and sushi. I must recommend the Tempura Platter or the Golden Fried Prawns to start with. Also the Nasi Goereng which is a rice preparation is excellent for the main course or else try the Egg Wrapped Fried Rice. Try the Ikan kai which is a lemon flavoured chicken or the Sweet and Sour Prawn in Orange Sauce. I have heard good things about the "steamboat" and look forward to trying that soon.

Had a wonderful time here. The ambiance was very good and the waiters were super polite and informative. I think it was the service that brought in the "wow" factor. Apart from that chilly pork and  nasi gerong was superb though the latter was a wee bit spicy but nevertheless tasty n different. 

The nilgiri sushi was average as i liked only the prawn and the salmon one. I only wish they had the option of taking just one variety so that people like us who hate squid can avoid the same.

The miller beer, had it for the first time and was quite good for its mild taste although i do think they should increase the variety when it comes to alcohol. 

Other wise all good and reasonably priced.

Awesome is the word.the singaporean spare ribs are fantastic...perfectly cooked and with the right balance of crunch and softness,meat and fat.the tempura is good but a few more prawns and little less veggies would be welcome. Service is faultless.child friendly place.been there thrice in two months...will definitely go many many more times.

Last night was a wonderful experience at "The Wall". It is a lovely place to hang out with family and friends. I loved the golden fried prawns(Rs.355/-). The preparation of Strawberry Charlotte(Rs.125/-) was simply mouth watering. Chinese chicken fried rice(Rs.185/-) with a chicken preparation called "That Pan Kai" (Rs.185/-)was also good. I liked the ambience and the service of the staff had a personal touch in it.I would definitely visit this place again.

I visited The Wall last night and I must say I had a lovely experience. The experience started at the door and ended at the door 2 hours later. The reception was very warm. Our waiter was not very good at english but he more than compensated it by his behavior and service. I never had sushi before and the sushi that they served did make me want even more of it. The other preparations were very tasty and delightful especially the pork (I don't remember the exact name of the dish). I would definitely visit this place again and again.

I went to this restaurant few months back. At that time the lunch buffet was available and it costs around Rs 500(approx). The food was good.

I would like to know whether the lunch buffet is available all through out the year or not.

I went to this place on 4th October 2011 on the occasion of Durga Puja(Astami) with my wife to check some of the authentic Chinese cuisine. But the festive season made the hosts to put forward only buffet. Though a bit heart broken(I had made up my mind to taste some a-la-crate dishes) yet the menus served on the night was great. Specially the behavior of the staffs and the ambiance made me delighted. I would genuinely like to come back to taste some pork and sushi. Its a must visit restaurant as per my opinion for food loving people.

Sushi quality, authenticity is fair (in the eyes of a customer who had authentic sushi before).
Food is good as well the service. Not very expensive neither too economic. Lunch buffet at Rs400-450 is good. Place is good. Its in the opposite lane to Sarat Bose Road Barista near Southern Avenue crossing.
