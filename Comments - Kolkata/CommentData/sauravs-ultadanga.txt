Went in for a quick lunch and had kochuri alur torkari which tasted really good .... But they do not have seating arrangements which makes the place quite crowded .... Also they have got GST included which I did not like.... I am rating 3.5 based on the food

A decent spot located close to the Ultadanga station, Saurav serves decent food but lacks ambience or good quality. Perfect for passengers/office goers who have to grab a quick bite.

Ordered mixed gravy chowmin during durga puja 2k17. It was less salty. Also the gravy was tasteless. Maybe hakka is better compare to gravy one here.

Their location is practically unmissable from the bus stop. It's one of the oldest eateries in the area, serving namkeens and chaats. But the hygiene and the quality of  food seems to have deteriorated down the years. What still remains fine is their soda. Love their green mango soda.

I hv visited this place many times. Foods are a little bit costly but very good in taste. Their south Indian and Chinese both are good. Dahi bada,dosa all are good. Their chat like Raj kachouri is also good. I will always remember their Chinese item which I tasted, American chopsuy and chicken 65. These two are really really amazing. Try these once.

A veg restaurant very near to the biddhannagar road station at ultadanga.
Had to visit as I was very hungry and also I need to have pure veg for that particular day.
Ordered cheese masala dosa and mango milk shake.
The staffs are not very attentive. Hygiene is also not very good.

We were in a lookout for a cheap place to have lunch around  Ultadanga area and came across Saurav's.
The place is not a very attractive one. Service was also on the slower side. Many of the items on their menu was unavailable.
Finally went with the Masala Dosa. Very mediocre in taste but have no complains, either.
You can visit this place if you wanna go easy on your pocket!

They had always served quality food especially the south Indian dishes, especially uttapam and cheese masala Dosa. With the same expectation, I have been there but unfortunately couldn't find the taste of Dosa and uttapam like before. They need to work on their stuffs for sure to ensure more foodies visit.

Situated in ultadanga main road near bidhan nagar railway station. Restaurant was devided in three parts. In ground floor they have sweets, quick bite desi snacks & soda based drinks center and inside they have pure veg restaurant which serve south indian, desi and Chinese snacks and in first floor they have non vegetarian restaurant in which they serve Chinese and some other snacks. Ambience was very nice and hospitality was also good. Service in reasonable time and presentation was nice. Price was reasonable. Today I tried their Matar kachori with aloo dum it was spicy and very tasty in taste. I also tried fruit beer soda and it was also good in taste and refreshing too. Must try place. Recommended to all.

Well, I was quite a regular at this place till few years back ‚Äì when I began to notice a steady decline in their quality and a steep surge in their prices as well as their popularity. This obviously limited my frequent visits to this place and slowly and gradually, all my visits dried up. Today, however, I mustered sufficient courage to re-visit them ‚Äì in anticipation of something good - a decision I severely repented a few minutes later.

A prime location near Bidhannagar Railway Station is their only USP, I feel ‚Äì and they don‚Äôt have any more attention grabbers! Their soda machine serving varied soda flavours (which is very reasonable priced also) is a big winner, especially for the daily commuters @ the nearby Railway Station. 

Once inside I wanted to order samosas, which was out of stock and quite understandably also, as I met them past 8 pm. Nevertheless, I decided to settle for their sweet meats and had their chocolate roll, chocolate Sandesh as well as a white mishti parcelled.

My nightmare started the moment I placed those sweets onto my tongue only to realize that they were damn stale ‚Äì at least a day old! They completely spoiled my entire dinner ‚Äì they had no right to serve me obsolete stuff as I am purchasing everything at MRP. This was definitely not a 90% discounted distress sale of as-is-where-is outdated stock at Chandni Market where sellers don‚Äôt take any guarantee of sold goods.

Management need to change their attitude big-time to maintain the Goodwill of this place.

This place ain't fancy but deserves a review because in the mad hustle bustle surrounding Bidhannagar railway station,one gets two minutes of respite while grabbing a quick bite from here.
The place is more or less hygienic.The dosa tastes great for the price charged.My mum recently bought home their samosas and aloo bondas.If you've spent time outside West Bengal, you would know the hell-and-difference between the shingadas we get here(bordering on the sweeter side)and the samosas you get outside the state.None of my cross-country train journeys are complete without gorging on spicy samose and aloo bondas from the hawkers with mirchi to munch on.The samosas from this outlet just brought back those warm memories.I didn't really like the aloo bonda(you might as they were on the sweeter side)but the samosas along with the red meethi chutney were yum,each gulp obviously paired with a bite of green chilli.These small little places do deserve our patronage.

They used to make really nice kochuris, though at present they are not that good. Regarding their dosas, they are just plain okay I guess. For quick bites, a streetside shop to hop over on a busy day at a bustling place, perhaps before catching a train, bus or auto or alighting from one.

Saurav's serves my purpose of visiting thr place. They had been serving hot gulab jamun even before it got popular. The place is neat and clean. Prices are reasonable. 

This place is very busy due to it's location. Popular for its's variety of food available and cleanliness. A must place to visit.

They have got a range of choices for their customers ranging from sweets and confectionery items to a proper restaurant in the floor above.

Located just beside the very Bidhannagar Station at Ultadanga, just opposite of Rosenberg resto.
The location has huge crowd coming althrough as it is near railway station. People passing by stops once here for their hungry buds. A veg resto before later amended to non veg, this place certainly has some varieties to offer you. They deal with south indian as well as they got Soda stall and sweet shop too. A complete place for food and drink stuffs at one. Place was somehow not that clean, maybe due to the rush of crowd keep coming in.
We had the masala dosa and later we had the soda drink too.
Masala dosa was average nothing to be explained much. Like any other masala dosa you can say. (It hurted a lot becuz i forgot to click the picture).¬†
Soda was satisfactory. Prices are fine.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Souravs restaurant in ultadanga just beside the railway station of bidhannagar ( ultadanga) is running from years and making some really nice food as they have options of Chinese , Indian and other fast food items .
I had tried this restaurant couple of times and I have always ordered dosa probably that aroma of dosa always calls me as they prepare it down and this restaurant has ground and 1 st floor so while you pass to go up to the seating and tables in 1st floor you love that delicious smell . The dosas are fresh and big enough for a big hunger moment also has nice fillings inside and the chutneys and sambhars have a great taste which over and all makes a great pair .

However the service is a bit slow I really don't know why , probably the coordination from ground to 1 st floor , still the food sets my mood here and hoping they improve the brisk service part anytime soon

Probably d best gulab jamun they make in n around kolkata. If u r sweet lover,try their HOT GULAB JAMUN JUST @RS 10. Its huge n so soft n very very yummmmiiii. So I rate Saurav's   9 on 10 only for their sweet items. Reviewers liked dosas n uttapams n all,but I don't prefer masala dosas here,its pretty ordinary. Hungry people running for train can eat,but no speciality. Chinese items I never ve tried,so cant rate. N lastly, dahi badas....its also very good,tasty,smooth n they serve it with loads of yogurt....n I ordered for special dahi more for it. The service boys are friendly. Must visit for gulab jamuns.

You can try dosa and idly. These has regular taste, nothing special. Most of times, sambar was not good. It lacks vegetables.
Raj kachuri chat is a real disaster. The kachuri itself was too hard. In fillings, they used boiled chana with chickpeas, and it tasted really bad. For no reason they put toppings of soft breadcrumbs!
Froot juice and lassi is good usually

Other dishes are also nice. Not to mention the collection of sweets made of pure Ghee!!Now they have even renovated the place and made arrangements to sit and eat. A very decent food joint to go with family, and friends for sure. A very busy place because of the bang on location and obviously the quality which they have maintained over the years..

Good food and good location . They may introduce non Chinese food like biriyani , nans and parathas . The real thing to be concerned about is the staircase , they need to improve it

At times this place is a saviour for me. Though there is nothing to appreciate highly but certainly one can have a decent mini meal here. They have varieties of Sweets, aerated drinks, Chinese and South Indian dishes.

Not a very good place to be at if you want quality food but definately a place for some quick bite at low price. We had masala uttapam, hot gulab jamun and koolfi here.
Food is average, ambiance nil and price low.

The restaurant is near Ultadanga station. It has 2 floors, the ground floor is a vej restaurant where you can taste chats, pao-bhaji etc; while the 1st floor is a non-vej Chinese restaurant. Food is not that good.

Located beside the busy ultadanga station,probably the best and cheapest place to take a bite on the way to sork. Fully vegetarian and the food quality ain't so bad. If you have a sweet tooth,i would really recommend theri gulab jamuns and other sweet delicacies.

A good and pocket friendly place to visit near Bidhannagar Railway Station. Ordinary menu with good taste and extraordinary quantity. I am not at all bothered about the ambiance when I visit this place I just hog on to my favorite Masala Dosa or Uttapam. Their prompt and good service is something worth mentioning. The wide range of Sodas they have is something one should try. Go once and try it. :)

Situated in ultadanga near to the station.... This restaurant is one of the few decent places to eat in the area. Menu doesn't boast anything unique... All the regular fare such as dosa, idli, chaat, dahi vada etc etc their sweets are nice though.. Recently their prices have gone up with the quality and quantity being average... All in all go if you don't  have time to visit elsewhere.

If you have money to waste and an stomach to upset please do visit this place
The paneer was stale 
The salad was not fresh
The non veg food is cooked by a  cook who doesn't know the difference between paneer butter masala and kadai chicken 
The food is too over priced 
Buy some lays or have food in the nearby roadside shops instead of wasting money here
Keep munching
Cheers :)

This place was once used to be a famous spot but now, they are simply out of business. I went there one Sunday night because I ran out of options and ordered some Chinese. Took the first bite of chicken manchurian and it seemed the chicken was not fresh. The rice quality of fried rice was also not good. What astonished me more was I was the only customer.
The only good thing was this wonderful light hanging above. May be I would have recommended this place a few years back, but not now.

Very very poor. People go there just becoz its near railway station.  Quality and quantity of food is  disgusting. Not worth of a single penny.
Entrance staircase is so bad that you have to climb through that tiny space.

And last but not the least...the attendants and waiters have no manners. I dont know if they instruct them to behave so disrespectfully.
There is a lady in the downstairs 'dhosa section'  and the waiter in first floor are so rude..i was really embarassed to bring my girlfriend and parents separately..
They will not even served water until i asked for it. They will treat you like  anything. Those people are really bad-mouth and disrespectful. I am not going there anymore..dont wanna be insulted again and again..

The name itself speaks for itself actually. Located near bidhan nagar railway station its easily noticeable. Had heard some nice things about this place although the reviews at zomato speaks otherwise. So finally thought of giving it a try. Had ordered Doi boras from there. N o my they were huge. 2 of those are enough for an evening snack. I was pretty much impressed. Ambiance,service are average. But who cares about those when u get such good quality food at such low price! Lolz

When looking for pure veg, this place can be in your option list,, besides dhokla chat and dahi vada, the other one that you can try out is chilly baby corn..¬†

The ambiance is not at all good, service is ok-ok and at some points you will miserably feel the deficiency of ¬†hygiene..

P.S. the hot and tasty gulab jamun is a must try..

The vegetarian restaurant is located ar the end of the footpath that leads to bidhannagar railway station . The interiors have been recently revamped , the eatery now therefore has proper tables and seats inside . There is also a new juice bar , right next to the sweets. They also make dosas and other basic south Indian dishes on a tawa outside . They have flavoured soft drinks towards the right at the entrance .  The sweets here are awesome and one must try all of them ! Their hot gulab jamun is a must try and one of the earliest reasons why I visited this restaurant which used to be a sweet shop .   The lyangcha and rasamalai are also great! They have samosas and other salted (namkeen) products in case you don't have an enthusiastic sweet tooth.

I used to visit this place during my college days when I used to have my tuition in karunamoyee. This place is located near sony's showroom in ultadanga. Ambiance is nothing great to talk about. The place is mostly filled maybe cause its pretty reasonable. We used to generally order chats,pav bhaji and noodles. Thought the chats were average to taste on the chinese was not that great it was more on the oily side and achinomoto.. They could improve on their chinese section specially when the footfall in their outlet is pretty high....
