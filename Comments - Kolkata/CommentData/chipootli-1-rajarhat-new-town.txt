Located in the Hangouts of city center 2, this outlet serves best if you are running on a low budget and want to gulp a lump sum amount of food. Various combos will surely make your day!

Some days before I went to CC2 with my Sister and obviously food court is a quite good place for chilling out and eating titbits. So we opt Chipootli for that.
Believe me, I wish I could give negative rating but Zomato Policy didn't allow me to do so :(
So we ordered a "Snacks Platter".
‚Ä¢ Snacks Platter
It contains many kind of snacks. a) Chicken Lollypop b) Fish Fry  c) Chicken Pakora d) Crispy Chicken (Actually I don't know what it's name I mean it was just worse)
The  quality is damn bad. My words are unable to express it's badness. The taste of the all items are overall same except Fish Fry. It's like same taste in different items. The crispy chicken was just worst. It was so chewy and unable to gulp. And the chicken was also not fresh.
So I highly recommend  not to visit this place.

This rating is only for the quick service and good behavior of the staffs. Quality of food was very ordinary and taste was also on a lower side. But they are offering a good quantity of food at very reasonable price range.

Would have given a zero rating to this resturant.I ordered a prawn combo with crispy baby corn and fried rice. And the dish was stale as if it was kept for so many days.I had a stomach ache immediately after eating the food.Please don't visit this place.

Located at the prime location of food court at city centre, Rajarhat. Well the food was not upto the mark as desired.
Ordered MIAMI CHICKEN (8 pieces). Chicken drumsticks topped with potato wedges. In accordance with the quality didnot liked it much. It costs Rs 398 (including Vat)
CHICKEN DELEVARA was the dish which i liked. Costs 220 bucks (including Vat). It had that tangy spicy saicy flavour in it. Good to taste.

This eatery is situated at the food court of City Centre II, Rajarhat. I would definately not recommend to try their foods whoever is reading this review before making their decision.
We ordered a platter consist of spaghetti, chicken meat balls, garlic chicken & chicken drum stick. First of all, they served our platter with 2 extra garlic chicken piece by telling they ran out of meatballs. Secondly, The quantity of spaghetti they serve may not be adequate for grown-up adults. Added to that they served the food cold even after taking more than 15 mins. to prepare it. 
The chicken drum stick was lump of flours and less chicken. Other items were so-so. I did find the deal a bit overpriced too.

Been here yesterday. As we were hungry by the afternoon we headed for lunch at food court which is named as hangout. Ordered our lunch from this Chipootli a combo pack of non veg rice, noodles, chili chicken, chicken fried papad, 2 piece of drums sticks. I couldn't eat noddles due to huge oil into that. Chicken pieces were very very poor and small pieces and some were of besan pieces instead of chicken. How could they serve so poor service? How could they serve besan pieces instead of chicken in the chili chicken? 
Staffs at counter are OK! They took exactly 15 minutes to serve their poor service. 
Will never visit this food store again!
No recommendation either.

I'm not really a fan of food court foods and reluctantly tried a non-veg combo, today evening. That said I was impressed when Chipootli served me a nicely cooked chowmein (which had the perfect spices). The chicken balls cooked in schezwan sauce were also good. But the drums of heven were a bit more tangy than it should have been. All of this for 195 bucks. So if you are hanging out at 'hangout' I'll recommend you to try Chipootli.

While their outlet at CC-I has come to a halt, this one is still surviving. Located at City Center-Rajarhat, they are mostly known for their cheap combo meals. Dropped in here once while I was roaming in the vicinity to try their Chicken Combo Meal. Sufficient quantity of chicken, tasted quite good while having it hot. The rice could have been better though. Can't complain much due to their economical pricing.

Don't know whether they still make momos, but from a counter in CC1 I'd tried their momos which were one of the worst I've ever tasted. They were all smeared in a kind of gooey sauce, and momos were extremely hot, in fact too spicy that the taste actually got obliterated.
