The veg is good. The non-veg is very poor quality.... The keep puting coriander leaves on every item which is a unnecessary. They should know they not everyone likes coriander leaves. You can't feel the difference between a chicken and mutton. Sorry can't rate it higher. Bcz of there poor non-veg special.... But it's good for a vegetarian's....
