Horrible food quality, audacious staff..had a horrible experience previously when we found hair in their gulab jamun..this time since all other restaurants were booked we chose this one..we reached at 3.30 they told us to wait for some time and finally allotted us the table at 3.50 informing us that buffet will close at 4.30..half of the spread was empty..
Finally the icing on the cake one of the staff in the desert counter literally snatched the chocolate syrup bottle claiming they are supposed to serve and we are not supposed to take it ourselves.

Went for a team dinner. Buffet price is 575 including gst. All food along with ambience is so pleasant. Including all, total 15 - 16 starters & main course dishes are available. 4 types of deserts, ice cream was there. Everything is very good in a very good price range.

Recommendation - all fish items are better than chicken and mutton items. (I love fish). So highly recommend everyone to try fish items.

Feedback - chicken creme soup is not so good. It can be done better. I would suggest to make it thicker. And only one flavour of ice creme is available. It would be great if we can get more choices.

Verdict - pocket friendly good shot for all. Must try. I liked it. :D

We initially decided to go for a la carte, but the lunch buffet looked so enticing that we decided to give it a go, and boy, were we impressed!
Each food item was better than the previous. I never thought I'd eat veg from a nonveg buffet, but Mio Amore surprised me with amazing veg food too.
Extremely recommended!

i will give this place a more than average rating for its  lovely food, good ambiance and reasonable price.
i was here for a buffet on a Sunday afternoon and i must say i am quite satisfied. there was a live counter for pasta, ommlete etc. the food menu on the buffet was quite unique and very tasty. ambiance superb and pocket pinch not so much. overall   a nice place to be for continental delicacies.

I tried out Pirich Dolmasi and Shish Taouk here along with blue lagoon. The tastes were so so. You have to wait quite long for a serve though the staff is courteous. But, the wait only gets worthy if the food pleases your taste buds, which I missed here. My suggestion to the team of Mio Amore is to please work on your food quality.¬† Best Wishes!!

First things first....Price dropped!! 475+5%GST= Rs.499(AI) for Non Veg Buffet Lunch w.e.f 15/11/17

Starters:-

1) Soup:- worst ever in my life....water with pudina leaves and 2 V small size "God knows what" in it , looked like Mini Idli

2) Starters:-

Chicken Tandoori:- Full of bones,  less chicken...Tactics to get ur stomach filled.

Boneless Chicken tandoori:- Okayish

Fish Finger:- Same as served in marriage parties but slightly better than Gariahat roadside ones.

Prawn in Barbeque sauce:- Many said 1 % prawn, but I say NO PRAWN...only some flavour & essence of Prawn...It can be better called VEG Balls in Barbeque sauce.

3) Main Course

Fish:--Too sour, over use of lemon...

Chicken:- Simply Home cooked chicken...(Mangshor Jhol)

Mutton Rogan Josh:-  I seriously feel the chef must learn what is Rogan josh

Baked **** Something:-- Only item with corn and cream...tasted good

4) Desserts:-

Chocolate cake

Ice cream with chocolate sauce

Hot Gulab Jamun

Now,

Ambiance is  superb!!! No fault

Behaiour of staff..OK...but I personally didnt  like it....reason's listed below:-

1) I could see the waiters chatting amongst themselves in bengali, but when I spoke to them in bengali, they replied in English and glanced as if I am a poor " Chaaposha Bangali" who has walked in by mistake and as if I do not belong to  their class!!

2) I told them  that whatever bullshit name they might give but their fish maincourse dish was too sour for  the Indian tongue....They said it was a meditteranean dish...at that point I had to tell them that I had travelled across EGYPT & LEBANON and tasted & knew quite a bit about Arabian & Lebanese cuisine( together forming a major portion of medittearnean cuisine)...They glanced as if I am a fekuram.... 

3) I requested, if the chef was available coz I wanted to thank him ( as well as mention about too sour fish!!!) to my utter surprise, there was no chef or  his assistants  and they left, it was only 1 PM‚Ä¶Utterly surprised & seriously thought‚Ä¶.did they even hire a chef or is it actually a well trained ‚ÄúRannar mashi‚Äù (maid/kamwali bai) who finishes cooking before the restro opens & goes to the next place‚Ä¶!!!!!! (someone did mention thatthey havent changed their menu in years)

4) Soup and starters were  served on the table:---This one is  a bit tricky!!! May be they have done it for customers good, but I felt that I was at the mercy of the waiters‚Ä¶ they served small portions and I  had too call them often‚Ä¶and they although didn‚Äôt show but I felt as if I am bothering them too often.

Suggestion:--Make  it a complete buffet rather than serving the starters and not sering main course‚Ä¶.

Not visiting anytime soon again‚Ä¶.

The starter part was good but the prawn balls were full of cornflour n 1% prawn ... Now the main course ... Rogan josh mutton which was very popular n mouthwatering it was just boiled and put into the curry ... the chicken was too hard and the baked fish was okayish.. The best part was the pasta in white sauce ... Coming to the desserts they have the same menu all throughout but they didn't have brownie and neither they took lesser money nor they added something ... Overall it's not a must visit ...

Been there serval times and have to say they really should change their buffet menu now. It's extremely repetitive!!
Now coming to food. Their buffet menu was around Rs.600 with tax, so that's not too much. The food served though repetitive but not disappointing, except for the Prawn Balls that only had cornflour and no prawn. Starters are good and there is a room for lot of improvement. Like the chicken tandoori, the chicken is very dry and ultimately becomes very chewy at the end, but the taste is not bad.
The main course served is very good and tasty. Especially the Greek Style Fish and the Mutton Roganjosh! The rice was simple and very light mixed with peas. It tasted good. The Dal Makhani tasted very good with tandoori roti. There is other options for assorted breads as well.
The desert section included Hot Gulab Jamun, Brownie and Ice cream.
The most intriguing and attractive thing about this restaurant is their decor and ambience. Overall it is a good place to go for it is pocket friendly and food is not bad.

Corporate binge!

Being a corporate associate it's tough to make time for fun. Nevertheless, everyone over here crave for fun and when your company is throwing it, then it's just more than a bliss to us. Thus, when our brand, Tcs was interested to sponsor the night for us, therefore for our only love we chose Mio Amore as the venue to savour the night.

They had vast and alluring buffet system to offer. As we all were famished for anything comes with F - food or fun; thus we finished off the starter counter madly. They had fish and chicken kebabs with chicken wings and prawn balls. All of them were luscious. Moving towards main course we had varieties of pasta, besides these, there were lasagne al porno, rice, dal, preparation of paneer, mutton and chicken. This part was all right to savour. Besides, their stewardship was prodigious to handle the corporate maniac like us. And now comes the dessert part, which they had offered with ice cream escorted by chocolate sauce, and fruits and brownies. Overall, the experience was worthwhile. Cherished it utterly.

We spotted this place one fine day on the top floor of Mani Square Mall and we really liked the menu of the buffet.
Also price is reasonable.
Next day,we went with our group of friends to have lunch here.
The buffet has soup,salads,starters,live pasta,mainvourse and dessert.
‚Ä¢Soup-Streca Della is the name.It is a chicken clear soup and tasted great.

‚Ä¢Starters-The non veg starters section included Chicken Sish kebab,Tandoori chicken,Fish finger with tartar sauce and prawn balls.Salads had an amazing chicken salad,lentils and veg salad.The best from starter section was the soft and yummy fish fingers and the worst being the prawn balls where we did not find a single prawn and it was a ball of flour rather.
Also,from veg section I had paneer shawarma and cheese balls,the former is nice.

‚Ä¢Pasta-We had veg penne in creamy white sauce.The pasta is absolutely lip smacking.Both veg and non veg lovers should surely try this.

‚Ä¢Maincourse-Maincourse section for non veg had Baked fish,Pollo caciatora(chicken),mutton roganjosh.Each and every items tasted nice.It had pilaf rice and Indian breads.From veg section,spinach della,Dal makhani with naan,Mediterranean baked vegetables and paneer butter masala are equally delicious.

‚Ä¢Dessert-The dessert section had hot gulab jamun,Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce,Orange mousse and choco walnut brownies.The brownies are just out of the world.Other items are basic and taste was good.

Was happy with the buffet food however after we finished off with starters the waiters just started circling around our table as if waiting for us to go out although there was zero crowd. Worst part was, after having ice cream we were just sitting and talking and we're about to get the gulab jamun when the waiter just came over and took our plates !!!!!! RUDE!! 2 stars just for the love of mutton and fish

While there are many famed names in Mani Square food court like Chapter two, Kaidi kitchen, Hoppipola, this restaurant is keeping a separate identify for itself. 
Went there to opt for buffet. For starters they had chicken wings, prawn balls in bbq sause , char grilled kebab.
For main course they had greek style fish, pollo asado, mutoon kassa. 
In dessert section they had only vanilla flavoured ice cream with chocolate syrup along with gulab jamun, kulfi faluda.
Greek style fish and kebab was best amongst the lot. 
Ambiance is pretty neat and staffs there are well mannered. 
The price for buffet is very reasonable.

The best part about this place is its ambience and behaviour of their staff.. the food is just about 'okay'.. just how we have "indian chinese'.. these restraunt serves indianized version of Mediterranean Italian and Lebanese cuisine.. in my opinion it should be retitled to a multicuisine restaurant instead unless they 'serve' what they claim.. starters were good and the only saving grace..need to have better options in desserts as well.. its a disappointment if one has the idea of authentic continental food and expects the same from here.. overall 5/10 kinda experience. Pl improve your delicacies as claimed on paper.

Sometime back me and my partner visited the place. The ambience was very pleasing and the behavior of the staff was extremely friendly. We started with the chicken soup that was served on the table. The starters had some awesome salads but the best of the lot was corn salad since it is favorite. The garlic chicken, gravy prawn, fish tandoor and mushroom was good enough for taste buds. Just one drawback of the food was, the chicken was more fried and wasn't marinated well. I ordered for pasta in white sauce which was just awesome.
The main course of fried rice, prawn in chili gravy, palak paneer, polao and paneer tasted well off. We ordered separately for fresh lime soda but unfortunately it was not at all good in taste.
The desserts of gulab jamun, brownie and ice-cream served their purpose.
It was overall a good experience. @

Worst food experience ever! The housekeeping was still acceptable. Went for the buffet lunch. There were not a very vast range of items. The starters were still better but the main course was not at all of any standard. The biriyani did not taste like biriyani, the daal maakhni was not anywhere near to what actual daal maakhni tastes like...and how did they prepare the mutton rogan josh: no salt, no flavour, the mutton was not mutton, it was rubber!! The only thing good in the dessert section was the vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and brownies (probably because it was not prepared by the restaurant staff). My only suggestion is, never opt for the buffet (at least) at this restaurant. 'Mio Amore' no more.

We visited this restaurant during Durga puja. The restaurant was comparitively less crowded than the other restaurants in Mani Square. So initially we were a bit skeptical. But at last we decided to give it a try. The ambience was very beautiful. Prices were reasonable. We had buffet. The buffet spread was good. Taste was excellent. Especially i loved the fish finger. The desert section is really weak. I must mention that the staff behaviour is very good and they take good care. Veg people can also find a lot of options in the buffet. Just need to ask the waiters as all the veg dishes are not on the counter. They serve them at your table.

I have heard about this restaurant many times. So on the evening of Durga-Panchami I have decided to taste their non-veg buffet.

First I have to admit it is really affordable.
Second I must recommend everyone to go with a empty stomach and high appetite.

Each dish was great.
Properly done.
Shish touk (chicken kebab) was the best.
In main dish Pollo Cantania was the star.
Dessert was average.
Two thinks are missing....Swarma Salad and Lebanese biriyani(a rice dish with chicken and herbs).

For a good food experience in a well decorated restaurant within a budget price I must recommend this place.

Went to Mio Amore with colleagues nd opted for the Non Veg Buffet. 
Starters were not up to the mark..the 2 types of chicken kebabs that they serve as starters were not soft at all...the main course was better..specially the fish nd chicken preparation...dessert was ok as well
Need to improve the quality of starters though !!
Overall an OK OK experience but not Great.

Located in Mani Square Mall this place looks like classy.. Decor and ambience is very nice... Now talking about food.. There is also buffet system available but we go for normal ala-car-te.. Though there buffet menu was also seem very mouthwatering.. 
For starter we order Istakoz Firminda..it's probably a Turkish dish.. Taste was good but the prwans were slightly stiff.. Then as for main course we had Gamloroni Formaggi...and this is a real gem.. We complement this dish with Garlic Toast.. And it is very much yummy...it's an Italian dish..with lots of creemy cheese...those who love cheese it's a must try..with prawns and vegetables this dish stole all the thunder... Next we ordered baked fish( not remebering the exact name, as it was the staff's selection) and it is also tasty again complemented with garlic toast.. For dessert we ordered Crepe Fanlasia..its basically a Pancake with ice creams and chocolate sauce.. Though the Pancake was not proper but complemented with Ice creme and chocolate sauce it tasted very good.. 
Staffs are very much co-operative... Prices are not high at all...infact there buffet price also very cheap(non veg was 475+taxes).. Easily affordable place.. Overall nice experience..:)

We had the lunch buffet there. It was a pretty good spread and the starters were served to the table by the waiters.

Mio Amore surprised me! 
Located on the top floor of Mani Square mall, this Mediterranean styled Resturant is beautiful and big. It has good seating capacity with big tables to accommodate large groups! We were an odd 25. 

We opted for the buffet. And it was delicious. The starters had shwarma with humus, Chicken kebabs, Chicken wings fish kebab, prawn balls. For mains we had Fish in spinach prepaprtion, Au gratin, lamb dish and chicken gravy with a flavoured rice. For satisfying the sweet tooth, there was Brownie, Icecream, hot gulab jamun, and fruit cake. 

Overall service was fast. Polite servers.  Great food. Value For money! 

recently I've been very disappointed with the buffet scene in Kolkata, so i rarely prefer buffet over ala carte but this case I'd like to recommend Mio More for being way above what I expected! 

Do I RECOMMEND? Yes. 
Value For Money? Yes
Will I go back again ? Yes.

Date: 29/08/2017.
Location: 4rth floor mani square mall.
Order type: Dine in. (Buffet)
Price: ‚Çπ560.00/- per head (including gst)
Ambiance: The decor, music and all the other stuff are really very classy and beautiful.
Staff and service: Behaviour of the staff is friendly and service is very quick.
Food description: At first chicken clear soup was served. After that the kebabs were served. For starters we had djaj kebab (chicken), fish finger, char grilled chicken wings and at last prawn balls in bar-b-que sauce. I liked the prawn balls the most and did not like the fish fingers at all. They also had 4 types of salads. After that for the main course we had chilli cumin coriander rice, greek style fish, polli cantina, mutton dak bangla, vegetable au gratin, cannelloni florentine. I liked the mutton dak bangla. The chicken was too sweet to be in main course. For dessert we had gulab jamun, orange mousse, swiss roll (chocolate flavour) and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. The orange mousse was very tasty. Vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun were average. And swiss roll was not good at all. Overall the food was quite average for me.

Went for the dinner buffet which was around 560 with tax. The buffet spread had various items, the soup was good, starters were good but could have been better. The main course was really good special the baked potato and dal makhani. Also, the chiken preparation and mutton rogan josh is a must try. The dessert part had hot gulab jamun, pastry, brownie and ice cream. Gulab jamun was good. Brownie was amazing. Overall a value for money experience.

Went here for a friend's treat. First what attracts you to this place is the design of this restaurant. Looks like a very high end restaurant from outside. The interiors are also very nice, giving a very nice ambience. The behaviour of the staff was also extremely polite. So we opted for their buffet. There buffet costs 475+ tax( non veg). And the price for the price it comes,it gives a variety of starters and main course, and all the items are cooked very well and very delicious. Very happy with this place and would definitely go there again.

Went there this afternoon with my friends. We were eight of us, and we took the buffet. The ambience was in perfect sync with the cuisine they served! Coming to the cuisine, one word 'foodgasm'. The starters contained 2 chicken 1 fish and 1 prawn dishes. It was well cooked and delicious! Prawn was extra spicy and in my opinion it went well with the sauce! Coming to the main course rice was amazing..very aromatic! The chicken gravy dish was creamy and very different from the other chicken dishes you normally get in other restaurants....Mutton was great. The spinach something something and the gratin thingy were also putting new sensation to the tastebuds! Not a veg person but the double baked potato was amazing as well...other items in the menu included paneer in gravy, dal makhni type something baked fish and assorted bread. Desert menu was limited, gulab jamuns were amazing had 10 of them brownie was not that good though, hard and tasteless mousse I don't like anyway. Overall amazing mouth watering food. A must try for all. I personally am going there again for sure!
P.S: chicken was halal. Nonveg buffet is 475/- + tax. Veg buffet is 375/- + tax.
Since all the dishes were named in Mediterranean so I do not remember any of the names pardon me for that.üòÖ

Well its my 2nd visit at Mio Amore. We as usual took the buffet menu I thought there must be something changed in the menu but got disappointed as there was no change it was same old the starters were good specially the fist but the prawn in bbq sauce was a totally bad it was chewy, cold and there was no flavour of prawn. The main course was also great but the mutton could have cooked more cause it was so difficult so eat it and in dessert section was very limited food but brownie was great and the gulab jamun was warm. The overall experience was good the ambience and decoration was very pleasant. Overall it was a good experience. But if they could work on there buffet menu add new dishes then it would be nice.

Perhaps for the first time,  I am writing a negative review on a restaurant. My wife, my friend and I today(23.07.2017 at 21:30 hours)  decided to have dinner here. So we went to check the buffet menu. 
Unfortunately,  the man who was standing near the escalator and was supposed to attend the guests, was too rude. He was indifferent. 
We asked him a few details about the dishes especially "Rice with vegetables ". We wanted to know whether it was like Fried Rice or Pulao. To that he said " It comes with vegetables ", in such a manner that we felt really insulted. Did he just assume that we don't understand the meaning of 'vegetables '? More can be said about his attitude,  but let's not say more. 
We are having our dinner somewhere else now. 
We felt insulted,  perhaps he thought that " Yeh logo ka aukad utna nahi hai" or something like that. 
Dear Restaurant, 
Don't judge a book by its cover. 
2 stars for the decor and food menu.

I went there recently with my friends for the first time and to be honest the starters were really delicious from the kababs to the fish dish(picoli). N then there was the pasta (being my favorite) I loved it. It was creamy and beautiful I can't even express in words. Also I tried Rogan Josh for the first time n d meat was perfect and tender n just the way God intended to be. Finally the dessert I had was brownie with vanilla ice cream. I wish I had more space in my stomach. I loved the ambiance n the service was good. I wish to come back again sometime. N shud also recommend people about it.

Had the non-veg lunch buffet yesterday. This is an often-overlooked place that's quite good actually. I mean, if you want a different option this is the place to go. Mediterranean cuisine at its best 

Other than the mutton Rogan Josh all preparations were very good. Mutton was slightly undercooked. Otherwise 4.5.

Went for a lunch buffet on friday... Very well decorated place with perfect ambiance.. 
We didn't take non veg starters.. There were  4nonveg starters- 2chicken starters any 1fish starter were average but  prawn balls in BBQ sauce was very tasty.. Minestronie  soup was good too.. 
I just loved the main course....  There were 6 veg any 3 non veg items along with vegetable rice  and 4options of bread.  We ordered butter nun  and masala culcha which they served within 5minutes.  Pescado capiado (the fish item)  tasted heavenly with the veg rice...  Veg gratin was also awesome..  Mutton rogan josh tasted a bit different though nice...  Butter nun  and kulcha  were also perfect..  I have described only this dishes because I didn't taste all the items.  But  for me the main course was really very good. 
Live pasta  counter is  also available there. 
Desert items were limited but  gulabjamun any flan di naugat were  very tasty.. 
Service was also good..  Loved it.. 
Overall nice experience

Situated at the top floor of Mani squre.....the best looking restaurant of the lot....great ambience,great decorations,nice music playing all around....this was our post GST first lunch out.....

We opted for buffet each and every item was good and cooked to perfection....four types of non veg starters,one soup which was tasted different but good....among the starters the prawn balls and fish item were excellent....

The main course is also good....masala kulcha and butter nun both tasted good with dal makhani and paneer butter masala,the veg rice which was excellent tasted awsm with the fish item or the chicken item or the awsm mutton roghan Josh...

Four types of salads were there...

In deserts four items were there...all were good....

After all it was a really good experience...now the GST is 18% so now eating in a good restaurant is cheaper than pre GST period....Tanushree Chakraborty

My friend suggested me to visit this place atleast once and his suggestion was correct. This restaurant is one of best restaurant in Kolkata.
Last Friday we went for a party. We opted for non-veg buffet.  The cost was very reasonable 475+tax. 

In the starter there were following items: Prawn Balls, Fish Finger, Shish Taouk(Chicken), Tandir Kebab
Prawn Balls and Tandir Kebab...both are fantastic.
In main course we had pescado capiado (fish) Moroccan Chicken and Mutton Do Piyaza.
This fish item was very good. Mutton Do Piyaza was little bit spicy, but that taste was good.
In Desert, regular items were there: Ice Cream/Chocolate Brownie/ Gulab Jamun
Interior/Ambience/Food...everything is perfect and truly praiseworthy.
Surely I will visit this place again..and would suggest others to visit this place. And I am confident that they will also love this place.

Buffet and food was good.  However had not very pleasant experience with the person at the gate who is tasked to welcome guests and allot tables.Almost 60% restaurant was vacant ,we wanted to pick a 4 seater of our choice for 4 person but were forced to a corner inside seat.Was told a lie that the table were booked (nobody came to the table entire time we were there).Not sure what the logic was,but I feel if I walk into a restaurant when most of it is empty I should be able to choose a table of my choice and not forced by somebody to sit in a corner.

Chapter 2 was full on a Monday evening and we were told to wait 30 mins for a table. Without wasting time we went to Mio Amore. The person who greeted us gave us a choice for buffet and ala carte. Buffet spread consisted of both indian and continental menus and the cover charge per person was Rs 475+ taxes. My sister however opted for ala carte and thanks to her we all had a wonderful affair of food. She ordered lebanese , Italian and indian as well, dont know the names though. All the items were just fabulous, really unexpected since we had a bad memory in this place when it had opened its doors for the first time. This was our second visit since then and hell lot of things have changed starting from the ambience to its food and staff. Introduction of lebanese nd italian affair makes it different from other restaurants in the city. Its not as crowded as Chapter 2 or Haka in Mani square, may b people doesnt kno about its delicious food yet. A must visit  place to try lebanese and italian as well as indian dishes with huge quantities. We had to take parcel of the raan that we ordered because of its huge quantity. Five of us were unable to finish it. Love this place. Will visit again soon.

Best price for the money!! I had the afternoon non-veg buffet at the same price as haka(just next to it) but its way better than the latter. The ambience is superb, best for date with your partner, the staffs are friendly and the music is great. The buffet menu is quite good. They got boneless kabab, chicken tandoori, fish roll, prawns and an amazingly light soup. Starter is the best part of the buffet. However the main course has got fish, chicken and mutton, but over spiced. The desert is simple yet satisfactory, though if someone is unlucky can get orange moose!!
Overall an great experience at 500 bucks, its worth the money.

This restaurant is one of the best restaurants in kolkata and I can bet on that. Starting from the decoration to the ambience to the hospitality everything was praiseworthy. We opted for the non-veg buffet which was reasonably priced at 475+taxes.
For the starters there was Fish Fingers, a Boneless Chicken kebab, Tandoori chicken and Prawn balls. And there was also a Chicken clear soup with 2 chicken balls in it. All the starters and the soup tasted amazing. The sauce in which the prawn balls were tossed were perfect. It was spicy yet the heat was balanced with a little sweetness. The boneless chicken kebab was cooked to perfection and so was the tandoori kebab. Then fish fingers were the best fish fingers I have ever had. The quality of the fish was amazing and the taste was heavenly. Even the mint dip and tarter sauce provided with the starters were also very good.
There was a chicken salad as well which I didn't try but my friend said that it was good.
For the main course there was a cheesy fish preparation which tasted amazing. Then there was a chicken dish, pilaf and mutton rogan josh. The chicken dish was not upto the mark and so was the pilaf. The mutton roganjosh was good but nothing special. We ate the mutton with butter naan. More brrad options were available but we had butter naan which was very good.
For the desserts there was gulab jamun which I didn't try but my friend said it tasted good. There was chocolate cake which was very good. It tasted more like chocolate brownie. There was vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce to accompany the cakes. There was orange mousse as well which was also good but the chocolate cake was the best among all the desserts.
We also had Screw Driver and Strawberry Smoothie. Both of the drinks were good.
Coming to the service, it was very slow. It took them long to serve another helping of the starters but it was worth the wait.
They should definitely work towards improving that.
And another word of advice to the marketing management authority of the restaurant, do mention in Zomato separately that you guys have a buffet option at this reasonable price. No where in zomato is it mentioned that there is a buffet option available. Until and unless someone reads other people's review who have had food from their buffet, people would not know about it. The buffet of this place is way better than most of the restaurants offering buffet in Mani Square so do utilise that.
Will definitely visit again. üòä

The restaurant  serves all kinds of Turkish and Italian food..We ordered a Shish Taouk which was mouth watering want to try out again someday, in main course we ordered a Pollo Cantina an Italian Delicacy, would recommend everyone to try out. In desert they served us a Crepe Fantasia which
 fulfilled our sweet tooth. Recommended for all as they also serve buffet along with ala carte.

The ambience is in one word BEAUTIFUL... the fountains, cozy sofas, paintings, lighting everything made the place ideal for a romantic date. The staff's were polite and courteous. We opted for the Non-veg buffet. The starters were really good. But the main course was really disappointing. The mutton was not cooked properly. The chicken was dry. The fish florentine and the lasagne was good. Coming to dessert, mousse was really light and tasty. The chocolate cake was dense but the winner is the gulab Jamun. Hot and soft in the centre. Overall, it was fine.

P.S: The purple rain mocktail was the perfect companion to the Mediterranean fare.

Not worth a place to have good decent family meal.

High on taste and value for money!!Had a lunch buffet .....The manager was courteous. He guided us to a table. The ambience was pretty good: had good music and a fountain, tables decorated with nice hanging lamp shades. We opted for a buffet..Had chicken cream soup- it was piping hot and was creamy and delicious. there were 4 starters which were very nice.(refer the menu pic). Tandir kebab and prawn balls in bbq sauce are worth mentioning. The main course was equally palatable. Mutton Rogan Josh has stolen the show in this category! I feel that the desert section wasn't at par with the starters and main course. Vanilla ice cream ,gulab jamun , brownies and bread pudding failed to create the magic and satisfaction that is required after a good meal. The brownies were hard and the vanilla ice cream had almost melted. Gulab jamun was average and contained hard masses inside it..overall it was a nice lunch.  Well u cannot wish for a perfect buffet at this price!!!!

Huge space. Absolutely beautiful decor. Great location.

Yet, the food quality is definitely not at par with all these plus points.

Have tried the lunch buffet twice, and the dinner buffet once, over the last couple of years.

The starters were excellent, the soup was good.
But on all the occasions, the main course has been disappointing.

On one occasion, the baked fish was extremely bland. On another occasion, the mutton was chewy.
All in all, it seemed that the main course dishes had exotic names and appearance, but did not taste half as good.

Desserts was less disappointing.

Have never tried the a la carte menu, so cannot comment. But the buffet, as far as I am concerned, is not completely worth the money.

Both of them looked and tasted awesome.
The decor was also nice.
Overall a good experience and would like to visit again.

A well decorated restaurant with not so good tasty food. 
Quality and quantity is good. We went for a buffet which was comprises of a lot of different variety but few imp thing were missing in the Lebanese cuisine. 
The most important of the dish, tahini i didn't like it so much .  
Worth to visit once and if you like any food do drop a review so others can do the menu selection right.

I went for the buffet. The starters are fine. The prawns being the best. The main course isn't that good. The deserts are good but nothing extraordinary. The worst part was the service. They were serving 1 piece at one time. We had to call them several times to get us the starters. We liked the prawn but when we called them the 4th time they didn't even serve us. So mio amore restaurant turned out to be a great disappointment. Not visiting again.

I visited today on lunch buffet with my sister.. It was a OK experiance.. As the starter was really good specially the fish tikka n prawn ball..and pasta ..yummy..Bt the main course was quite disapointed as the pulao was cold and too hard to chew.. nxt is mutton which is undercook.. now come the dessert part which is THE worst part as there was only normal fruit cake, n ice cream, & nrml fruits which they served after saying two times in..n even the cake was a nrml fruit cake. Bt ok with the service as the r helpful.. so i will gave 3 out of 5..

The place seems to be a classic example of trying to do too many things but not managing to master any. While in terms of continental menu offered in their buffet, it is quite good. But the Indian dishes seemed most ordinary. The best thing about the buffet were the starters which were quite nice and varied. They have good potential to grow into a nice continental food joint. But might need to sacrifice the Indian dishes from their menu or get the act together somehow to manage multiple cuisine offerings together.

No question about their deco, ambience, sttafs n service... all are very very good... but I think they need to re alter their seting arrangements... so that they can accommodate small groups or couples... tried some of their mocktails with their buffet spread... the mocktails are very good... the buffet spread was decent consisting of nos of dishes... I liked their kebabs and the chicken dishes... also liked their veg augratin... it was excellent... all the others were very decent... they also need to arrange for preserving the ice cream boxes properly... it was not accepted from this place at all... However it was a good experience... pocket pinch was decent too...

First of all the location of this restaurant is prime, on the 4th floor of Mani Square. Secondly the interiors are freaking awesome. Imagine yourself at a plush middle eastern mansion sipping a glass of wine and watching glamorous belly dancers perform on a podium accompanied with Arabian music like you see in movies, and that's how you would feel when you enter this classy Mediterranean-speciality restaurant. Also the seating is comfortable and spacious. 
Thirdly the staff works really hard to cater all one needs. 
And fourthly and finally the food here is top notch. They offer one of the cheapest and splendid buffets in the city. So, We opted for the buffet spread which could satisfy us thoroughly. Even the veg items were surprisingly delectable. A la carte is also available but I would suggest to go for the buffet as it offers a variety of delicious fusion food from which you can indulge in as much helpings as you want. 
Go for Mio Amore..!

Visited the restaurant on 9.10.16 ¬†with family for a buffet dinner. The food especially the maincourse was garbage. the biriyani and the side dishes were gross and the meat was surely stale and was ¬†tasteless. The abiance was good.The behaviour of the staffs were poor. The Manager of the restaurant , Mr Yadav was rude and asked us to leave the resataurant just after one and a half hours as he had a booking ¬†for the table about which he never informed us(according to the manager you have to leave within 1 hour 30 mins after enteringthe restaurant ¬†even if you are having a buffet ¬†lunch/dinnner ) . ¬†The ¬†complete buffet was ready 1 hour behind the scheduled time . To say the least ¬†visiting the restaurant was a waste of time ¬†and money . Will recommend people to avoid the restaurant .

A friend brought me here as a treat for his new job, and we were taken aback at the reasonable rate for the buffet and we opted for it. The starters were amazing to eat and the freshly made pastas were too good. If I had thrown away my shame that day, I could have had a bit more pasta. The main course was where we were brought down to earth. The containers were not somehow warm and all the food kept there were sitting and getting cold. The meats were hard and cold. It was only when they were freshly refilled that we could get the real taste. The desserts were good. I will definitely visit this place again to try the ala carte menu.

We had Tandir kebab which was a milder version of tandoori chicken, average taste. An italian dish with chicken n mushroom in white gravy, served with pasta which was great. Another chef's special item with chicken in red sauce was very blunt at taste. The best item was the cheese bread- warm, soft n flavoured. Overall average experience. 1 extra point for nice ambience.

The taste were different and we all liked it, starting from the tangri kebab and prawn balls in starter to the mutton biriyani... The chiken main course dish was fabulous which tasted better when had with butter nan.. The thing that i liked the most ,was the live pasta counter.. Tge deserts and drinks were equally good,so was the ambiance and the service

My friend was too excited to visit this place and I followed her choice.
Located on the topmost floor of the Mani Square mall, the interior is nice.
We opted for the non-veg buffet lunch.
First disappointment: there wasn't any welcome drink. The list of mocktails was a tiny one of just three items. Nothing was appealing. So we didn't order any.
Among all the starters served, the prawn pakora tasted yummy compared to the fish tandoor, chicken tandoor and Lebanese chicken. And the soup almost made me puke! Second disappointment.
In the maincourse, the chickpeas salad was fresh but the other veg salad was below average. The chicken curry was good, but the mutton curry tasted over-spiced. The fish in white dressing tasted really great. We took small portions from the veg section too. One of them was a cheese filled something. Oh My God! That tasted heavenly! And yes, the pulao was good too.
Third disappointment: Just 4 items in the dessert section. Chocolate muffins, pineapple cake, Gulab jamun and vanilla icecream, and a bottle of chocolate sauce placed at one corner of the table. The pineapple cake was yuck causing the fourth disappointment and the icecream was already molten being the fifth.
The sixth disappointment was complained by many as the items weren't refilled on time, even after several requests. Maybe the management weren't expecting such a crowd even on Mahalaya.
Last but not the least, the Axis Bank 15% discount is a hoax for buffet people. It's applicable only on Ala-carte. But seriously, who opts that here?

 A good trick played by my friend. üòÇ

This is located at Mani Square. Good and clean place. The decor is simple but spacious. Children can play around. The major attraction is their food and the variety. The place serves both buffet and Ala Carte. 

We ordered some delicious dishes and they were lovely. The service is awesome and very helpful. They serve alcohol. This place is not expensive according to the dishes they serve. 

One must visit this place in order try some delicious Mediterranean dishes to satisfy their hungry stomach.

Mani square mall, apart from quest and south city gives some really good and economical food options. One such restaurant is the Mio Amore restaurant situated on the 4th floor of Mani square mall. It has a different entrance as compared to the other restaurants and has a huge space with proper spacing between tables. The ambience and lighting are soothing the water fountain adds to it.
Coming to food, the buffet option is something I will recommend to go for because of two reasons. First, the prices are 475+ taxes even on weekends; second within this price there are lot of options in both veg and nonveg. 
They start with a brilliantly prepared chicken soup followed by two varieties of salad. In the starters, they have chicken tandoori, chicken kabab, fish kabab, prawn balls, all of which are lipsmacking. Coming to main course, they have Greek fish, chicken curry and kosha mutton which allows you to tempt even after you have consumed considerable quantity of salads and starters.
Service, I did not find it to be exceptionally good as compared to other eateries, but yes they are somewhere decent.
In the end, if you want to have an economical yet tasty buffet, this is the place to be with your family and friends.

While waiting for the visits hours at the nearby Apollo Hospital, I ventured to Mani Square and stumbled upon this place after deciding the other choices might be heavier and it might be better to check out some Mediterranean dishes. We passed on the buffet that seemed to be a medley of pasta dishes and desserts and didn't look too appetizing. The vibe was further eroded since the three dishes we ordered from their main menu were really, really sub par. First and that's where they pretty much lost me was their hummus. It seemed watery and likely from pre made frozen concentrate. It was downright nasty. How can a Mediterranean or Lebanese place not make fresh hummus is beyond comprehension! Second, so called grilled kebabs were equally baseline lacking texture or aroma. Total disappointment. Miraculously they also offered an Indian menu. Playing safe we ordered the next round of dishes from this menu and it was barely acceptable with flimsy portion sizes. I would unequivocally suggest folks go to a different spot if you are looking for any kind of well cooked Mediterranean food. 
'Mio Amore' is supposed to be 'my love' in Italian, but after eating there I would say it's more like 'Mio Avversione'. No need to look that up!

Well maintained, decent food, delightful buffet and humble courteous staff tucked in one corner of the mani square mall on the top floor.
I went on a weekday where they have buffet options.
They rates are very reasonable in comparison with the quality and variety of food.
But, having emphasized itself as Mediterranean restaurant, Mediterranean food options in Veg Buffet was just one starter.
The taste of food and service is quite good. I recommend this place if you want to spend quality time over meal.

Buffet spread and food quality was below par to say the least. The spread included dishes from varied cuisines that did not gel together. Everything had a fancy name but it was clear that they were lazily prepared. The rice especially was bland and boring and so were the appetizers. The prawn appetizer had a thick coating and had barely any prawn it it. I felt cheated as it was one of the highlights of the menu displayed outside the restaurant. The cakes reminded me of cheap roadside bapuji plum cakes and Jalajog. The entire spread screamed out "itna paisa mein itnaich milega".the only thing good about this place was the decor... Never going back.

Absolute disaster. What a waste of ingredients. The soup was salted boiled milk, the prawn starter had no prawn in it and everything else was pretty much on the same line as horrendous. Don't think they do a taste test of what they serve. Jalajog makes better pastry and honestly I make better mixed veg! It was just panch meshali with baby corn. It had borboti for heaven sake. Thank god I had amazing company. Please do not waste ingredients like this. You are wasting food by making such crappy dishes! Horrible!

The mocktale was good...Moroccan rice with sheesh kabab was very nice specially the kababs...they were soft and juicy and less spicy...baked fish was pretty good..
But we are not satisfied with starter and spaghetti in main course....for the starter the batter was thick and so we couldn't get the proper taste of prawn and squid.....for the spaghetti the taste was not so much Italian rather it was much more Indianised in taste which is very disappointed for me...
But it was a good experience as well

The place is huge and well staffed. The quality of service is good. 

We chose buffet. The buffet is a continental one. Starters: Really good. But they should try some better continental items.

Main Course: Was pretty good as well. Lamb preparations could have been a tad bit better. They needed more softening.

Dessert: They kept a safe dessert platter. But they were yummy.

Since this is a continental restaurant they had more ro.e for fitting in some good continental items. They could have experimented a little with their tastes. However they came up with a good list of items which can be enhanced. So expecting them to be better next time. 6/10.

572 INR AYE Buffet on Friendship Day! Thank God for my company of BAEs, else I would have given 1 rating! This was my 3rd time lunching in Mio Amore (3rd time lucky, but in my case, luck was on a holiday!) The starters was OKAY, with chicken meatball ... more like, rashmalai, soup. Two tiny pieces of balls, one attached with a chilli stem. When asked the waiter to change my soup, he did, but returned with a fresh bowl, only to tell me, that it was only parsley & not chilli stem, (well he was on a mission to prove me wrong). Next were the prawn balls, What with the balls guys. Prawn balls, were deceptive. I guess they swam to the waters out of sheer fear because the balls were 'battered' only! the main course was dull, and the cutlery, well attaching the pics. You see for yourself!

A very underrated place. I am saying underrated because the whole time we were eating the buffet, i.e. for about 1.5 hours, the only customers were us.The ambience and decor were awesome, special mention to the music. The waiters were very helpful.The buffet was delicious. For 475 bucks (with tax- around Rs. 575) per person, it was a very good spread.First, there was the Straciatella, the chicken meat balls clear soup. Nothing extraordinary, but it was good.For starters, there were Pollo alla pomodoro (Italian, translates to "Chicken Tomato" in English), Tandir kebab, Fish fingers, and Prawn balls in barbeque sauce; and after that, the Chicken salad . Every item was good, but I will specially mention the Pollo alla pomodoro and the Prawn balls. Apart from the nice taste of the pollo alla pomodoro, the chicken pieces were very soft. And the barbeque sauce of the prawn balls was delicious.The main course had Greek Fish (didn't like it; those who are cheese lovers unlike me may enjoy it), Pollo asado (again Italian, translates to "Grilled Chicken" in English; an awesome chicken preparation with a sweet tangy taste) and Mutton roghan josh (was well prepared, but was dimmed by the previous one). There was also rice with vegetables and bread of your choice.On the desserts menu was Chocolate brownies, Orange mousse, Hot gulab jamun and Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. The gulab jamun were not up to the mark, the rest were very good and the ice cream‚Äî heavenly.All in all, a very satisfying experience. I would recommend this place.

Few day ago I had visited this place for dinner with my family.... Outside and inside was beautifully decorated, also waiting room was very eye catching.... Ambiance was good.... They have huge space ,but I think they could not utilized it well.... Staffs were well behaved.... We tried their buffet, veg and non veg both items were available.... All items from starters to desert were not up to the mark.... Starter was average.... In the main course veg items were very good than non veg items.... Also desert was not good , because Ice cream was totally melted, Firni tasted like Khir, Brownie was very hard.... Separately we ordered one Virgin Blue Lagoon & Purple Rain Mocktail, both were good.... Cost of buffet was very cheap....

Was facinated by the different cuisines served by them and the good buffet menu.  Went imside to try it out.  Ambience would make you feel nice but the food might not.  Didnt feel anything extra special. The rice tasted funny and the nans werent exactly what I had in mind. The chicken kebabs were nice though and I filled myself with it. :p

This place is freaking awesome. Imagine yourself at a plush Middle-Eastern mansion sipping a glass of wine and watching glamorous belly dancers perform on a podium accompanied with Arabian music like you see in movies, and that's how you would feel when you enter the classy Mediterranean-speciality restaurant owned by Chef Pradip Rozario (who is the pioneer of fusion food in Kolkata and also owns KK's Fusion and Kurry Klub) serving Turkish, Moroccan, Lebanese, Greek and Italian cuisine. 

The place exudes charm, elegance, sophistication and a tranquil Mediterranean ambiance with graceful decors like elegant Turkish marble fountains with gentle trickling water, Moroccan ceiling lamps, furniture and ornamental Morrocan walls adorned with pictures of exotic Mid-Eastern women, statuettes, salad bowls, pristine terrazzo flooring and a quaint bar. Soothing Mid Eastern music plays in the background to align with the theme.

They offer one of the cheapest and most sumptuous buffets in the city. A la carte menu is also available but may appear expensive to some so I would suggest if you are visiting it for the first time you should opt for the buffet spread for a choice of a variety of delectable items from which you can indulge in as much helpings as you want. Hospitality off staff are also praiseworthy. They rush from table to table inquiring after guests' comfort and even inform how to eat a particular dish.

We dined on both the buffet as well as a la carte options. From the buffet we helped ourselves to tandir kebab (chicken), shish taouk (chicken) samak chermoula (fish), prawn balls in bar-b-que sauce, pollo cantina (chicken), mutton rogan josh, rice with veg, sauteed vegetables, chilli herbs potatoes, spinachi dello chef, paneer tak-a-tak, dal makhani and four other items whose names I can't recall, and chocolate cake, pudding, phirni and ice cream for dessert. They served the cream of chicken soup included in the buffet at our table. For the a la carte dinner I personally ordered couscous chicken stew in the mains and Crepe Fantasia as the dessert. The couscous "is described as a national dish of Morocco, certainly one of the most well-known dishes, served with chicken stew with Moroccan spices." The Italian crepe dessert consisted of chocolate pancake filled with ice cream and topped with chocolate sauce and garnished with two chocolaty wafers. Among the buffet fare liked the shish taouk which is a traditional Turkish shish kebab and yogurt-marinated chicken grilled and served with rice, and also the tandir kebab which is a Lebanese tandoor kebab made of whole chicken baked in an oven and marinated with yoghurt, thyme, parsley and spices. The samak chermoula was also flavorsome, which is the famous Mediterranean chermoula marinade rubbed into fish steaks and cooked in charcoal fire and served with rice.
They provided toothpicks, paper napkin and Mentos mouth fresheners after the hearty dinner.

Mio Amore: Mediterranean Kitchen & Wine thus is a great option if one's looking for Mediterranean cuisine or tastes that are out of the ordinary and not really conventional. To feel like you are in Turkey, Morocco, Lebanon, Greece or even Italy, and to enjoy a splendid, mellow atmosphere of rhythmic melodies and stylish world-class dining experience then Mio Amore or My Love is the place to be in Mani Square, a quiant world away from the outside hustle and bustle.

Although the ambience was calm and serene and the buffet menu looked tempting - nothing and absolutely nothing about mio amore could impress us. It was disappointing right from the moment when the waiter refused to serve the starters on our table stating there are a lot of customers today - sadly only 4-5 tables were occupied. I was shocked and started wondering what's the footfall on other days! Then gradually as I progressed with my lunch I realized that just maybe he's right - people might not want to revisit this place ever.
The cream of chicken soup smelled of raw milk-which was obnoxious.Live pasta counter didn't have anyone, and there was cold pasta which tasted extremely poor because of the sauces used.all the starters -be it fish chicken prawn seemed tough chewy and rubbery-i couldn't gobble them up.only veg augratin was somewhat edible although it left ur taste palate sweetened to the core.the fish,rice,paneer and naan were the only things that saved my appetite.the dessert consisted of firni which was nothing like conventional firni.it was extremely sweetened khir kinda thing.
overall experience -extremely poor.
service provided-pathetic-they need to understand that even in the busiest buffet joints they never refuse the customers from serving the starters onto their tables!

Mio amore has been on the culinary scene for quite sometime now but still have not made a significant impact in luring the food enthusiasts of the city . After going through the zomato reviews , it is clearly visible that most of the people come here to avail the buffet which is available at quite a decent price . 

With a stunning ambience and a buffet serving at a decent price one should expect this place to be flooded with patrons . But this is not exactly the case . I was in the mood for some buffet experience and hoped in this afternoon with a curious mind and a lot of  expectation .

¬∞ Location :- Topmost floor in the Mani square mall , kankurgachi .

¬∞ Ambience :- Absolutely stunning . In fact I was so much awed by the interior , i spend the first 5 minutes talking abt it with my partner . The place is spacious . There are couple seatings as well as seatings for smaller groups and larger groups as well . There are 2 beautifully decorated fountains inside the restaurant which adds to the serenity of the place . With a pleasant music playing in the background , it was a perfect ambience go have a good meal with your partner .

¬∞Food :- As you can already see that it's a 3.5 star rating from my side . A joint with so much potential it is disheartening to see them being a mediocre  in the main but basic department of being a good restaurant . Let me give you a clear detail as to where things went wrong and where they did right to pull out a 3.5 star .

Straciatella soup ( 2 / 5 ) :- This is the only item they serve at the table , and the rest you have to take from the counters . The taste put me off from the first sip . The broth had an over exposed amount of butter and sweetness which made it almost inedible . The chicken pieces inside the soup were nice but the soup destroyed it completely . I could not complete the item and left it aside . A very very poor beginning .

--------------------------------------------------------------
STARTERS :- 
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Prawn balls in BBQ sauce ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- A very cleverly packaged dish . By adding the name prawn they have tricked us into believing they have an actual item in the menu . There was no flavor of prawn to indicate that they have minced the prawn in the meat balls. But apart from that the balls were tasty and tangy as the sauce was good in the month . Not a bad starter if you ask me .

2. Tandir kabaab ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Smoked chicken pieces ,mostly leg portions . They are really very very slow in refilling the counters . As a result of which most of the food becomes cold . They donot keep the trays under burners so it cools down after sometime . The first time we had these kabaab they were cool and dry , after refilling we tried again and they were really good .

3. Samajh Chermoula ( 3 / 5 ) :- The only fish starter , was very very excited about this . But it was a huge letdown . The kabaabs seemed to be grilled a day before and served after just heating . That is entirely my belief . They didnot seem fresh . Mostly dry and lacking the juice , it was not a pleasant experience for us . But thankfully the fish didnot have any smell .

3. Sish taouk ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- More like the chicken malai kabaab. It was a tad dry but still not bad as a starter . Seemed quite good .

A word of advice in this department is to keep refilling the items with time . People in charge of service should be efficient enough to understand when they need to refill items in the counters . No matter how small the number of guests are in the restaurant they should not allow food to be cold in the counters . Something I was not expecting from them and I want them to take into concern .

-------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN COURSE 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Really pleased with them, not many buffer serving restaurants score in this department . But this is the only reason i am giving it a 3.5 star . Otherwise it was gonna be a 3 star for me.

1. Pescado Capiado ( 4 / 5 ) :- More like fish florentine . This is such a delightful dish . With good portions of basa cooked in cheesy gravy , i could not have enough of it . This is a must try . 

2. Polo Cantina ( 4 / 5 ) :- Your traditional chicken curry . No complains , the taste was spot on and the chicken pieces were tender . With a lot if curry , this is a good dish to go with the rice .

3. Mutton Rogan Josh ( 5 / 5 ) :- The star of the show . This is where we got our money worth . The highlight of the day, the mutton was cooked perfectly . I almost cannot remember mutton cooked so well in any buffet serving restaurant.  The meat was surprisingly soft and the gravy was so tasty . It felt like homemade mutton curry . We had a lot of mutton today courtesy to this stunning preparation . A huge standout applause to them in getting atleast the mutton item spot on . One can just have as much mutton as he wants and make his money worth .

4. Rice with veggies ( 4 / 5 ) :- well cooked . Similar to veg pulao . Compliments well with the main items .

--------------------------------------------------------------
DESERT :- 
--------------------------------------------------------------

Probably the worst desert serving ever . The items are :- 

1. Fruit and cake pudding ( 2 / 5 ) :- very mediocre 

2. Choco vanilla cake ( 1 / 5 ) :- dried and not fresh at all .
 
3. Ice cream ( 0 / 5 ) :- Yes, u read it right . I had only one expectation . And that is to have some ice cream . They kept the vanilla in a jar and it melted. Instead of refilling it , they served the melted ice cream to us . I was angry and dissapointed as their atrocity . This type of negligence and unprofessionalism is not expected.

4. Firni ( 4 / 5 ) :- it was really tasty . Molten kheer , it was a treat . If it was not for this my desert experience was gonna be a disaster . It was still a disaster though after my ordeal with the ice cream. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

The service was prompt and courteous . Other than the items mentioned  above i had fresh lime soda sweet which was quite well done . It costs 50 rupees . 

Certain points to look at :- 

***  Good :- 

1. Main course ... especially mutton 

2. Kheer .

3. Stunning ambience .

4. Buffet at a very decent price .

*** Bad :- 

1. Mediocre starters .

2. Poor refilling of food at counters .

3. Pathetic deserts .

A place with so much potential cannot afford to get a 3.5 stars . I would urge them to up their tempo . Look into the departments I have mentioned in the miss department . When you are keeping lesser items in the menu , it is very important to get at least those items right . A would like to give it a 4 star rating someday . The super tasty mutton and the stunning ambience is what i am taking away for now .

If you're out of for dinner or lunch in around north Kolkata and looking for something other than the Chinese and mughlai, I urge you to consider dropping by Mio Amore! Brilliant decor and amazing ambience to say the least. 

We were four, and in order to quench our long kept Italian craving, we ordered a fish & prawn risotto, chicken carbonara, Spaghetti bolognese in meat sauce, a meat lasagna & 3 portions of garlic & cheese bread! 

Although all the above dishes had to be baked, the serving was lighting quick amidst the busy Sunday lunch hours! Very impressive! 
The food! First came the Risotto! The risotto they serve is one in smoked white sauce, had just enough garlic! The broth was quite creamy had an uniform consistency, with the garlic put in in the perfect amount! 

Next came the Spaghetti bolognese in smoked chicken sauce! This was yummy! The Spaghetti was well cooked, the sauce cooked just right with enough charcoal flavour and minced chicken in it! The aroma of herbs was just right! Brilliant!

Next came the Spaghetti carbonara. This dish however didn't appeal to me much. Although the sauce was as creamy as it could get, the consistency was way too thick for me. The flavor was a little too blunt for me! 

The best was saved for the last! The chicken lasagna! The lasagna was loaded with chicken, and the flavour was mouth savoring! I'd have preferred a leeeettle less herbs and more cheese definitely! But it was surely the best of the lot. 

The garlic cheese bread they served was just fine with enough amount of cheese! 

Overall a very very satisfying experience! Shall definitely visit again!

One of the worst experience I have ever had. When we entered, no body was there to attend. I  opted for a lunch buffet. Very sorry to say that the soup comes later after starter. Anyway soup was so so type. Starter was pathetic. Chicken dishes was too much sweet. The fish wasn't properly baked,even had to wait for 15 minutes to refill it. And the main course; better not to talk about this. The only good thing is the ambience. It was good. But I cant rate it more than 2 if it has ambience only. I expect a good cooked food

Went today for lunch.It was one of the most horrible meals i've ever had.The soup did not have properly boiled vegetables.The starters lacked salt.The salad kept in the buffet had rotten tomatoes.The only dishes which were bearable were grilled potato,Au gratin & the Pasta.
Desserts had ice cream which too wasnt frozen well.Cake was v.hard too.
We had to constantly ask for water.
The only saving grace was the company i had for lunch..:)

Am impromptu lunch date with my sister ended up being a good afternoon spent. Just walking around Mani Square we decided to go try Mio Amore and we were pleased. The cuisine suited our pallettes as i am a big Italian  as well as Mediterranean food fan. The decor and music was subtle, the staff  friendly. We went for the lunch buffet and all the dishes were tasty but a special cheers to the Pescado capiado (hope i got the dish name correct.. it was a fish in white creamy gravy). It is one of the best fish dishes i have tried. Hope to visit again soon and even try out the a-la-carte menu too.

Looking at the exterior and interior I had second thoughts for it to be very expensive, but then the buffet menu was there that saved us. Sumptuous lunch for two enough varieties like baked fish, fish finger, kebabs and other menus. Their food is awesome and would like to come back with more people this time. The waiters are always in a hurry since the rush is huge. They billed us 1200 incl of all and we were content. Ambience is great and had better things to offer them other restaurants present there.

I might be biased as I had my first date there, but this place really played an important role in the decision making process. I was amazed at his choice of place. He seemed to have a good taste of food and place. Lovely ambiance and food and most importantly felt very romantic. I can guarantee over the food and ambiance, may be the romance was my mind's add on factor.

It took me 3 visits to decide this. It took me more than 30 items in the menu to finally convince myself. It took me hours of grilling and harassing the staff, to finally satisfy myself that Mio Amore deserves more accolades than it has been given thus far. On my first visit, the executive chef Mr Rozario cooked a¬†live meal for me, on my second, I tried their buffet, on my third, I got a chance to taste their Ala Cart√©.

A first time visit for Sunday dinner!. The ambiance is quite good interms of interior, decor and spacing. But no theme music is audible, I don't know whether it is on being an Mediterranean restaurant . There is less number of two seaters more of large table However, we got our seating just close to buffet section. And this is quite irritating as when people came to pick up their food our table is getting shakes. Both buffet and ala carte are available. Buffet has set menu with some good options. Starters and soup are served on the table. Rest items from buffet. 2/3 types of starters of Indian, Lebanese and Mediterranean cuisine. One soup. Live pasta! They also have 4 varieties of desserts in the buffet. Veg buffet is Rs 375/- and Non Veg buffet is Rs 475 /- exclusive of taxes. ¬†Food taste and quality is no doubt very good. On the other hand Beverage menu is not that impressive . Only four varieties of cocktails and few cocktails. ¬†It was a quite busy on Sunday dinner. The service is prompt and warm. Value for money and can be hang out once a while. Authenticity not very sure

Tried out for the first time. Experience was good. Ambience is good and spacious. Service is fine. Foods are really good. But some problems I would like to point out. We went for buffet and took non veg. We were told to receive veg dishes as well. Except for paneer swarma they did not serve any. Keeping that aside kebabs and tandooris were nice. But I felt tandoori chicken was bit elastic. I hope it needed some more minutes to cook. Fish finger was good. The main course were awesomeüòç  I loved it like anything. Kudos for that. Desserts were simple and fine
Overall its good and recommended üëç

Worst buffet I ever had.. Yesterday I visited there for first time. But they totally spoiled my mood by serving nonsensical foods.. that too they could not serve in sufficient amount.
Their was a party going on apart from this. But the party was pre booked . why that situation happened I don't HV idea.. We complained their manager regarding their mismanagements. He agreed. But did not serve any complementary , we paid full amount with vat, service tax.

Please never visit them. Better if you choice other restaurants in mani square..

I had visited this place a year back but my review is solely based on my visit yesterday for our team dinner.
Now coming to the review, we arrived at the restaurant at around 7:15 and were welcomed by the staff, though they didn't provide any welcoming drinks but on asking by some people they provided a small glass of Pepsi which they added was an one time affair. Now the restaurant is spaciously decorated and lighted.Yet many people couldn't find seats and so had to stand while eating.
Coming to the food there was salads like chicken salad,corn and Russian,for starters there were chicken tandoori, chicken kebab, fish kebab and baby corn. Out of these I liked the corn and the rest were average. The chicken tandoori was getting hardened in the ac and hence i had to throw away the rest.The chicken salad didn't have any chicken in it and corn salad was spicy. Next for main course there were moroccan chicken,mutton dopiaza ,a fish item, rice ,naan ,paneern,dal makhani.Also there was a cheesy item stuffed with palak and paneer but alas I couldn't get any of it.The main problem was that the food was getting over and people had to wait for the next refill. But this shouldn't have occurred as the staff should be aware that in buffet people do eat too much.
Coming to desserts it was the same average affair , we had orange mousse,firni,gulab jamun (which was over and hence I had to take one piece only) and ice cream. The firni was delicious and so was the mousse.
Overall the buffet was average but yeah I won't recommend anyone to eat here.But I haven't yet tasted the ala carte so can't speak for it.Maybe I will visit once again to try the ala carte.

We have been to this place about four times now and I am assuming those are enough visits to pen a decent review. Though the Zomato details section doesn't mention it, the restaurant does carry a Indian menu apart from the Italian and Lebanese. This is important because (a) a major part of the buffet is from the Indian menu, and (b) they should probably stick to this.
The 2 occasions that I have ordered Lebanese were utter disasters and I am sorry to say both of those were on days when we were celebrating a special occasion. The Italian dishes are decent but some of them, like the risotto, should just be left alone if you aren't competent enough to handle it. As a foodie who has a special corner for risotto and having tasted it in Italy itself (including Rome, Florence, and a quaint charming place called Lucca), I can rest assure that what I got in a plate in Mio Amore was everything but a risotto.
On our latest visit, we decided not to take any risks and stuck to Indian. We chose ala carte as usual. The mister asked for chicken malai kebabs and was told they aren't available. He went with his 2nd choice of sheesh touk. I was happy to order my chicken tikka kebabs. Both the starters tasted good. For the main course, we ordered paneer butter masala and jeera rice with a super fancy name. I tried ordering with the name too but the server was kind enough to say - jeera rice chahiye na, toh wohi boliye!' üòÅüòÅ The rice was decent. The paneer gravy smelled strongly of yogurt and tomato base and looks like could have done with a little more cooking. Also, personal pet peeve - I hate raw paneer pieces in my gravy, more so if they are hard!
For desserts, I gave in to temptation and ordered um'm'ali (which again the server pointed to me, this time with his finger close to me and the menu card I was holding) - madam padho yahan likha hai yeh bread pudding hai. Umm... next time I must ensure that I let the server know that being a post graduate in the subject, I can actually speak, write, and read English decently üòõ
We ordered a take away of the dessert (inspite of the knowledge that it's a bread pudding lol). It was average tasting. Damn! I should have listened to the server.

Been here quite a few times. The decor is excellent, food ...well food is great if one can choose properly. The buffet is downright bad with regular pasta , soups and kebabs and no Mediterranean item as such. The moroccan dishes are actually quite good, harissa soup, roasted lamb, moroccan chicken with couscous, platters ( pita bread, falafel, hummus). Anyone trying this place for pasta would be disappointed, wish there were a better focused menu though the waiters were trying to guide. Plus the better items are all middle eastern than Mediterranean, wish that is made clearer. Anyway, if you can make a good choice from the menu it is one of the better places to eat in Kolkata

wonderful ambiance ....
And that's where it stops...
Food is ok... Some things are great making u ask for a second helping and the some things are such that u won't take a second bite.

The chef is confused regarding the names put up in the buffet and the dishes served.
For eg the tag says mutton dak bungalow but what u get is mutton kosha. It is tasty but not what u expect.¬†

The day we went for the lunch buffet it is possible that their dessert/pastry chef was on leave. The fruit cake and the pastry were stale to the point that they were crumbling. The pastry looked as if 1portion was divided into 6peices. Good old Indian gulabjamuns saved the day.

All in all an experience I wouldn't want to repeat.

Supposedly a Mediterranean fusion restaurant as we were informed. Just another name for confused menu with dishes thrown in from all over and with some fancy names that taste like rubbish for the most part. Clueless management and crappy service which is probably why the place was completely empty during lunchtime. Can't understand how this place survives. Avoid.

This place is just a wow place if u are a foodie.. A fine dining ambience, great service and delicious food.¬†
Try the Pilich Dolmasi , a Turkish appetizer, which is just amazing.. Choui Chermoala (whole roasted lamb) is just mouthwatering... A must try for lamb lovers. In the main course, try the Escalope of Chicken and Chicken Casserole.. Actually for this place, all the items are just mouthwatering... Please try this with ur friends and family and u will fall in love with the food.

Exceptional ambience, reminded me of Taj in delhi. Grand and opulent. Went for a lunch buffet. Amazing spread. Loved the mix of continental and Indian food. Great for weekend lunches. Usually not too crowded. Educated waiters. Over all highly recommended

Situated in Mani square- Went for buffet dinner in a friend's birthday party. The range of dishes was pretty good according to the rates. They had quite a chicken, fish, mushroom, paneer in both starters and main course. Soup and soft drinks(one for every individual) were included in the buffet. The desserts too were nice. Although I must say that there are too many restaurants on that floor and it is difficult to zero in on any one. But this was a good choice.

I was quite intrigued by the decor of this place,a romantic themed restaurant with ample seating place.My particular favourite part of the decor was their wall hanging..which had portraits of women...

Coming to food,the manager suggested us to try their improvised kebab platter..which had 2 pieces each of Samak Chermoula(Fish)..Shish Taouk(Chicken)..Istakoz Firinda(Prawn)...The fish was brilliant,fresh and perfectly cooked,my portion of the chicken was a bit overcooked so got it replaced and the prawns too were good...Of all these,I found the chicken(Shish Taouk) the best

Kebabs are a must try in this place!!!Since they are from different regions,hence they all taste different..
What complemented the kebabs more were their cocktails...Mojito and White Russian..this place makes one of the best cocktails in that area!!!We wanted our Mojito to be stronger so they added 30ml more of white rum..for which they charged extra...
This was a big turnoff for us since no restaurants charge for making cocktails stronger!!!¬†

Coming to food,we had Escallope Chicken and Moroccon Chicken with kous kous..The Escallope Chicken was accompanied with Penne and is a pretty heavy dish loaded with Cheese and Cream..I personally would recommend it for two people especially if they order the Kebab Platter..
Moroccon Chicken was average to say the least..Needed a bit more flavour...

We were served complementary deserts in the end since it was my friend's birthday...which had chocolate brownie served in a sizzler platter...the caramel was completely burned and sticky...Topped with vanilla ice cream...the brownie was okay...

I was hoping to catch up with chef Rozario that day but couldn't...hope to catch up with him the next time I visit...

I will always remember the corner table on the right when you enter from the gates of the restaurant. Its where I used to take my girlfriend. Even though my relationship didn't last but the relationship of the taste still sticks to my mouth. Has a nice menu, good service and yes the cooking is great. Well I can say that it is a nice restaurant with a good set up. And yes do keep up the good work

Worst buffet we have ever had. Went to have some good food located near by. The staffs were completely bullshit. They don't even know the basic hospitality. We need to wait more than 30 minutes just to have paneer shawarma and veg pasta. After asking numerous times finally they serve them which tastes worst. We can make better pasta in our home. Only one suggestion to the restaurant authority, please learn the basic hotel management from any school. If you are not able to handle such few customer gathering and called it a rush time, you don't have any right to bill 700 bucks for such a waste quality food and worst customer service. Please don't visit this place if you really value your money. We would prefer mio amore ( aka monginis cake shop) than this waste. Its not even eligible for 1 rating.

Went with family for dinner. We had their buffet. There were three starters paneer tikka, aloo tikaa and some kind of tikki. The starters were pretty okayish, nothing great. Then there was pasta which was again just okay nothing great.
There was a good amount of variety in the main course. Starter was a little better. Pocket pinch was not very high, that's a plus side. But I feel the food should improve a big deal, especially the starters.

Had high hopes for this one but it all went upside down as the buffet progessed.
My happiness ended as soon as their starter ended, but there is also so many drawbacks about their starter too.
1. Service too slow and lousy, they would ages to bring a new order during the buffet as if they were deliberately testing our patience.
2. When asked to bring more their waiters looked like they were asked to do heavy labour.
3. Their chicken wings tasted really bad and sad, as none of us could eat that.
Main course was vey much limited and didn't taste that good.
Plus points are- 
1. Nice and clean place. Decor was really good.
2. Desserts were nice.
3. Buffet price was not so high, but there was not so much choice there too.

I have had a la carte at Mio Amore about a year ago and it was absolutely delightful. Today I tried the non-veg buffet and I loved the dishes served. The starters taste very good; I especially loved the fish kebab. The main course had a choice of Indian, Italian and Moroccan side dishes along with rice and choice of bread. The dessert steals the shows. The blueberry cake with orange mousse a was bliss. The hot gulab jamun and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce gives a completeness to the meal. The food's worth the money!

Went to the dinner buffet with a group of 19 as a friends treat.
Located just opposite to Flame and Grills,Mio Omore is a comparitively new place serving Mediterranean buffet.
The decor and the ambience is super and also is spacious.At the side also you can find a waiting area with sofas and magazines to keep u occupied till u crave in the gastronomic journey.
At first was serves Stracciatella Soup which was basically chicken clear soup with thinly sliced vegetables and a tad spicy.. Not needing any extra additive overall.
Next among the starters there were Prawn Balls in BBQ sauce which was good yet a bit sweet.Next came the World spiced Char Grill Fish which was boneless grilled fish.Other items in starters included Tandir Kabab.
Salads included..plain salad, hummus,corn salad and fruit salad.
After indulging in the variety of Kababs comes the maon course of Rice-a-bici,Moroccon chicken,roasted fish in tomato mustard sauce,mutton dakbanglo and another spanish item which unfprtunately the name i forgot. 
Among them the Fish tasted superb.
In the dessert section.. Chocolate Brownie, fruit cake,hot gulab jamun and vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce was there.
The only thing I found negative was the lack of complimentary drinks and I felt it may have been complete had the ice cream had some varieties. 
Else..it was total value for money.
Hoping to visit again and Happy Dining!!

On the top floor of Mani Square, this place is everything a Mediterranean cuisine lover can ask for. With a huge range of delicacies  in every cuisine, it was a delight. My sister would satisfy all her midnight cravings for Italian food right here if she could. Haha. Jokes apart, for someone who loves Mediterranean food, this is the place she prefers. The range of dishes and the taste is excellent. Service is a little slow so I wouldn't go in if I'm famished or starving.
The ambience and decor are amazing and the desserts are a sinful indulgence but so worth it. We love the crepe fantasia.

After reading a lot of negetive reviews about the place, I was a little skeptical of visiting mio amore this time.
However, once the dishes started coming in, all my worries were well put to rest.
We ordered shish taouk and Istakoz Firinda for starters. The chicken was soft,succulent,well cooked and was served with humus and a red spicy sauce. The prawns were tasty as well. 
For the main course we ordered chicken steak, spiced moroccan chicken with onions and nuts, roasted fillet of fish with tomato mustard sauce. The fish was absolutely delicious and has had a lasting impression on me! The chicken steak was pretty good too..however the Moroccan chicken seemed bland in comparison to the other dishes and pretty much tasted like simple fish curry cooked at home.
We ordered UM M' ALI for dessert..it's a warm dessert and tasted good.
They serve little portions of rice with every dish, so unless you're absolutely famished, you could do without ordering a separate rice dish.
Overall, my experience at Mio Amore was quite pleasant.

Had a lunch buffet here. Overall it's a value for money buffet. Cuisine was continental and indian. Number of dishes in the starter section as well as the desert section is very less but quality is on point! Loved the prawn in bbq sauce, baked potato in gravy, spinach cheese fried rice as well as the fish in white sauce. As I mentioned earlier deserts are a huge disappointment with only ice cream and halwa in the menu! A special mention about the ambience which is quite artsy and neo chic!

I had been searching for this place for quite some time now on Zomato but was not successful until today.

This place is absolutely a breath of fresh air in Mani Square Mall. I guess if asked I would say this along with Flame & Grill serves the beat buffet and Non -Veg fare. 

The decor is classy and The place is really spacious. The staff is very courteous and Polite. The buffet spread though is limited offers fantastic dishes. 

If you are a vegetarian you won't get too many items. But the non veg platter has some very tantalising dishes. 

There is a live pasta counter as well but I guess it wasn't working that day. All in all I and my fiance loved the place and would love to go there again.

This is one of my favorite buffet¬†place in town. There Mediterranean spread is very good. Cream of Chicken, Prawn Balls in Bar-B-Que Sauce,¬†Samak Chermoula, Tandir Kabab and Shish Taouk which¬†all were¬†extremely delicious. Pescado Caplado (Fish) was the best dish (though I don't like fish much). Pollo Cantina was too sweet as chicken dish¬†for my taste buds. Biriyani & Rogan Josh both was with Mutton and very good. Pasta was just too good. First we ordered mixed sauce that ws awesome. There ordered white sauce, which was just simply to die for. Disappointed with ice cream but Fruit Salad and gulab jamun was there to cheer you up. Though food was great, but I must say its bit of disappointing for chicken lovers.¬†I would love to visit here again and again.

The chicken items were very dry!
Only the fish item was good!

Main Course- The Fish n mutton was ok!
The biriyani was horrible!

Deserts- The moouse n the brownie were Excellent!

We went there during Durga Pujas for dinner. We decided to try the buffet spread. Its a very limited spread and the food quality was pretty ordinary. One of my friends complained about a hair she found in the gulab jamun. They replied that they don't cook it and get it supplied from outside... Anyway I am not interested in visiting the place again. Prices are too high given the quality.

Visited Mio Amore on Christmas Day; I'll admit I wasn't expecting it to be good. To my surprise, it turned out quite good and refreshing. We opted for the normal buffet (non-veg) meal which cost us ‚Çπ575 + taxes.

In appetisers, they served only "Cream of Chicken Soup" which in all honesty appeared more of curd than soup. The taste didn't appeal to me that much. However, the starters made up for it. They offer you "Prawn Balls in Bar-B-Que Sauce which was extremely delicious. The " Samak Chermoula", "Tandir Kabab" and "Shish Taouk" was equally good. These can be excellent if you are ordering drinks too.

In the main course, Pescado Caplado (Fish) stole the show. Despite not liking fish, I turned out loving it more than the other dishes. "Pollo Cantina" was a chicken serving which was more of any chicken curry but surprisingly tasted awesome. Apart from these two, Mutton Rogan Josh was the third dish which was good too.

What I loved the most was that they served Mutton Biryani. Being a Biryani maniac, I feasted on it. Quite expectedly, the pieces of mutton was good making the biryani a safe bet.

In desserts, I was disappointed with the ice cream. But again, the Gulab Jamun lived up to the expectations saving the day.

Apart from these, they also served Pasta and Shawarma apart from salads. You could also feast on the mousse and cake they served.

Coming to the ambience, perfect for you if you are a couple. But again, there are ample scopes to enjoy if you are visiting with friends or family. Go for it. The proximity to Bidhannagar and the access to EM Bypass makes it even better.

This is my favourite place for Mediterranean and continental food! Their whole roasted lamb is awesome!! The sea food is also worth a try! Pasta with meat balls in white cheese sauce is excellent! The ambience and decoration are superb! The behaviour of the staff is also good! The manager himself suggested some of the best dishes! I intend to keep going to this place. I have relished all the dishes that I have tasted so far! The price is also reasonable as compared to other continental restaurants of this standard in the city.

I went there a couple of times for the buffet menu. The atmosphere is pretty good. Decoration is awesome. The fountain at the entrance is pretty nice. Now come to food quality is average. Starters are good, specially the fish fry and the tandoori chicken. Fried rice is good but the mutton was too hard every time. Side dish of fish was good nd the chicken was average. Now come to the desert part it's lack of items. Lastly the icecraem, I did not like the melting icecream. So my final verdict is go for this restaurant fr it's decoration not for its average food quality. Pocket pinch is approx.1100/- for 2 person.

This is like the only restaurant where the waiting lounge is more justified than the actual dining place.
The cocktails are far below standard, behaviour if the staff is extremely unaccommodating, food just doesnt seem to arrive even after 40 minutes of waiting.
Would never recommend this place to anyone!!
Sucks royally!!

Excellent ambience and food. Quality food at reasonable price....good place to hang out with family...the mocktails are also quiet innovative. Fish in greek style was the best item.

We took ala carte...but I'd suggest to go for buffet as most of the ppl, apparently all other than us were taking that. Food quality was good and service as well, apart from the fact of delay, but i guess if you select something which is not part of buffet you will have enough time to spend time with your mate. Point to mention here, we ordered the famous Ratatoulie and waited a good 45 mins eagerly which came out be an utter disappointment. My poor tongue could not able to distinguish it from an Indian traditional spicy paneer curry prepared with some vegetables. Hence 3.0

Their service is good too.
As far buffet is concerned - starter was satisfactory; the main course was good, the items had good blend of flavours and in the dessert the orange mousse was the best.

A very well decorated Mediterranean restaurant. Food is really good. Though the chicken lasagna was not so good and a little more salty, the crust was lovely. Their sweet lime soda was refreshing enough. Well behaved staffs. Efficiently served food. The prawns that we ordered were immensely fantastic. Also the starters were lovely. Highly recommended if you're shopping at Mani Square.

We visited this place on Saptami as we expected this restaurant to be sparsely populated as compared to the others...however we were proved wrong.
Coming to the food we had ordered a whole lamb dish (forgot the name) and shish taouk...a turkish chicken kabab sort of a dish as entree. Both were delightful. For main course we had couscous chicken stew , meat lasagne and pasta in white sauce with chicken. Chicken stew was mind blowing and I'd definitely suggest it . Lasagne and pasta both were perfect and quantity was also good. For dessert we had umm ali which is sort of a bread pudding and equally yumm. This was dinner for four adults.
They didn't serve mocktails as sadly it was a dry day.
This restaurant surely lived up to our expectations.

This restaurant vaunts an exquisite decor. I had visited with a friend quite some time back and was thoroughly impressed. Their menu is quite grand and illustrious too. We had ordered some really fancy but extremely hard to remember names- so can't quite mention them here.¬†
But I loved the food- the meat preparations were cooked to perfection with succulent portions served.¬†
For me, the experience was good and I would look forward to visiting again, soon.

Now about the food... They have a bit of variety in it... The lamb i tasted there was one of the best i had recently....other than that the cheesrbread was above par or else everything was on a very average basis...i can recommend it for all of u but to spend a heavy amout nd not please ur tastebuds properly wud be injustice made to self

Went to mani square looking for some delicious food! This place caught our eyes! The ambience was decent, seats were comfortable, decorations were also good!
We ordered 
1. Tandir Kebab which was normal chicken kebab nothing special
2. Pasta Al Forno, again it was like your normal pasta but taste and quality was 10/10
3. Lasagne Al Forno, very good, won't recommend it though (not the best lasagne I had)
4. Chicken Tetrazzini, best dish among everything we ate! 10/10 would recommend! The flavour, the aroma! Probably the best Italian dish I've ever had
5. Crepe Fantasia, if you are looking for a good desert to top it all off this is the one! 
These 5 dishes cost us around 1800! So it's not that expensive either! The money was worth the food.

The quest for something different, rather different cuisine tool us to Mio Amore on Panchami afternoon. It is situated in the 4th floor of Mani Square mall and should not be confused with the recently renamed confectionary chain. Read on to find out about our overall experience:

1.Ambiance ‚Äì It is spread around a large area with very relaxed ambience. The seating arrangement is very comfortable. The interiors are aesthetically done with brass lamps hanging from the top. Two marble fountains are also present which adds to the beauty of the interiors.

2.Hospitality ‚Äì The staffs are very cordial and well informed. Loved the way they pronounced the name of the dishes and suggested them to us as per our taste and preference.

3. Food ‚Äì We ordered the following items:

1.Choui Chermoula ‚Äì This is a Moroccan dish consisting of whole roasted lamb. This dish was very spicy and suited our Indian taste buds quite well. It had cashews and capsicums along with long shreds of the lamb.It was served with rice.

2.Pilich Dolmasi - A Turkish starter. It is basically very well prepared chicken kebabs served with Turkish sauce and salad. The taste was good and the meat was well cooked.

3.ShishTaouk ‚Äì Ckicken kebabs with rice. The taste was awesome as it was evident that the chicken was coocked for a long time amidst charcoal. The charcoal flavour was attractive

4.Roasted fillet of fish with tomato mustard sauce ‚ÄìThe best item of the lunch ‚Äì this item melted in our mouth in seconds. Ultra soft with delicious taste. Moreover tit was served in fish shaped dish.

5.Rotolle Di Pollo Al Romeo ‚Äì A chicken dish which was mediocre

6.Lasagne Alla Cacciatora ‚Äì A brilliantly prepared lasagna which tastes heavenly

7.Cheese Garlic Bread ‚Äì We ordered this to accompany the Lasagne. These were served after long waiting period . But didn‚Äôt go well with the Lasagne as we felt too much cheese.

Overall a brilliant experience.

First thing: the decor is brilliant. The service people were extremely warm and helpful. The price is pretty reasonable. The music was as per the decor. Cant remember the names as they are Italian but Choui Charmouli with garlic bread is a must along with chicken steak. A deduction of .5 as it took time for the food to arrive.

This is my first visit in this restaurant. Mediterranean and Italian dishes - They taste really good and the presentation and preparation is quite up-standard. We tried baked fish (can be compared with ITC; same quantity and quality - yes, taste wise also so so good - they couldn't provide "lemon butter sauce" though along with it) and we tried an Italian chicken preparation - which is ok types ... The place can be considered as fine dinning as the service and etiquette is very good.

I wish I could have given a better rating than this. We were planning a family dinner and debated for long as to where we should go. Finally decided on this venue thinking it would be nice to try Mediterranean. The ambience - light, music were very nice and comforting. The soup was great to start with and we were all set to have a great dinner. I took a plate of 4 non veg starters and alas! They were all cold! Asked the waiter to change that. We were told veg starters are not laid out and we would be served on table. I requested the veg starters which never arrived. There was a Shawarma counter and live pasta counter but no one to prepare the dishes at the counter. The main course food was good, not great. There was a rice dish, a chicken, fish and mutton preparation. The mutton could have been cooked more and was not that soft. Every time when we were stepping out from our table for helpings we had to call someone to clear the used plates. Desserts were very limited. Ice cream was not well frozen, although the gulab jamun and cake were good. Throughout the meal no one stepped up to check on us as to how the food was. To top it all, when I offered my credit card for payment, to my surprise the waiter said - "Bill lagbe?" (do you need a bill?)!!! Overall very disappointing. Gave additional 0.5 rating over 1 just for the food taste. I found service efficiency and professionalism severely lacking which I think are hygiene factors.

This is one of the best resturants I have ever visited. First to mention the ambience and decor over there...it is beautiful,elegant and classy. The furnitures,lights,decoration...everything is perfect for a perfect dine out. Staffs are very efficient, helpful and courteous. Now coming to the food...they serve mainly meditteranean and italian dishes. They taste really good and the presentation and preparation is authentic. As we were not that much accustomed with such food we went with the suggestions of the staff and all were worth to give a try. One thing I also want to add please go for dishes of fish and salads and specially people who are in a search of healthy food this is the place. Service is quick and the price is very reasonable,cheaper than what we expected and please don't go by the approx price for two people and the menu given by zomato for this place. I would suggest this place as a must visit.

Went there with my gym pals n it belonged to then. It was for dinner buffet.
Decor: i simply loved the decor with fountains n live pasta counters. There is a comfy sitting zone as well.
Staff: courteous and friendly but may not be well informed about the dishes.
Food: at first there was a non veg soup whose name neither the waiter knew, nor i did!! It was a tomato based thick meat soup, tasted good.
Next were assorted salads followed by chkn tandoori n tikka kebab. Meat was moist n juicy. Fish fingers and prawn balls were delicious Then there was baked fish, chkn with rosemary n mutton. Mutton was a bit chewy but the rest tasted really yummy. There were also assorted veg items which i didnt taste. Pilaf rice was an exciting prosoect.
Now comes the let down part. The desert section is so very simple with watery vanilla ice cream, cake like brownie, gulab jamun n fruit salad. After such an amazing starter n main course, the dessert is bound to disappoint you.
Barring the desert, i give it a huge thumbs up and would love to visit again!!

Mio Amore for Mediterranean food. One of the must visit restaurant in Mani Square Mall. They had one of the best Italian cuisine i had ever tested and i am giving full ratings for that. Although the pricing are on a heavier side, so i had to purchase coupons from Groupon and had a visit to this amazing dreamland. The whole meal costs Rs500 for 2 and it was a dream meal in that buget, so cant expect more.

List of items we ordered:
1. Starters- There were 2 starters, one is chicken and the other one is fish, i forgot those names as it is very hard to remember. But trust me they are delicious and mouth watering.
2. Baked dish- We had chicken lasagne, one of the best dish out of all, guys still wondering how it is cooked.
3. Main dish- We had Pollo Alla Cacciatora which is another great chicken dish with vegetables. One word marvellous.
4. Dessert- Lastly for deserts we had chocolate icecream with a beautiful wafery coating which is necessary at the end.

All in all a great restaurant to try, we had visited twice and fell in love with the food.
Thank you. Happy fooding

Where it is: 4th floor,Mani square Mall

What it is: A multicuisine Buffet Restaurant

Is it costly: Yes very. But money for value. Stuffs are very well behaved.

Should you bother: If you are a food adventurer then hell yeah :D .

Menu: They have great menus on weekdays dinner. But like any other buffet restaurant, weekends are far more better. Staffs are very well behaved and will go out of their way to help. Did I tell this already? Sorry, I gush when I receive great service :P ( which is very rare in Kolkata unfortunately.)

You will find almost everything in their menu. And they give extra attention to desserts unlike others.

Was the experience worth it? : I think I don't have to answer this one :D. You can pretty much sum it up. It's a great restaurant with awesome interior. But will only visit if I am looking for unloading a fat wallet :P

PS: Look out for the Chandeliers they hang just above the tables. I banged my head twice there. :3

Mio Amore shouldn't be confused with the numerous cake shops with the same name (that's just 'Monginis' renamed). It's located on the 4th floor of the Mani Square mall & offers on the most reasonably priced buffet spreads in the entire city. The variety & taste are amazing & their rates haven't gone up drastically over the years. Though the buffet spread is the best option to enjoy a fine meal, you can also check out their menu if you want. I recommend their Stracciatella Soup, Samak Charmoula & Spinachi Della Chef. The ambience & sitting arrangements are good too, giving you a spacious feel. The staff are courteous & efficient, particularly when handling kids. A rare place to get 5/5.

Mio amore has a huge buffet place on the top floor of Mani Square mall, E.M. bypass, with lovely vibrant ambience and colourful cutlery. It also serves Al a carte. It has Mediterranean and Indian food. Coming to the decor,  the place has this soothing feel to it. Service is also fairly good. Took the buffet spread and was pretty happy with the food served. The starters were really awesome. It's lasagne and pasta was good enough. The deserts were awfully bad ending with a bad note of chlormint serving for mouth freshner. Overall experience was good.

It was 31st December night.. our group of 4 friends made a sudden plan to dine out.. so, as all the known places were full as expected, we landed to mio amore.. and it was not a bad decision at all!!
This is a huge buffet place on the top floor of mani square mall with lovely vibrant ambience and colourful cutleries.. and I loved their special decorations for new years eve!
Coming to food.. the buffet included varieties of food from different cuisines including Mediterranean, Indian, Italian and a lot more.. all the dishes were cooked to perfection and tasted good.. I specially loved the different chicken salads and also the fish fillets and prawn balls.. and the huge display of the bar menu in the centre was very eye catching.. I loved the on-spot pasta bar too. tasted two types of pastas.. quite good.
The price is very much reasonable I must say.. waiters were very courteous and were always at help whenever we needed.
Overall this place is just perfect if you wanna take your friends and families to try out a little off-track dishes from the regular 'indian-chinese' buffet.. and that too without compromising on our all time fav indian main courses!! :)

Mio Amore was the venue for meeting a special friend. This was my second visit here. I came back because of the good experience last time. Sadly, I was a little disappointed this time. 

The place is located at the top floor of Mani Square Mall at E.M. Bypass. Coming to the decor, the place has this soothing feel to it . Love the whites and the pastels used to do the decor and the bright coloured dishes add a lot of character to it . I especially love the waiting area with lovely white sofa and mirror.

Coming to the food, we were offered a buffet menu but we refused. We went in for a-la-carte. 

For starters, we had chicken shawarma. It is a lebanese dish. Though it had a different name in the menu card.  The pita bread was unnecessarily thick and the chicken was all sticky and dry inspite of adding lots of hummus. For the mains we had spaghetti carbonara and spaghetti with sicillian meat balls. Both tasted average. Nothing impressive.

Service was good. Waiters are well informed about the food that they serve. Well mannered too. This place is not crowded which makes this place very peaceful.

If you are in Kolkata and you are craving for delicious spread of continental with a-to-remember-for cocktail selects, then this wonderful place will pamper your hungry taste buds in the best way. Distinctive by its ambience, its buffet menu, its cocktail choices; Mio Amore is one-of-its-kind place in the city that loves food. It is much more than a resata√πrant and once here, you would not agree more! A must-visit place for every soul to quench their gastronomical desires.

Been here a few times now. Oddly enough never did had the urge to try the buffet. My favourite picks off the menu would be: minestrone soup, veg baked lasagne and the risotto. The service is also fairly good. Unfortunately there isnt alot of foot fall here i feel but this place is worth a try, especially for people who indulge in this cuisine. Good place for a nice relaxed and possibly romantic meal.

Omg how could I forget to write a review of this restaurant!!! Mio Amore is one of my favourite restaurant in this part of town. Located on the fourth floor of Mani Square Mall this restaurant stands out from its competitors on the same floor because of its outstanding quality of food and the serene ambience it provides. I have visited the restaurant several times and have always tried their continental and European meals. I simply love the pasta preparation here for their authenticity and taste. The steaks are equally succulent and comes with the perfect blend of sauces meant for such dishes. I remember my mother trying the prawn thermidore here and she simply went gaga over it. My father loves the Italian pastas available here specially the white sauce vegetarian pasta is his favourite. The white and wooden decor will welcome you to a different experience altogether. There is a serenity in the restaurant which I like a lot... the soft instrumental music pervades the environment with calmness. If you are on a date then this is one of those restaurants in the city you can vouch for. They also have a buffet menu but I love their ala cart continental menu so much that have not tried the buffet meal. The decor inside the washrooms are equally nice. The service is also good and best part is the stewards know their job pretty well and can suggest you dishes based on your likings.  All in all an excellent place to savour on some great food with your loved ones.

This place is a clear winner for me. I loved this place for 2 reasons. First,we went around for a late lunch and it was almost 3:30 and when we opted for the buffet menu,the staff were extremely courteous and informed us promptly that the buffet is only available till 4:30 and they would give us 15min in excess. I really liked this straightforward approach. Nextly, seldom have i gone to a place where the main course in a buffet spread is good,however mio amore is an exception in such case. The interiors of this place is extemely decorated and looks ornated. The culinary skill of this place is as good as its aesthetic feel is. The buffet spread was delicious and I loved every bit of it. The starters included non veg salad(with ample amount of chicken) fish fingers,tandoori chicken,sheekh kabab n a cream soup. All the dishes excelled in taste and both I and my friend loved it. The main course included mutton dish,veg au gratin(which tasted superb),a rice dish,varieties of chicken dishes,fish,zucchini pancakes assorted bread baked portato and some more stuff(can't recall the exact names)and each of them tasted blissful. We also had mixed sauce and white sauce arabitta pasta and it was good. The only small glitch which i felt was in the dessert section. Though the deserts served were quite nice but they were just 4 in number. It included a mango mousse,a strawberry cake, gulab jamun and ice cream. I would definitely request the management to look into this section as it is an integral part of any buffet menu. Apart from this very little snafu,i loved their food and is definitely going back soon.

This was my 4th visit to this place and nothing has changed. Be it the food, the ambience or the service, I feel this is one of the top notch restaurant of the city which is underrated.  The  first time we were there, we went for al a cart√® menu. It was during the FIFA world cup when the decor was made accordingly. We ordered an Argentine soup,Yakitori, a Risotto, a Moroccan chicken dish and some other main courses which I don't remember now. The Yakitori was not that good if u compare it with Shushi Oke. The deserts came as a rescue to us. Both the Tiramisu and Um'm Ali were mesmerising. I had Tiramisu at The Mythh,HHI but Mio Amore went passed HHI in this case. Couple of days back, we went for their dinner buffet. Starting with the cr√®me of chicken soup, followed by 4 non veg starter, we didn't find an issue to complain. The main course was a never ending one. The items are almost the same as shown in the Zomato menu, only with a few minor alterations. Like, that day they made mutton kasha instead of mutton roganjosh. Even the spinach item was replaced by the pancake. We had the spinach item on our last visit but the simmering hot zucchini pancake was beyond any comment. They had a rice preparation with corn while was below my expectations. They offer quite a good number of breads like kulcha , nun and etc. Don't forget to taste their live pasta which is available both in red and white sauce.
 The deserts were limited in number but of much better quality than that of Flame & Grill. The mango mousse, gilab jamun and the ice cream was delicious but the fresh fruit looked stale. Overall pleasant experience at an affordable price. Three of us has dinner for only Rs 1711 which was rather cheap if you compare other buffet menus of the city. Anyone planning to visit the place, go ahead and don't miss the fish preparation in the main course and the pancake.

Went there for a team lunch.. ¬†Took the buffet spread and was pretty happy with the food served.. The starters were really awesome.. The prawn balls very good.
Some of the food item was extremely spicy... Though it was not an issue for me but could be an issue for a lot of people...¬†
The dessert spread was also good..¬†

Overall the experience was good.

Me and my friend without any proper plan visited mani square but we were not in a mood to try out the usual Chinese nor mughlai cuisines so we thought of giving this restaurant a shot. We really liked the exterior hence this place attracted us and equally the interior was also impressing. We checked the buffet menu and decided to try it out as the items were appealing but as we were late the staff told us that they would give us some extra time which was a really nice gesture. Their behavior was mentionworthy. Now coming to food we were served cream of chicken soup which we thought that like any other buffet the soup will not be good but we were so wrong cause it was delicious. The starters were chicken salad, tandoori chicken, chicken kebab, shammi kebab, fish fry. All the items were well prepared, the chicken was soft and properly spiced, the salad was good, the fish fry was one of the best items so we couldn't stop having it. The quality of all the food items were good. The main course had a fish item,mutton item, chicken item - don't know the exact names, corn and peas rice, assortment of breads, veg au gratin,double baked potato, and some veg stuffed pancake etc. None of the items were below average just the mutton dish was very spicy and hot so I was struggling to have it. The fish and the veg dishes stood out as the flavour of the former was quite unique. Then they brought us pasta which again maintained the standard. The dessert section was limited containing gulab jamun, mango mousse, strawberry cake if am not wrong and vanilla ice cream which was not great but again not disappointing also. The price that they were charging was satisfactory and was well balanced with the items that they were offering but one suggestion they should also include a soft drink in their buffet menu as it was much needed. We both had to pay around rs. 1200 in total which was reasonable and I would definitely go back to try other things.

One of the places where buffet isn't that expensive. But if you want to try authentic Mediterranean food, go for a la cart√©.

I, my brother and my uncle went to visit this place to try our palate on Mediterranean cuisine. Well we failed miserably. Our uncle warned us that it might not suit our taste and we went for a dish of lamb with mushrooms with a fancy name. Don't quite remember it. Well hated it to the core. We couldn't eat. It was horrible. Intelligently my uncle took an indian dish of chicken which was our savior. The indian dish was surprisingly good. The chicken was juicy and the preparation was exquisite. The curry was great as well. The service and ambiance was top notch.

I would put all my cards for Mio Amore's decor. It is kinda the Grand Hotel of Restaurants. Gives you a nice vintage feeling.
You would want to go to Mio Amore when you:

(A)
1. Plan for a nice date with your partner
2. Know eating is secondary, spending time together is more important.
3. Want to escape from the crowd.

(B)
1.  Decor: Amazing
2. Staffs: Wish they knew little more on what they serve.
3. Food: Okayish.
4. Complimentary Drinks: No.
6. Crowd: Decent, mostly. At times you have the pricks too.
7. Value for money: Okay, yeah.
8. Referable: Yes

Good place for first date: Go ahead.

Negative Points: Food aint that amazing, could have been better when you compare it with the decor.
Positive Points: Decor.

After a sudden plan, we went to this place at the night time. We took buffet option. Buffet included 4 veg main course, 2 types of rice, 3 types of breads, 4 starters and soup. 

The soup wasn't of choice and it was vegetable sweet corn which I don't like at all. 

Starters were nice specially the aloo one. 

Main course was the usual with no super specialities. Pasta were amazing. The person who made pasta must have been an expert. 

Breads were the usual. 

Talking about desserts I have only one word for it - "Awesome". If desserts would not have been there the buffet wouldn't be a value for money option. Ebony and Ivory, Hot Gulab Jamun and Sliced Fruits.

Overall it's a very nice and reasonable place. No Wi-Fi is a bit of disappointment for a place like that. The ambience and decor is upto the mark.

Before the review, I would like to mention that the page here needs to be updated as there is a buffet available apart from the ala carte menu.
Mio Amore was an unplanned visit on a summer noon. It will give u a very good first impression. Full marks to the decor (well i'd give 4.5/5 as nothing's ever perfect in my eyes). The buffet needs to be looked into. I would prefer more items in the dessert section as well as chicken/mutton starters.
However, the greek fish is a plus.

Decor - 4.5
Food - 3
Service - 3.5
Overall - 3.5

Went to Mio Amore with a friend  for lunch right in the middle of the sweltering summer. The first thing I noticed were the interiors - very pleasing, spacious, the tables placed far enough not to be disturbed by the conversations between your neighbors. We stuck to a la carte as recommended. The menu can get a bit difficult for first timers but you don't need to worry, they'll help you choose what's the best for you and explain the dishes as well. Don't leave the place without having the Shish Taouk, they are heavenly. 
Food can take a little time to come, but as they say the best things are worth waiting for and in the meantime you can keep up the conversations at the table. The amounts they serve are adequate and if you keep the drinks off your table a meal for two comes well within 1500. Definitely recommend. 5 stars.

It was an unplanned visiti to Mio Amore...I had heard of this but din't get a time to read the reviews and then check in. If you judge based on the decor it would definitely give a person a positive feedback. Well we liked the decor and thought we might get to have some really lip-lip-smacking food here. Since we were already running late and had to rush for our movie show we ordered for the buffet as the ala-carte would take 20mins time to serve. The non-veg buffet included a so-called corn soup which in no way tasted or looked alike the corn soup which we generally have. It was the worst soup I had till date. The starters comprised of chicken hariyali kebab , chicken djaj tikka, fish finger and a prawn pakora types. Chicken tikka and fish finger were okayish but the hariyali kebab was not tender and juicy, the way it should be. For main-course there were chicken, mutton dak bangla  and a fish item. Mutton was well cooked but this is not what we call mutton dakbangla!! There was pilaf rice which was not cooked properly. Veg menu for main-course had veg augratin, dal makhani, paneer and two sabzis. There was pasta available which was again a big disappointment. They had some salads as well. The desert included gulab jamun, vanilla icecream, kiwi mousse and sliced cake of which only the cake was good. We had ordered for a mocktail 'Italian smooch' .  This was my first and last visit to Mio Amore. I would recommend a NO if you opt for buffet. Going by the taste and quality of food I don't expect much from the Ala-Carte section as well!!

Ambience: Out of this world. Looks more like a palace than a luxury restaurant.
Food: Order a buffet only if you think you can coax your tummy to match up to the price. Indeed the food is tasty, but the sheer variety of items on display would make you want for more but only for an average foodie to fall short of his capabilities. But then, the food is every bit delicious.

When your visit is unplanned, it obviously gives you some excitement. We were in manisquare mall for shopping and it was a bit late for us to go home and prepare our dinner. So we coined over there and reached at this place.
As it was Monday I opt for veg. The ambience was excellent but the staff response makes me little impatient.
I had a mixed experience with the food. The live pasta and the desert was good but the main dish....
Hope if I will have their non veg buffet this remark may change.

I went to Mio Amore with my family for dinner on a Sunday. Even though I had a reservation, I was asked to wait for around 20mins on my arrival. The service is slow and poor. The stewards are polite but have a very laid back attitude. However, if you can hold on to your patience, good food will make you happy. We simply enjoyed the Moroccan lamb dish and the freshly baked pita bread with humus. The ambience is impressive and one would enjoy provided it's a less packed day. Nice experience overall. It would have been a very nice experience if the service was upto the standard.

Its a complete waste of time and money. I was surprised to see such untrained and unprofessional staff in this restaurant. The worst dining experience I ever had.¬†

Food was below average............the chicken was stinking and when complained they took it casually.
When asked again the manager came and said they had changed the chicken (but they never informed us).
The waiter said they had informed us i.e. lied and argued on our face.

If you really want worth your money ........ never visit this restaurent.

Note: I will rate negative but there is no option for the same.

I loved my lunch with only my bros here!:)
We went for buffet,soup was delicious, I must say,otherwise generally I pass to others!
4 starters(prawn,fish , chicken with fish and chicken) were equally good,but prawn items tickled my taste buds a bit more! :)
Main course-veg section was simply superb, for first time I ate more veg items than non veg!
Among non veg,only fish item was good in taste !
Veg- rice was very good with sweet aroma,and baked type something was there,it was also good!
Veg lasanga was mouth watering,(baked cheese or something may be added to it)
Desserts were 4 again!
Nothing special!
And we ordered two cocktails,blue hawainn was really refreshing!
Loved it,loved ambience,less crowded, nice music, nice place to go with family and to have adda,share memories with your closed ones! :)

Me and my better half visited this restaurant yesterday,on a sunday night as we found that this was the only place were the crowd was less and we didnt have to wait for long.This was our second visit to this restaurant and unlike last time this time we decided to have ala carte instead of the regular buffet and we were extremely disappointed.Well the ambience is good and the waiting area is very cozy comfortable,all white and elegant,but that is the only good thing I found in this place. Initially we had to wait for really long and had to keep on calling the waitors for placing our order but no one seems to pay any heed.Although the place was half empty the waitors were running all around in hurry,such a good example of mis management.Then after placing order it took forever for the food to come,the main course was infact served before the starter and the chicken that we ordered,their so called Turkish dish was half cooked,had to leave it on plate itself.Last but not the least waited for 20mins for the bill then I had to go and ask the manager.In short will never visit again.

#SundayDinner #Buffet ... The ambience was soothing and calm.. Relaxed a while with a pair of cocktail...the service was good and prompt..The buffet consisted of the usual stuffs but the difference was created with a piece of paneer and cheese mixed sabarma that was a bit of a surprise.It tasted fantastic.We had non veg buffet so it went through almost the same list of items. The desert part also did not surprise me. In short it was a nice experience if you want to go light on your pockets.

I ALWAYS used to notice this restaurant after coming out from cinemax. Visiting there, was in my bucket list. I have visited there twice but never tried buffet over there. They have wide range of continental dishes. If you don't have any knowledge in continental dishes then before ordering any food, you have to make a solid ground work. :)I had chicken lasagne over there, which was pretty good. recently i had Spaghetti over there, which was pretty good too.drinks are pretty expensive there.and the best part is, they don't close their restaurant after lunch period.

Rarely have I gone back to a restaurant again and again for a fish preparation! Let me clarify - I hate fish, mostly. They smell. Mostly. But the Tagine of Fish Kebab of Mio Amore has me licking my lips in anticipation!
Most of the dishes I've had have actually had that effect on me. I'm someone who prefers their a la carte menu to the buffet, by the way, and I really think you should too. Their a la carte offerings are far more tasty than the buffet ones.

Located at the fourth floor in mani square.  If you're looking for Mediterranean, Moroccan or Italian food u might visit this place for once. As you walk in you are greeted with waterfall present in front of the restaurant giving a shear occulance to the lavishness. Making the place look more classy. It's a place where food are awesome but if you don't go with continental then it's not a place you must give a try. The hanging lanterns the dark black wooden chairs and tables adds up to the elegance of this place and ok to talk about food I would keep it simple. 
Appetisers:-
‚Ä¢ charcoal grilled fish 
‚Ä¢ crumb fried chicken wings 
‚Ä¢ prawn balls 
Main course :-
‚Ä¢ chicken au gratin 
‚Ä¢ pollo dello chef chicken 
‚Ä¢ chicken lasagne ( heavy instantly fills ur stomach)
‚Ä¢ salsa Sofia Loren 
Desserts:- 
‚Ä¢ yasoon cake
‚Ä¢ ice cream with chocolate sauce. 
This dishes will surely hit up your taste buds..

Had been planning on visiting this place for quite sometime now...finally did...but honestly was a little disappointed by the place.
My sister and her friend took the a la carte while I took the non veg buffet menu. Starting with the cocktails we took a mojito, a screwdriver and a margarita...all fairly good though the screwdriver could have done better with a little more hit of vodka...
In a la carte ordered a chouk chermoula (lamb dish), the Rissotto (had a white sauce and cheese base and seafood), and crepe fantasia (in desserts to our disappointment tiramisu was not available)... the lamb was good, one of the dishes we actually quite liked... the rissotto however was bland , nothing much to it really... dessert overall was tasty but could hav done with little more crepe... the portions overall were adequate for 2 persons...
Coming to the non veg buffet... u can both ask to be served at the table or self serve... I was served the straciacella soup first, nothing great, quite bland, please dont order it in a la carte... in starters had shish touk, prawn balls, some fish kebab and chicken tandoori- the fish and prawn were good;the chicken- well I ve definitely had way better kebabs...
In the maincourse tried fish tangine, moroccan chicken, mutton kasha, spinach delo chef, baked Mediterranean, paneer butter masala. ... the fish dish was really tasty, even the two veg dishes were quite nice and different... chicken, mutton, and paneer dishes were a complete let down...
Not great choices in desserts, nothing good to elaborate...
On the upside the decor of the place is quite beautiful...they have a live bar counter and the place is never overcrowded ... and service is nice and amiable...

Mio Amore is one of those rare places which serve authentic mediterranean and middle east cuisine in the city at not so high rates..This place is elegantly decorated and provide you a comfortable family experience of casual dining..One thing which strikes me is this place is usually vacant, though they serve quite satisfying buffet spread at a pocket friendly rate of 495+tax..The servers here are well trained,the starters here are quite delicious,though the main course is indifferent and the desert section needs to be revamped..
Coming to the food,we opted for the buffet twice we have been here,and it has been a fulfilling experience given the prices we paid..
Live salad and pasta counter..
Prawn Balls in BBQ Sauce: By far the best starter I have here,the balls were crispy,cooked fresh,only issue was the sauce a bit salty..
Shish Touk: This is a¬† middle eastern chicken kebab cooked with authentic herbs and spices..it taste unique,flavours are distinct,still a bit dry than preferred..
Samak Chermoula: A fish kebab which I personally don't like much,since there were too many flavours you cant enjoy distintcly..should have been balanced with the spices..
Another Chicken Tengri Kebab which tasted better,charred nicely..
In the mains the hero of the spread was undoubtedly a fish preparation called Greek Fish,which is prepared on a creamy gravy with base as milk,it tasted really good,mild flavour and not overcooked so that you get the flavours of the fish itself..Other items includes mutton biriyani,chicken side dish and veg spreads, though nothing to vouch for..
The desert was a big dissappointment for a sweet tooth like me who eagerly waits for it,the orange mousse should have been lighter,brownies were dry,gulab jamun not good..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

I have to say this place i visited just surprised me with my casual drink sweet lime soda. I am in love with the taste of its sweet lime soda i had two glasses as because it was the best soda i have ever drank.
I went there with my friend. It was lunch time. We just searched for a new taste and made up our mind on going for buffet.
The fish, chicken, mutton, and crispy prawns were delightful.
Live pasta was creamy as well
Salads were well prepared.
Main course-->
Pescado capaedo was awesome. It was just so creamy and fish was cooked very well. Mutton as well as chicken was good and spicy.
There were three rice dishes equally well cooked but i dint try the breads so you have to try it out.
Desserts-->
Fruits .Gulab jamun. Vanilla Icecream with chocolate sauce n orange mousse softy.

But note it does the special sweet lime soda which is just the best. Try it.
Pocket friendly with very good food and taste. Try it out friends.

This was my second visit to this place. The first time I tried their
A la carte menu, the food was really good. So went back to try their buffet this time. A decision I really regret. I really have no words to describe how bad it was. They had four non-veg starters. The chicken was bad. But fish-fingers & prawns were good. That's all. From that point onwards every dish went downhill. As you move up the menu, each dish progressively worse than the previous. To end it, the chef probably forgot that a dessert pudding is supposed to be sweet, if not anything else. My advice to the management - please close down your buffet menu, you are just not up to it. And I wonder, do you have two entirely separate kitchens for Buffet and A la carte. How can a restaurant which does really good in A La carte, do such a horrible mess up in their buffet. And please do bother checking your reviews on Zomato, cause a lot of your customers have the same views.

Wait ! 2.0 ?
Yes. 
This review is purely based on their buffet. Not A LA carte. 
Now to the why ?
Everything you needed was just there, yes only the name tags, the bowls were empty. We had to remind them every time to fill things up. Starting from the salad to the main course to the desert. Just when I thought the rating might improve given the prawn and kebab were decent enough, I hit the main course. Boy, I am still hungry. The chef really needs a course refresh. 
Last but not the least, how could someone make pudding without even the hint of sugar in it ?
No visits for buffet to this place anymore. Off my list. ?

So this was my fourth visit to the place. Which obviously means I liked the place. What changed on my fourth visit? I had the tremendous misfortune of trying out their buffet. I'll be blatant in the way put it across. I haven't had a buffet meal anywhere, in my lifetime, which served food as bad as this one did. I mean, I get some items being off in a buffet as it is impossible to maintain the standards you can set in an ala carte as compared to when you are making food by the truckload. That being said, any resemblance of sanity regarding the food which was being served was chucked out of the window. The food was horrendous. Every single item on that spread. Yes, the hummus, the veg au gratin (me being a non-vegetarian), the cream of chicken soup and the gulab jamus were pretty good, but pardon me if I cannot rave about the two of those because if i pay something close to 550 including taxes, I would expect more than good gulab jamun and hummus. I'll detail how bad some of the items were on the menu.

The shish touk firstly. The first serving of it was actually really pleasing. Then I made the dreadful mistake of asking for another serving. There I had it. Undercooked chicken. A truly amazing start to it. Good flavours on chicken which hadn't been cooked enough. The seekh kebab which was served after that was edible yes.

Then some funny chicken on the bone. After undercooked chicken, how could someone not serve up overcooked dry chicken. It would seem like the most logical conclusion. Firstly, it just seemed reheated to me. Was funnily cold inside that weird thing. And I absolutely could not believe how bad it was honestly. Again decent flavours on chicken which was cooked (or microwaved) abysmally. 

There were two preparations of fish and I do not understand why they bother serving fish. Got knows how long it had spent in the fridge. It was soft, smelt stale, and had that horrid texture to it which will never be the case if it hadn't been a decade old. Looked fine outside and then had that weird wateriness inside it which, mind you, was not juiciness. Fish should be flaky. Not clumpy and definitely shouldn't want you to reach for your napkins. 

The chicken in the main course again was so, so overcooked. I could have chewn on it for a lifetime and still not gotten it down my throat. The mutton was slightly softer yes, but we are comparing two different qualities of leather here. Let me not. By now I was tired of the entire ordeal and decided to skip all of that and go for the desserts. 

I love any kind of mousse and brownies. They had orange mousse which looking fine, tasted just fine initially and then this strange heaviness came on my palate. I am going to blame it on the kind of cream they used in the mousse. It had to light. It wasn't dense, but just did not hit any kind of mark. Half decent mousse isn't honestly that difficult to make. The brownie was exceptionally bad. So dry.

My friend ordered a shrimp salad. Overdone, soft pasta and lettuce which was bitter. The shrimp was cooked well, thankfully. And I could not believe how much they had crumpled the feta beyond recognition. A general piece of advice would be to have slightly more chunky bits of feta. It is beautiful cheese and it is a mighty shame if you can't taste it in the midst of all that crap on the plate. Also, did I mention how much of raw onions was there on the salad.

By then, understandably, I was exhausted. I paid and walked off. Coming back would require some miracle. I don't think I have ever written a review this caustic. But that's because I have rarely eaten food this bad and had to pay for it.

=======================================

Jan, 2013. Rated 4.0/5

In overall terms, food is excellent. I personally love the Gyros Kebab. Service is sometime excruciatingly slow. You have to pick and choose a bit to make sure you actually get the best of the lot on the menu. The staff is reasonably courteous. Could have expected a bit more on that front especially since I am paying a fairly decent price. But it is good for the quality you get here. Taking the ala carte would be your best bet. Desserts aren't particularly very good. But the rest of it is enjoyable.

Ahh what a let down , after the initial 'lovely ambiance' factor .The restaurant was heavily crowded when we walked in. All places were taken except two. We had to choose a corner table, since the table we liked was reserved for a bigger group. We opted for the buffet spread.                                                           

¬†Nobody intimated us that the starters will not be served on the table. We kept on waiting for around 10 mins till a waiter attended us. On being questioned,he told us that the veg starters will be served on the table and for the non veg starters we have to go and fetch.                                                                                                                       

Starter was average .Though the restaurant claims to be the only Mediterranean joint in the city , they failed to reflect that on the menu. All the items except one or two were Indian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

They served Chicken Clear Soup in the Non veg soup section .Chicken balls in the soup tasted like processed meat balls.                                                                                                                                                                                        

Main course was even worse. Mutton duck bangla did not even remotely taste like mutton duck bangla, Pasta was too saucy . The only good part was Au Gratin.                                                                                                                                                                                 

¬†There were not too many options, when it came to dessert. The only thing I liked was vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, which was again, not Mediterranean.

One of my friend found a toothpick in her food and when she complained, the manager never showed us a sign of concern or regret. He obviously tried to cover up the entire episode by giving us complimentary meals.                                                                                                                                                         

¬†However, when we were about to leave, he came to us and started cross questioning as if the fault was ours. We could have given them a benefit of doubt for the first time , but after witnessing manager's arrogance, we decided not to visit the place ever.

I had decided to give a 3.5 for the rating but the 0.5 more is for the white sauce pasta. It was just delicious. Pasta was serving from the live counter. The starters were something new and savory. Main course was also good. The only draw back is the dessert section,less items and nothing special. the ambiance¬† was good. the buffet costs around 565 with tax.

For team leaders this is an ideal place to host team parties within limited budget. 3 cheers mio amore team.

I really loved the food and the ambience, one of by favourites in Kolkata. The Mediterranean cuisine they serve is really good and quite authentic so I loved it. Also I would recommend to go for the Ala-carte there you will find some unique dishes only if you are ready to experiment your taste buds.

Been here last week. The place is really decent when it come to ambience. Nicely decorated, has a small fountain and is really very tidy.
Coming to service, the service here is really very good. Staff is extremely polite too.
The food here is sort of different. There is a good variety of starters and let me tell you, the starters are amazing. Be it Chicken, Fish or even Veg. The white sauce pasta was good but red one wasn't. the main course was a bit disappointing. Never heard such dishes before and most of them had a bland taste. However the Daal Makhani was good, maybe the best main course dish. Desserts- nothing special.

Let me first say that I am a huge lover of Mediterranean food. So this place is a haven for me. Utopia of food. 
I would suggest that u bunk their buffet spread and opt for ala carte so as to suite your tastebuds. Moreover I didn't find the buffet to be that good. 
To order , if your a seafood fanatic do try their deep fried seafood starter. Their excellent selection of drinks perfectly compliments your meal. Now if you are a bit confused as to what to order don't hesitate to ask the staff as they are very helpful and would probably help you to choose a perfect dish . One thing that caught me was that their cous cous was prepared perfectly. Impressive as It's something that easily goes wrong. And pin point precision on the seasoning. 
All in all superb dinner

Went for a buffet. There were 3-4 types of starters for both Non Veg and Veg sections.The veg starters were not up to the mark. Non veg starters are so so. I found the prawn starters very good. Regarding the main course it is far from its name it's purely Indian like Chicken Kosha and Mutton Kosha which were also so so. Desserts are not also very good.

Its known for its authentic Mediterranean dishes and was the only choice in the city for Mediterranean cuisine. However with time many choices have come up. Restaurant might not be that huge but ambiance had some class and maintains the theme.

We started with our favorite Mediterranean starter Hummus with Pita Bread washed down with Blue Lagoon.

In main course narrowed down to again Mediterranean chicken and lamb dishes.

Spiced Moroccan Chicken- Grilled Chicken topped with a sauce which is a mixture onion, garlic, diced fruits, honey and many other spices. Chicken is little though but the sauce had a unique taste.
Rotole Di Pollo Al Romeo - Cheese and mushroom stiffed chicken breast cooked in white sauce served with pasta of your choice.
Involtini Di Agnello Con Fungi - Lamb slices stuffed with mushroom baked in oven with red wine.

With time their standards are falling and so is their popularity. However, you can surely try their Mediterranean ala carte rather than buffet spread.¬†
Pocket pinch is at par with any other specialty restaurant in the city.

Location:
The top-most floor of the Mani Square Mall. 

The restaurant was almost empty when we reached, around eight-thirty, so a walk-in wouldn't be a big deal. We were a group of twelve and we opted for the buffet. 

The ambiance: The place looks exotic, with big dining space, neat bar and plenty of place in between the tables. Music was Arabic. As soon as you walk in, there's a small fountain which adds beauty to the place. There are beautiful lamps and chic seating. Very orderly. 

The service: I wish I could be satisfied with the nice gesture of pulling out chairs for the ladies to be seated, after the initial high, it was an unsatisfactory service. In a buffet? Yes! 
Why so? 
The veg starters were only brought in after request and not continuously served. So the time I had to wait till I got my next Paneer tikka was close to ten minutes.
The cutlery must have been replaced after each course. The service was SLOW.
While serving vegetarian starters, the waiters could have named the dishes. The reason I am so ill informed about the dishes in this review because no one cared to tell me what I was eating. Also, I was informed that there was a live pasta bar, after I was done with my dessert.

The food:
We were offered complimentary cold drinks on arrival, shown the way to the spread when we requested buffet, Vegetarians were told to wait for their starters; non-veg starters were kept along the main spread. The cream of tomato soup was excellent to start with, though the non veg counterpart(cream of chicken I think) was not up to the mark.
My friends tell me that the fish was soft and succulent, but they did not like the minced prawns much. 
Dal Makhani and Paneer Makhanii? Could have come up with better vegetarian main course.
One: The starters were okayish.
Two: The main course degraded even more. 
The spinach tikki was the only good vegetarian starter. The paneer tikka was so uncooked, I could taste the raw marinade. The chutney refilled after severall reminders.
Au gratin and Spinach dello Chef are two, star dishes of this place. Everyone should indulge in these. 
The Kiwi mousse could have been a mousse to remember, but it gave a strong artificial taste. Rest of the desserts were satisfactory but not especially good.

Overall I would say, they should inform their diners, be fast on their feet and make the live counter actually live. 

Not going again, unless if someone really wants to eat Au Gratin.

Located in Mani Square mall, Mia Amore mainly serves up Mediterranean Cuisines. Ambiance was quite nice and specious, sitting arrangements were also comfortable. This contemporary venue serves up dish after dish all day long. Diners fill their tummies with fusion dishes laid out on the wooden tables inside the restaurant. In addition to food, there is also a wide selection of wine available. Like love, food comes in various sizes, cooked in various ways, and can be enjoyed by allowing the fork to kiss the knife. 

In starters we love to try out 'Charcoal Grilled Fish Kebab' and 'Crumb Fried Chicken Wings' along with soft drinks. Service was extremely professional but not at all friendly or makes you feel like home, I have not seen a single staff with smiling face in one and half hour. Anyway food served to us was hot and quantity was nice. Charcoal Grilled Fish Kebab was mouthwatering & delicious, a perfect way to start your meal. Crumb Fried Chicken Wing was tasty but not as good as Grilled Fish Kebab. The coating they used for Fried Chicken Wings were bit stiff, I think it will taste much better with soft crispy coating though my friend thought both starters were good enough. 

Now moving to main course we decided to have 'Chicken Au-Gratin', 'Chicken Lasagne', 'Salsa Sofia Loren' and 'Pollo Cantina'. The service was extremely quick and everything looked scrumptious. Chicken Lasagne taste so awesome, it made me stay speechless for few seconds. Chicken Au-Gratin was equally top-notch and mind-blowing, hats off to the chef for making those dishes. The Salsa Sofia Loren was very creamy and had a wonderfully mix of spices, the dish was cooked to perfection. Salsa Sofia Loren was magnificent and a must order dish. Pollo Cantina tasted pretty average and we did not like it at all, may be the taste of Sofia Loren was still occupying our taste buds.

Our desserts was two course affair, we had ‚ÄòCreap Fantasia‚Äô and ‚ÄòGulab Jamun‚Äô.¬† Creap Fantasia was attractive and very interesting but not enough to touch my heart. This place is ideal for both family and friends if you are in Mani Square. You should definitely check out this place if you like to adventure with your taste buds!

Buffet zone in mani square.The decoration and ambiance is the only awesome thing here.Medieval lamps..a indoor fountain and a soft tickling music..Its all nice in that part.
Coming to food...Very few dishes in the buffet spread.The starter will include fish chicken and mutton.The fish dish was full of mayonnaise and was not able to tuck in much of it. Chicken dishes are so so. Main course has hardly any variety in it. For 3 times I have visited they are making the same Mutton Rogan Josh (believe me it tastes nothing nothing like roganjosh) and a biriyani (with no nice smell or taste like ones in Arsalan).
Dessert : what a horror. A mousse in pineapple flavor(you will not be able to have more than a spoon of it)...only vanilla ice cream with Hershey's choco sauce(the bottle of which is almost always empty),gulabjamun that will require some great chewing to digest,they are so hard and thats it!!
Service was very slow..Very inattentive waiters...
A funny point...they will give you chloromint with the bill.
The price is a bit low.
So you can just give it a try once.As for me I am never going back.

I have frequented Mani Square mall so many times but never went to this place. For the first time i visited this restaurant last week. The decor was very nice with middle eastern lamps. The space is quite large. The service was not too attentive. I asked for two soups and got one in reply. :-( The service very slow too. There were only 10/15 diners at that time, but they took ages to bring the dishes. I was there with my toddler and they did not have a high chair.
The presentation was great. The taste was also good but not awesome. We ordered for soup, some fish starters and pasta in white sauce as main course. The pocket pinch was also less, the total meal cost us around Rs. 800. Nice place to chill if you do not like the over crowded restaurants.

I have just come out of this restaurant. We were served cold and uncooked food in buffet and the manager was not trying to admit and said that other customers were not complaining. Another customer immediately said that they also felt the same. Then the manager tried to offer fresh food but I declined coz the uncooked raw meat had already killed our appetite. When i asked how he expects us to pay for this food, he asks us to leave. The behavior of the manager was appalling. I think for the first time I have seen in a restaurant that a customer was asked to leave. To not to be totally pessimistic, I would like to say that the veg starter was good but I think the behaviour of the manager was startling. I have also reported this to Mani Square's Senior Manager of Hospitality as Mani Square's brand is also at stake.

This is actually quite a good place to come to if you crave a wide range of cuisines at a decent price .¬†
The first thing you notice here is the decor, very artsy and should I say, "European".¬†
We had the non-veg buffet here, and the spread is quite lavish, they even make you a paneer shawarma and a custom-made pasta if you want. Otherwise, the starters were good - the kebabs were almost made to perfection, especially the prawn one. The Greek-styled fish was easily the best thing on the menu, closely followed by the Mediterranean-styled vegetables.¬†Coming to desserts, the orange mousse and the fruit cakes were delectable, but the ice cream was a bit on the bland side.However, this felt a little mismanaged as compared to the more established gourmet restaurants, particularly with respect to the buffet arrangement. Hope this will be resolved in future.

A la Carte is the way to go for this joint. If you are tired of the regular Indian, Chinese and Italian cuisines then this is the place to go for you.
Their appetizers are killer when had with drinks which are also very reasonably priced.
Don't think twice before going for their Risottos and the pita bread.
The Turkey Roulade which they serve is something worth going back for.
Ambience is excellent. Staff prompt and well mannered. 
This joint is worth a visit definitely. 

P.S: I celebrated my Anniversary here and it was Perfect!

Wonderful place to relax and eat and enjoy. The place is very spacious and the interior is really soothing. The food is extremely light and tasty! Really, there aren't many Mediterranean restaurants out there, and Mio Amore is truly one of it's kind in Kolkata.

Been there on Groupon voucher. Oh yes ! the famous look down upon groupon voucher.
The attitude of the staffs changes on seeing the voucher as if their salary will be deducted because of us .
They come back after some time stating there was no advance reservation and the attitude was that they want us to leave. On a little confronting attitude from my partner they backed off and decided to serve us stating "mio amore " is high class and we should have reserved although its primarily empty on a weekday.

Again because of Groupon we had no choice for starters only four options in main dish.
I dont get why this discrimination and why give vouchers if you dont want to serve the so called "Groupon customers" .¬†

WE ARE PAYING OUR MONEY FOR THE VOUCHERS [not there for free food ]

Disappointed with the starters and dessert but the main dishes were good.

Over all a bad experience.

Another fantastic joint to try out. The restaurant is located inside Mani Square and far exceeds the basic expectations many of us have come to demand from Restaurants in malls. I personally love this joint, mainly because I have a great liking for Mediterranean cuisine. The restaurant delivers in all major fields - food, management, d√©cor and staff.¬†

As an avid fan of Italian cuisine, Mio Amore comes through as one of the better restaurants in Kolkata. It does a good number on the pita bread as well, not to mention the delicious Couscous. It probably is a better bet than it's neighbouring restaurants, and is a definite must-try.

I would recommend you steer clear of the buffet, as the a la carte is a much better option. The pricing is very reasonable. I've eaten here multiple times, and I've been impressed every single time. Great experience!

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

In my opinion this place has many drawbacks. I was there in the beginning of December 2014. Firstly, cost wise it is very high. The food items are very less in compared to buffet. The quality of food is not at all good. One more thing also I have noticed that in spite of being a buffet the staff doesn't allow the customers to eat properly also. They are always in a rush to put the customers out of the restaurant. Without even completing the main course they got the desserts for us and without asking for the bill they got it for us. Absolutely hopeless. When we were thinking of trying one another dish they straightaway got the desserts for us without even asking for it. I would say the ambiance is good but the other criterion of being a good restaurant does not works here.

Frankly, I think this place is terribly overrated. We opted for the buffet and could barely eat anything, except for desserts. Maybe the bland food did not stir our Indian spicy food-loving palates, in which case, our bad. The ambiance is nice, but that's the only good thing about this place, in my humble opinion.

Place best avoided, wanted to give a lower rating if possible.

The restaurant just had 6 diners and took ages to get the food to the table. Except the chicken in white sauce and the choco dosa type dessert it was just miserable. The staff is useless .. absolutely.

Fountain is the only positive aspect of this place.

It was my first visit to "Mio Amore".As yesterday was 30th wedding anniversary of my parents we decided to check out new places for dinner and we decided to eat dinner at "MIO AMORE".First of all, I would like to start with the surroundings of the hotel , it was great.The Hotel was clean and tidy.The helpers was very helpful.The light music was played in the background .Now the most important the food . The starters was good . Among these , i would like to give prawn kebab out of 5 ,4 stars. The main course was good .The desert consisted of gulab- jamun, pineapple ,cake and strawberry mousse . Among these,I liked pineapple one because it was really soft and very tasty.Overall , I am satisfied with the buffet.So I am recommend to try buffet especially pine-apple mousse and kebab.

It was 4 out of 5.

I had non-veg buffet lunch here on a weekend. I am dissatisfied with the quality of food here. I will rate the starters as 3/5. Soup (worst soup, i ever ate...I found that they have mixed cheese and chicken in the soup) 1/5. And in the main course, I was surprised to taste the chicken curry (don't remember the Mio Amore name they have given it to). It tasted so bad, worst combination of spices with a boiled chicken in it. No mocktail included in the meal. And finally the desert, gulab jamun, ice cream and pastry...Lucky to fill my tummy with gulab jamuns.

I was hesitant at first to try this place, however ultimately gave in to the repeated pleadings of my friend. The decor of this place is up to scratch, the ambience is soothing, and the service is also very satisfactory. However the thing that let us down was the food. We shouldn't have gone for the buffet which we did and it turned up very mediocre. The kebabs were only acceptable, nothing to write home about, and the three other non veg courses of chicken, fish and mutton that followed were not enjoyable either. The rice was a complete disaster. Only the kulcha and the butter naan were palatable. Paying ‚Çπ450+ for a buffet which can't be savoured to the heart's content is not a bright idea for me. A la carte options, viz the Mediterranean dishes could be a much better choice, but the buffet was not up to the mark. Ambience, decor n service get votes up, the  buffet gets a thumbs down.

The buffet cost is very reasonable but the individual a la carte foods are too costly.

Tips: In buffet, don't go for the Indian foods here, they are just average, but the European & Mediterranean foods are awesome.

One of the lesser known restaurants of the city, Mio Amore is all about European and Mediterranean cuisine. I still cannot explain the low footfall here because the food is absolutely awesome and the price pretty reasonable. An elaborate non-veg buffet is Rs 475 + tax.

Perhaps the 'mango people' as we call them are scared of the unknown, so do not prefer taking the road less traveled. (However now they have infused Indian in their menu and on the buffet to attract people, much to my dismay).

The 22 page menu has everything exotic ranging from antipasti to frittata! There is a wine list too, and a pint of beer comes as cheap as 160 Rs. approximately.
The decor is in one word - MAJESTIC. There are a few places in Kolkata, so tastefully yet richly decorated as this one.

Here are the things that I absolutely love:

Hummus and Pita Bread - middle eastern bread and dip combo

Zucchini pancakes - Turkish zucchini wraps with a creamy sauce dressing

Mezzeh Salad - Lebanese mixed salad with burghul (cracked durum wheat), 
faltoush, avocado dip, and red chilly puree

Baked fish stuffed with mascarpone spinach - the name says it all

Chicken Shish Touk - yoghurt marinated chicken kebab

Khobz - Moroccan bread 

Pastas are also worth a try. However I will not speak for the desserts. They were just about average. In all, a highly recommended restaurant.

Food? 1/5 Please people, avoid this place,the only thing that caught my attention was the decor, the buffet was awful. cummon, we have had swawarma roll at other places,it was disgusting. n the chicken was not good either. lets just say that other than the prawn bbq there was nothing. it was the only thing as a plus.

just try fame n grill just next to it.

A PLACE WITH A GREAT NAME BUT NO GAME¬†
Seeing the great name and so-so rating in zomato,thought that I should give it a try. Went with the buffet option and that might be the ¬†biggest mistake I had ever made.
The shawarma roll was one of the worst, the bread wrap was kind of sour, like what happens when it goes stale and I have had shawarma rolls earlier to know the difference. The kebabs were not that succulent as you expect, it was really mediocre . The pulao was real bad, it had a kind of cardboard taste. The Moroccan chicken was the worst preparation of chicken I ever had, the mutton rogan josh was okay but not anything to compliment about.
Now a handfull of things I liked(only 3 to be exact)-
The prawn ball in bbq sauce,it was awesome, the pescado capadio- Its a creamy preparation of fish and it tastes awesome and a ¬†creamy rice which was good according to my taste.
Coming to the deserts there is nothing to mention-The only dessert we were given was a fruit salad,vanilla ice cream with Hershey's chocolate sauce and a kiwi mousse ,I did not dare the fruit salad,the ice cream was not kept in a cooler and was melting and it was watery and the chocolate sauce didn't make it any better, the kiwi mousse tasted nothing like kiwi and had artificial flavour¬†.
I expect the same kind of quality, if not better, if I try the buffet instead of the a la carte menu, so that's been a bummer and I'm never going back to mio amore and to the ¬†foodies who want to try the buffet,stay away .........with nearly Rs.600 cashing out without tax, it's better to spend a couple of hundreds more and have at any other restaurants.

We visited this place during the pujas so was greeted with a special menu with the options of buffet and a la carte. Opting for the latter, we ordered for shish taouk as starter and some mocktails; for the main course we had veg fried rice and spicy moroccan chicken with onion and nuts. The starter was absolutely sublime...the kebabs beautifully juicy and seasoned. And the chicken was satisfying...although the ginger taste was a little overpowering for my taste. The service was prompt, the servers polite and helpful. The ambience and decor was spacious enough. Overall...good dining experience.

Went for a sunday lunch buffet. Overall this place lacks authenticity. The starters were named after Turkish/Lebanese dishes, but basically they tasted like Indian kebabs, and were good from an Indian perspective. The chicken shawarma was great though. The main course was a mixture of mediterranean and indian. The fish was good, but the chicken lacked freshness. Desserts were passable. Service on the slower side, but courteous. Priced at 475+ taxes.

Going by a rating of 3.8 I thought of trying out this place at Mani Square Mall. The initial impression was quite good with an aesthetic decor, large space and courteous staff. We opted for the buffet menu as it had a number of items to offer. Although I couldn't quite get my head around why there were items like Mutton Rogan Josh in a Mediterranean menu! Starting from the soup to starters through the mains, the food was very average. I only liked the dessert they had to offer which was kind of like a Mediterranean bread pudding. However, I might give this place another chance to try out some of the specific dishes from their √Ä la carte menu.

Talking about the ambiance this place is quite impressive....You could get a complete quietness with even a crowd....Its a calm place and to talk about the decor i have to say its brilliant......Its at the corner of the Mani Square Mall, Top Floor.....and you have to cross a bridge to reach it......Inside it, it is brilliantly decorated......The sitting places, The food table every thing at the right place......

Now to talk about the food it didn't impress me much......The food had a weird smell, though not stale.....Mostly i like every cuisine but this time i didn't like some dishes.....though the buffet offered a wide range of dishes....The staffs were helpful though......

The price was Average......I would like to tell if anyone likes to try Mediterranean cuisine, its a good place....

The names on the menu will confuse you initially but the curtious nature of the management will make sure they clear your doubts and you order a dish which you would definitely like.

The food is a little expensive , but the quantity was enough for the 4 of us.¬†
The ambiance is very pleasant and it is exactly the kind of pleasant time you will be looking for with your family and loved ones.¬†

Since I stay out of Calcutta , when I do come back and have to ¬†catch up for dinner , I do mention Mio Amore to him/her and everyone of them have appreciated it.

Yesterday I visited this place at Mani Square with my wife as this is the last retaurant left inside this mall we haven't left our footsteps. We opted for the Non Veg buffet( 475+ tax). The ambience, space, interior decoration were excellent. The courtesy of the staffs were seriously very pleasant. In starters they served, one fish item, one chicken kebab, prawn balls, and one chicken-veg wrap (just like KFC but in a small size). This was followed by Chicken cream soup and pasta in white sauce(live counter). Being a cheese lover, all these starters were too lipsmacking that I almost filled up my stomach with the starters and pasta. Then we moved for the main course. They served one fish item cooked with cheese, one chicken item, one mutton dish, veg fried rice, one cheese-spinach curry and pan cake. The main course were good if not excellent like the starters. Finally the desert - mango mousse, fruits, hot gulab jamun and vanila ice cream with chocolate sauce. Overall, I liked the place and food and would recommend to go at least once and specially if you like Italian cheese based food, it should be a must go for you as in kolkata we have very few authentic Italian retaurant.

One of the very rare restaurants in the city which offer a wide array of dishes from the Mediterranean region, Mio Amore was able to satisfy us entirely with the ambiance, the service and the taste. The restaurant looks beautiful, and the limited space is made good use of, using decorations and mirrors which accentuate the size of the restaurant, and give you the feeling of entering into an intricately decorated palace. The waiters are very polite and quite prompt with their service. Another aspect which was really good was that the description of each dish on the menu was detailed enough with even a mention of its origin, which induced even more interest in us long before the food arrives. The spices were mild to the Indian palate, and yet far from bland, and created a subtle magical taste which lingered on long after we had finished our dinner. In all, it is definitely a restaurant I would go back to, and even invite all my important guests to.

SCINTILLATING.....this is the first word that comes to my mind while i recall my experience at Mio Amore. Its an awsum ambience overall, not much of a crowd as compared to the other resturaunts at Mani Square like Machan, Rajdhani and all. Its a peaceful place at the top floor ,free from the hustle bustle of the entire Mani Square. We went during the FIFA world cup season, the tables were decorated with the flags. Coming to the food, I felt they make d best Yakitori in the city. Even the lasagne was above par with wat I had tasted earlier in Kolkata. Only thing which made me upset was they couldn't serve Tiramisu dat day. But instead, the Lebanese desert which they served was mouthwatering too. Nice service from the staffs. Overall very pleasant experience, and its much much cheaper than other mediterranean food joints of the city.

I walked in with a friend for a lunch buffet without having any prior opinion about thos place. We were served chicken minestrone soup on table and i kind of liked the soup enough to request a helping. The buffet had a shwarma counter a live pasta counter and the rest of the spread. I found the started cold enough to not to serve on a buffet. However the prawn balls were edible. Moving on into the main course i realized my mistake of walking in without prior information. Having developed a pallette for Mediterranean cuisine, i can tell good from bad. I wasted a plateful of food.
The dessert was 3 course : an extremely dry marble cake, orange mousse and gulab jamun. 
Ice cream was kept in a metal container without any freezer. The icecream was ki d of inedible even with Hershey's chocolate sauce.
The interiors are quite well done and classy. The nonalcoholic beverages are quite economical.
A total of 567 inclusive of all taxes were charged. No complimentary drinks were provided.

Went there for the lunch buffet opting for the non veg one. 
The starters were more amazing than the main course. Would love to go back again

A warm welcome set the tone for the lunch. Being a vegetarian we settled for vegetarian buffet with a request for serving the initial starter to be served, which was accepted with a smile. All set and then arrives a finely chopped fresh salad and very tempting cheese balls. The remaining starters actually were fine and the dip was very tasty. As we moved to the main course I think that requires a little care as the pasta on white sauce was not feeling fresh. The dal was good and so was the other baked items. Nan was crispy and we ended with a rosogolla. The electric wiring was being repaired right on top of the food which should have been taken care off.

I happened to drop in for dinner with my friends on Saturday night,we went for the non veg buffet.The spread was limited,in starters section only the prawn & fish preparation was good.However lack of accompaniments with the starters mars down the overall experience.In the main course Fish preparation was awesome, the chicken & mutton dish were absolutely distasteful, the mutton was not even cooked properly. Same was the scenario in the desserts section, orange mousse tasted more of orange cream & the ice cream was devoid of sweetness. All in all this place is absoutely not worth visiting.

Tried out the buffet out there on saturday. The buffet spread was not at all good, the food was cold and stale. in the live counters the waiters took lots of time to bring the dish to the table, and also we were 5 persons, he allways bought 2 to 3 servings, to serve 5 persons. Falafel and shwarma was too bad and nothing near the stuff from the popular street joints. Our appetite died and we didnt care to eat even after the first helping. Most of the spread was kept empty and people got fed up and went back. There was more waiters/stewards than customers there but they simply stood there and guarded the pieces of food so that none can be fed properly. 
   Very poor food and strategy. Wud suggest not to waste time, energy and money here , but to visit a better buffet redtaurant.

We went in there on a Friday afternoon. A group of 16. Infact you might be surprised to know we didn't book any table before going to this place. Infact we decided about Mio Amore just before getting into the cars. Anyway, not reserving a table ultimately did not pose any issue on that day. The eatery was just empty when we stepped in for lunch. We decided to go for non-veg buffet which comes at around 475/- + tax, quite reasonable I guess. To start with, there was Stracciatella Soup which honestly I didn't like it that much, then we moved on to starters which included - Salads, Samak Chermoula, Asian Italian Chicken Kebab, Prawn Balls, Live chicken shawarma. I loved the prawn balls and chicken kebabs, also the Shawarma along with Houmus was good to taste. Also they served some tasty pasta which was tossed and cooked right in front of us. In the non-veg main course there was Tagine of Fish which I simply loved and ended up hogging a lot of it. Then there were Pollo Dello Chef Chicken and Laham Salona Mutton - both were equally well prepared. Apart from this we tasted the Lasagne and Legume ala Sicilian which were too much stuffed with cheese and just filled us up instantly. In the dessert - I really liked the Yasoon cake & Ice cream with chocolate sauce combination. And now comes the best part apart from the food - It's the superb interior decor and the lovely ambiance, just a class apart! It was actually the birthday of one of our friends in the group, so a surprise cake was brought in and birthday songs were played loud making the birthday boy pleasantly surprised and embarrassed! All in all - a beautiful experience and I'll surely recommend this place to all my foodie friends. Cheers!

Horrible is an under statement!!!
It was Friday, I had been there for dinner  (buffet) with my group of friends. It was one  an experience I aint gonna forget in a long long time. Th veg food was horrendous and pathetic to say the least and to top it all the service was exceptionally poor. Avoid having buffet here, it sure is a no no...
I am not going there anytime soon would recommend that you all stay away as well.

Can bring more variety in d dessert spread...morrocan, lebanese food incorporated in d spread is a goog idea as guests can try different cuisines. Price is very very reasonable. Nice decor.

Have been to this place on a weekday..I liked the concept. Though we didn't like the Shawarma. It seems that they never had Shwarma. But everything else was good. The ambience was good as well. I will highly recommend people sinec there are not much options in Kolkata for such food. The dishes are more continental than Mediterrean. Still it is worth trying because they are good (barring Shwarama).

We went there for Sunday lunch and opted for buffet. 
The ambience was good.
Regarding food, the soup that was served was thick with shredded chicken and full of cream, tasted not at all good. In starters they had chicken and fish kebabs and prawn in bbq sauce. These were good in taste. They served chicken sawarma, but that was not up to the mark. In main course, rice was of okay type, the chicken preparation was very sweet, which I didn't like, the fish in white sauce too was not good in taste and mutton rogan josh, which was well cooked and tasty. In desserts they had cake slices, mixed fruit salad, hot gulab jamun and ice cream. Overall it was not bad but I can't say it to be very good.

Now its twice that I have visited this place with a long span in between and voila! Nothing has changed...! the same awesome decor and the same quality of food if not better. Great ambiance and great food is what best describes the place. The Mediterranean dishes are awesome with the Prawn Balls scoring the highest among us. The Moroccan Chicken and the Stracciatella soup were delicious too. The kebabs were one of the very best quality, as tender as it can be. The only sore point was the dessert area. What we didn't like was the choice of the desserts and also the arrangement. It would have been great had they kept some other jellies along with the chocolate sauce for the vanilla ice-cream. Also the cakes and tart were not as tasty as we would have liked. Still, keeping all the odds in mind, this is a great place to hang out equally with friends and family.

i would say the overall experiance of the buffet spread was good ! the starters were good but the soup could have been much better . the prawn balls were not good . getting to the main course the spread was delicious and well served . the shawarma was a bad let down and was not worth it . the salads could have been a bit more better . the variety of breads was really great except the masala kulcha . the chicken nd mutton rogan josh was quite soft and well made .  the spinach rice was awesome .  comming to the desserts the browie was decent but the firni was quite good . i missed a gulab jamun r mousse . to end it the waiters were really very helpful and caring that made us comfortable nd everytime they served the dishes to the table . the would get a thumbs up from me ! overall as i said a good exp till i visit the next time .

Went to this place last Saturday n I was initially quite impressed by the overall decor of the place, behavior of the staff and low price of weekend buffet (non veg Rs 475)
But my high hopes were dashed once the food started coming in.. the starters except for the creamy chicken soup and mutton balls were a total let down. The live shawarma counter is just another gimmick.. the shawarma roll was stiff with a bland filling and my jaws literally ached while chewing it.. for a restaurant which claims to specialise in Mediterranean and Italian delicacies, this was a big shock..
Coming to the main course, the items had fancy Italian names but unfortunately the flavours n preparations were mostly North Indian.. the chicken and mutton items were nothing worth mentioning.. the only yummy dish in the non veg section was the grilled fish..
In the desert section again nothing special.. the mousse was okay and the tutti fruti cake was stiff.. could just enjoy the vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce..
Overall decor n ambience are impressive but not worth a second visit
Oh n yes, a word of caution to all Bloody Mary lovers.. never try it over here.. you' ll develop a lifelong repulsion from it! !

Last saturday i was in a mood to try out mediterranean cuisine... So for months i was hoping to visit Mio amore.. The place is situated at the top floor of Mani Square mall.
It was a birthday dinner which i planned for my special friend.. Undoubtedly the place is very classy and the decor is top notch.. The pictures in the wall are very mesmerising.
Coming to the food,i opted for their buffet.. Very reasonable i must say.. The starter was average but i really liked their prawn starter.. I don't remember the name exactly.
The main course was delicious.. Specially the baked rice and greek fish..but i was hoping for a proper mediterranean buffet.. But their was Indian cuisine also.. Which i didn't like. 
The deserts is very limited only brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce and gajar ka halwa.. Gajar ka halwa was perfect but the brownie was not soft..i would really appreciate if Mio amore include more options in deserts.
And lastly the service which is really commendable.. Because the staff members are very much friendly and warmly welcomes you 

So for me not a disappointment.. The evening, ambience and the food was totally a good experience.. Must visit.. And specially try their buffet

Mio Amore has very good ambience. This place is located inside Mani Square mall which makes  suitable for anyone looking to spend sometime shopping, watching movies and then having a nice lunch or dinner at a good place for reasonable price. All the food items (Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian) were tasty. It also served drinks, but they mostly provide drinks which are not mass-drinkers' favorites. 

Rate can be considered Rs.500 per head for non-buffet. Buffet is also reasonably priced and provides choices, though non-buffet is recommended.

I guess our search for ‚Äúsomething different ‚Äú is a never ending journey MIO AMORE  being one of the stops in my part this elusive embark ! The very thought of MOROCCAN AND MEXICAN  food being served up in an eclectically done up premises was a ‚Äúturn on‚Äù in itself . But then sadly I ended up having NORTH INDIAN CUISINE  which was definitely not my purpose of visit . However, if you are not so picky about the cuisine you have decided for an eat out this place is a good option as what they served looked and tasted good.  Staff were polite and the pocket pinch was decent .

The ambiance is pretty attractive but the food was an average one..The service is very slow , we kept waiting for near about than 30 mins and the only good part was the Tandoori macchi which tasted really good. We had buffet on our second visit (hopefully my last visit if they dnt improve) which was okay, the expectation for Mediterranean food was on high but sadly there were nothing much to choose from..!!

This evening I went to my favourite restaurant in Mani Sqaure, Mio Amore. I went there many a times before. but certainly will never go there again. I am grossly dissatisfied with their service and the quality of food. We went for the buffet. We liked the spread in our previous visits. However, this time - the hummus was thick and stinky, the Tahine was evidently bitter in taste. A nearly 15 year old boy was running the live pasta counter. I don't blame him. He was too young for his job. I had to wait for more than twenty minutes for the pasta. This was a time when we literally had to take a break because the trays in  half the spread were empty. The management was smart enough to indicate at the other half and was asking us to enjoy them with big smile. After more than 20 minutes those items appeared and my pasta. The pasta tasted nothing - a few boiled penne tossed in olive oil with as little veggies as possible and with absolutely no herb.  As if this not enough- the fruits in the fruit salad were stale. Before we finished eating of the service men came to us and asked if he could take our plates but did not care to listen to our answers. He took away my nephews plate while he still was eating. Amazing! 

It was hard to believe that my favourite restaurant and deteriorated to this level. I will strongly discourage any foody to go over there in future.

Yesterday we went out with my office colleagues for dinner. The place is huge with lots of spaces. We ordered for the Non Veg buffet. The soup was good and the starters, fish, chicken and prawn were really yummy. But the let down was the main course food as it was not really good with Rice being quite hard (maybe because it was quite late and had been in place for long time). The deserts were good. Overall a good experience.

I visited this place twice and willing to visit it again. It has a perfect place to share a meal with your family and loved ones. The decor of this place is certainly in its 'pro' list. This place offers a range of Mediterranean items which doesn't hurt your pocket but pleases your foodie-heart. My personal favourite is 'Rotole Di Pollo Al Romeo'. The buffet however is a letdown which lacks  in quality and taste.

Will definitely suggest people to visit this place just to try different cuisine. Kolkata is filled with Chinese and Mughlai joints anyway.

Located just above the Food Court at Mani Square mall, the restaurant offers nice ambience and tasty Mediterranean food. Had opted for the buffet spread on a weekday and it was value for money. The Live Counter made great pasta too.
If one needs a break from the regular Mughlai, Chinese fare, then I would definitely recommend Mio Amore.

"Wow! This place is nice! ..And so empty.", was our first reaction the moment we stepped in for the dinner buffet, just last evening. Good lighting, awesome decor and quite decent background music (they were playing Enigma in loop) - very plush ambiance indeed. And then came the menu cards.. They do have a lot to offer! Having opted for the buffet, our choices were limited. Buts that's not to say we weren't happy with what we got. Kebabs, meatballs, salads and soup; all for starters. Main course was equally satisfying. I'd like to point out here that their fish-items are exquisite! And the complimentary pint of Foster's was a nice touch.However, the desert section wasn't at par with the rest of the meal. They did have a Mediterranean specialty on offer, which was quite good, but frankly, I could have gone for some more pastries and chocolates and stuff. The cheque brought back our smiles though.. at under 1200 for a scrumptious meal (including taxes), it seemed like yeaterday's prices. I'm gonna go for broke here and say that its the best overall experience that I have recently had. I'd recommend this one to everybody who likes to try something new once in a while. I for one, am definitely coming back!

I have visited this place 4 times. 
Why I love it
1. Ambience 
Quiet and the restaurant has very few people on weekdays, so whenever I go, I get the table of my choice.
2. The Food
Each Item on their menu is great. Its far better than BBQ Nation in terms of individual dishes.
What I dont like
1. The Lack of variety 
Yes. There is almost nothing in terms of variety. Pretty standard menu.
What I hate
1. Only one thing
The desserts. They are okay yes. But, unlike BBQ Nation, there is not a huge amount of desserts. So, I expect that just like the rest of their small menu, this would be great. Every time, this part is a disappointment.
You should give it a try, if you like it great but there is no way that the trip will seem like a futile effort. But it is NOT EXCEPTIONAL.

Went to Mio Amore with a big hope of finding something new, a welcome break from the chinese, mughlai, or even continental. Won't say it disappointed us but yes, their options should have been more 'Mediterranean'-y. Italian food is not only pasta, u know...and also they could have included Greek food on the buffet. At first I thought it ought to be an only Italian spread, going by the name, and expectedly there were some pasta in white sauce which tasted good. Also, there were shawarma wraps, hummus, a Mediterranean pie in the buffet menu. The interiors were done in a very different 'Mediterranean' style. In all, good ambiance, good food, although options should have been more in number. Also, dessert doesn't always have to be icecream with chocolate sauce. If you ask me whether or not will i visit it again? Yes, i would with a hope of finding more exotic preparations.

The speciality of this place is its decor and ambiance. I've heard great reviews about this restaurant and was quite excited to visit this place. A great friend of mine took me to this place for a grand treat. If you want to surprise someone special or propose in a grand ambiance with nice lights around, beautiful drapes, and lovely paintings hanging from the walls, this is a nice place. I found the food average. However, the starters were good. Among the non-veg appetizers, the Tandoori Macchi, was brilliant. It is basically cubes of fillet fish marinated and grilled in charcoal fire. The fish tikkas were soft, moist and juicy. They were actually melting in my mouth. Compared to the Tandoori Macchi, Chicken Tikka was not that outstanding.

Warning: Avoid the Live Chicken Shawarma they serve. They take time to prepare it, which makes you hope that what a masterpiece they are going to serve, but it's not. If you ever had good Shawarma rolls, you will know what I'm talking about. Also, they almost forced us to have pasta which took more time to prepare than we expected. We had a few spoons of it, dumped, and concentrated on the main course again. In the desserts section, there were gulab jamuns, ice creams, brownies, and orange mousse. Nothing you have never had before.

I didn't find anything worth remembering about the main course. It was pretty OK. The food tasted good but nothing exceptional. You get to eat such quality foods in almost every restaurant of that range.

Before ending it, I must write about their customer services which raised my brows. The people who served are a bit arrogant, I don't know why. They behaved as if they are doing us a favour by serving. I've been to all the restaurants in Mani Squere, and most of those places are better than this.

Mio Amore came out a refreshing option of Mediterranean food in north kolkata a couple of years back. The decor and hospitality is great. The decor has been done in an extra ordinary fashion which is very elegant and soothing. The seating is very spacious and comfortable. The staff is very polite, warm.

It offers a variety of Moroccan and Mediterranean food in its menu. I loved the pasta as well as the risotto preparations. The garlic bread is pretty well made. It has started serving indian food too. Dal is great , rotis are crisp and tasteful but other veggies aren't so amazing. The place is quite empty on weekdays which tend to make you feel weird but food compensates for it. It was one of the first few places to serve shawarma in Kolkata .

There is a buffet also priced which was priced at Rs 450 AI couple of months back. They served kebabs in the starters that were great but the soup was a disaster. The options were not so diverse in the main course which was a big turn off. Cannelloni was not that good which was a shocker for me. The buffet did not contain the best items of their menu is what i felt. The deserts were not that great either.

Ultimately buffet was a major let down after some wonderful experiences when we ordered Ala-carte.

Pros:
1) Pretty reasonable prices for good quality food
2) Good decor, friendly and warm service
3) Lots of options in food
4) Italian preparations
5) indian starters

Minuses:
1) Buffet is a disaster and a complete no-no for me
2) soups are not great
3) emptiness of the place ( for some

Went to this place for an office party with foreign clients and the catch of this place is the ambiance.. Very gracefully decorated with photos and lampshades, the ambiance really refresh our mind. We opted for Buffet dinner. 

The chicken soup came a bit late. It was smoky hot and tastes decent. Moving on to the starters, salads were nice, Fish and chicken kebabs tasted awesome while I personally didnt like the mutton kebabs much. They also served cheese balls and shawarma wrap , which i did not like. In main course , they had plenty of items both veg and non veg. Among them the item made with fish and some preparation with brinjal (dont remember their names) stole the show.. Other items were also good, but nothing much to whip about. In dessert they had fruit salad, brownie , gulab jamun and ice cream. Brownie tasted really nice but gulab jamuns were too sweet for me, so could not ate more than one.

Our clients from US and France liked the food, but for me its the ambiance which I find more attractive than the food.

This restaurant had been on my 'To-Visit' list for quite a long time... I finally went there this evening... And to put it in short, I was hugely disappointed... We went for the Weekend Buffet and that was pretty average stuff... Starters are not served at the table, except for the Shwarma wraps, which do not taste that great for a restaurant that prides itself in being one of the top few to dish out Mediterranean and Lebanese food... The starters included Chicken Tikka, Fish Tandoori and Mutton Balls and were more or less good enough... Coming to the main course, it had one good Fish preparation with a name that you wont remember, and bony chicken and mutton which were nothing too great... The pilaf rice was half cooked, which I learnt, is a speciality and there were some veg items I did not feel too inclined to taste... The desserts included hot Gulab jamun, ice-cream, brownies and orange mousse... Overall nothing great and nothing you have never had before... The service was also pretty flat... Not going back any time soon and even if I do, would have to go for A-La-Carte options... 
The only good points are the decor and the ambience, and the low priced buffet (475 plus taxes), but with the kind of food they served it would be difficult for them to price it too high... Also another plus point is that even on a weekend, the restaurant was half empty, and we didn't have to wait at all without a pre-booking... But we didn't get the hint then...

Recently after hearing about the place a lot, i decided to visit it for lunch . The resturant is indeed a nice place with soothing ambience. A classy touch was preasent there in every corner of the place . Coming to the food, I decided to go for the buffet which seemed really cheap to me as compared to other places. The food was really awsome with a little turkish touch. But the major things i didn't like abt the resturant is the service and desserts. The service was really slow. Orders which were placed came almost half our late , as an instance - water was served on table after we askd for that and it took around 15 mins to get it . The desserts part was quite dull with gulab jamun and orange moose only . Over all it was an ok ecperience so will give 3.5

This was a surprise find!! Awesome food, great ambience and absolute value for money!!!! Even my 4 year old liked the food...which is a big think considering how finicky she is about food...and the servings r so big that we were done in with just starters!! 
Rating: 1.5/2 for ambiance, service and location. I really liked the decor and the seating was comfortable. The staff was courteous and prompt.
3/3 for food, serving and pricing. The menu is really exhaustive and gives a lot of options to choose from. The pricing is absolute value for money- considering the quantity, quality and taste of the dishes. 
How i wish they would be in delhi...but this ll definitely be in my list of places to visit on my next trip to kol!

Possibly one of the most underrated restaurants in Kolkata, and certainly one of the very best. I have been here countless times, and each time, every single dish that I have ordered has been utterly flawless. The quality of food is exceedingly excellent, considering which the prices are more than reasonable. The mezze platter and the lamb are absolutely sublime. I only wish their desserts weren't so evasive. Often, I found that I wanted a tiramisu, only to be disappointed by its unavailability.

Juz returned from Mio Amore after a sumptuous buffet. It had been on my 'must try' list for some time now and I must confess that I am rather satisfied . The thing that works in favor of this unique restaurant is the ambiance which, I would say ,is at per with any of the restaurants in a 5-star. 
Upon entering, we were greeted by 2 lotus fountains . The wall is done in elegant white and blue. There is nothing gaudy about the interiors but it is rather enchanting and has a 'Royal' feel about it.
Moving on, we opted for the buffet spread which was modestly priced at 475 plus taxes. Being the insatiable foodie that I am, I couldn't refrain from particularly 2 of the starters- the chicken kebab and the crispy fish finger. I would go on to say that the fish finger was one of the most delectable ones that I have tasted over the course of time and is definitely worth having multiple go's at. The mutton keema balls were okay. The disappointment was the shawarma coz the pita bread was rather hard and the filling didn't arouse my taste buds. The humus served with it was pretty good though. The soup was again nothing to be fascinated about.
Coming to the main course, they had pilaf rice, a chicken item( made with indulgent amount of cheese and white sauce ), tomato fish, mutton rogan josh and an array of veg items like veg au-gratin, a rice item made with spinach and cheese, etc,etc. The fish was definitely good and so was the chicken. The rogan josh was nothing to boast about. The rice was bland. However, their veg preparations were quite up to the mark. 
The desert comprised of ice cream, fruit salad, strawberry cake and gulab jamun. This is the part where I was disappointed coz the desert spread was rather limited and was not at per with the other buffet outlets.
The main concern for me regarding the sustainability of the quality of the food over here is the unusual blend of Tandoor,Indian, Italian, Mediterranean and continental that they have infused in their buffet spread. I think they are better off serving continental fare rather than delving into Indian cuisines to satisfy our taste buds.
I am giving it half a star more coz the ambiance is plush and the waiters are genuinely courteous. It is a really warm and cozy place to dine in. And , next time, I would definitely go and try their A La Carte .

Food-3.5 stars
Service-4 stars

A multi cuisine restaurant with Italian name. Went there for a change to have some Italian food on 1st of Jan. At first glance the place looks stunning and opulent. The interiors are well decorated and spacious. Upon entering two lotus fountains welcomed us with perfectly lit ambiance.

We opted for buffet dinner which was around 575 plus tax on that very day. We started with non-veg soup which took some time to arrive but it was quite different and we liked that. They had a live shawarma and salad counter along with other dishes. The shawarma was good but the pita bread was not that soft. The salad was much more tastier than the shawarma. Moving on to other dishes, I liked there fish preparation in white sauce which was so creamy and awesome to have. They have indian kebabs and tandoori items too in the buffet but I think they should concentrate on Italian cuisine majorly which is more of their genre. In desserts they have the usual stuff nothing special about it. There are few items which really need serious attention so that a perfect balance of buffet can be enjoyed.

Overall had a great time at Mio Amore with friends on the first day of the year.

Excellent ambience, good non intrusive music in the background. The food itself was great!  Would recommend the Lebanese and moroccan cuisine. Didn't try Italian, though I'm told that is good too. 
The only negative was the speed of service. If you opt for ala carte, be prepared to wait a while. More so if you order cocktails.

I went to Mio Amore about a year ago on Christmas day. The ambience and the decor was amsolutely amazing. I loved the designs and the overall sophisticated atmosphere of the place. 

I ordered the buffet lunch. The food was quite alright and the pastas served in the live counters were very nice. I especially enjoyed the one in red sauce.

Starters weer served at our table and that is always good for a lazy person like me.  The dessert was also quite alright. However, it may be that I am not a medierranean connisseur as such but I found the food to be alright but not something to go gaga over. Thus, I did not repeat my visits to the place in the year that went by. But good for a one time try I suppose.

I wish the food and the service was at par with the food and decor ..... that is for me the perfect way to sum up this place ! With the kind of ambiance it creates it raises the bar for itself but then fails to live up to it. The food is average but it does not shine. In an effort to keep up with the competition they have added Indian food to their menu. I went in a fairly big group for a business lunch and from the feedback I got no one had negatives to say but neither was anyone thrilled with the meal. The majority ordered Shish Taouk or Shish Kebab and said it was nice. I ordered a Chicken Tetrazzini which was nice enough but I have had much better. For dessert the Crepes and Tiramisu failed to impress . Here is hoping for some improvements soon .

First time we went there, we opted for buffet lunch and it was really really impressive. Everything from the pasta to the dessert was just delicious. That is why we decided to visit there again. However it was disappointing the second time. We opted for the a la carte... they took 30 minutes to deliver the starter, 20 more minutes to deliver the main course and another LONG 40 minutes to deliver the dessert Tiramisu... when I inquired why the desert is taking so long the manager tried to be over smart and little rude too. However the tiramisu didn't taste good and then we decided to not to be there again...The decor is really good and the nice experience of the 1st visit impressed us to go there again....if you want to enjoy nice buffet then you can go...but for a la carte, I would definitely NOT recommend this place at all.

I dropped in at this place yesterday with my boyfriend for a late lunch. I had heard a lot about it and hence was looking forward to a good experience. And though a large part of the menu was very alien to me and  part of cuisine alien to my taste buds, i had a great time. 
We reached around 4 pm and the first thing we noticed was the absolutely empty restaurant. The decor is very very good. and they kept playing good old English numbers.Only thing that seemed weird was the color of the plates they were serving in. bright red, green, yellow, blue. The plates didn't seem to be in harmony with the white background of the place. 
Since we had never had Mediterranean Food before we studied the menu for a long time. After much thought we ordered a soup ( Spraciatella) ( i cant be sure of the names as they were long and foreign and the menu isn't present here), a prawn dish from the kebabs, and for main course the chef's recommendation Escalope of chicken and a Moroccan chicken dish with couscous rice. Food didn't take long to come. The soup was a clear soup with meet balls and noodles. It was good. The prawn kebab was basically 3 pieces of tiger prawns with a few vegetables served with 2 sauces. The prawn was itself quite tender and tasted good with the sauces but didn't agree with me too much. The Escalope of chicken was the treat of the day. 4 chicken breasts with stuffed potato and cheese  with veggies in a thick creamy yummy white sauce. We had two pieces of chicken each and it was so heavy and we were so full that by the end of the last bite we were regretting ordering another main course that was yet to come. The next dish wasn't that good. the chicken was tender and was served with veggies in a thin red sauce.
 By the time we finished all these we were so full that we couldn't order dessert even though we wanted to.
 It was an overall good experience. It was date and it went well.

Very nice decor. Excellent ambience, one of the best in Kolkata, staff are very friendly and tried to do their best to satisfy you. Although I like Pradip Rozario's legendary Kk'a fusion much more, but this place is also very good. At least in terms of ambience and decor and very honestly, the food is really good. May not be very authentic, but kinda Indian version of Mediterranean, except a few. But really enjoyable. Drink are very good too. I have been there many a times for a la carte, and today I've tried their weekend buffet for the first time and it is great. Fish starter as well as Greek style fish both were very very tasty. As a matter of fact the greek style fish was probably even better than Pradip's own KK's fusion, where I first tried it and just in love of it. Hummus and other spreads and salads and chicken were good too. Zucchini pancake was marvellous. A must try for all. They served one of the best strawberry mousse you can found in Kolkata. Also tried um ali as a la carte dessert, it was very good indeed.

I've visited the restaurant quite a few times and particularly liked the decor and ambience. it's actually surprising to see such a nice place going empty most of the time. I really liked the food, the stewards were polite too. the only drawback was that the dishes take too long to prepare, apart from that if you're not in a hurry and are looking for a leisurely meal, it's delicious enough for your visit.

No wonder mio amore remains so deserted even on weekends. 5 of us went there on a saturday for their lunch buffet. priced at 375 the progression seemed a bit weird. greek soup and chicken lebabese kebab followed by fish finger and mutton shami kebab and Moroccan chicken followed by mutton dakbangla??!!! I mean it was very apparent they don't even pay heed to what they will serve which is a big let down in such a speciality restaurant. coming to the food the greek soup or hortosoupa, as the called it, tasted like rasam. the chicken Lebanese kebab looked like reshmi kebab but tasted way worse. the tangine of fish looked chinese and reeked of garam masala. the moroccan chicken had no taste or flavour. the mutton was like chewing gum. they had a live counter serving shawarma and pasta (again don't know how they could fit pasta in the menu). the pasta was ok but the shawarma was the worst I ever had. coming from a live counter it was cold the pita bread was like tandoori roti and low on chicken and loaded with veggies. I would have accepted that my palate is not made for Mediterranean food but the shawarma was a give away. coming for a dry barren country like lebanon how do u expect so much lettuce and cucumber in their food. and living a stones throw away from go lebanese and royal lebanese I love my shawarma and was very disappointed with such a unsavoury shawarma. the desserts were as worse as the main course. the firni tasted like those amul shrikhand you get in any supermarket and the mousse smelled like cough syrup. one big issue I have with the place is they don't serve any drink. let alone a beer or a cocktail not even cold drink is included in the buffet. I would definitely say stay away be happy.

I visited the restaurant today and found it interesting. The menu is certainly different comprising of Moroccan, mediterranean cuisines and many more, however that can be confusing sometimes too. The ambience was nice and waiters were polite and trying to help.I started with a kind of chicken meatball soup, preciously named as "Stracciatella Soup"! I didn't like it. Then there was a confusion .. I think I pointed to "Shish Taouk" for the starter at the Menu book which is a kind of famous Chicken Kabab, but may be my bad, they brought "Istakoz Firinda" instead which is a kind of Prawn Kabab. The new item was also good enough and so no damage was done!In the main course I ordered for "Spiced Moroccan chicken" which was just awesome and quantity was exactly Ok for one person. I also had the mocktail "Italian Smooch" which was nice. So overall a good experience but costly enough .. all four items cost Rs. 1147/- including Tax.

The name practically draws you to the place. Located in Mani Square, the restaurant actually stuns you with its emptiness and makes one feel quite sad that such a nice place is running empty. I must say that I went on  a Thursday evening around 8 PM and we were the only people there. By 9 PM there were a few more people. Anyway the decor of the place is nice with the wall facing outwards completely made of glass with innumerable small concentric circles. The menu is elaborate with a appropriate mix of Turkish, Mediterranean and Italian cuisine. The place offers a buffet on weekends but I would suggest against it because half of the menu is Indian (Thumb Rule: Never go to a specialty restaurant like this and order Indian food, it wont be good. Its not supposed to be). The food is colorful and tastes quite nice. Wine is a must. Some of the dishes do look quite similar to tandoors but taste pleasantly different. The fish with tomato and mustard and Khobz (Moroccan bread) was the highlight of the evening. The service leaves a lot to be desired though. Every dish took about 20 minutes to half an hour to prepare even when we were the only customers. Also the waiters were a bit clueless about what they are serving. All in all it was a nice experience with good food and ambiance and not too brutal on the wallet as well. Must visit for people who haven't been there. Try out the Umm Ali as well, supposed to be a very nice desert, but skipped it because there was too much butter. Trying to go healthy even while eating out.

I had visited Mio amore with my friend about 5months back.We had their weekend buffet.It was quite nice.There were about 4-5 types of starters,main course items and desserts.The variety was decent and most importantly the quality of food was pretty good.I did not find any of the items exceptionally good but all the items were good and uniformly so,unlike some other places for buffet where some items are really good while others are quite bad.The price was also very reasonable,more so,compared to other places.
Other than the food,the ambience and the decor was something I really liked.Apart from being really well decorated the interior  was quite spacious,which I quite liked.
I guess I would have had a much better idea of the place if I had tried their a la carte option,which I would surely try when I get the scope.But overall I think this place is surely worth a visit.

I am very disappointed with mio amore.Decoration and ambience both are very good but at the end of the day what matters is the taste of their food.I went for the non veg buffet and some items like lamb chop,rice,fish were real disasters.So I would suggest dont go there for buffet when you have flame and grill,haka on the same floor.It doesn't even come close to its rivals.

A 5 on 5 for Mio Amore. You rarely get a Mediterranean restaurant serving North African cuisine (most places would give you Lebanese, Greek et al ). The buffet on weekends is very good in quality and decently priced, but the real charm is the a la carte option. I can go on mentioning a few of my favourites but one main course which stood out was the Chakchouka, a simple dish from vegetable and eggs made really really well. And the Umm Ali for dessert. I am not exaggerating when I say its the best dessert I have ever had in my life. In fact, I have gone back to Mio Amore on a couple of occasions just to have the Umm Ali.
Good staff, polite and respectful. Wonderful ambience. Good choice of drinks.
Highly recommended.

My brother introduced us to this eatery way back when it started and we fell in love with it. The ambiance, the food, the mocktails and even the pricing. The portion seems special mention -- most of the main course dishes can be shared by two people. We love the Italian Smooch (Drink), Harira (Soup), Hummus, Chicken Tandir. Apart from that we love the kebabs and there is a special fish item which is my favorite, but can't remember the name off hand.

Being a newbie in terms of Mediterranean food, I had huge expectations when I walked into the place. The decor seemed a little lack-lustre at first, but I dismissed the thought, expecting some great food. The Hummus and other Turkish delicacies were in fact nicely done, but the Mediterranean dishes were quite, to be honest, dismal. The meat was served rare as opposed to the medium rare that quite goes with the gravy served. I had to load up my plate with some simple Turkish Pancakes and some plain pasta in red sauce, just to fill my growling stomach. All in all, it was quite a let-down. I might think twice before I am about to try out such cuisines, the next time my taste-buds go exploring! The ScrewDrivers that I washed down my meal with was, on the other hand a refreshing add-on!

I've had a great experience here. I came here with my friend on her birthday and it was worth it.
The  Mediterranean and Continental dishes taste great, and the helpings are pretty generous. The decor of the place, in my opinion, is really good- and pretty well spaced out (yes, I don't like people jabbering on about their relatives getting married just behind my left ear).
A word of advice, however: I wouldn't suggest the buffet here. They need more variety there. The A la Carte is a much better choice. Also, sometimes the food might take time to be served, so I suppose you should be keeping your stories running to bide the time. 
As for the dish I loved - the Shish Touak......try it!

Ask me about this high rating, and I will tell you about the day I first visited this restaurant. It was a 14th February, and I was here with my fiances.

The ambiance was nice and soothing and I loved the music, a mixture of Lebanese and Egyptian folk tunes at times, that was being played in the restaurant. The food was also good. However, please make sure to ask the waiters about the dishes and its contents, as most of the items may seem to be written in an alien language for a newcomer. Stracciatella Soup is one item I would always refer with its tender meatballs that nearly dissolves in your mouth.

I prefer the a-la-carte here. And it is mostly because that they don't have much exotic dishes included in their buffet spreads. They can also work on the menu a little more in terms of exclusion of Italian dishes and inclusion other exquisite Mediterranean dishes.

I have mixed feeling for Mio Amore. There are several reasons why. Firstly, I love the ambiance and the decor. Slightly intimidating for a lot, but I like it. Secondly, I like the Shish Touak, which I sort of order virtually two out of three times I come here. 

Now for the bad part. 

1. Service - super super slow and the servers have no clue about what you are eating. They will stare at your face when you ask them what is what. I find that really irritating when I am paying premium prices for the food. 
2. Buffet is not good. I am sorry to say but even Mani Square HAKA offers much better choices any given day.
3. Most of the flavors in the menu, especially the fish dishes, which tastes icky. I am specifically looking here at one gem where I told the waiter about the fact that the fish smelled bad and was told... no no it does not. 

So no, until they really work on their menu and give this place better servers, I am not going back. Sorry.

Situated on the top floor of Mani Square Mall on E.M.Bypass, Mio Amorro is a brilliant celebration of a multi-cuisine food extravaganza spread over a plethora of middle-eastern countries.

The decor, the drinks, the food, the ambience, the small white sofas in the waiting section, the large screen projecting classic music of the early 70s and 80s, the variety in the menu - this is all that brings appreciation to this restaurant.

True that it is a tad bit expensive, but once the food is right there on your plate, you will know why that is the case. Brilliant and without any reservations - one of the finest in this great city of joy(ful food).

Do try the Salsa Spagnola as it is unparalleled. 

The only downer about the entire experience of dining at Mio Amorro was the amount of time they take to serve the food, which was close to a whole 40 minutes. Otherwise, the pasta, the lebanese food and the turkish delicacies are brilliant.

FINAL VERDICT - Mio Amorro is a burst of flavor and texture all celebrating multi cuisine food. So if you don't mind driving up till Mani Square and waiting for half an hour (you can always do with a few drinks), then Mio Amorro is perfect.

The nice and crisp ambiance will be the first thing to attract you inside. The food is quite good and the buffet they serve is quite sumptuous. Been there twice, one being a buffet and the other a-la-carte. Honestly, the buffet spread was much better than what we chose from the a-la-carte menu. 

Try out the various continental cuisines available and they would not disappoint you as such. However, our last experience was ruined by waiting. Had to wait for over 30 minutes after lunch to get the Tiramisu which turned out to be horrible. Overall, nice food, OK service with magnificent decor.

Arguably one of the best Mediterranean bistros in town. The cuisine covers Greece, Morocco and South of Italy.. The decor is aesthetically apt and comforting. The food is pretty much flawless and after my fourth visit I am still not short of mesmerized. This bistro serves one of the best lamb preparations I have tasted in this city. The best part is that they are priced quite reasonably. This a must for Italian and Mediterranean food lovers. For its price and quality.. this tops the list.

I went for the weekend buffet spread at Mio Amore. One of the best things about the place was the decor. The middle eastern music played helped create a nice ambience. 
The buffet had a mix of Indian and Mediterranean dishes. The soup served was a thick tomato soup with a dash of crushed coriander. It tasted decent. Next came the starters. The chicken kebab tasted like any other standard North Indian kebab but was too dry and over-grilled. I prefer my kebabs to be soft and juicy, thank you! The shrimp and mutton starters were total disappointments. The shrimp starters were nothing but balls of besan batters deep fried with few tiny shrimps in between. The mutton starter was deep fried spiced minced meat mixed with a binding material. It was too oily and soggy.
There was a live counter for pasta. It was serving pasta with white/red sauce with a choice of vegetables. Frankly, the pasta was one of the better tasting items on the spread.
The main course constituted of a veg pulao and three non veg options- a fish, a chicken and a mutton. The fish had a creamy white sauce with herbs. It tasted decent. The chicken wasn't boneless and had a sweet gravy. I did not like it. I think it was too sweet for my taste. The mutton was slightly undercooked, had a raw smell and the gravy was light and thin. 
Vegetarians had standard North Indian dishes with choice of naans/rotis.
The desert section had few options and none of them impressed.

The buffet along with taxes cost about 600 per person. 

At this price I think there are better options in Kolkata. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

I was there on a national holiday for lunch with my wife. The place was quite crowded but did not seem so. that was a plus. I hate places that seem like there is no place to eat. The decor was quite nice down to the mosaic floor which seems very mid eastern. The place obviously had a up-market feel about it. Nice. The menu arrived but disappointingly, just one. For a place of this appearance, I would have expected a menu per person, at least where there are just two people. Anyway, I asked for another and got it promptly. I ordered a chicken shawarma, a roasted moroccan fish and some lamb kebabs. The fish was decent, the shawarma was a a little too sour and could have been a little more flavoured (please note not more spicy, more flavoured). The lamb was also decent. One thing is that the portions are quite good. We had two mocktails (since it was a dry day) which were well prepared and presented. One thing I must mention here. I am not an expert on middle east/Mediterranean food. To me it seemed more like basic north Indian food. They do have a Italian portion in their menu which I did not try. The service was good. The waiters knew the dishes and explained them well as we ordered. They were always discretely present. Finally down to the cost. For the kind of food, the ambience and the class of restaurant, it wasn't too bad. Slightly on the higher side but tolerable. Worth a visit.

Kolkata as a city as always extended a warm welcome to new and interesting restaurants and cuisines. It was surprising to see this restaurant empty. 

To begin with, the ambiance, looked a bit like a Turkish HAMAAM but none the less and aesthetic one. Enrique was playing that made me want to run away from here. 

Next, I was set to order the starters. We had an assortment on mezze. The food was great, especially the Pita and the Hummus. But to my disappointment, my steward didn't know head or tail of what was happening. It took them almost 35 mins to serve us a Mezze assortment and then another 20 mins to serve our second starter, Slow Roasted Lamb... which also tasted brilliant. 
We had pretty much lost our appetite thanks to our wait. We had ordered for a Fish Tajine and rice with date and nuts. Both tasted brilliant, but the fish was not served in a tajine (and in spite of telling the waiter insisted that it shud be called TANGINE....tan-jain) .Well while ordering we had asked if the fish was boneless and were given a dirty look and told "yes its boneless... what else"

None the less good food.

Desserts that we ordered included Tiramisu and Um'm Ali (bread pudding). 

We were told that " you're lucky, we have 1 tiramisu" when we ate we had to spit it out, it was rancid. Tasted like STALE OIL. 
The UM'M ALI which is supposed to be their signature dessert was lachhedaar paratha in hot milk with MALAI in it and was not sweet enough.
By far the worst desserts I have had. And yes " we were lucky" because we were alive after eating a rancid Tiramisu.

The food was good but the service was super slow and highly obnoxious. Ill mannered staff, slower than death service and in spite of the fact that I loved the food I will never go to this place again.

Moroccan, Mediterranean, Greek, Turkish, you name it and you have it on the menu. You'd want to come back everytime to try out the varieties of cuisines offered in this place. The food is absolutely delicious and also very reasonably priced. The ambiance is just overwhelming. 
A very peaceful place and your taste buds will want more with every bite you take. If you have any difficulty in choosing your meal, the staff is very glad to help you out. A very satisfying destination indeed.

Oh what a delight to write about Mio Amore..Foods are as good as the name is..this was my third time visit to Mio Amore.And i would like to say it is a place where you get the value for money..
we started with Straccatila soup and a dish which had baked  fish ,(as i don't remember the name). The soup was just too good and the fish was heavenly. then In the main course i had moroccan spicy chicken dish(not the exact name) with couscous. other members had some other dishes anmong which only INVOLGINI(some lamb dish) was not at all value for money,though its a lamb dish it was full of pasta only....and in the dessert we had umm'ali,which was not very good..

otherwise the ambience and music was very nice...only one thing to complain,that is service is very slow,some of the dishes took more than half n hour..bt overall very very nice place to  be...

Lets begin with the table setting and the greeting. It was a table very well set and I knew I'm in for some big time pampering...did not know how Mediterranean food tastes and so I was all eager to go and see for myself. The wine list was amazing..that's a favorite, and then the starters...the texture of the chicken and the consistency till it left the tongue and started its journey down was something I will not forget soon.

I don't remember the names of the dishes, but it was like a competition going on between the starters and the main course. One tastier than the other. With every passing bite, I cleaned up my mouth with a sip of beer and was ready for the next bite. This was a good experience, away from all the oily, greasy food at Chinese and Indian restaurants. The music was good, fox trot was played at times and it was the ambiance, the taste, smell and feel of the food that had me going for almost an hour.

Food and ambiance is very good here with a standard Mediterranean menu. The menu also contains some good Italian dishes as well. However, more specialty Mediterranean dishes need to be included in the menu which would make it more of an experience rather than just a different kind of restaurant.
