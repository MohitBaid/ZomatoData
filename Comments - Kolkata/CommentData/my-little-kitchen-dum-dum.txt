We ordered simple dish chicken ball soup and crispy baby corn. The soup was awesome tasty, baby corn was also good and service is really fantastic. Very quick service and response, ambience is very romantic.

Had come here long time ago for a family dinner as it was on our way home and we desperately needed a change from home food. 

We had simple Indian food.

Dal Makhni
Palak Paneer
Butter Naan

I remember the Palak Paneer tasted nice. The dal was weird. The naan was good but they could be softer.
Never went there after that. And even I did I don't remember because they fail to impress.
Had Chilli Chicken a couple of times (take away). It was nice. Nothing extraordinary; rather local street shops cook better chilli chicken than them.

I have been here a couple of times and opted for a take out most of the times.
The interior is well decorated . The service and the ambience is pretty good. Coming to the food it was pretty good. I have tried the chicken drumsticks, chilli chicken and the chicken noodles . These dishes were decent.
To sum up the place offers decent chinese food at a pocket friendly price.

This little kitchen at DumDum offers a lot of variety in chinese and small bites! Though I did not have much anticipation about the place, for a quick Saturday evening munching I ordered their Chicken noodle soup and Pepper Chicken to be delivered. While the soup was average lacking salt a bit was a mere okay dish, their pepper chicken really surprised me. Tossed in Thai pepper black sauce the dish was supremely tasty. Good value for money as the prices re quite cheap and they are pretty generous with the amount.

Their drumsticks are quite good ,  their rice is okay but a bit oily and their chilli chicken has the Indian touch , nothing great but okay for a hungry tummy. This place is generally a little empty and the service a little slow.

This is very close to my place. Good ambiance. Nicely done interior. But serves average food. Price is a bit on the higher side, probably, for the interior. And, one more thing, we had to wait for almost an hour after placing the order though most of the tables were empty. So be mentally prepared for that.

Well , I went there a few days back exasperated at the lack of choices for any new place to dine at in our neighborhood. Well the place seemed quite empty though our timing of 4 30 pm wasn't exactly rush hour timing. The ambiance was okay. Quite generic in fact with a loud TV playing all those Bollywood songs. Now onto the food . We had ordered chicken drumsticks and mixed fried rice and chilli chicken. I wanted to try their volcano, but the server couldn't really explain what kind of dish it was. Now onto the dishes, the chicken drumsticks is one of the better ones in dum dum for sure. The mixed fried rice though full of veggies and chicken and egg and prawn could do with better quality rice and more penetration of spices. The chilli chicken was the same average Joe you get everywhere but a little lighter for my taste. Over all I might drop in for the drumsticks from time to time and might try the volcano next time. And to mention the service it was a little slow but the cushiony seats add up to the comfort and you might not mind waiting unless you are in a hurry.

After a long gap visited on Nabobarsho day due to heavy rush at other places this was the only place left. Felt that food quality has improved but the service quality was still horrible. There was a old man ( there were 2 old waiters, I am talking about the person with black Frame spects and mustache. The other person was very kind polite and nice) basically for whom the whole thing was going on vain. That person thought he was the only person who knew everything. I don't know the MLK team will read this or not they must remove that guy. He doesn't know how to talk to a customer, doesn't have any manner, only the thing he has is god damn attitude, which brings only problems and dissatisfaction. I am feeling very sorry to say this about an elderly person but its very true. Till now most weird restaurant we have ever visited. Some time it feels like we are inside any kindergarten school as that oldy does what ever he wants not whatever customer needs. üòî Hope on future any situation will not come that again we have to visit this worthless place.

Over the years the quality of food in this place has been deteriorating like anything. I remember, just about 5-6years ago, it was so popular that you would have to wait ages in a queue to get a place, and now almost always it stays empty. It's expertise lies primarily in chinese cuisine but now even that has become abysmal! Still, worth mentioning would be their dry chilli chicken.
Overall, wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone. Doesn't scream anything out loud!

Chalked out a sudden plan to visit this place with my wife couple of days back. That was for the first time and definitely is for the last time. In terms of ambiance, food quality, appearance and co-ordination of the waiter, this place falls in third class category. I am sorry to say but it's true. They took almost 45 mins to serve a common dish of two plates chicken fried rice and a plat of Veg-Manchurian. It would have been accepted, if the food quality was up to the mark. But in reality it was nothing but a shit. So totally waste of time.

Not an "up to the mark" restaurant...the space is very less, the leg space for sitting is like indigo flights...u somehow adjust that....I have visited this restaurant quite a few times with the expectation like, "last time it was bad..this time it would be definitely better" but they never stood up to the expectation level. The quality and quantity is not good. They have tried to create a light and shade effect inside which eventually creates a bad "shade" only. They say they provide wifi free which eventually not accessible. The most hilarious experience after which I have completely stopped being there - I had ordered for a fresh lime soda(sweet) and what I got was a glass full of water with some sugar dust floating and dripping inside. When asked, they said, "‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶´‡ßá‡¶∞‡¶∏‡ßç ‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶Æ ‡¶∏‡ßã‡¶°‡¶æ ‡¶è‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶Æ ‡¶á ‡¶π‡ßü"....so eventually by this statement you can easily figure out the courtesy of the stuffs as well.

I had a very bad experience of first time visit there. Ambience is okay, got enough lights. We ordered 3 plates of chicken drumstick, 5plates of pan fried chicken, 10 plates of chicken biriyani. Drumstick and pan fried chicken is good enough as starter, but biriyani was too bad. It was absolutely tasteless as there is neither salt nor other ingredients. Worst biriyani I ever had in Kolkata. Moreover the entrance door has big banner saying the premise is wifi covered. But there was no trace of single network.

It's among the very few restaurants on Dumdum road. Food quality is above avg. And the ambience is good. Amount they provide must suffice a normal hunger. They are not serving tandoor dishes presently, though they are on the menu. Biriyani tastes good. Few Chinese dishes are awesome. Price could have been lowered little bit. The waiters are well behaved. The wash room is hell (they provide finger bowls anyway).

They've got free Wi-Fi in the restaurant.

They've got home delivery too. I have ordered quite a few times. Mostly delivered within half an hour.

But the food didn't meet our expectations and it was a bit pricey...
The chicken kebab was OK...the fish kebab they recommended was not at all delicious but pricey...they served  cold biriani ..and after several requests they took the plates to warm it...chicken butter masala was good...
I won't recommend this place to someone

Comfortable place and the ambience is soothing. Though the food they serve is always fresh and recently cooked. Though it is not refered to visit if you are not having immediate requirement of food. They have free Wifi for the guests, as the door said; but didnot used it.

Not a good experience but not a bad one either. Staff were well mannered and polite. Decoration was not exceptional but the ambience was comfortable. My friend ordered Murg Handi and lacha paratha. I ordered mixed noodles (gravy). The murg handi was upto the mark but the same cannot be said for the noodles. Gravy noodles is one of my favourite dish but I was highly disappointed. It turned out to be more of a soupy noodles. However I will definitely go back whenever possible to try their other dishes.

the palce is located near hanuman mandir(10mins from dum dum station).. when u enter the restaurant u will really like the way it is decorated..good lighting and the atmosphere is well not that bad..but once u order the food u get to realise the flaws..food is OVERPRICED both for the quality and quantity..i had ordered chef's special prawn and murgh lajawab..to start with the prawns..well i could not realise what was so special about them..it was simply chilli prawn with a new name..and then comes the murgh lajawab..unlike the name it did not taste that good..so the place looks good but the main purpose of a restaurant ie. serving tasty food that is not available here..

p.s.: i got free WiFi here and while eating i downloaded a few games and apps.. ;)

Dis place with a gud location and well-lighted interiors will surely make u feel comfortable but d moment u try to take a table to d instance u eat ur food will leave u flabbergasted. U will huff and puff to access d chairs as der's ceratinly not enuf place between d chairs and d table.¬†
Another important(read: most important) is dat u will not have to wonder what to order not because dey will suggest(silly !), but coz almost 60% of d menu wont b available. Make dat d entire indian cuisine. So Tandoori and Biriyani lovers, drop d idea of visiting here at d moment. Now for d chinese counterparts, der's a few dishes likeable over here including d crispy chilli babycorn, schezwan chicken, chicken lollypop etc. One wud often find it difficult to differentiate between chicken manchurian, chicken chilli and chicken schezwan in both taste and outlook. A well-dressed manager taking orders instead of d waiters will leave u suspicious. D waiters were only der to serve water and only God knew what language dey understood. Anyways no need to waste ur time here neither eating nor reviewing. Strictly stay away from dis

Its catchy name didnt live up to the expectations. The food is nt so good & the service is poor & unattentive sumtimes. A lot of inprovement would be needed for then to draw in the customers in future... Visit at ur own risk.. >_<

The '2' I gave is just for the ambience they have. Else, this place doesn't even deserve a '1'. I really wonder how they are still in business. "My Little Kitchen" is located just opposite to Hanuman Mandir. I went there with my family for a Sunday afternoon lunch, it being really close to my place, and it was such a let down. They're out of chefs almost all the time, 'cause of which it is very unlikely for you to get what you want to eat. MLK if you're reading this, please move out. Let some proper restaurant take your place.

Another place near my locality (actually the second nearest place), I have visited this place couple of times, each time with hope and expectation and off-course hunger! But every time, there appeared some issues (major) which left me disappointed. 

Ambiance:
Nice, clean, good interiors and flooring. There are issues though. The seat edges are too close to the table legs so when you seat you have to apply several bending positions for your legs to get in.. that might get tedious. There is no music the background, but yes they have a plasma television running. It's good if you like the channel.

Food:
Average..just that. I don't remember any special menu except the fish items, among the dishes, that stand out. Also, there is hardly any item available from the menu. We had to deliberately ask at last "Apnader ekhane ekhon ki paowa jabe seta bolun (Tell me what is available now at your place)"! That's shameful.

Hospitality:
Very Dull! There is hardly any welcome, any smiling face. Just gloomy guys moving around. Very disappointing at times. To my relief, at the end of the meal, there was atleast someone to ask " Bhalo legechhe khabar Sir? Aar ki kichhu order deben?"(Did the food taste good? Do you want to order anything else?).

Overall, can be a destination to eat.. but just for once, only if you have no other options to eat somewhere else. :( 
I wish this place goes up the way it names itself.

MLK has not been such a sweet experience as the name suggests :P

**Location -> It is located beside the CCD at the DumDum Road opposite of DumDum Hanuman Mandir :)
Going towards Nagerbazar from DumDum Metro Stn, it will come to your left.

**Brief -> I went there with my family in search of some quick food to satisfy my hunger. But I was not at all satisfied.

**Ambience -> They provide a free wifi which is super slow :P The ambience was not so bad and it was a spacious place as well !! 

**Food and service -> While we decided to order, everytime we tried to order an item,the server would say they dont have it as their Chef is absent. I never like it when a restaurant says they dont have foods in the menu !! Finally we ordered Biriyani,Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken!! Just imagine having Biriyani with chilly chicken :(
The food came around 40 minutes later we had placed our order !! Cant believe it!! No wonder so poor reviews :(
Anyways the food was nothing special.The biriyani was very normal and the other chinese items were also not worth mentioning. The only thing I liked was probably their cold drinks !!

**Purse Check -> Pricing was still alright, though not worth the quality of service and food !!

**Overall -> The management should take a careful note on these things and hope MLK rocks back again. Best Wishes :)

Not Recommended for now, sorry !

Located near hanuman mandir at dumdum..the name plate of this restaurant is an eye catcher...it is well decorated and have a nice ambience ...i visited the place with my family for dinner but was highly disappoiinted..

we ordered for mutton biriyani,mixed fried rice,hakka chicken noodles ,chilli chicken and chilli fish as a side dish...and trust me when they came for taking order half of the dishes in the menu could not be served coz they dont have a cook...can u imagine this? though we were lucky that we get these and could feed our hungry tummy...we were very hungry and instead of going to another restaurant we chose this one and it has juz let us down..and the food was not that great ,the biriyani appeared to look like fried rice...and the rice was a bit on the saltier side..

the management people are disorganised..i didnt like their attitude ,and i would not be going there again coz they have highly disappointed me...

I was quite surprised. I had thought that it would be a normal restaurant but it turned out to be a good experience. We had gone by car. They had guided us quite well. The first thing I noticed upon entering is the interior. It was like contemporary yet having a vague classic vintage touch though lacking a specific theme. We had gone during late afternoon and it was raining that time. Found only one customer. The leg space is very less. The food was quite impressive . We had taken a combo. Club Solitaire's one. The food was quite delicious. One thing that i liked that there was any visible oil floating over the curry dishes.The service was good. One thing was that the waiter was constantly staring at me. Difficult to eat like that. The TV was tuned to a music channel, so no comments on that. One thing- they give free WiFi but it is SUPER slow. Overall a good experience.Can give it a try

Had my sore fate of having to visit this restaurant twice. Located at the heart of Dum Dum Road this eatery proposes to be an eye catcher if you happen to pass by but once you choose to enter and have a grub you are sure to end up with an headache. The waiters do need to brush up on their mannerisms and service. Coming to the quality of the food, you will be left utterly disappointed with a platter almost half-eaten by you as well as your fellows. The food is pathetic. The TV is always tuned into a boring news channel. For me this restaurant is a big "no-no!!!".
