I am generally not a type of person who writes reviews but prefer sticking to the easy way of recording my rating at best (if at all I am satisfied).
But not writing a review after giving 5 star rating to Homebaker's Treat would have been injustice not only to the Foodie within me but also the creator of these lovely mouthwatering cookies.  
The smell of fresh bakes forced me to break my self control and indulge in appeasement of my tongue.
The items at this place calls for a tag line "I bet you can never stop at one".
Try it to believe. 
You will yearn for more.

"A Homebaker's Treat" ! Take a bow! I am smitten!
No doubt on the fact that this is one of the best bakeries ( off course home bakers) I've heard of in Kolkata ... as of now...
"A Homebaker's Treat" ! never fails to express. Have tried their Fruitscake, cupcakes, cookies, caramel casterds and brownies mostly, and needless to say, each and experience by far has been amazing.
Christmas & New year are incomplete without having a cake from this place.& We all agree on one thing...it's not easy to walk away from these incredible cakes!

Tried the brownies and quiche. Brownies are awesome with full of wall nuts.

It's an experience in itself....... Each baking is done with lots of expertise n fineness. At the same time keeping the authenticity of  every recipe. It's really a treat which one cannot afford to miss!!!

From the kitchens of a passionate home baker. The products exude as much quality as they do the passion of the person behind them. The herbed cheese cookies are something unique that I hven't tasted anywhere before. And the creamy cheesy quiches are simply yummy and filling too!! So don't miss out....ðŸ˜Š
