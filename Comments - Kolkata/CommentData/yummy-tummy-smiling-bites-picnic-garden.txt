Such a brilliant find, this place! Ordered in from here yesterday and was in for a pleasant surprise! The service is amazing. The staff are extremely polite. The delivery timing, the packaging and the care was exemplary.
Now the most important bit; the food! Ordered fried chicken strips, chicken wrap and a chicken pasta in Alfredo sauce. 
The fried chicken would give KFC a run for their money on any given day! Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, this juicy piece of meat is a must have!
The chicken wraps, omg. There was no hint of oil, the chicken inside was scrumptious, it was loaded with crunchy, fresh vegetables and oozing with sauces. A perfect solution to hunger pangs.
The pasta was good too. I wish it had been slightly more cheesy but that's just my opinion. It was loaded with chicken and Italian herbs, and sprinkled with black olives and chilli flakes. 

All in all, a wonderful experience and I hope they keep up the amazing work!
