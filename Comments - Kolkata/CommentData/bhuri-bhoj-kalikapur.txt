We went there for a luncheon on 01.01.2018. It was hosted by my husband's boss and we were around 13 pax.

Menu was pre decided by our hosts and it was a gala spread. To start with we had jal jeera which was ok, nothing great. 

Next on the table were plain rice, moong dal, jhoori alu bhaaj, mochar ghonto, doi pona, basanti pulao, mutton kasha and mango chutney.

Quality : quality of each food was way above the price paid for it. U will not be given any chance for complains. the food was made home style.  the fish and mutton were very fresh...no odd smell.each preparation was good.

Quantity : Quantity served was like 2 plates for 3 pax. but u have got a really big appetite then i plate per pax will suffice.

Environment. : Its a hidden gem. A small place which can accommodate around 30-34 people. its calm, much away from the hustle and bustle of the city (not geographically, u can easily locate it on google map incase u r not able to locate the place)

Service : very prompt, and courteous.

Note : There was hardly any crowd, considering the day to be new year....this might be because its a much less hyped place... but i would surely recommend this place if u r craving for a home style bangali food...but away from home.

On the occasions of Bhai Phonta, we decided to have a Bengali lunch and was looking for a Bengali restaurant nearby. We choose Bhuri Bhoj and was really satisfied.
We ordered Macher matha diye mung dal, sukto, pabda mach er jhal, mutton kasa, jhuri alu bhaja. The items were not so spicy. We liked all of the items, specially pabda mach preparation.
Service and quantity was also nice. There was four medium size mutton pieces and two pabda mach in each plate. Overall it was a nice experience and prive was also not very high too.

The closest place from my house.  Order quite a number of times in a week.  Not a glam place but really good food.  Very clean,  beautifully spiced and authentic.  

Not too pricey but worth the money.  
Especially the  lentil preparation is my favorite.

This restaurant is situated at a place which is really difficult to find. The restaurant is quite small with few seats.¬†

We took vegetarian and non vegetarian thali; other than rice and dal vegetarian thali had 2 sabjis including Dhokar Dalna , aloo bhaja chutney, papad and non veg thali had ¬†1 sabji, aloo bhaja, chutney papad, fish and chicken.

The quantity was quite good, service was fast and the staffs were nice. The food tasted great as if it's a home made; less spicy but good taste.

Overall I would say the restaurant had good ambience and the food taste great but the only one drawback is it's location.

Tiny place in a nook with good tasteful and light on pocket food. When we reached here it was empty and we thought it must be a wrong decision to sit down for lunch here, but man! We were wrong the food tasted good and realised that it's more of an order joint than a restaurant to sit and eat. Decent place for food lovers in Kalikapur.

I have had lunch quite a few times at Bhuri Bhoj. This time we got the food delivered at home. Though they have limited the variety in the torkari section they provide good options in the mains. The food was very delicious. The chingri bhapa and the dhokar dalna was the best of the lot. Also worth mentioning were the chitol machher muitha and pabdar jhal. The khejur amsotto chatni was a bit too sweet though.

One day at lunch I placed an online order one Spacial Thali and one Soeshe illish from here.... Thali comes with Streamed Rice, Moong Dal, Jhuri Jhuri Aloo Vaja, Sukto, Katla Kaliya, 2 piece Chicken Kosha, Chatni, Papad....Thali tasted awesome.... But Sorshe illish disappointed me , taste not good.... Serving time was good.... Delivery boy was well behaved.... Cost was ok...

A place that serves awesome "Bangali khabar", visited it on a person's recommendation. And wasn't disappointed.
We'd ordered basanti polao, gobindobhog bhat (the staple rice favored by Bongs), shukto, musur dal, jhuri aloo bhaja, chhanar dalna, muri ghonto, bhetki fry, tangra macher jhol, mangsher jhol aloo diye, khejur amsatya-r chutney, and rabri
Food was super tasty and I supped to my heart's content on the other items, each being highly delectable. 
For those looking for a hearty meal of mouth-watering Bengali dishes at pocket-friendly prices, if they want to skip a day of home-cooked Bong food, then do visit Bhuri Bhoj for a scrummy "bhuribhoj"!

This is one word which comes to my mind synonymous this place. Living upto to its name in the best manner possible. 
Bhuri Bhoj is nearby to my place, and hence home delivery from this place is a regular thing for me. I have eaten in this place probably for more than 20 times now, and I cannot say that I have been dissapointed a single.
It has now become a practice to ordre-
1. Gobindo Bhog 
2. Moong Dal 
3. Jhuri Aloo Bhaja 
4. Dhoka
5. Chanar dalna

My personal favourite is the Moong dal and Chanar dalna. The Moong dal served is one of the best dals I've ever had. Flavored and cooked in the most beautiful way, the dal has a tinge of sweetness which is heavenly and this accompanied with Jhuri Aloo Bhaja brings a divine combination. 
The Chanar dalna a bengali favorite is yet another favorite dish of mine. Soft and mellow as the Chana is the Chanar dalna is rich in taste and brings out a confetti of a dish. It's light it's tasty it's sweet it's spicy it's an absolute yum!

Bhuri Bhoj is one of the best places in kolkata for authentic Bengali food. Do visit.

Though i don't rely on their service and most of the time send my person to get the food...

What great authentic bengali food. As it was my first visit to Kolkata, it delivered on my craving for something simple yet delicious. Had fish kali, chicken, pula and luchis. Recommended to anyone looking for simplicity, authenticity and delicious food. The place however was not like a restaurant. It was a flat converted to an eating joint. So don't expect anything fancy there. However, when the food is good, these are but trivial nitpickings.

We(4 of us) found out about this place while we were searching for a place to satisfy our hunger..this place is located in kalikapur , a few steps away from Spencer's ..located in an alley adjacent to a book stall it is difficult to locate however when you enter into the alley you can see sign board of this restaurant..
We entered at around 2p.m...was empty....the staffs provided us with plain water as well as a sarbat which was good as it is not provided in many restaurants..we ordered basmati rice , moong dal , beguni, chitol maacher muitha,  chicken do piyaja, bhuri bhoj special chicken..
Chitol macher muithya was not good as there was no fish in it....special chicken was good but not very good as the mixture of capsicum was not successful..rest of the items were good..this joint is mainly for home delivery..but our experience was good overall..

While shifting to my new residence at kalikapur, I received a suggestion from a reliable friend to try out the place.Ever since I have started loving their food.The quantity and quality are both something to tout about.¬†

So far I consider the prawns Malay curry to be their best. At close second is their doi chingri.Others worth trying out are echor chingri, murgir aloo dewa jhol. Am yet to try their mutton.¬†The oil is not dangerously afloat on food. The packaging regular and convenient. The price very reasonable. A great place to have takeaways or get home delivered.

i can't restrain myself as i recount this amusing anecdote.i had been ordering home-food regularly from their place, sometimes even 2-3 days in a row. so i receive a phone call one of those days and the manager preemptively informs that the restaurant would remain shut for a few days before resuming its operation. on inquiring why am being informed about this a get a really heart-warming response - so that am not inconvenienced. the bigger eateries should learn to value their customers like these folks!

In Kolkata for a day and HAD to have good Bengali food. This place has quite a few things that often point to great food: tough to find, good reviews on zomato, good word on the street, very basic and unassuming, low on ambience. The food didn't disappoint, but I expected more. Recommend this place if you're in the neighborhood and want nice, fuss-free Bengali food.

I have been there long time ago.... but visited again today for lunch... happy to see all the tables full.... I ordered basmati rice, marcher mathe diye moog dal, beguni, aloo fulkopir dalna, chingri malaicurry, bhuri bhoj special chicken and anaresser chutney.... all the dishes are very good although a bit oily, but tasty.... only I find the macher mathe was not fresh as it was smelling and chutney was very sweet.... there preparation was improved a huge from what I had last time... every one can give it a try.... service was bit slow.... staffs are not trained but very friendly... and above all pocket pinch was very low... I had all these within INR 666... also they serves complementary amm panna sarbort... its good...

This is a small place which serves bengali cuisine....the food quality is good and the staffs are friendly...the con of this place is that it is located in the interiors and might be a bit difficult to find...also the place is small...about 8-10 tables...this doesn't make an issue because the footfall is less...but if you want good bengali food around this place i would recommend this place...

A decent place serving bengali food with excellent services. My initial impression of this place was that of a renovated rice/dal hotel but it is something way above that. Their ambiance is better than kasturi and radhuni in new market. To start with the location of the restaurant is it's biggest disadvantage, it's located at preety interior and that explains their lower footfall. When we visited it at 1:30 in the afternoon , it was completely deserted and after five minutes or so there was just one more party that came in and saw another man giving orders for parcel when we left. However they try to overcome this disadvantage through their excellent home delivery services. So if you don't feel like cooking for the day, just punch in their number and you won't be disappointed. Their staffs were really nice and as it so happened we had found hairs in one of our order and they changed and replaced it with fresh order with just a polite request. We had ordered mohan moong dal , jhoori aloo bhaja, beguni, mochar ghonto. They really cooked this items well and had us our fingers licking for the taste. We further ordered doi pona and bhetki macher paturi, which I must say were of below average quality.  The preparation seemed like plain vanilla with no distinct tatse or speciallity that you get in most of the bengali restaurants like Kasturi, Radhuni and 16 anna bangali. They lack the midas touch in their main courses and that's a great disappointment considering the price they charge. So overall this place is perfect for home delivery if you are staying nearby but the food won't have any speciality flavour just plain vanilla bengali food which is decently cooked and nicely served

Nice food quality. I felt its a bit overpriced. The  ambiance of the restaurant is not that good. Pretty small and nothing special. Though I loved their mutton kasha and khejurer chutney. The servicing is prompt and impressive. If you are bored with the taste of bahjahari manna then this might be the place you want to visit.

I have dropped in to this joint a couple of times while visiting my ansestral properties in barrackpore. It is located nearby the corporation office of the locality. The restaurant is situated on the 1st floor. The decor was simple and neat, nothing fancy or didn't have any cozy feel. They serve authentic bengali cuisine. As i was new to the joint i asked for the assistance of the management to suggest their specialities and we ordered mutton kasha, rice, daal, etc(typical bengali type lunch); the quality of the food was edible but i cannot say it was enjoyable and worth relishing. Being a bengali myself i am aware about how the dishes of bengali cuisine is supposed to taste so i figured out their preparations were unnecessarily too spicy and oily and it lacked the basic texture and the flavor of blended spices which were required. My mother ordered fish which was of the similar state as well. So according to my experience this joint deliver edible food but its better not to set your bar of expectations too high. Its a place where you can crash in during those rare days when you are too hungry and missing home cooked bengali food.

Perhaps it was the Puja rush... very very oily food delivered cold. Yes, you get a variety of fish and vegetable preparations and it is not heavy on the pocket. Recommended for the quick average Bengali meal when the cook doesn't turn up. Nothing exceptional, nothing memorable.

I am not a Bengali..bt I love Bengali food, and this is a great place for Bengali food lovers, with very low prices. The ambience here is not something you can appreciate, but if u are hungry, you don't need to think twice before coming here.
The service is prompt, and I liked it.

This rating of 4.5 is only and only for the food that is offered by them.
Frankly speaking have never been to their restaurant, we have only got home delivery, therefore I have absolutely no idea about the ambience, service, etc
These guys give you one of the best authentic bengali cusine and I tell you it's just finger licking good.. so far everything we have ordered have turned out to be above average stuff... The best of the lot that we have to have in all our orders are Macher matha diye dal, jhuro aalu bhaja,  mochar dalna. 
Wonderful dil mangey more kind of food, we have almost become it's regular customer, and almost eat twice a week from these guys, also is never a burden on ur pockets.

This is a neighborhood small restaurant with around 30 seating capacity with no great ambience. However, the service is prompt and taste is good. If you are looking for good bengali food at a low cost, this is the place. My wife and I had basmati rice, musoor dal, topshe fry..2 pc, chicken curry, chutney, mishti doi. Can you guess the bill? It was just Rs 372 with taxes. I feel this is great value for money. I will recommend this place for bengali food lovers.
