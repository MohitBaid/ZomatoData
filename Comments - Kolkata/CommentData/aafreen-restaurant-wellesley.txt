Lovely food that would relish all your cravings at a very good price. Service was not that good. I mean just one man taking all orders and v litrally had to wait for about 20 minutes for our food to arrive But at the end the food made the day and was worth waiting for without making a big hole on my pocket.

Visted here on my birthday with friends. We ordered biriyani and chicken tengri kebab. Biriyani was not good at all. It's some kind of mixed up potato meat and rice. Tengri kebab was good. It was a bad experience.

Its around 12:30 to 1 i ordered American chopsuey and crispy chill chicken dry. Food was pathetic to taste American chopsuey with lots of vegetables is only tested like a tomato sauce very sweet vegetables cutting is like chef is not in mood to cook food. And the hero of spoiled lunch is chicken it smells like a goat first they served me 8pc n saying small size hai isliye zyada quantity de diya. No real thing is that its a yesterdays leftover chiken bill comes around 320 for thode two dish. Very disappointing

Guys this place serves the best haleem in town. Ramazan is a month you get to oogle on haleem and trust me I have tried most of the places from nakhoda masjid to Wellesley and this year Aafreen is rocking it. This review is purely based on on their haleem preparation, NOT TO BE COMPARED with their other dishes. You see for me arsalan's is too heavy and aminia's haleem tries to do too much with the spices. This review is a shoutout to those like me who loves to enjoy the ramzan delicacies. The additional benefit is that the mutton pieces they put in their haleem are really juicy and doesn't have much fat which you don't get in other places. Trust me guys, just 3 more days to go for ramzan. So go and try it. You will thank me later.im having it for the last 4 days straight and wish I came across it earlier.

On nobomi this year when kolkata was wet with rain I had no option but to enter this resturant. I went their with a cousin of mine. We were welcomed by their waiter who was very courteous. They gave us a sit and was very friendly in his approach. We ordered chicken tikka kabab and chicken reshmi kabab and mutton biriyani . The ambience was quite nice and so was the food
 
Chicken tikka kabab : it was soft and succulent. The meat was soft and well cooked and the taste was just perfect
Chicken reshmi kabab : it was white and was a bit less spicy. Same size as the tikka kababs the meat was softer and tastier
Biriyani : the biriyani was a heart winner. The quantity as well as the quality was superb. We had decided to go fr mutton special biriyani but the waiter had wisely recommended us to go fr normal biriyani. We couldn't finish one plate each even though we were very hungry

Overall it was a great experience

While many a soul are aware of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan singing the famous song named Afreen which translates into "beautiful", but, not many are aware of the restaurant which might delight customers with their in house treatment but has pathetic home delivery service. Aafreen is the one which masters in that.

I have had ordered a plate of Mutton Dum Biryani via Zomato getting applicable discount as promised. However, the order when got delivered seemed to be a disaster which no words can express.

Well, I got the order delivered around 2 pm and pounced on it as soon as I placed my hands on it. However, the preparation was dead cold, despite the time of order being appropriate for biryani eaters. Being slightly disappointed, I went inside to look for the delicacies which might cheer me up.

On fiddling with the rice, I put a bit in my mouth and then came the real disappointment as the biryani seemed stale. Even the mutton piece did not have any bit of aura to be liked. This utter blunder made me furious on so many levels that I could not complete the food. It seemed that they delivered me a day old stale food. This kind of negligence was not at all expected from an restaurant of this name!

A visit not at all recommended.

Ordered food from this place through zomato. I should really appreciate the delivery service of this restaurant, they delivered the food within less than 40 minutes. The packaging was decent and the delivery staff was also courteous. We ordered Chicken Dum Briyani, Chicken Reshmi kabab, Chicken Tikka Kabab, Children Tikka Butter Masala, Gajar ka Halwa n Shahi Tukra. Guys the Dum Briyani was really very good as per the taste and also the quantity was decent. The kababs were soft and utterly delicious. Loved the dessert section also and would surely give thumbs up to the food quality of this place . Have not actually been there so cannot comment on the decor and service etiquettes.. But if you want to try out authentic moghlai dishes , do check out the place as they won't disappointe you. üòä

Nice eating joint with soothing interiors. Food is quite satisfactory. However, the quantity served it on the lower side. Four Wheeler parking at times is an issue otherwise everything else is quite satisfactory....
Chinese was simply mediocre...

Came for a friend's birthday party long back from college. Had the Chicken Biryani and Mutton Rogan Josh. Both of them were pretty good. Nice ambience, service can be improved. Good place to give birthday treats when running on a small budget.

I haven't visited the place yet.. But I have orderd food for delivery .. The size of the roomali roti is quite big. The dal makhani is good. Dal had perfect blend of spices in it ... the vegetable biryani was delicious . One problem with the food was excess of oil in it. Work on that

Chicken Achari Kabab was a bit salty otherwise it tasted good. The green chutney it served with the kabab was worth a mention.
Chicken bharta was yum but the quantity was a bit less.
But this restuarent is Good for Kababs..
Am recommending. :)

The place is quite large and spacious. Food is average though. Only if the location was a bit better, the place would be a nice spot for Biryani in the city.

A new entrant to the mughlai restaurants...was recommended by a friend and I have to admit it truly lived upto it....nicely done up place in context to the other similar type restaurants in kolkata...fully recommend this place..

We ordered online delivery from Aafreen, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road near Wellesley today for 2 Mutton dum biriyani , 1 chicken dum biriyani and one plate drums of heaven. Size of mutton in mutton biriyani is too small, test is not up to the mark. Cost of mutton biriyani is 175/- but in online price is 140/- -Astonishing. They charged 175/-.
Test of drums of heaven is not also good.

Its a bad restaurant with horrible food. Besides other food, the Mutton Rezala tastes so bad that u'll want your money back then and there. 
No one should waste their money here.

I loved all the dishes. First of all the service and order was quick enough. One must try the   Aafreen special kabab it's delicious. Apart from that food is excellent with very reasonable price. Finally the d√©cor is fine.

It's a late review. We went for lunch. It is located at Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road near Wellesley. Ambience is good, neat and clean. The place reminds me of Arsalan. We had mutton biriyani and  chicken tangri butter masala. Biryani was light, not much rich. Chicken tangri butter masala was really good. Also had Shahi Tukra, personally I didn't like it. Overall food was good.

Visited this restaurant on my friend's birthday. Located on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road just beside Wellesley hotel.We tried Chicken Tangri kebab, Butter nan,a side dish of chicken and Biryani. They served the order after 35 mins,and we had to wait a long.Tangri kabab was delicious in taste and mouthwatering. Biryani was not so good in taste,it's satisfactory but not excellent. Ambience is little crowdy.Staffs are clueless, they have to be more responsibile.Overall as it is newly opened they are little unorganised and need time to be in track.

It is a relatively new outlet at an area which is already crowded with a number of restaurants. The USP that it carries is the presentation and feel of the entire restaurant and the ambiance. No wonder it has generated such a good amount of popularity among the locals. The food is good, in fact, the Naan-Curry dishes is better than most of the esteemed Mughlai restaurants around. Particularly, the Chicken Tikka Butter Masala if you are looking to have a curry based dish to go along with a roti or naan. If you wish to try out Chinese then the Chilli Garlic Noodle of any preference is a good option as well. The Biryani is okayish. However, you should try the Mutton Rezala here. It is promising.

The only complaint I harbor is the service at the spot which is not only slack but highly disorganized whether the restaurant is crowded or not.

Tried their Khuska Biriyani along with friends who had regular Muttoon Biriyani, when they were just a week old!!!

Taste wise we found that it needs lot more improvement, core flavour of Biriyani was very mild, hence needs attention. Over all Masala & Rice were not well mixed.

However, decor, being new, gives a good feel, specifically around Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road you won't have too many restaurants with nice & neatly done decor...

Price wise as per "going rate".

This place had a small hotel called marakkar hotel...famous amongst the locals before and suddenly it turned out to be this extravagant restaurant "Aafreen"...they've completely rebuilt this place and they have done it well, truly high standards... I'v been wanting to go to this place since it opened 2-3monrhs...at one occasion I had there biriyani parcelled and that didn't impress me much comparing with other legendary places.... But then restaurant is not all about biriyani, there are so many other delicacy to try...so went there yesterday with my friend just to taste food not eat properly....we went through the menu which had lots of items and the price seems to be little cheap compared to its other counterparts...they serve indian and chinese both...but i always believe in not to try chinese in these Indian mughlai hotels...if u want chinese go to proper chinese restaurants.. so therefore, we just ordered 1 portion of mutton stew and 2 roti just to get an idea how the other foods were.... And yes, the quantity was good so was the quality and the taste comparing for the price they are serving...there was enough gravy for 3 tandoori rotis, the mutton pieces were well cooked and soft and the roti was also very soft...I would surely go to this place and try more items in future....best part is all the rates on the menu is inclusive of all the taxes...so it doesn't pinch ur pocket at all... :)

My rating....

Food: 3.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Music: N/A
Hospitality: 4.5/5

Welcome readers,to be honest i was skeptical to visit this place jus becoz i read reviews abt it which was quite promising thou it is near my area (Park Street) i became adamant and visited it after all..To my surprise i was intrigued by the ambience which impressed me ( plz note: the ambience i m referring is the family room inside the restaurant)and regarding the food and service lets jus say if u r assuming my reaction to be fantastic and benevolent towards the restaurant perhaps u r sadly mistakenüòè the food is jus lyk any other restaurants..last but nt the least service was averageüëç if u r still reading my review, guys y r u reading my reviews get up smell the coffee!!!  Since its a new restaurant i hav uploaded the pikz which i usually dont intend to do...visit and check out yourself!!!!üòú‚úåÔ∏è¬Æ

To be honest it is an alternate to Arsalan. Though Arsalan has an image but surely this place will gain its popularity soon. The ambience was decent, service was average. The only thing that i liked was the food though the mutton bara kebab in the Special Assorted Kebab was a bit raw. I would definitely give this place a second try.
