It's quite good for quick bite. Some of the best shop which I could get at North Kolkata. Fish fry, breast cutlet, fish pakora I like most. Don't expect decor at this place , but have a seat here and feel the typical north calcutta evening culture.

Probably one of the best but underrated places serving the best cutlets afganis and all palatable dishes in north kolkata.It was suggested by my mother and I keep travelling all the way from extreme south to taste their mutton cutlet fish afgani mutton moglai curry and other dishes.Extremely pocket friendly but definitely a winner in taste

My childhood memories take me to the smell of fresh chicken stew, fish pakoda, fish fry, moglai paratha and fish fry. I have tasted fish pakoda at many places but this is the best. Chicken stew was a delicacy in childhood. It's a nostalgic feeling attached with this place. Still remembering the chicken stew brings water to the mouth. The fish pakoda is so delicious and smooth. All the best.

Fish items are awesome, specially fish roll and fish finger. It's an old school, typical eatery of North calcutta, but much better than many celebrated food joints.

This restro can be called as my family favourite snack house. When I was an infant, I used to see my grandfather bring food from here, then my father used to bring food for us and now me. We love their vegetable grill, fish chop, chicken pakora, chicken stew, fish roll, Kabiraji and actually everything. The fish roll is grand treat for the taste buds. But recently their quality has been compromised, the food feels a little greasy inside mouth. Apart it is great, reasonable and easy digestible.

Probably the only place in Kolkata that still has the cabins for you to enjoy your privacy and their delectable food. It was one evening when my and I found ourselves there to calm our taste buds down. 
I had always heard of the excellent cultets and fries they offered. So we ordered Mutton cutlet, fowl cultet, fish fry, fish pakora and Chicken stew with bread. 
The Mutton and fowl cutlets were just fine, spicy filling, crispy exterior yet had enough moisture and softness. The mustard sauce was a perfect fit with the fries. 
The fish fry was the only thing I didn't like much. The fish was under Marinated because of which it gave out a strong smell. The fish pakoras on the other hand were a dish made it heaven. The entire pakora was big chunks of fishes and oh so soft and juicy. One can literally press it smoothly between your fingers. 
Being the stew crazy that I am, this stew gets 5/5. Light, crisp, healthy and tasty. The vegetables were correctly boiled and the chicken was so tender and soft. The bread alongside is a perfect compliment.

This is a hidden gem located in the Sovabazar area of North Calcutta. Though not well known like the nearby Mitra Cafe, this place is by no means any less, foodwise. Very popular among the locals, the place serves yummy fries and cutlets at a very pocket friendly rate.

There are two dining rooms. None are air conditioned. With its old age feel, it is one of those cabins of Calcutta, which are fast disappearing. You will have to share tables with strangers here.

The menu consists of fries, chops and cutlets and kosha mangsho (mutton gravy). The fish fries and batter fried fishes are tasty with juicy and fresh fillets. The chops are tasty and cheap. And the salad served along with the fries have the typical old Calcutta cabin style boiled potatoes.

Come here to enjoy the old charm and pocket friendly but tasty food.

One of the oldest restaurant of north Kolkata. Fish kabiraji, fish pakora and chicken stew are hot favourite for all its daily customer. Not for health conscious people because most foods serviced are deep fat fried. Not recommended for people searching for decor restaurant.

Its an old saying...old is gold..nd it definitely matches with this place. A very old place in north kolkata for foodies like us. I stay very near to this place nd have many childhood memories of this place. I think they make the most wonderful moghlai paratha in whole kolkata. Fish fry, fish pakora,fish roll, chicken cutlet, mutton cutlet, dahi chicken, chicken kassa, mutton kassa all are my favourites and really recommended. I m not giving them full points just because their items tend to finish very early.

A heritage place in the city to sit with your friends and have addas. They serve delicious fast foods like cutlets and kabiraji. Also the prices of the cutlets are pretty cheap and affordable for the college going students. It is situated near ganga ghats of kolkata. They provide freshly made products which are great in taste ..  a great place to have your evening snacks and a must for every foodies out there in the town.

One of the cheapest outlet for food and adda lovers that exist in north KOLKATA is Dhiren Cabin. Situated in the Shovabazar More, just on the roadside of the road towards the Ganges Ghat, this old cafe provides one of the cheap and tasty food that you could ever find in the north KOLKATA.
Dhiren cabin is very similar to Indian coffee house where you could have quick bites and could enjoy the adda mejaj which has been prevalent here for generations.
The famous kabiraji- a moghlai dishade with egg and fish stuffing is the must whenever you visit this place.
Along with that you would find fish fry,fish fingers, cutlets, vegetable chops,etc.
The quick bites along with the sip of tea is the perfect combination that you would enjoy with your friends.
When you visit this place you would find wooden compartments that used too be famous for your separate chats with your friends in kolkata of 60s and 70s.
Although the cabin is quite small in space you would find the olden ambiance here.
This particular place have a special place in my growing as we friends used to play cricket, football in Kumartuli Park, then go for a evening stroll along the ghats of Ganges and then would stop here in the cabin for the quick bites in the evening. This eventually continued for a long until we all got jobs and went to different cities for our jobs. The place has a sentimental value and despise of its small space it holds a great value of importance in our childhood and youth. Perfect place for begining of great memories along with quite good tasty bites, that's what is dhiren cabin.
