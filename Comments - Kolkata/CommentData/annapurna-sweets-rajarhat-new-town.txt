This sweet shop was very near to the place I was staying. So, I took advantage of the first chance I got to visit this place and stuff my mouth with some delicious traditional Bengali sweets. The place is neat & clean and has a wide range of sweets to offer. I got 3 types of sweets from this place. Nolen Gurer Sandesh, a soft classic sandesh with a filling of Gur syrup. Nolen Gurer Rosogolla, again a classic delicious rosogolla, I love the light flavour nolen gur throughout the rosogolla and its not heavily sweetened too. Baked Mihidana, this was an unusual sweet, a crunchy pie crust filled with mihidana and topped with a layer of Rabri over it and baked, this was a bit too sweet for me. All the three sweets were of  really good quality.

Sweets are good but highly over priced. Shop timings are wrong (as given in Zomato page), please confirm with shop. No card, digital wallet payment accepted, major deal breaker. So if you want to buy some good sweets for 4-5 people, run to the ATM first.

Since my work place is in DLF 1, I am a frequent visitor to this place as I really have a sweet tooth. The most delicious item I enjoy is the besan laddoo made here. I also liked the sandesh and the samosa available here. Usually, there is a wait but the staff are very cordial. Price is a bit on the higher side but given the location it is perfectly understandable.

Located within half a km from my house, this used to be the only sweet shop for the entire stretch of the DLF1 IT premises locality until few months ago. They stock an enviable range of delicious sweets, misti doi (sweet curd or yogurt), milk products like chena and cottage cheese. The namkeen range, however is restricted to radhaballabi-dum aloo, nimki and singara(samosa) .
                                                                ...

It's a premium standard sweet shop and it's literally a banchharam competitor. It's really good and the shop looks premium and staff is good. I'm the morning they have dahi vada and dhokla too.
The rosh Malai is fab and so is the dahi... Paneer isn't that good.

Sweet shop next to our home. Tried their Rasagolla many times, its delicious. It's getting tastier day by day. Try their chocolate sandesh. That's awesome too. But don't like their misti doi. I think it's a bit costly and too much sweet and thick. 

Eager to have their Singara. I heard it's very much tasty.

Sweet quality is good. But it could have been better according to its price.
It's situated in a place where no other sweet shop is present, hence people have not much choices for other shops.
We tried Rosogolla, Chocolate Sandesh. Sandesh was really good, whereas the Rosogolla is average.
It's a good place but try to improve the taste and quality

One of my favorite sweet shop in Kolkata. It has many varieties of sweet and few of them are too delicious. Most of my office celebrations are incomplete without sweets from this place. Prices are fine as sweets get mostly of same price in good shops.

This place is next to my home and I have a very mixed feelings for Annapurna. Without any hesitation I can say, what they serve is just awesome. I have tried almost all the variety you can find on Zomato Images and all of them are of best quality. Prices are on the higher side but I felt that it deserves.

Now about the negative feeling, behaviour of the staffs are often very rude, they serve food but no arrangement wash your hands and they do not even have Tissue Paper for customers which i felt like Awww when I faced it for the first time.

enjoy the sweets at home but not in the shop(the space is real tight). ;)

It is situated very near to my office so usually after lunch we go for sweets here. It is a small outlet which is neat and clean. It can be easily spotted. There is no sitting space so you have to stand and enjoy sweets. There is parking space for your vehicle. It has variety of sweets and snacks. They also have Misti dahi and sada dahi. I have tried rasgulla, gulab jamun, rasmalai and chocolate ladoo tart. I really liked everything. The price are not very high. The gulab jamun is very soft and tasty, the chocolate ladoo tart is basically ladoo of coconut and it is dipped in chocolate topped with dry fruits served in crispy tart. It was good but the tart was too crunchy. I really like rasgulla and rasmalai. The rasgulla is so soft and yummy that you cannot stop at one. I can eat 4-5 at a time as it is so tasty. Rasmalai is also nice. This place is definitely recommended. I wish to try all the sweets here.

In New town area this might be the only authentic bengali mistir dokan . They have several branches. When my office was in DLF building I used to go their several times. Their Rasamalai is very good .
