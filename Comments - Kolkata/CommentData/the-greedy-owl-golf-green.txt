I have ordered from this restaurant twice and the delivery guy stole the change he was supposed to return both the times. Later i recieved a call from the manager after i complained to Zomato who assured me that my money would be returned but it was a lie.

I really would want to know this really a restaurant , I did ask zomato they say it is but I really don't think so , here's what happened I order app shows order recieved , then app shows food on the way , then is the best part I never got the food looks like it vanished mid - way I call the restaurant no response on one no 2nd no not connecting only , I speak with chat support they even get the same response , my question again why has zomato kept such supposed restaurant that forget Delivery don't respond and say they deliver late night ..... The photo shows I got my Delivery again magical I must say ....sadly again there is nothing lower than 1.0

Located amidst the inner side of Jadavpur area , this place is a home delivery outlet and has some lipsmacking cuisines. 

What I Ordered -

1. AMRITSARI BASA :  Golden cripsy on the outside and soft on the inside . It tasted amazing .

2.PALAK PANEER MOMO : The momos looked itself so amazing , that I felt like preserving it and not eating , haha .Now coming to the taste, the palak paneer stuffing on the inside was very tasty and I gobbled like anything. Try this item if you want to come out of mainstream chicken momos. 

3.DAB SHAKE : Originally a shake made out of coconut . This was okayish , nothing fancy. I personally felt it could have been better .

4.ROASTED CHILLI PORK : I have always been a pork lover ,and if you are ardent pork lover, this is the item to try . 

5.PEPPER GARLIC CHICKEN : Another fabulous tasting item from this place. The pieces of chicken were quite big and the smell of fresh garlic added a touch to the dish 

6.FISH STEAK : The fish steak was amazing. It was medium rare and was quite soft to cut .

7.PORK RIBS : Amazing is the word for this item. They gave a Barbeque sauce to compliment this item . In one word, must try guys 

8.BASIL FRIED RICE : Another good rice item from this place. The smell of basil made the rice more tasty .

9.MUTTON KOLHAPURI : I kept my eyes closed while I was having this dish. The mutton pieces were so tender it almost melted with a bite. A must try. 

10.BUTTER CHICKEN BOWL : This item comes with rice , gravy and butter chicken . So if you order this item , it is going to keep your stomach filled for quite a long time. The butter chicken  tasted amazing . 11. SCHEZWAN PRAWN¬† : This item directly made me feel,that I was having the best prawn item in the world. So juicy. So amazing in taste. The prawns will keep you craving for more.¬†

This place is a very good option when it comes to home delivery food. The packaging was quite neat which kept the food warm. Do not think twice when you order from this place.

We happened to order food from this place, being quite close to our place. 
What we ordered were:
1. Palak Paneer Momo- the palak being totally infused into the dough that they used to make the momo. And a generous filling. This really was amazing.
2. Amritsari Basa- battered fried fish, also really good.
3. Roasted chilli pork- I could have the whole of it. The pork pieces were so good. Mostly meat, less of fat.
4. Szechwan Prawn- fab fab fab prawns.
5. Basil fried rice topped with corns. 
6. Lastly the winning stuff being butter chicken Rice bowl. 

We had a lovely experience trying these out. The Greedy Owl surely has a long way to go.

Our never ending thirst for trying out new placws took us here.While hanging out in our friends apartment we decided to check out one of the delivery based outlets available.
We ordered :-

Their Dab shake.

Pork Ribs.

Fish Fillet Steak.

Palak Paneer Momos - My word.The dough was made of palak itself which made it very distinct.And one of the softest momos.I have had.Tasty as well.

Amritsari Basa - Lightly crusted soft on the inside.Good stuff.

The best - Butter Chicken Rice Bowl - Such a perfectly cooked Butter Chicken Gravy .Deadly combo.My pick in this selection.

Kolhapuri Mutton - Unique gravy which was on the sutble side but tasted really well with well prepared mutton pieces.

Pepper Garlic Chicken - Slightly gravy-ish

Schezwan Sauce - My second pick.This preparation directly hits your taste buds.One of my favourites.

This place is absolutely amazing. It was the occasion of reunion of old friends at one of the friends house so we decided to order from this place. 
Our order consisted of the following-
1. Palaak Paneer Momo- pretty, green coloured momos that stole our heart. Though we were at first quite skeptical to order it but finally we decided to take the risk and I am so proud that we did take the risk because it was mind blowing. The coating was green and it was so flavoursome that words cannot express and the filling of paneer was creamy and equally tasty. It came with a spicy sauce with complimented the momos very well.So this is a must try!
2. Amritsari Basa - fresh ,soft and juicy basa with thin and flavoursome coating. It was also very good.
3. Roasted Chilli Pork- an absolute delight for all the pork lovers. A must try
4. Pepper Garlic Chicken- succulent pieces of chicken tossed with bell peppers in a thick garlicky sauce. Tasted amazing!
5. Schezwan prawn- now I am such a kind of person who likes prawn only in malaikaris but this changed my opinion. It was so awesome that I can't even express. A must must try 
6. Fish Steak- steamed fish with awesome flavours! 
7. Pork Ribs- it came with barbecue sauce. one word for it- awesome!
8. Basil Fried Rice- it was very tasty
9. Mutton Kolhapuri- oh my! This was heavenly. Please order this one. I bet you won't regret it 
10. Butter Chicken Bowl- Chicken in a heavenly greavy served with rice. It was amazing! This is a must must try!
We had also ordered Daab Shake which was refreshing and tasted good.
This place is like one of the best delivery places in Kolkata and I will recommend everyone to give it a try. I bet you won't regret a single dish.
Happy Fooding ‚ù§

The Greedy Owl had been in my bucket list for a long time. Finally got the chance to savour some of their delicacies. For starters, we had palak paneer momo,roasted chili pork,schezwan prawn and pepper garlic chicken. Every item was yumm and beautiful. Loved the flavour of the pepper garlic chicken, the schezwan prawns were soft, chili pork was tasty and the palak paneer momo was heaven. At first i was a bit skeptical about the momos but after a bite, it transported me to heaven. Along with it we also had fish steak and amritsari basa which were also good; the amritsari basa was soft and yummy. To satiate our thirst we also had daab shake which was quite good. For main course, we had basil fried rice, butter chicken,mutton kolapuri and big fat pork. I m in love with the mutton kolapuri and butter chicken- they are just heaven. I had along with this basil fried rice it was a perfect combination. The big fat pork was also good. Overall i loved the food. The service and packaging too was quite good.A big thumbs up to The Greedy Owl. Do try guys, you wont be disappointed.
Recommemdation:
The palak paneer momo( do try this guys)
Pepper garlic chicken
Butter chicken
Schezwan prawns
Mutton kolapuri

If you need a sandwich or a burger at night when it will be too late to cook something this is the ideal place.... Ordered spanish omlette nocturnal sandwiches. i must say that they should charge a little less for the quality they serve but then again withe the option for free delivery and food being served warm in the middle of the night you can pay this bit extra ... However they take almost an hour to deliver the food which I personally do feel is a bit longer than the usual....

We ordered a variety of beef, chicken and pork burgers, but the burgers were not labelled, so the folks who don't eat beef chose not to eat at all.

Very very disappointing.

And the burgers were not great either. Very amateur effort. 

Will never be ordering again.

Ordered food from this new 24*7 delivery joint in our locality. Delivery time was a bit long. Packaging was alright. We had ordered - 
Pork Kebabs - Never had pork kebabs before. Three skewers were served with four kebabs in each of them. Tasted decent. Nothing extraordinary. Could have done better if provided with some dip/chutney. 
Big Owl Burger - I may be wrong with the name but probably this was the one. Contained a beef patty, mayonnaise, lettuce and came with fries. The beef patty was very average. Didn't like it much though. 
It's a 3 for now for the items I tried. Didn't like the food much. I am not sure if I am going to repeat this place again. Won't say that this place is recommended to try but do take a note of the place if you're in the locality as it's a 24*7 delivery joint. So they can take care of your hunger pangs at the oddest of times when other places are unable to serve you. That's it. Happy Dining! :)

This delivery outlet is located in the interiors of Jadavpur area. It is a solely home delivery outlet which offers a variety of cuisines for those who like to experiment with their taste buds. 
I was invited at a friend's place near Jadavpur where she ordered food from this outlet. She ordered -
1.Pork Kebab- I have never had pork kebab in my life before and the juicy and tender minced pork kebabs made me fall for them. The kebabs were perfectly cooked with spices and the meat tasted delicious. 
2. Pulled beef sandwich- The sandwich wasn't an ordinary one but had pulled beef fillings. It is filling and the beef is tender and well-cooked.
3. Chicken wings- Who doesn't love chicken wings? We couldn't help but order this dish which has filling and juicy chicken pieces cooked in a very unique sauce. The quantity is also good and won't let you down.
4. Egg and bacon burger- this burger has a thick layer  of bacon and another of egg with veggies which is filling and very tasty.
5. Corn and cheese sandwich- the sandwich has a thick layer of cheese and the mixture of cheese and corn perfectly goes with the sandwich.
6. Chicken tikka bowl- this is a heavy platter with rice and chicken tikka completing a wholesome meal. The chicken pieces are cooked in Indian spices and the rice compliments the chicken preparation very well. 
They might take a little longer in delivering but the food will be worth the wait. The price is also very reasonable and won't fall heavy on your pocket. The service is commendable and great food will always keep you happy.  They maintain good hygiene and the packing is perfectly done. I would definitely recommend‚Äã everyone to order food from this outlet. You won't regret.

This was the worst experience ever. We ordered a masala omelette and a ham and cheese omelette both of which came with 2 pieces of bread and hash browns. Firstly the food was prepared with a below standard oil as the hash brown had a funny smell in it. The chicken filling in the omelette had excessive salt..the ham and cheese omlette was just average..i mean how can you go so wrong with simple omlettes??? will never recommend this restaurant  to anyone ever.

They need to make some improvements regarding the delivery timings.

Ordered 3 dishes from The Greedy Owl late last night.
Repercussions - stomach ache and mild diarrhea.

Dishes - Peri Peri Chicken (which is supposed to be their best dish), Egg Shakshuka and a Butter Chicken Bowl.

Review - all the dishes had one fatal flaw. An overdose of salt. The kind of overdose that makes you retch the moment the food hits your mouth.

The Peri Peri chicken was spicy, but extremely dry and salty. Couldn't finish half of one.

The Egg Shakshuka was again, extremely salty. The eggs were overcooked. It ended up looking, smelling and tasting like a bowl of poorly cooked tomato puree. 3 or 4 spoons was the most I could have from this.

The Butter Chicken bowl had 1 saving grace. The rice. Just the rice was nice and ordinary and standard. The chicken and it's curry was inedible on account of its salt. The chicken itself was edible, but dry and starchy.

Overall, the quality of food that I was expecting based on recommendations and reviews was not met at all. I was thoroughly disappointed with the food and like many other late night delivery joints, the greedy owl disappoints.

I'm a food lover and it hurts me to write negative reviews. But the food here has caused health concerns, keeping aside all the taste issues and cooking problems. I'd urge the restaurant to take a good, strong look at their late night delivery and quality standards of cooking and bring it up.

I don't usually put reviews on Zomanto however my experience was so appalling now I'm compelled to write one. Now I'm no food connoisseur, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to discern what crappy food is. I ordered

French fries - and what a French freaking fry it was, the fries were thick as hell, bland and barely fried it felt like they saut√©ed‚Äã those damn potatoes on a normal skillet rather than deep frying

Mexican Bowl - which costs whooping 300 gives you nothing but‚Äã mere rice with bits and pieces of chicken, maybe I was expecting it would be a rice bowl similar to Chili's with tortilla strips, black beans and stuff and boy was I wrong

Egg Chicken Sandwich - now the MVP, this one stole the show, when I opened the package and saw the sandwiches I started questioning my own sanity, they were tiny and looked like a road roller ran over it on an asphalt road numerous times, even your local chaiwala can make you a sandwich which will look aesthetically pleasing and cost 10-20 rather than 180 -___-. After all this do I have to mention that it tasted like utter nightmare.

Thanks for ruining my evening and a total waste of money I was gullible enough to fall for all the 5 star reviews it recieved, but good thing I made an experience out of this, you will never find me ordering again from greedy owl

A friend of mine recommended this new place. So I thought to give it a shot. I ordered Spicy chilly pork and Cocktail sausages for delivery. They took about 45 mins for the delivery. The food was really upto my taste. It wasn't a disappointment. They have a very good and versatile menu and it's not very expensive either. I think I will order again and give the other things in the menu a try too.

Firstly, should have marked them between 4.0 to 5.0 as they are just 5 6 months old and have a lot to improve,  but still full marks to their service and their concept. Probably the best eatout at golfgreen area. Started as a midnight delivery now a 24 hours service is set to give a huge competition to lots of running restaurant owners in this area. No second thoughts about their service, delivery time is high, but balances it with hygeine and quality of food. No questions regarding the quantity. Grilled chicken is highly recommended. Will like if you people put a more of Chinese and Indian to your menu. Rice bowls are just awesome. If you are from golfgreen, do give it a try.

The chicken was soft and nicely cooked and I still can't get over that mouthwatering taste... In short it was simply yumm ... I plan to order more from here.. And thank you so much for the quick delivery... This is undoubtedly one of the best places I have come across that fits our budget and suits our taste at the same time..

I went for a night stay at my friend's place in kalikapur a few days back and during midnight we had this immense craving to have Pork. I knew that I would have to let my craving die  until another friend suggested The Greedy Owl.
We ordered Pork chops from there at around 2 am and our food was delivered by 2:40 am.
Wonderful packaging and very warm behavior of the staff adds to the positivity of this delivery restaurant.

We are a family of five and my mother decided to take a break from cooking one day.  Had already heard about the Greedy Owl from my friend before and I thought it that it was the perfect opportunity to order from them and see if my friend's rantings were worth it.  I am happy that I ordered.  We ordered three rice bowls and three steaks.  The steak was just how you would want it,  cook properly with proper spices and taste great.  We also ordered  five dab shakes,  as cool the name sounds,  the shake was more.  The delivery time was nearly 45 minutes which is Okay if I consider where I stay , over all would like to order again.

I went for a night stay at my friend's place in kalikapur a few days back and during midnight we had this immense craving to have Pork. I knew that I would have to let my craving die  until another friend suggested The Greedy Owl.
We ordered Pork chops from there at around 2 am and our food was delivered by 2:40 am.
Wonderful packaging and very warm behavior of the staff adds to the positivity of this delivery restaurant.

We are a family of five and my mother decided to take a break from cooking one day.  Had already heard about the Greedy Owl from my friend before and I thought it that it was the perfect opportunity to order from them and see if my friend's rantings were worth it.  I am happy that I ordered.  We ordered three rice bowls and three steaks.  The steak was just how you would want it,  cook properly with proper spices and taste great.  We also ordered  five dab shakes,  as cool the name sounds,  the shake was more.  The delivery time was nearly 45 minutes which is Okay if I consider where I stay , over all would like to order again.

Ordered from The Greedy Owl last night. I'm in love with their lip smacking peri peri chicken and Texas Massacre. They don't even charge for delivery and their delivery was on time . A great takeout to satisfy your tummy at night.
A thumbs up to overall quality and quantity.

I have ordered Chicken steak...the steak itself was juicy, flavorful, and tender. The steak  was salty enough to forgo the gravy, but it does add an extra layer of slightly creamy, peppery flavor. It's pretty watery though. There's a savory note to it but it's not very meaty.

They brought the whole new concept of food delivery at your doorstep any time at night,i think this is first of kind in Kolkata.When I first saw their menu I thought its little overpriced but the quantity and quality they serve it makes the price reasonable.Plus they dont charge for delivery which is good and they deliver within time.I think twice they dient deliver within time but its okay as the food were still hot.The quality and taste of their is great.If u feel hungry middle of the night greedy owl can emerge as your saviour.

From the variegated menu to the authentic taste in affordable price. The Greedy Owl is definitely one of the best take-aways out there.  The food they serve is fresh and made with love , the goodness of the materials used can be felt in every bite and the most cherishing part is the availability of all the items in the menu every time. You never get to hear a no or the food is over. The delivery may not be always on time but you can be sure that the food is fresh and definitely a treat to the taste buds. ‚ù§

Probably the best place to get your food cravings sorted. Delivery within 15 20 minutes. Fresh food. Tastes great. The best part is, the food they come up with, is not comparable with others in this area. Maintains the quality along with quantity.

What to say about a place which fulfils midnight pangs? Full marks for the idea and execution, especially for people like me who stay awake completing boring office works. Now coming to service, never expected a setup of golf green to deliver at thakurpukur, again bang on service. Food, quality is something I would recommend other restaurants to be aware of them, so is their quantity. Do order steak, rice bowls , burgers from them. I've more or less tried everything from them.

Ordered Alfredo pasta along with a chef's special chicken side at a very odd hour, probably 1:30 in the clock. On time delivery. No additional taxes.g pod quantity. Packaging was good enough which kept the food warm. The person who delivered was such a gentleman. Will surely order food once again and recommend to others too.

The food from greedy owl is a delicious blend of home like taste and restaurant type quality. I loved the peri peri chicken and the milk shakes were really good. I also ordered the Texas massacre burger (that name tho) which is a beef burger, but the best part is that they let you customize their burger, so I could get chicken instead of beef. and damn it was good! If you are tired of the same old restaurant food then greedy owl can easily be your new food destination for a long time.

The Greedy Owl is a single solution for midnight hunger and cravings. I am a night owl and was bored with consuming maggi on a regular basis. I ordered for a beef steak while working late at night and I was satisfied with the quality and the amount of the food. The Greedy Owl does justice to its name by surving the Hungry Nocturnals who don't have enough time to cook or are lazy enough or partying late.

Firstly, thanks for not keeping me hungry for the whole night. Pretty badass step for a bunch of young Individuals to portray this kind of entrepreneurial and professional attitude at the middle of the night. The food, packaging and the delivery time, helped me to give a rating of 4.5. The Pork Ribs and the Big-fat-Burger is a must have at around 2'o clock at night..

It cracked by chance. I was pushed by my Sr. colleague to give a try in our midnight mission to kill the hunger and curb the greed. One Greedy owl was ordered to supply the food. We tried Nocturnal Sandwich and Chicken Steak. It was supplied in right time and taste was simply superb. It's appealing. it's no more one greedy owl but 'the greedy owl'for sure......I don't know how they can cook so tasty item in sleeping time.

In less than an hour, I was presented with the oh-so-amazing dishes. This place is perfect for every nocturnal in terms of service, quality and quantity. I'm more than just satisfied with the first experience of ordering from The Greedy Owl.

Ordered from The Greedy Owl last night. Came to know about this place from a close friend. To be honest my expectations weren't that high. I ordered The Big Fat burger and hot chocolate. Order was placed at 12 am and it was delivered around 12:40. The burger was delicious as hell. Generous portion and balanced taste. Fresh buns. Hot chocolate exceeded expectations by a mile. Greedy owl's idea is still young and i really hope they open an outlet soon. I am a picky eater but this place is highly recommended. I'll be ordering again from this place soon.

The food from The Greedy Owl tastes pretty well and is inexplicably healthy. It is really suited for all of us, when we get stomach growls at ungodly hours. From party goers to late night study rounds when the fridge is empty and Mom is out-of-station to hostelites and people staying as paying guests, I recommend it to everyone. The best part is that the food that's served is healthy, delights your taste buds and appeases your tummy. The food delivery service is quite meticulous and the costing is also pretty reasonable, I'd say. You could very well just go for it!

This had been one of the best eat outs for me recently. The food is quiet reasonably priced and has a kind of freshness in it. Their delivery is prompt. And the best part about them is that they can very well take care of your midnight cravings since they remain open till 4.00 a.m. unlike most of the Calcutta restaurants. 
So for all those party people out there and for all those late workers, this is the exact place for you to dig your fork into. A must try for everyone.
