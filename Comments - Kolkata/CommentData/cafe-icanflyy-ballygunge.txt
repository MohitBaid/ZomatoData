This cafe is beautiful. Went there yesterday to celebrate my friend's birthday. We had a lot of fun. The food was below average but the place was beautiful. Coffee was normal, chicken poppers were good, pizza was alright but basil pasta was terrible. Overall food was not so good. Coming to the decor and ambience, it was a five for me. There were plenty of board games and outside the cafe itself there was a small space for games like fusball. We also requested for karaoke which was not a real karaoke but was fun. Staff were friendly. I hope they put more non veg items in their menu and improve the quality of food. Pricing is also a bit high but if we consider the fun we had then it was alright.

Cafe situated beside madox Square Park, it's a small cafe but very well decorated, they have fun games, books available in cafe so that one can go hanging out with friends or can also enjoy the lone time. We had one ami tomake bhalobashi coffee, one hug in the mug, one bbq chicken poppers and pizza... Everything was good except the pizza.. I forgot to take the picture otherwise everyone can the size of of the pizza, it wasn't even sufficient enough for a kid, it was that small... A very well known cafe near my home made me very disappointed

A beautiful idea. Go and check it out for yourself.  

Won't say much but the kind of service we got, truly touched.  

The food prepared was good. So was the cute decor and the Foosball outside.  

A great great experience.

I wanted to visit this place from a long time. A well decorated place with a lot of board games, card games and foosball. We ordered for BBQ Chicken Poppers, Chicken Jalepeno Pizza, Chicken Platter and French fries. The chicken poppers is overhyped. The chicken platter didn't do justice to the name platter. Two chicken breasts were deep fried and served with a tangy sauce fried egg and french fries. The pizza and the games were the only good things about this place. It's a place where you can just go in a group and enjoy the food along with the games. It's a very good initiative I must say and hence a must try for everyone.

It's very tastefully decorated. I love their chairs.
I love the noble idea of providing employment to people who are special in a way or another.
The owners were very friendly and nice.
The food was average.
The menu was mostly vegetarian with a few non-veg stuff.
It's suitable for a drink and some finger food only.

Located opposite to Maddox this cute little café with board games , mini library is a great way to unwind yourself after work. Interior is really interesting, with usherers being differently able shows a compassionate Human Resource policy of the owners. Ordered Roasted Garlic Potato bites, and Balsamic Mushroom  Cheese Pizza 🍕. Food titilates all the sense organs and is yummy. Take away snacks(roasted chidwa,jhal Muri) and their packaging  reflects Social responsibility too.
Food - 4.5/5

Great cafe. Its run by special people. And their service is good.  I ordered chocolate frappe and a chicken pizza. Taste was good. Ambience and decor was excellent. They had board and other games. However they need to work more on their menu  because the options are less. Sone more chicken items needs to be introduced. Overall i had a good experience

One of the top rated cafes here, in Zomato, I thought of giving it a go. I was totally blown away by the decor & bonus it's Christmas. This cafe is managed by people with special needs and needless to say, they are best at it.
They have both indoor and outdoor sitting options with a kids zone as well. They have a huge collection of books and games to indulge in. The ambience just sets your mood. We chose to sit inside. The staff was very friendly and sweet. 
The menu card was so colourful and welcoming. We ordered Green Apple Mojito, Cappuccino, Spicy Chicken and Pickled Jalapeno Pizza, Cheesy French Fries and to wrap it up some Nutella Pancakes. The food was lip smacking. Enjoyed them to bits and pieces. 
In all, an excellent experience ❤️

We came across this beautiful café while attending an event at Maddox Square. It was one of the most charming and quaint ones that I have ever been to 
Located just opposite Maddox Square, I Can Flyy is run by specially abled people and supported by the I Can Flyy organisation. 
There are both outdoor and indoor seating areas. The outdoor area has a Foosball table and a seating capacity of around 25.
The indoor area is smaller, but decorated very brightly, and was specially done for Christmas. People can play board games, cards, and while away there time just as they like. The staff were also very friendly.
The food was quite delicious. We ordered a Cold Coffee, nicknamed Ami Tomake Bhalobashi, BBQ Spicy Chicken Poppers, Veggie Delight Pizza, a Special Mixed Sauce Pasta and Death by Chocolate Brownie. Loved all the preparations and enjoyed them to the fullest. 
Special mention for the Chicken Poppers and the Brownie. I would keep coming back for them.
This little café definitely needs more exposure and more people coming. It is a hidden gem.

I went here just before Christmas, so it had all the Christmas decor and it looked all so beautiful.

To reach here you have to take a auto from JD Park (if coming by metro) > auto towards Ballygaunge Phari > tell the auto vala that you want to get down at National high school > its a 5-6 mins walk from there.

The staff is super friendly. And cafe is disabled friendly, i like the most about cafe.

It has seating arrangements in the open also and inside.
Play area for children.
To top it all, the board games are absolutely free. You can pick any game and keep your children engaged, and
 even adults. 

I ordered: 
1. Choco Frappe 
2. BBQ Chicken Poppers 
3. Spicy Chicken and Jalapeno Pizza
4. Brownie with Ice cream

One of the finest cafes visited till date. The wonderfull decor and the interiors are well lit, bright and colourfull. Friendly ambience and staffs. Located near Maddox Square this place is run by speacially abled people. A perfect place for a mood lifter. Also they offer a variety of board games so its not just a sit, eat and leave kind of a cafe. One can spend a quality time playing cards or a variety of other board games offered. and the food is amazing. Tried Spicy chicken and grilled jalapenos pizza, blueberry frappe and hot chocolate. Pizza was well served on a wodden pizza plate that looked so yummy but could have been a little larger in size keeping in mind the price. Apart from this its a must visit cafe. 😃

The cafe is one of the most prettiest cafes I've visited till date. The cafe offer more than just good food and is dedicated in trying to make the world a better place and is redefining the concept of "coffee with a conscience". I'm really happy to see the effort put by the management in making the cafe disabled friendly. We definitely need more places which are disabled friendly and this cafe serves as a prime example that people with special needs can run a cafe just as good as others. People with development disabilities are able to perform tasks as long as they receive sufficient support.
A truly great cafe. A place to recharge with a good book and a steaming drink or to chat up a friend over that perfect pastry. The best spots have a bit magic to them: ambience with no pretence, friendly baristas, and of course, delicious coffee.
Coming to the food, we ordered chicken poppers, pizza and brownie.
We tried chicken poppers for the first time. Saw the reviews before on zomato about the chicken poppers which showed the chicken looking plump and appearing to be a good size. The problem is that they don't resemble to those pics and the pieces were quite small. They aren't bad but they don't offer anything really special. Most cafes have pretty lame desserts but this one is the best I've had in a long time. Coming to the pizza, the crust was thin, slightly chewy and packed with cheese and mushrooms.
Please visit this place to know how good it feels to eat here. I will never forget this experience. This was my first visit and definitely not the last, it's a beautiful place. Cheers!

For a really long time me and my friend wanted to visit a cafe to just chill and spend some quality time. After spending a considerable amount of time checking out cafes on zomato, we zeroed on this. 

The moment we entered, it was love at first sight. The cafe was sooooo vibrant and colourful that it can cheer up anyone's mood. They had loads of board games and the management was really friendly and nice.

We ordered the following :

● Green Apple drink - Tasted fresh and tangy. 
● Roasted Garlic Potato Bites - Nothing great
● Balsamic Mushroom and Three Cheese Pizza - It tasted heavenly.
● Fettuccine Alfredo - Creamy and yummy.

Overall, loved the food as well as the ambience. Definitely looking forward to visiting again.

One of the prettiest cafes of Kolkata, Cafe I Can Fly is a mood lifter. A must visit if you like the idea of sipping a "Ami Tomake Bhalobashi", which is their signature cold coffee with some board games like Scrabble, Uno etc with your gang. They have alot of food options as well starting from my favorite Aglio Oglio to Pizzas, sandwiches and the like. I loved this dessert, the name of which I am a little unsure of, (most probably it was Chocolate Manjar..)but it was sheer bliss. Mixed with chocolate brownie, crunchy walnuts, toppled with gooey chocolate sauce and what not. I can't wait to go back, just to have a mouthfull more of that blissful indulgence.

Price for two is really misleading. The Caesar’s salad only had onion and lettuce in it with sorry shreds of chicken. The pasta was very mediocre and the raspberry drink was also miserable. They have employed women with down’s syndrome and advertise it too but the lady at the counter was shouting at them in front of us which seemed distasteful.

Price is reasonable, quality and quantity is good but i won't say that the food is amazing because it was little oily. Other than that..they play good music. They have board games which is fun.  everyone is so friendly.. so you can have a good time.  This place can really make you happy. :)

Cafe I Can Fly, the name means a lot. This place is run by specially abled childs and its initiative is done by Preeyam Buddha and her mother. Its located just opposite to Maddox Square.

Second impression about this place was their interiors, everything was very colourful and vibrant. Brick walls, Warmth of the filament old style bulbs, Some gift packs and quotes on small sticky notes in front and comfortable sittings. All together it was very impressive and comfortable for a cafe experience. Also they offer lots of board games. Coming to the food, it was our menu for the day…

Berry & Basil, Green Apple, Mint Lemon :
————————————————————
All the soda infusion drinks looked good but my personal favourite was Mint Lemon. This one was purely refreshing and hint of  lemon felt good where other drinks could’ve been better. Priced at Rs. 120 the Mint Lemon is recommended.

Choco Frappe & Strawberry Frappe :
———————————————————
Next coming to the frappe we were served the most popular once. Frappes were served in a really good way. Starting with the chocolate one that tasted really nice with the flavour of ice cream and cream. Also it was very balanced and enough to fill the heart of a chocolate lover. Both the frappes were priced at Rs.200, bit expensive but Choto Frappe is recommended.

Mix Veg Strips :
—————————
In quick bites menu we’re served with Mix Veg strips, that was basically veg balls crispy fried to complement the drinks. Served with sauce and pickle it looked well garnished. Taste wise it wasn’t much impressive, still good enough to complement tea or coffee. It was priced at Rs. 110.

Veggie Delight Pizza,
Balsamic Mushroom and 3 Cheese Pizza,
Spicy Chicken and Pickled Jalapeno Pizza :
———————————————————————
After small snacks we jumped into their Pizza menu. All of the pizzas were well served on wooden pizza plate and each and every pizza looked just delicious. Toppings on the pizzas were enough to catch eye at first glance. But just after taking out one slice we understood the crush was super thin. Better to say it was thin like a paratha. Well they don’t offer any crust selection option, but by default they assume you are on diet. So they made pizzas on extremely thin crusts. Unfortunately it didn’t tasted as good as it looked like. Although all the 8” pizzas were filled enough with cheese still the fun of pizza didn’t came from these. Priced at Rs.255 each of the pizzas were bit expensive.

Fettuccine Alfredo Veg &
Mozzarella Penne in Garlic Red Sauce with Chicken :
——————————————————————————
Now to fill the little hunger we jumped into their Noodle and Pasta menu. Both the pasta looked quite colourful and cheesy at first glance. Unfortunately Fettuccine Alfredo Veg pasta was over boiled and tasted dull compared to Mozzarella Penne that tasted till good. Both the pasta priced at Rs. 240 seems quite expensive too me.

English Mustard Egg Sandwich :
——————————————————
Like each and every other dishes this one was also served really well & beautifully garnished with some potato chips and ketchup. Breads were well grilled and the brownish texture on it looked nice. But taste wise it was kind of average and dull. This one was priced at Rs. 135.

Conclusion :
————————
Keeping the food a side, what they’re doing needs a big heart to do that. Specially abled childs do need a place in the society and they are just offering that. You can definitely give it a try and see their work done in this beautiful cafe, but don’t expect much from their foods.

A little difficult to locate at first but its very near Maddox Square.It was love at first sight.The place is colorfully decorated.It instantly boosts your mood.We received a warm welcome from the staff.Now we ordered classic frappe, perfect cutting chai,roman pizza and chicken poppers.They were perfectly done.Infact i loved their tea so much that i went for another round of it.The presentations were beautifully done.There are a lot of board games kept on the shelves so it is an ideal spot to just chill and have fun.

A Cafe in Ballygunje, , has become a hometown hit for a few reasons — the biggest being it provides employment opportunities for staffers with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our society is seeing our disabled children aren’t so disabled after all. I applaud the determination these workers show.

A vibrant and spacious cafe, some good food and a few happy faces; this is what Cafe ICanFlyy all about. A new cafe located at Ballygunge, well almost nearby Maddox Square. To be very frank, before visiting the place, I was happy knowing the location, Maddox, after all, is close to my heart and for that matter close to many typical Kolkatans.
                                                                ...

A cozy ambience with very warm and welcoming people , Cafe i can flyy serves good food and makes sure you have a great time there. The cafe, managed by special needs people , is unique in the sense that it is so well kept and filled with positivity.  
We had the green soda infusion , black coffee and cold coffee , all of which were good. We also had French fries with cheese sauce , chicken poppers and mushroom and three cheese pizza. The poppers were good and seasoned well. The pizza was the highlight of the day. It was amazing , blending three cheeses well and the mushrooms were tender. 
The pieces are reasonable here and the people are very friendly. It’s nice to see that they’ve been given employment and recognition. 
They don’t fit in because they’re born to stand out. And all this was possible because of the founders of I Can Flyy , Mrs Mini Budhia , Mr Sanjay Budhia and their daughter , Priyam Budhia. 
A well maintained place and a place to go again and again.

A newbee in town, Café ICanFlyy is located near Maddox Square, 10 minutes at the most from JD Park Metro Station (Hazra Gate).

The best thing I liked about this place was the interior. All done up in vibrant colours, this place sure gonna set the gloomiest of moods into a happy one. There is also provision for outside seating. The best part is they have got Foosball alongside various board games. This is a proper Café, in the truest sense.

Coming to food, we had ordered the following;

Beverage 🍹
Fruit Tea
Berry & Basil: It was just too good. A must order if you visit this place.
Honey Green Tea Frappe: An all new definition to green tea, it gave. Creamy, it was like a mini version of shake.

Starters and Main Course 🍟🍕
Cheese Pots
Spicy French Fries
Chilli Cheese Toast
Super Crisp Roman Pizza
Veggie Delight Pizza
Mozzarella Penne in Red Garlic Sauce

Each of the item was was well over the mark. The Pasta needs special mention, it was one of the best I've ever tried. A must have!!

Dessert 🍧
Chocolate Brownie: Nutty, tasty serves with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Good service by special people which was the best part of this place, worth mentioning. Overall, I had a great experience over there, will recommend this place for sure. 😊

Cafe ICanFlyy,has come up with a special concept, located just opposite maddox square, take the walk inside the lit up lane and you will hit the doors of the cafe. The decor of this place is really good, the lighting and the live music will attract you, and so will be specially abled servers, who will serve you happily with a broad smile on thr face, an added 1star for that.
Coming to the food we had Mix veg strips, Choco frappe(recommended),Strawberry frappe, Balsamic MushroomCheese Pizza, Spicy Chicken & pickled jalapeno pizza, veggie delight pizza, Berry basil, Green Apple, Mint Lemon, Chicken Mozarella Penne in Garlic Red Sauce,Fettucine Alfredo, English Mustard Egg Sandwhich. For the food I would give a 3,and there is a lot of scope for improvement, the upcoming cafes are a value for money places, but this place falls short on that, as the price to quantity ratio is much low, maybe because of the charity, the food is a bit overpriced, not sure. Overall a good place. Also I would like if they introduce some special offers for specially abled people, that can attract a huge number of people.

Cafe icanflyy is a very special place run by wonderful peoples.Owned by Preeyam budhia and her mother,this cafe is an initiative to able the children who have special needs.

Located just opposite the Maddox square,this cafe has a nice and warm ambiance that will make your visit memorable.The fun and quirky interior is absolutely commendable and eye catching.From the quotes that drives your attention to the hanging bulb tied to a rope everything is precisely done.
They have a lot of board games to play and karaoke nights also.

Their menu ranges from various types of quick snacks like pizza,pasta,sandwich to refreshing beverages.

Coming to food,we had
Mix veg strips
Choco frappe
Strawberry frappe
Balsamic mushroom and 3 cheesepizza
Spicy chicken and pickled jalapeno pizza
Veggie delight pizza
Berry basil
Green apple
Mint lemon
Mozarella penne in garlic red sauce(chicken)
Fettuccine alfredo(veg)
English mustard egg sandwich

I loved the frappe,its a must try but the pasta was not upto the mark.
Food was good but there is a room for improvement.I felt the quantity was a bit less in accordance to the price.

For desert we had brownie and mini cupcake.

All in all this is a nice place with a soothing ambiance and amazing people serving you with cheerful faces.
Kudos to the team..

Will power knows no obstacles and that is what "Cafe ICanFlyy" is all about.

Situated just opposite the famous "MADDOX SQUARE" it's more than just a Cafe,but it's an initiative,for the good & the specially abled ones.

Motivational quotes,wooden textures,brick walls,ideal setting of glass and the warmth of the filament bulbs perfectly set's up the mood and to cherish this whole decor phenomenon, you have karaoke set up for you.

It's not just the decor but the humbleness of those beautiful people disguised as staff's.

Good music for your earbuds and amazing touch of decorations for your eyes but what's in store for your TASTEBUDS?

| Food,Drinks & Dessert |

• Berry basil
• Green apple
• Mint lemon
• Choco frappe
• Strawberry frappe

The drinks tasted fresh and provides you that refreshing sensation.

• Balsamic mushroom and 3 cheesepizza
• Spicy chicken and pickled jalapeno pizza
•Mozarella penne in garlic red sauce(chicken)
•Fettuccine alfredo(veg)
•English mustard egg sandwich
•Brownie

The main course section is where this place looses it's hard earned points.
Neither their pizza's are able to make a mark for themselves nor the pasta's are that overwhelming  and the biggest issue is ofcourse the overpricing of the items but if it's for a good cause,then why not,for those beautiful people.But maintenance of proper taste is what will help the cause more and will build the reach but if the very purpose of food fails,building upon the adjacent i.e the social cause get's difficult.

Would love to see this cafe rise to it's full potential and keep trying to build itself,everyday,in a new way.

Best Wishes <3

The place was in my wish list for a long time and few days ago we visited this restaurant with group of my friends. This place is located at a convenient near Maddox square just beside Cafe Mezzaluna. Not a hard thing to find it out.

You will hardly realize I is a Café until you walk a long corridor. The décor is good and very much vibrant in color. The café is operated by some special need adults who are extremely friendly and ready to serve you with smile.

Now come to the food. Chillers (Berry basil, Green apple, Mint lemon) were normal as usual soda based drinks. Frappes (Choco Frappe & Strawberry Frappe) & Veg stripes were good. But Pasta (Chicken Mozzarella penne in garlic red sauce & Fettuccine Alfredo) and Pizza (Balsamic mushroom and 3 cheese pizza, Spicy chicken and pickled jalapeno pizza) were not up to the mark. Need huge improvisation in these sector. Sandwich was good and the desserts were okay type.

But when it comes about pricing, it was too much expensive in terms of food. Live music will surely let you fly high. Overall okay.

Located just in front of Maddox square... The cafe is not that big but have both indoor and outdoor seating... Loved their modern decor...!! 0.5 extra marks for their decor from my side.. 
I must say about the pricing... It's really excessive in terms of food... 
Smoothies and chillers are good.. Loved those...  Need extra touch on pizzas... I felt it can be improved... Sandwich and veggies balls were good... Pastas was not upto the mark... 
The concept of live music was good... As they will let you for live music..!

This cafe is just located oposite to maddox square , very easy to locate. What i loved about this place is they came up with an initiatives to help out the children who needs special attention. Such children serve us food and work in this cafe. Infact the hand crafted things prepared by them is kept there so that if any one wishes to buy they can buy.
Ambience wise i will give this cafe 5/5 .
It was a cute and cosy place where you can seat for a long time chatting with your friends over the nice spread of frappe or sodas or coffee.
Prices of the food for the quantity and quality was moderate.
I found the food quality to be ok.

A perfect place for couples to go or with some delightful bunch of friends meeting after a while and having conversations
The ambience is such that make us feel relaxed 
Moreover about the pricing which is really unexpectedly not expensive.
I had garlic masala maggu in which the taste of garlic was actually coming on my way too good
And hug in a mug (hot chocolate) and ama toma k bhalo bhasi 😆 which was cold coffee was also perfect
Really an amazing place

Located just beside the Maddox square so that's a big plus point for this restaurant to have such good location. Walking down a narrow by lame is the mere effort you have to go through for the sake of reaching this place. This is a very special place because it employs people with special needs and hence empowers them. Funky interiors and quirky seating arrangements and furnitures makes this place a really cool hangout centre and instant favourite among many. Karaoke nights and vast variety of board are other big reasons to love this place. They have a compact menu serving some average quality dishes. In my opinion the prices that they demand as per the food is very high. Coming to the service the special need people work as staff members and greet you with a big innocent smile. I have no strong complaint against the service. I hope this place gets a broader menu and chops down the price in the later future.

This cafe is located near the main gate of the famous adda spot "Maddox Square" and beside café Mezulana. They are helping the disabled children to get an exposure and I loved the idea behind it. The place is small but the space management has been done rightly and is very nicely decorated. The ambience is a 10/5. :)
But the quantity of the food in not satisfactory where as the quality is good.
The menu card is very interesting and the Desserts are to die for 😍
We ordered: Egg Sandwich , Soda Infusion (Mint and lemon), Earl Grey Tea and Nutella Pancake for dessert (I loved the pancake)
They have foosball  and lot other indoor games. And also sell  cookies, bookmarks (bought a set)
It's a good place and a better initiative.One should visit that place once and I bet they will have a good time and a better day :)

Cafe ICanFlyy , a start up for a wonderful and noble cause , rendering working opportunities to individuals with special needs gave us an uniquely different experience. The location is an adjoining plot near Maddox square , interiors done colourful and vibrant with cute quotations on pictures frames hanging on brick exposed walls , huge selection of board games , an array of handmade goodies snacks and bakeries one can pick up for home, a karaoke set up and great selection of music played giving a positive vibe all along we stayed.The outside set up has a couple of tables, also a table soccer. Each table holds a table number along a placard giving a perosonalized description of the special server alloted for the table. We met Saloni and Prakkriti , perhaps the loveliest beings on the planet serving with bright smiles and taking good care of us throughout.

Things we tried :

BBQ SPICY CHICKEN POPPERS - beautifully presented in a S -pattern cutlery , eight pieces of crunchy coated single bite sized chicken topped with a sweet and sour dip. Loved it .

HUG IN A MUG - Hot chocolate in a big mug topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips. Quantitatively huge , but i prefer having pure chocolate rathen than mixed with cream as done here. Nonetheless i liked having it.

BERRY BASIL SODA INFUSION - nice one again as my
friend seemed to like it.

SPICY CHICKEN PICKLED JALAPENO PIZZA - i can give a full mark to this if only judged taste wise , but quantitatively pretty disheartening to find 4 bite sized pizza given in two portions.

GRILLED CHICKEN TIKKA SANDWICH - decent ones resembling homemade sandwiches , served with chips and ketchup.

A 4 out of 5 comes for the food and an extra .5 goes to those lovely individuals making the difference . All the best for the special concept that this cafe has come up with , will definitely recommend and visit again :)

I have bookmarked this cafe for a few days and finally managed to visit the place today. The speciality of this cafe is that this place is run by a group of special adults.
Location : This place is located at a convenient place near Maddox square just beside Cafe Mezzaluna.
Ambiance : The ambiance is very beautiful. Decoration is awesome. Cleanliness is the key factor of this place. Everything is perfectly organised. The lights, furniture, cutleries etc everything is just perfect.
Food : We had one nearbuy voucher. Our Today's Menu includes,
* STARTER : BBQ Spicy Chicken Poppers
* MAIN COURSE : Spicy Jalapeño Chicken Pizza
* MOCKTAILS : 1. Green Apple
2. Ami Tomake Valobasi Cold Coffee
Firstly they served the Chicken Poppers. 8 pieces of crunchy Chicken Poppers were served along with a sauce dip. It tasted quite good. The Poppers have perfect crispness and it tasted pretty awesome. Next they served the pizza but we were quite disappointed to see it's very less quantity. The pizza they served was very small in size though it tasted very good. We would be glad if they served in greater quantity. Coming to the mocktails Green Apple soda tasted very good. Cold coffee was a thicker drink and very refreshing.
Service : Their service was very prompt. The staffs were very friendly.
Overall a very nice place. Prices are on higher side and they also charge GST. You can give it a try if you are a cafe lover like me.

NOTE(imp) : The prices given in Zomato are probably the old ones.This place has INCREASED PRICES + charge GST on it.It would come to around Rs.800 FOR TWO !!
A wonderful place,soothing ambience with slow tracks being part of their music & simple yet appealing decor.The furniture is very comfortable & colourful adding to it's beauty.
Loved the fact that a special child greeted as well as served us. :D
Now coming to the food. We ordered the following -

Fettucci Alfredo - Was okayish.Not much to talk about cause probably it was way too simple.Also quantity was slightly less. (4/5)

Super Crisp Roman Pizza(non-veg) - Was very different from the normal pizza.Very small, triangular shaped slices with decent amount of cheese & meat toppings on it.Liked it.(4.5/5)

Italian Herb Chill Cheese Toast - Again an okayish dish.Extremely good presentation but the taste can definitely improve.(4/5)

French Fries(spicy) - Beautiful presentation, very tasty & quite a lot in terms of quantity.Give it a try !! (5/5)

Green Apple Soda - Tasty,refreshing (4/5)

Mint & Lemon Soda - Pretty decent(4/5)

Overall, it's a cheerful place. Board games are really good.Atmosphere just about perfect for a casual outing with friends.But,yes, the food as well as it's QUANTITY need an UPGRADE ,specially when it's just small things which need touch-ups.Just that, and you'll go a long way !! :) :D

Cafe ICanFlyy is a cafe managed by special needs adults. It is the brainchild of Miss. Preeyam and her mum! Kudos to them for such wonderful initiative they have that is able the unable!

Location: The cafe was just opposite maddox square which is a go-to place for all college students! The cafe can be easily located.

Ambience: I loved the lighting of the place because i dont like cafes having dim lights. The cafe was bright, vibrant and had positive vibes. The decor was quirky with fancy chairs, sofa, pinned messages on the wall and beautiful wall hangings. It was picture perfect. They have a corner where they showcase their in-house products which is for sale. Also there is a foosball table, board games, dart etc. Its a kids friendly place!
Food: Coming to the most interesting first. I was surprised to see the price of each dishes! It is so cheap and affordable. But that don't hamper the quantity or the flavours! All the food we tried were beyond delicious! Death by chocolate,Chicken poppers,Balsamic mushroom pizza ,Spicy chicken jalapeno,Berry and basil,Mint and lemon,Strawberry frappe,Classic frappe and Cheese tots. The food was fresh and mouth watering.

THIS IS MY CURRENT FAVOURITE CAFE AND I AM RECOMMENDING EVERYONE OF MY FRIENDS TO VISIT!

An amazing place to spend a gloomy Calcutta evening. 
Just opposite of Maddox square is easy to spot.

The ambience built by the cafés decor and the initiative that owner's have taken up fills it with the warmth it possesses. 

The food is value for money as well! 
And won't leave a huge hole in your pocket,
Will take a huge place in your heart though!

A place to revisit again.

The newly opened cafe right next to Maddox Square has recently been trending because of the idea itself. Managed by special need adults who are extremely friendly and very caring.
We visited in a group of four, apparently the first ones to enter.

Ambience- full marks to the ambience. They've decorated the cafe so well with interesting quotes pinned on the wall. The red bordered vintage walls are so cool. Around 7-8 tables provided with sofas and cushions. It has a section just for board games like Jenga, Uno, Monopoly. Pick any and have a good time.

Service- Saloni was there to help us. Very jolly and bubbly girl she was. The owners were there who took a special interest in each of the customers

Food- Food is pretty much pocket friendly and presentation is fab. The quantity could have been a bit more as per the price though but nevertheless,
We had: 1. Pickled Jalapeños Chicken Pizza.
2. Plain French Fries
3. Death by Chocolate Brownie.

Play as much of games as you wish and they definitely wouldn't tell you to move on fast. We personally had a great time and can vouch for the fact that others too will.

You name it - they have it! I loved the ambiance - you have an array of board games to choose from. Best bit being - you'll love interacting with the children, they are truly special.

It's really amazing to see such a heartwarming place tucked in a beautiful corner of ballygunj. Awesome ambience, lively decor and serviced by those charming special need children surely makes this place something special n probably the first such initiative in India.

Live shows and options of such a wide range of board games made our time spent truely amazing. Add to it those oh so cheesy Balsamic Mushroom cheese pizza and BBQ spicy chicken poppers were just fantastic. The really funny named coffee choices 'ami tomake bhalobashi' and 'just fatafati' were also perfect add ons. 

Keep it up guys. Surely Will love to come back many more times....

I visited Cafe ICanFlyy on my last visit to Kolkata and my trip was all the better for it. The concept of employing special needs people is unique and brilliant. That, coupled with the delicious cold coffee and Roman cheese pizza, left a great taste in the mouth! The place has a very fun, colourful vibe about it without compromising on the quality of food or service. Our food came on time and everything we ordered was superb. 
Hope to see a Cafe ICanFlyy in my city really soon, and until that happens I will definitely be visiting this place when I'm in town next!

One of those places which makes you smile no matter how bad your day was. Me and my friend walked in here to catch up after a long time, the warmth of the team, the ambience, and the food served just made our meeting more so special. The kids are here are so soft spoken, well mannered and they are amazing chef to top it all, I in fact wanted to volunteer with them. Also they have a host of board games, so you and your squad should definitely try this out. One last thing, the lighting makes the entire space feel so warm, perfect for taking memorable pictures. Try the pancakes, we loved it.

Cafe I Can Flyy is a lovely new cafe that has opened beside Maddox Square. A bright cozy vibe and the most special thing that warms your heart is that the cafe empowers Special Needs People by employing them in the cafe. They serve you with a smile and definitely make your experience special.There are all the crowd favourites on the menu from pizza to pasta and sandwiches to eggs along with a great selection of hot and cold beverages. Go have your next adda there and soak in the vibe. They have lots of popular boardgames and special events every week.

Loved the ambience..
We had cold coffee and one of my friends had a Americano all were delivered on time..
And tbh the cold coffee was great and looked cute in those small bottles but I wished the quantity was a little bit more.
We had a great time.
Just a lil advise for people if you're in a hurry please don't go.. have ample amount of time.
Love the initiative.
I wish more Cafe's were like this.

The place stands out as different because you are greeted by special needs adults with warmth and innocent smiles. The decor is contemporary and reminded me of fairy tale characters due to the innovatively designed chairs. I ordered for a non veg pizza which was delicious and a choco frappe which was just perfect...neither too sweet nor too less. A noble cause combined with a cozy cafe is a rare find. Also, the USP of this place is the location which is right next to Maddox Square..

Good amount and good quality of food. Superb service by super-cute people. Different from every other nearby cafe for its ambience. Most recommended: Choco frappe, english mustard egg sandwich.

A random search on zomato got me the link to this cute little place. We were looking for a budget friendly place, and this café seemed to be just the thing. Located just beside Maddox Square, it's a small place, seats about 20 people, plus there is some outdoor seating. The owner and manager are two pretty ladies, and as they explained to me, the main objective of the place is to employ special needs young people, associated with the I Can Flyy institute. The decor is modern and warm. We ordered a berry soda, strawberry frappe and chicken poppers with BBQ sauce. We especially liked the soda and the chicken poppers. Since they opened very recently, they have been having a series of events including music, karaoke and stand up comedy. I'd suggest this cute place to my fellow zomatoans, do go check this place out. Sorry I forgot to take any photos.
