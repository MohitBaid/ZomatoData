This place used to very good then it first opened but now the quality of their food has really degraded. They used to serve rolls with mayonnaise, sweet mambo sauce and cheese garlic, but now just with mayonnaise. Really disappointed after the last visit; hopefully they can regain their past glory.

Food is good overall . Specially the dynamite roll , it is bulky and delicious and also the pan fried momo. Noodles is sometimes bland and would be better if we have choice of sauces and vegetables. Side dishes are good as well. delivery is prompt and person is polite. overall a nice experience.

This is a small takeaway counter located somewhere in a small bylane in Ballygunge, the food is served in plastic delivery containers and quality wise I would say this is good street food served in restaurant quality packaging. But when you look at the price point it is more than worth the money you pay. My go to place in Kolkata when I want to go for greasy oily junk Chinese food. Best to stay away from non veg dishes bcoz the quality of chicken is not upto mark. Very good for veg.

Never been to the restaurant but I have ordered from zomato way too many times. At first, the delivery was a bit slow but after the 2nd delivery, they started to be at my doorstep about 20 minutes before the estimated time. 
The chowmein is the best. It is cheap and has really good quantity. I always order whenever I am too lazy to cook xD

Verry below average food 
Chicken mono-was cold and rock solid 

Veg noodle-had verry less to none vegetables and no salt or any flavour

Veg rice-verry same as the noodle no vegetables and less to none flavour 

Chilli chicken- it was nice had big proper pieces of chicken not chicken pakora but proper chicken pieces which I liked and a nice amount of gravy was also there
 
Overall one time eat 
After that the 2nd time I ate here there was human hair in the egg chicken noodles which I also showed to the people  working there

Don't know why this place have not so good ratings but my first experience was quite good.. I ordered Egg Chicken Chow online, it was tasty full of egg & Chicken.. It was made little bit spicy as I had told them to do so, though the chow is little bit on the thicker side but nothing much to complain about. Also the quantity is great, looking forward to try out some other dishes.

I am unsure why this placed has failed to receive higher compliments and better reviews and rating so far, but I had a very pleasant experience with them. I ordered from them despite the average rating because of a pocket crunch but was quite apprehensive of what I was about to be delivered. My fear was allayed by their food and their service. The confirmation and delivery was prompt in spite of a rainy day.Both the paneer chowmein and egg fried rice had a good proportion, and a delectable taste. However, their noodles are not the best variety and are thicker and coarser than most places, which many might dislike. The fried rice however carried a simple but nice aroma of capsicum. The chilly paneer was loverly, it had  a distinct tanginess and  lot of bell pepper, and was the only item that didn't come too economical. The rolls are very reasonably priced- I ordered veg roll and egg roll, which costs 19 bucks only!!. However, instead of a stymied diet kathi roll, they make very fulfilling lacha paratha rolls at that price and maintain a good proportion with the filling and sauce combination. I will surely try out  other items.

Ordered their Combo Meal which consisted of 2*egg hakka noddles ,hot garlic chicken ,chilli chicken and a thumps up (600 ml) .
Packaging :
5/5 .The containers ,the forks and tissue papers -looked quite impressive
Food :4/5

Noodles : well cooked not much oily with ample vegetables....had the smoky smell ..tasted good also
Garlic chicken and Chilli chicken : both the gravies deserve a special mention .They were heavenly
The boneless chicken pieces though a bit not so soft but along with the gravy and noodles tasted good

Quantity : sumptous for 3-4 people .

Pinch on the pocket : extremely reasonable

Overall , could suffice my hunger real well . Will surely order again .

Just one thing the delivery speed needs to be a bit SPEEDY as well .

It's a extremely small joint delivering in a bigger radius. If you are looking for a full course meal, this is not your place to be. But if you are looking for quick bites this the best place to order from.
There are one of the best counter tops serving rolls in the city.
The rolls come with an option of two sauces.
Must Try their rolls, they are flavourful and cheaper than most of the rolls joints in the city.

This is a very small joint, located in the lane beside tasty corner. I ordered chilli chicken, chicken steam momos, chicken fried rice and egg chowmein. The food was decent except for the momos. 6 pieces in one plate along with the broth soup, but they were chewy and tasteless. The delivery was prompt. They didn't charge us for the containers. I would like to try their rolls someday after reading the reviews. But chances are might not order proper meal.

This place is new and it delivers more dishes than it even mentions in its menu which is weird and hilarious, but the taste of the food is just out of the world. The chicken roll had great filling and was neither dry nor too oily. It was not unusually saucy either. The pan fried momos had a very unique taste to it. It was charred and in a good way. The spices are well cooked and complemented the momos which had a handsome filling.

On looking at it first, it'll come across as a normal newly open take away joint but it will amaze you with the taste that you'll  crave for! Good going n good luck speedy.
Really wish that you'll  keep serving us the good food and will not let go of your unique taste and standards. 
Must taste "dynamite"
