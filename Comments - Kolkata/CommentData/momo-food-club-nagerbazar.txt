It was the first place i ever had momo...Steamed momo that is.. which was some 9 - 10 yrs back with a friend who has now become a jewel in my life.. Since then the place hasn't changed much, only the price has gone a bit up and the quality has gone down...I went there last year during diwali..just for the sake of nostalgia... But was disappointed by the momo the serve now:
- It has decreased in size and quality
- And the bowl in which they serve looked dirty hav not visted it since.
It cud hav been an awesome place.. if they added a bit of innovation and improved there menu...as the location ia great..and its very easy to find..
9 yrs back they served real good momos but now the place has become very boring and their signature dish has lost its quality...

Momos!!! Well this shop has been in existent for a long time , but never had i ever found such a blatant crime of using a name and not delivering even pathetically close to their supposedly signature dish and then charging so much for it. Am just destroyed!!! Never paying a visit again.

I had dinner once sometime back and had understood that this was not good enough for second time visit. I agree that the price is not high but still the food is not at par with the resto just opposite to it which also is also not high priced. Anywaz, lets hope it improves and gives a competition to the nearby restos.

Ate once or twice when I was in school, didn't find it that attractive to give a second thought. The eating experience was aokhay I guess, it has been a long time, almost 8 years to be exact, had momos for certain.

Recently did the blunder of visiting this place which they call a restaurant for having momo. Truely disappointed with the quality and the prices are higher than Eiffel Tower. Zomato showing old rates . The momos nearby the Mall Road are much better than that of this food club . Don't dare to visit this place otherwise you will repent for doing that. Tibetan momo lover will definitely kill them or sue them for degrading their delicious dish . An oxymoron for the restaurant name given. Zomato should have negative rating option so that they can be atleast given the right ratings. 
Regards
A very disappointed Momo lover.

Considering the fact that it is a momo shop, I must say that they aren't doing a good job. The food tastes only okay-esque. It's also a tiny place. The price is very low though, which is a good thing.

Just another snacks corner near my residence,though the name speaks a lot about their expertise but the actual scenario is just the opposite. The momos here are just not worth the money..chicken momos are not available most of the times and when they are available they are mostly stuffed with veggies instead of chicken. Not very many available options you would find here. Once we were in a great hurry so we asked them which option they can prepare fast..they said momos. So we ordered that and they took a hell lot of time to serve it. When they knew they couldn't prepare that fast they at least shouldn't have given us their wrong words. But this place once did give us shelter from the storm when we hurriedly went inside and that was the first time i experienced their not-so-good momos. Therefore am giving it a 3. So okayish for once..not a place to be remembered and to be visited again.
