The small outlet at Forum Mall had prominent service and well maintained hygiene product. Glad with the pleasing service and the delish product.
Its menu has varieties of yummy shakes under the heads of classic milkshakes thick milkshakes and fruit milkshakes. It covered all the flavours under one head.
Specially the KitKat shake and butterscotch shake.. Every gulp was satisfying. üòç
Keventers don't just make shakes, they serve us with a pinch of heart warming sweetness with mouth watering sweet treat with some TWIST TO THE TASTE OF GOOD OLD MILK.
It was pocket friendly according to the quality served‚ò∫

The milk shakes of keventers are indeed good. They're thick, and tasty, but they're definitely priced on the higher side. On the occasion of Christmas the outlet is serving cute Christmas candy replica straws, with obviously the tasty shakes.

A bit over priced but tasted good. They let you take the bottles alongwith, with the nice quotes written on top of it. My favorite is butterscotch. Do try the other ones too.

Ordered classic mango milkshake and alfonso mango milkshake.Both tasted equally good,light yet filling.Lovely experience.And the glass bottles can be preserved for resusage at home.Avoiding plastic seemed a good effort.Will go for tasting more flavours

Ordered:

1. Mint oreo crumble-
 This is probably the only thick shake that did not live up to my expectations.. the combination of oreo and mint in a milkshake didn't not quite work for me..or maybe the oreo was way too crushed..nvm

2. Tutti frutti 
Anyone who doesn't have fondness for flavours other than chocolate must try it, I'm sure they will fall in love with this shake. It is so fulfilling.üòçüòã

‚úîThe presentation is spot on with those glass bottles and feel good quotes.
‚úîPrices are bit on the higher side.

Keventers literally made me fall in love with  milkshakes.. 
Revisiting for sure‚ò∫

So today arround 10 i visited elgin forum mall as me n nmy frbds decided to watch movie at inox
Unfortunately i was the earliest one to reach there among my friends as 1hour was remain for the show to start 
I was feeling very thirsty none of the shops were open at that time except keventers 
I have never tasted there milkshake but heard a lot about there milkshake so i tried there milk shak for fulfilling my thirst i ordered butter scotch milkshake with gst they charged 116
They take 2min to serve the milkshake man it was reallyv tasty n creamy

Have been to its Delhi counterpart so many times, wanted to try it out in my city as well.
This outlet in Forum Mall however was a disappointment, both in terms of the food item and ambience.
**No proper sitting arrangements. Had to move to the food court to sit.
** No staff courtesy. They fool around even seeing the customers line up.
** Had a caramel thick shake and a cold coffee. The caramel thick shake wasn't in its good shape. Felt flat & too sugary after gulping down half the bottle. Wasn't really thick either. Cold coffee was fair though, like always. 

**The Management needs to take care of these things seriously.

I was in the neighbourhood therefore to escape the scorching heat of the sun in the afternoon and to feast on some drink, I hopped intto the elevator, in forum mall to the Keventers outlet situated in the 4th Floor.

Tried 3 shakes namely,
1. Peanut Butter
2. Mint oreo crumble
3. Hazelnut

Peanut Butter is my personal favourite. Had just the right amount of saltiness for your taste buds against the sweetness which the shake provides. An absolute delight.

Mint Oreo Crumble was like any other average Oreo shake mixed with milk and served in a glass bottle. Nothing grand about it. Meh.

Hazelnut shake didn't feel like it. I couldn't really make out the distinct flavour of Hazel nut. Wouldn't recommend this shake.

For a Final Verdict, I'd neither side with the common mass of people who unnecessarily hypes it nor would I be a part of that pseudo elitist foodie clan who disparages it. There are some shakes which are very great and then there are some, which aren't.
All in all, it is okayish.
The price might be a little on the higher side, but the legendary bottles which reek R o y a l t y and has quirky captions written in white and inked over black makes up for it.

We ordered the mint Oreo crumble shake. All their shakes come in cute glass bottles and the packaging is sure to make you happy!
Coming to the taste, I loved it! It had a distinct mint flavour to it and I'm a huge fan of mint and chocolate flavours working together! The Oreo crumbles only enhanced the taste.
Pocket pinch- 125 for small bottles and 200 for large.
I would love to visit again to try all the other varieties they have to offer and the best part is you even get to keep the cute bottle!!

Tried the choco peanut butter. It was pretty good. The taste of the peanut butter was more evident than the chocolate but nonetheless it was good.

Editting review after trying two more flavours. The chocolate oreo shake and the cold coffee shake with chocolate syrup. As usual, they taste great. On a hot day or after a meal, take it home or have it on the way,  just so convenient, and a great, healthy alternative in comparison to your regular cold drinks.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I've tried out the Choco Chip, Kit-Kat, Chocolate Oreo and Chocolate Hazlenut. All of them were absolutely delicious but I must say that the Choco-chip is my personal favorite.

FINAL VERDICT- All in all I would definitely recommend this place to all, you won't be disappointed.

I'm not much into shakes. I heard about this place from my cousin, and she took me to Forum mall's Keventers. Apparently, she's a big fan.
The first thing I noticed there was the shape of the bottle, which was identical to and reminded me of the milk bottles shown in 'Tom and Jerry'. :D
And the lids come with cheesy quotes written on them.
The shakes were quite good. Do check it out if you're into milkshakes.

We tried Chocolate Oreo Milkshake and Chocolate Hazelnut Shake. Chocolate Oreo Milkshake did taste heavenly but Chocolate Hazelnut Shake wasn't thick and as good as the Oreo Shake. The staff could have been a little more courteous. Also, we had to repeat our order thrice. Overall it was good and the takeaway bottles along with the quirky one-liners on the bottles' caps are definitely worth it!!

As I'm a loyal 'Butterscotch' fan I opted for that one only. My friend went for the 'Oreo' one and another friend went for the 'Kit Kat'. Personally I liked the Kit Kat much better than the Oreo. If you wanna opt for Oreo go for the 'Mint Oreo Crumble'. Whatever maybe the shake name, Keventers never disappoints.

Keventers - Over hyped. 
=====
Location & Intro:

Keventers is located on the fourth floor of Forum Mall. This is the floor where people purchase tickets for the movies for Inox Mall.¬†

The outlet of Keventers out here is quite small. I had gone there alone. I had been hearing a lot about keventers hype and somehow went on trying their shakes. I am not a chocolate person so i went on ordering on their bubble gum shake. 
=====
What i had:

‚Ä¢ Bubble Gum Shake - It was overtly sweet and nothing very extra ordinary. I somehow found it very expensive for the price they charge. The milk part in the shake was overlapping the bubblegum. However, some of my money got recovered when i took that bottle back home. Haha. The bottle is kinda cute but i am not paying so much money for just a cute bottle. 
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Just an established brand name for shakes. 

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Expensive.  

‚Ä¢ Does not serve extraordinary shakes. 
===== 
Shakes for two: 400-700 approximate. Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.
=====
Conclusion:

I somehow did not like the shake here. Hopefully, i will try their other shakes sometime soon. 
=====
Disclaimer: Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

Finally crossed off Keventer's from my bucket list. I visited this outlet in Forum, Elgin Road, some days ago. I ordered a KitKat shake and my friend ordered a Chocolate Hazelnut shake. Both were delicious, thick and creamy; just how I like it. I am extremely happy and satisfied with my orders. I will definitely go back soon to try out the other flavours.
PS. You are also allowed to keep your bottle.

Amazing milk shake served in an actual milk bottle. They have a great variety of milk shakes, available in 3 different categories and 2 different size of bottles. The bottles may remind you of old Disney cartoons, where these bottles have been used very often. The price range also very reasonable. So , if you like milk and like them as flavoured & shaken, do visit any of there 9 outlets in the city.

Undoubtedly the most flavoursome milkshakes in town. I went for the basic butterscotch and raspberry milkshakes. It was a simple delicious drink. The price is okay compared to the taste and packaging. Its a must try especially for the elegant branding strategy of the company. You get to keep this pretty bottles.

I had ordered Alphonso Mango Milk Shake, but taste is very ordinary and milk quality is like tonned milk of mother dairy or Amul. Nothings special in Milk Shake. You will get far better Milk Shake in some renowned Sweet shop like Haldiram or Tiwari in much lower cost.

Keventer's caught my attention owing to the number of outlets popping across the city and the spectacular branding of the product which has been around almost for a century!

- Butterscotch shake was thick, creamy,smooth and delicious.
-I was a fool to try the Oreo shake,wasn't different from any other place's
- Bubblegum shake was a little less thick compared to the above two,and the taste was just decent enough for me to finish without having the taste to sink in.

It's a delight to have shakes from the celebrated brand of Keventer's. The shakes are good. The bubblegum is perhaps their best collection which is just phenomenal. Chocolate Hazelnut is also another recommended milkshake out there. For Alfonso, they just add some artificial flavours which doesn't taste good. The Oreo milkshake is just average.The outlet at Forum Mall is not much different from others.
The price tag with which it comes mostly pertains to the brand value than that of the actual cost.

Keventers is located at the 4th floor of Forum mall with common sitting space.. According to me it's lil over priced but after having what they serve over here you will forget about the price and will indulge yourself in their mouth watering shakes.. I have only tasted the choco oreo shake over here and after having that I can guarantee u about the rest of the shakes will also be delicious.. Must try..

One of the best in town beverage shops. Their shakes and smoothies are to die for and tastewise they are perfect. Well I have been to Keventers outlet a number of times and to douse one's insatiable thirst one must visit this place atleast once(and then you will be coming back over and over!) 
I usually have their chocolate and strawberry shakes which come in cute little bottles. Creating wonders with bottles full of surprise and awesome taste this chain of beverage shop surely deserves special mention. Hope to visit anytime soon.

If u want to spend 200+taxes for a bottle of amul taaza and and amul ice creme shake served in a glass bottle you are in the right place :P 
Butterscotch milkshake was just butterscotch ice creme and milk with no added crunch of the real butterscotch kernicles in it and same goes for blueberry shake which was there supposite premium milkshake.
Such a shame!

I had one raspberry milk shake. It's good. But not as expected..only because of the high price, which is not worth full at all . Why should we spend 250 rs in a normal milkshake which can we easily make at home ?? I bought this shake from avani riverside mall and  I noticed that it is made with only half cup of milk,one or one and a half scoop vanilla ice cream and some raspberry flavoured crush . That's it. I am not spending a peny again for this normal milk shake. If I want to have some i'll definitely go for Paramount.

Today (01/04/17) when we went to order a milk shake and requested them to show us the milk they are using , they refused to show us the brand of the milk . Keventers has definitely changed their Milk since they have opened . Pls be cautious in drinking Keventers Milk Shake . Aditya Almal .

Keventers is one of the best brands that produces some delicious milkshakes. On my visit to Tastes of India, i had mint oreo milkshake. Thickness was great. The taste great. It was smooth and delicious. The milkshake was very much oreo-y no doubt but there was lack of mint in it. On the whole it fekt like oreo milkshake rather than milk oreo. The flavours of the oreo were dominating. Apart from that, everything is good about milkshakes of keventers.

"When life gives you milk shake it". That's what our milk shake told us when got it. But it didn't needed any extra shake to it though. We ordered one chocolate hazelnut large. It was so beautiful that I can't even describe it in here. We took our milk shake and went to the rooftop, the beautiful breezy evening went very well with the shake. I highly recommend this place.

Don't like milk? Have the Chocolate Oreo Shake at Keventers and I can assure that you will love milk after that. I am thankful that this milkshake store has finally come to Kolkata. It has thick shakes and other lighter shakes like fruit shakes. The thick and hard shakes include Oreo, hazzlenut, caramel etc. Each and every kind of milkshake and other kinds of shakes are amazing. You would not want it to get over. I have tasted almost all the thick shakes and I simply love them. They serve in glass bottles and also let you take it home. You can collect these bottles and show your creativity as well. 
The quality and presentation is really good. The service is good enough. This is the best place to have shakes.

To be honest, I found this place to be a tad bit overhyped. They have a variety of shakes on the menu and not all of them aren't always available; I ordered a blueberry shake and they didn't have that. Then I got a melting rose shake which was not too bad but wasn't anything great either. The best thing about the shake was probably how cold it was. Overall, if you really want to spend good money on an average milkshake, this is the place.

Keventers was once an immensely famous dairy brand in India, which had a successful run for many decades before it got lost in the mists of time! Its foundations were laid in 1925 when Edward Keventer, a Swedish dairy technologist set up his eponymous dairy factory in India. Eventually, he went on to establish several units in different parts of the country, including Calcutta, Darjeeling, Delhi, et al.

Current time it came back with a bang by opening it's cute little outlet in forum next to krazy for chocolates.
It is one of a kind type of an outlet which deals only with Milkshakes. I ordered a variety of milkshakes and every one of them were brilliant in its own way. 
Mint oreo crumble was the one which stood out.

It is a wonderful addition to the city of joy where people can actually enjoy on some original milkshakes. Kudos team keventers!üëå

I have had the milkshakes from Keventers in Darjeeling and am so glad it has opened its outlet in the city. This one is in Forum Mall, on the 4th floor, in a small shop. But the chilled milkshakes are as good as they can get. They serve you these delicacies in a cute bottle, which you can take back even if you want. The prices are decent for the taste, and the flavours will take you back here time and again. My personal favourites are the Chocolate Hazelnut and Caramello, especially the later.

Keventers Elgin Road has the most horrible staff possible. They are possibly as bad as they come. I walked in to buy a couple of milkshakes at 10:00pm only to be turned away by Sanjit who claimed that they shut shop at 10:00pm. I can recall buying a couple of milkshakes two weeks ago which was billed around 10:45pm. What is even more shocking is that the store manager names Nasim came in and said that they shut shop at 10:30pm. Another Version coming from them was that the time was recently changed for which they had no circular or sign board to show for.

For a brand like Keventers, they should hire better staff who put the interests of the brand forward first instead of rushing to go home.

Between,Keventers is always shut on Swiggy. Don't know if I'm the only one coincidently find it shut when I need it or others have faced this problem too.

After a friend pointed out Barfi scenes were filmed at the Darjeeling location I was excited to try it in Kolkata. I ordered the rose flavor and my friend got the mint chocolate chip, hers was better but I like rose because it's subtly sweet. I like that you get to keep the bottles because the logo is so aesthetically pleasing. I'd like to come back to try the other flavors as well. They only accept cash and we were short by a buck and the cashier let it go which was nice

Quaint little shop tucked in a corner of forum mall food court..this one is unique in a sense that it allows u to take home the shakes and crushes in beautiful bottles reminiscent of our childhood haringhata milkbooths...the shakes and crushes are fresh and good too...so it is a double whammy...the glass bottles can be used for serving water...

Keventers Elgin Road has the most horrible staff possible. They are possibly as bad as they come. I walked in to buy a couple of milkshakes at 10:00pm only to be turned away by Sanjit who claimed that they shut shop at 10:00pm. I can recall buying a couple of milkshakes two weeks ago which was billed around 10:45pm. What is even more shocking is that the store manager names Nasim came in and said that they shut shop at 10:30pm. Another Version coming from them was that the time was recently changed for which they had no circular or sign board to show for.

For a brand like Keventers, they should hire better staff who put the interests of the brand forward first instead of rushing to go home.

Between,Keventers is always shut on Swiggy. Don't know if I'm the only one coincidently find it shut when I need it or others have faced this problem too.

After hearing rave reviews about this place, I wanted to try one of their shakes and since I visit Forum very often, I pounced at the chance. They have a wide range of shakes on offer, and shake aficionados like me would dig this place. The KitKat shake I had was thick, cold and really tasty. Service is quick and you can take those beautiful bottles home.

Having a sweet tooth, I'm a huge fan of milkshakes and smoothies!

Keventers!
I'm so highly impressed with their shake that I have tried today for the first time.
I wanted to try the Chocolate Hazelnut milkshake but for my friend, who doesn't like chocolate (yes, he's an alien from Andromeda Galaxy), we got a Bubblegum flavoured one. Thick, slurpy.. perfect milkshake it was! JUST AWESOME! Perfect balance of sweetness, that mild flavour of bubblegum that lingers in your mouth after you gulp down the first sip!
Trust me, I'm a fan!

The shakes are made on the spot and served in pretty little glass bottles.Service is quick and options are galore.The best part, you ask? Well, they do let you take those pretty bottles home! If that doesn't excite you to go visit them, well, then do wake up your inner child and pay them a visit.Soon!

Never been too fond of milkshakes. But this blew my mind, quite literally. Loved it to the core. üòç
Kitkat shake which I generally find bland elsewhere, was really amazing here, served in those ultra cute bottles for just Rs 150. Must try! 
They've opened a new outlet in kasba, hence I can indulge in more of these now. üòÅ

Well I'm not a milkshake fan but this outlet has been creating a buzz since it came to the city,so one fine day when we came out of the TGI Friday's my friend forced me to try the milkshake,so we ordered one classic butterscotch shake.frst of all I like the decor,the way the outlet looks is charmong,those glass bottles,organised proportionately,overall making it look good.

Now came the ordered shake,so it was good,frothy and sublime in taste,nicely giving the flavour!!!

Let's say hi! to this legendary.no. legen'dairy' Delhi based milk shake world here in city of joy!
Finally my long-days wait came to an end. 
This is a small kiosk of KEVENTERS  on the fourth floor of forum mall. The space is quite short but its well organised. Quiet ambience. Well organised small outlet. 
Now coming to their shakes. The shakes tasted divine. The butterscotch shake was Delius. It is a delight for the dessert lovers. It was thick frothy with proper amount of butterscotch flavour in it. 
And The Chocchip Shakes was..... Nope. You have to taste it to know how tastes!  It was delius, divine,a proper gourmet thing with rich, thick shake with bits of Chocchip in between which you have to chew before gulping. 
And the best part! The shakes comes in glass bottles with the name Keventers printed on it. AND. You can carry them back home! üòäüòä

Keventers has an outlet near my house in Delhi but I never had the opportunity to try it out, so I was super excited that they were coming to Kolkata.

I tried out the Tutti Fruity flavour and the milkshake tasted heavenly. You can taste the rich ice cream and the flavouring in every sip.

I had expected the price to be high but the total bill inclusive of tax wasn't very high. Plus they let you keep the bottleüòä

Will be back soon!

Pretty good staff and the taste is authentic to the original one. Great stuff, strongly suggest to try it if you are in or around Forum mall.

Finally after a lot of being patient I managed to visit the kiosk on the top floor of forum mall. The menu got me so perplexed about what to order because I found so many of them tempting. But since we were only two people , I got to taste just 2 flavours. 

We ordered a Chocolate Hazelnut Shake and a Mint Oreo Crumble, from the category of thick shakes .

The former was a smooth, ferrero rocher  tasting shake. It was more on the sweeter side. But chocolate lovers will drool over it :D I did.

The other one was revitalizing to our taste buds . Minty and chocolaty balanced blend having a bite to it (because of the oreo crumbles) it was a perfect pick. Loved every sip of it. 
You just gulp up one of the small shakes and I'm sure you'll be done with hunger for a lot of time üòå 

Since it is in the food court of forum mall, there is no such ambience separately to talk about. 
Go visit, and choose your flavour. 
I'm going again soon !!

Keventers is as iconic as it gets. Delhi was where I tasted proper milkshake for the first time, and Delhi was where I tasted it last. I realise Keventers has been open for a quite some time now, and I figured it was only right to pop in and see if nostalgia could hit as hard as it does.

This is a small shop inside forum and they don't provide much seating. But considering it's only milkshake, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is how well it's crafted and presented. The shakes are gorgeous and the bottles are everything you'd grow up imagining. The Oreo shake is probably among the better shakes here (I've only had 4).

I felt a little like Vincent Vega sitting in the diner, sipping on a $5 milkshake. But honestly so, that was a damn good drink.

Back for more whenever I'm nearby!

There should be a new addition to the dictionary, 'keventers' n. A place that turns someone who hates the flavor strawberry so much such that she feels pukish even when it smells like strawberries into someone who absolutely adores their strawberry thick shake. Been here a couple of times and it makes my stomach toggle. The choco hazelnut shake is AMAZING (not being too liberal with the word) The way they have put up about their origins gives a different perspective to their customers. And ofcourse the bottles! Who can forget the charm of the bottles.

Oh my god! Offering a variety of milkshakes from fruity flavours to classic flavours like chocolate mint or chocolate hazelnut this is the place to grab your milkshakes from. Whats a plus? You can take home the nice glasses. The quantity are of two types one is the smaller one which is priced 125 and the larger one for 200. The larger one is the one if u want to fill up your appetite completely.
Personal favourite chocolate hazulnut. Though i would surely recommend all the fruit flavours   Thumbs up!

This outlet is located in front of the Inox theater in Forum mall.
They serve yummilicious shakes to satisfy the foodies in town!
Visited on a weekday evening and even then the counter was a bit crowded (which is of course a good sign!)
We ordered "mint oreo" and "tutti fruity" shakes in small bottles.¬†
Both tasted heavenly, with ice cream and milk as its base.
The mint oreo flavor was a little less sweet and absolutely suited my palette. The other one was a bit more on the sweeter side but taste wise it was also great.
These are served in cute small glass bottles which the customer can take back home (it is actually a collectible, and I am planning to get some more!!) :D
Coming to the price, it costed us 301 INR for two shakes, which is a little high but after drinking the shakes we were happy to shell out that amount, worth it actually!
I am surely gonna visit this outlet shortly.

The staff was friendly and cooperative. They have the best milkshakes in town so do try it out !

Keventers is back to Kolkata after many years. It's located on the 4 th floor of Forum mall, Elgin Road. Had heard a lot about Keventers shakes from my dad. They were regulars at the previous outlet and were great fans.
They offer a limited variety of shakes each of which are distinct and yummilicious in taste.

They give the shakes in two size variants on reusable transparent glass bottles.  
We ordered :
The chocolate hazelnut
Melting roses
Butterscotch variants

The shakes were thick and creamy. The large one can be a bit too much for one person alone.

The melting roses was exquisite. Something that is a must try for all. The flavour is beautiful and refreshing.

Butterscotch is a dessert lovers delight. Creamy lemon coloured goodness in every sip.

The chocolate hazelnut was chocolatey with a distinct flavour of Hazelnut.

The prices are worth the taste plus the reusable glass bottles. Will try new flavours on my next visit.

The legendary shakes brand comes to town and houses itself on the 4th floor of the Forum mall. The shakes are best had within 4 to 5 hours of bottling.Well we didn't need to keep it for that long and gulped down the mango thick shake in minutes. The cold coffee with sugar free was good and we simply loved the cute bottles they serve in. The speciality ones like Oreo are heavy and almost good enough to replace a meal. A Keventers chilled  bottle of your choice and a book would be perfect for a weekend laze

The much reverred¬†milkshake brand of Delhi is now in Kolkata, now serving some really cool shakes at the fourth floor of Forum Mall, Elgin Road. Came here yesterday after lunch with my friend Shahbaaz Zaman¬†and tried two of their varieties. We had taken the Butterscotch and Strawberry shakes.¬†
Served in cute glass bottles with Keventer's printed on it, it was a visual delight to the eyes. The butterscotch was very good, thick and frothy wit proper flavours of butterscotch in it. Strawberry shake was also good. I liked the first one better as it was thicker. Next time, I am gonna come back to try the other flavours also. Happy Dining! :)

The staff was friendly and cooperative. They have the best milkshakes in town so do try it out !

Keventers is back to Kolkata after many years. It's located on the 4 th floor of Forum mall, Elgin Road. Had heard a lot about Keventers shakes from my dad. They were regulars at the previous outlet and were great fans.
They offer a limited variety of shakes each of which are distinct and yummilicious in taste.

They give the shakes in two size variants on reusable transparent glass bottles.  
We ordered :
The chocolate hazelnut
Melting roses
Butterscotch variants

The shakes were thick and creamy. The large one can be a bit too much for one person alone.

The melting roses was exquisite. Something that is a must try for all. The flavour is beautiful and refreshing.

Butterscotch is a dessert lovers delight. Creamy lemon coloured goodness in every sip.

The chocolate hazelnut was chocolatey with a distinct flavour of Hazelnut.

The prices are worth the taste plus the reusable glass bottles. Will try new flavours on my next visit.

The legendary shakes brand comes to town and houses itself on the 4th floor of the Forum mall. The shakes are best had within 4 to 5 hours of bottling.Well we didn't need to keep it for that long and gulped down the mango thick shake in minutes. The cold coffee with sugar free was good and we simply loved the cute bottles they serve in. The speciality ones like Oreo are heavy and almost good enough to replace a meal. A Keventers chilled  bottle of your choice and a book would be perfect for a weekend laze

The much reverred¬†milkshake brand of Delhi is now in Kolkata, now serving some really cool shakes at the fourth floor of Forum Mall, Elgin Road. Came here yesterday after lunch with my friend Shahbaaz Zaman¬†and tried two of their varieties. We had taken the Butterscotch and Strawberry shakes.¬†
Served in cute glass bottles with Keventer's printed on it, it was a visual delight to the eyes. The butterscotch was very good, thick and frothy wit proper flavours of butterscotch in it. Strawberry shake was also good. I liked the first one better as it was thicker. Next time, I am gonna come back to try the other flavours also. Happy Dining! :)

Keventers, newly opened at forum mall serves pretty good milkshakes. We ordered melting rose, chocolate oreo and butterscotch. All were very good. But it's important to consume it right away or maximum within an hour because after an hour when we had the butterscotch it had lost it's thickness and the froth.

Nice place!! 
They are famous for there milkshakes which are obnoxiously expensive like Rs 125 for 250 ml.
They are focusing more on selling there glass bottle rather then there drinks .
Took a caramelo and a choco hazelnut and both were tasting the same . And all the drinks are tax exclusive.

A speciality milkshake place, right next to Wow momo in Forum mall. We ordered for a Cold coffee and Chocolate hazelnut shake. Both seemed just perfect. The cold coffee was just the right amount of sweet I lile - so I loved it more. But all in all both shakes were very delicious. I am definitely going back to this place again and again.

Finally went to the hyped keventers outlet. Tried the butter scotch one, it was a normal decent shake, well presented, a bit over priced, nothing extra as of the hype it has created, though I would have loved it being thicker. 
Will try other flavours and the thick shake the next time and hope I find it better. Will love if small portions as mentioned is made available.

I had first visited this place in Delhi, so was really excited to visit the kolkata outlet. We ordered a KITKAT shake and it was really good but the price was little on a HIGHER side. Also the menu on Zomato shows small serving option but that was not available at the outlet, and this was disappointing. Hope the above two changes are incorporated so that i can plan my next visit....

Loved this place. And would love to visit again.
The mint Oreo crumble was good. It's thick and heavy. I would have loved it more if the mint taste would be more on the subtle side.
The cold coffee was well, not much cold. Some disappointment there.
As this shakes are quite heavy, I would have liked smaller bottles but in the menu it wasn't mentioned that small ones are available. And yes, they let you take away these bottles.
They served us our order pretty fast. But yeah with all the taxes and shit, these are a tad bit overpriced.
Nevertheless, gonna try them again asap.

I have been here twice and had very different experiences. 
First time I had thick shakes, mint Oreo crumble and tutti-frutti. The thick shakes aren't very thick,  Mint Oreo crumble is good but for me tutti-frutti was the winner ! If like me you love strawberry milkshakes do try tutti-frutti, it's strawberry based with some crushed tutti-frutti cherries . It's strawberry milkshake with a twist. My first experience was pretty decent and it compelled me to visit the next time.

When I went for the second time, I tried classic shakes. I had mongo classic milkshake. It was really bad , it wasn't tasting like mango at all. May be it was because it was over-crowded that day or whatever the reason being but it was way below the mark. For me classis milkshakes are a big No. Hopefully they'll be well equipped to manage the crowd in a better fashion next time and not compromise with the taste.

Keventers, welcome you to a world of milkshakes. They offer the best in chilled beverages, with a range of varieties in their menu starting from Melting Rose's and ending at Chocolate Oreo.

 I had ordered their Butterscotch Classic Shakes. While I expected the shake to be thick and creamy, I was disappointed to find the drink to be less heavy and more watery. The essence of butterscotch was not as strong as I personally would want it to be. 

But on the brighter side, the service here is fast even when it is crowded. It is eco friendly as they deliver to you milkshakes in glass bottles and not plastic ones. The staff team is warm and friendly.

Finally tried the Oreo mint shake and Caramelo as it was highly recommended by the reviews on Zomato.. 
Oreo mint was something new,mild mint flavour with oreo crumbles in my mouth.4/5 for this.üòÄ
Caramelo was suggested by them. But honestly didn't taste much of caramel. First two sips did taste like caramel but eventually the flavour faded and it almost tasted as if i was drinking milk with vanilla ice cream..2/5 for this.
One large bottle is too much for one person to drink at a go,they shouldn't have discarded the small bottles from the menu.

Roaming here and there in Forum mall trying to pass our 1hr time before we enter Inox was the time when we noticed this shop beside Wow momo. Never tasted before we thought to give it a try and ordered 3 butterscotch classic shakes. They provided us with hard glass bottles that could be taken home however we could not take it. The shake was ordinary butterscotch ice cream in liquid form inside a bottle without caramel. So try something different..

I didn't find anything special in their milkshakes. Yeah, no doubt they are very good. I like the butterscotch and the Oreo milkshakes. They allow you to take those cute retro style milk bottles. And yes it's 'overpriced' , I'm saying this because they're are just a counter with self service.

When we first heard about the best Milkshake makers finally coming down to Kolkata, we just had to try and see what makes them the best "original Milkshake makers". This is actually a major throwback post. We've been hooked on to their Milkshakes since they started operating here. The creamy consistency, perfect balance of sweetness and the amazing authentic flavors makes up for one of the heartiest and yummiest Milkshakes we've had in a long time. The Mint Oreo Shake and the Kit-Kat Shake tops our list. We are yet to try the fresh fruit shakes! We also tried the Caramel Shake and Butterscotch Shake, but we would suggest you to go for the other flavours as these two are almost similar to each other and lacks the experimental kick like the other flavors (or is it just us, always looking for excitement in everything we eat/drink?)üôà Also, do we really have to add their USP? (Hint: Those cute as a button bottles are your's) Okay, that wasn't really a hint.üòÇ

It feels so good that major food brands are opening up in kolkata nowadays one after the another. Among them keventers offer an unique brand of food category i.e. Shakes üòÅ.

This is situated just below the food court(beside wow momo). Few sittings are there for customers to sit & enjoy their food. A bad news i would like to give is that they have removed the smaller version of shakes which means that you have to spend on the larger ones üò¢.

So now coming to the shakes, I have had the following so far:-

1. Mint oreo- Thick shake consisting of oreos & mint ice cream. This is their speciality & rightly so stands up to its reputation. This shake offers an unique & distinct taste which would dazzle your tastebuds. Highly recommended!!

2. Mango shake- This is among their fruit section. Taste wise this was okay. Light & runny in texture. Gave a good hint of mango flavour.

3. Choco chip shake- Another chocolaty delicious affair among their thick shakes section. The choco chips were in abundance & felt so so refreshing due to its cold nature. Recommended!!

Their service is fast if no crowd rush is there(haven't faced such situation yet). The thick shakes would cost you 200+taxes while others would cost you 150+ taxes. One might feel the shakes are overpriced but to get premium things you have to throw in your penny üòâ

Is it love for food or the pleasure of spending money that makes you buy a milk-froth-shake for Rs240?¬†
Would you have gone there had they opened up behind Sealdah station? Will they be be able to justify the price and their percentage of profit?

I had been to this particular outlet yesterday after hearing a lot from ppl when I reached I saw that there was only a limited menu as compared to other keventers in India and more thing what I really appreciate is their marketing technique I wanted a small portion of the Choco hazelnut shake which I liked and my friend who had an Choco chip shake but as you approach to them they are like sir we are sorry but the small portions are out of stock so therefore 1 needs to take the larger portion and afcourse if a person who has come to taste the shakes and to try them whether they have a smaller portion or not they are def gonna buy it by paying extra which I found to be a very clever technique and let's come to taste of the shakes if we talk about the Choco hazelnut shake it was definitely cold and fresh but quite sweet like too sweet even the choco chip shake was fresh and well prepared but I did not find something extraordinary or as ppl call it a SPECIALITY MILK SHAKE well I am sorry to say but they are nothing special it's just a new franchise in Calcutta of keventers but nothing compared to the keventers at delhi‚úåÔ∏è

                I've heard my friends who live in Delhi rave about Keventers so I was pretty excited when this outlet opened in Forum. I tried the Kitkat and caramel flavours, both of which were delicious. Being a little on the steep side and the lack of seating space is a little discouraging. I was particularly baffled on my second visit where we were refused the regular size drink and forced to order the large drink because they claimed that the smaller bottles were over :/ however, they undoubtedly do not compromise on quality!

A speciality milk shake joint in Kolkata, situated next to the Wow Momo kiosk on the fourth floor of Forum Mall. It is said to be a franchise of Keventers Delhi but since I haven't been there I am unable to compare the two outlets. Here the milk shakes were reasonably good and thick. I liked the bottle in which they serve it. It's nostalgia and makes one remember a bygone era when milk was sold in such bottles instead of the plastic pouches or tetrapacks of today. But my one grouse with them being that the person manning the cash counter told me that there was no small size, one perforce had to opt for large. üòû Then don't have small in the menu, just have one size...large. Moreover the bottles had a lot of froth so the quantity of milk was less. Together with taxes one bottle cost Rs. 241/- and I feel that is exorbitant for milkshake served from a kiosk.üòû

Atlast this delhi-based milkshake brand is in kolkata.Got a chance to visit this place last week.Its a  small joint and you will be lucky enough if you dont have to wait in the cue to grab your milkshake.

SHAKES(Food)-They serve three varieties and two sizes in shakes but their "Thick shake" is a must try.I had-

1:Butterscotch shake(Normal shake)
2:Tutti fruti(thick shake) 
Among them "Tutti fruti" is a must try as you will feel the pulp in your mouth with every sip.

SERVICE-Despite having a long cue their service is quite fast and active.

So after all the hype about this place I finally got a chance to visit it.

The tiny little kiosk at forum is adorable.

I've never had the original shake in Delhi so I wouldn't be able to make a comparison.

I ordered the mint oreo or choco mint shake. 
I really enjoyed it. 
I've ordered the same shake elsewhere and I was always disappointed.
It has always been too chunky for a shake 
But I really liked the balance between the chocolate and mint.
Nothing was overpowering. 

Can't wait to go back and try more flavors out.

A 3.5 majorly because of the name that it carries. A small kiosk opened up in Forum mall to the delight of Calcuttans. They have a limited menu of which majority aren't available. The oreo mint shake is one of their best and is a must try. 
No wonder the place is so crowded. Also, I have seen people complain of less sugar in their milkshake at times too. Efficiency needs to be improved a lot as this isn't expected of a big shot name like Keventers. 
And oh,the best part is that they let you keep the bottles. So yay!

Had bookmarked this place as soon as it featured on zomato Kolkata! Keventers are "legen-dairy" milkshakes from the people who make it the best!
Their entry into Kolkata proves that brands aren't shying to come to the city anymore.
This outlet is located in Forum mall right beside the wow momo outlet.
The kiosk was extremely crowded but I managed to get myself two thickshakes
- Oreo Mint which was oozing with burst of Oreo biscuits and a strong mint flavour. Was yummy
- Caramello which was my favorite of the evening. It had the perfect blend of caramel and milk and was so filling and tasty! #recommended.

The milkshakes come in two sizes and thick shakes in the 200ml size. The milk bottles can be carried back as a take home!

Prices are reasonable considering the quality, taste and portion.

Definitely #recommended for you foodies!

Welcoming Delhi's favourite milkshake to the City of Joy and let's just say, it's been a happy experience. 

We had Vanilla, Mango and Strawberry milkshakes. The bottle bearing the emblem of Rabindranath Tagore and the iconic Howrah Bridge, makes it even more special! üòä

However the only problem I had was the quantity of the content served. When the froth in the bottle dies down, you see only 75% of actual milkshake being served to you. Delhi Keventers doesn't do that. So unless you don't want to cheat your customers, please keep this valid point in mind. 

Otherwise, I'm coming back for more üòä

The funniest thing happened here. We wanted to try their classic milkshakes. So, we ordered a Mango, a Butterscotch, and a Strawberry. It was pretty crowded and they shut down for an hour or so to handle the orders.
I wanted the butterscotch btw. When we finally got them, we started drinking immediately. It's funny that we didn't notice for a long while that the mango and butterscotch got mixed up and I got mango. The taste was so bland that even after noticing the difference, we didn't bother to exchange back.
They are new and I hope they get better.
One good thing I got, was the bottle, for free!

The much awaited milkshake joint has finally arrived in our city.
The Fruity shakes, out of four choices; two were out of stock. Tried the Exotic Strawberry, it was excellent.
From the Classic shakes section, I tried the Butterscotch and Pineapple. Both were smooth and yummy.
From the Thick Shake section, I had the Mint-Oreo Crumble Shake. It was undoubtedly the best!!
The service is satisfactory and price is moderate. The bottles are artistically and aesthetically pleasing with custom-made caricature of Rabindranath Tagore and the iconic Howrah Bridge. üëå

Keventers has been famous for their shakes in Delhi and they finally opened their little shop at Kolkata 1 month ago.
Within a month they got famous here too. For their unique takeaway method of shakes and value for money items.
Tried Caramello and kitakat shake. Both were good..
For two bottle of small shakes cost us 301 INR.

The service is satisfactory and price is moderate. The bottles are artistically and aesthetically pleasing with custom-made caricature of Rabindranath Tagore and the iconic Howrah Bridge. üëå
Definitely coming back to try more flavours. ‚úå

Keventers has been famous for their shakes in Delhi and they finally opened their little shop at Kolkata 1 month ago.
Within a month they got famous here too. For their unique takeaway method of shakes and value for money items.
Tried Caramello and kitakat shake. Both were good..
For two bottle of small shakes cost us 301 INR.

A decent little counter in the food court of Forum mall that makes amazing milkshakes. And they managed that little space quite skillfully and decorated with things like an old antique-ish phone, a picture of Mr. & Mrs. Keventers, etc. 
The counter is a limited space so having 3 personnel is enough, but that results in having people to wait for a bit. But then all complaints go away at the first sip.
 
Got a large chocolate hazelnut milkshake, pocket pinch of 241/- after taxes. It felt unjust for a moment, but then took a sip of the amazing milkshake and it was worth it. Plus getting to take that nice bottle home was makes the price feels kinda equitable. And let's not forget to mention that the bottle really does bring back memories of Tom & Jerry and those bottles of milk that were kept near the doorstep. 
Couldn't take pictures since my phone decided to run outta battery a few minutes prior.

Milkshake is made from a recipe older than your grandfather..So well said and well delivered too in this  famous vintage shakes house which has recently opened in kolkata in forum mall  right  next to Wow Momos in fourth floor.It serves you all classic and fruity shakes.The shakes are extremely yummy and surely wont disappoint you.Its a place that only serves you with variety of  flavours of milkshakes.The shakes are served in cute  shaped bottles which you would surely love to take it home.

We tried few flavours and would surely visit again to try the remaining flavours.The menu will  keep you confused regarding what to order and what to leave on for your next visit.

They have two sizes of bottles and both small and medium sized  are well priced .

The menu card is simple and nice.

We ordered for luscious blueberry shake , tutti frutti and mint oreo crumble shake.

All three flavours were just tongue -licking.I wish I could have ordered for more shakes as they were reallly really tempting.

Firstly we ordered for Mint Oreo shake which was a perfect fusion of mint flavour with oreo crumbles.It would surely uplift your mundane mood and would make sure you just don‚Äôt go with one shake bottle in your hand.We surely couldn‚Äôt resist one .


We then ordered for Luscious Blueberry shake which was one of the classic shakes and was very fresh.The bottles really looked very cute.

Lastly we could somehow manage in ordering for one more shake and called for Tutti Frutti.Each sip of the shake would give you frutti bites in your tongue.It was very soothing and classic .It was the speciality of the house.
 This place is must visit for all the milkshake lovers.It will keep you slurpping for really long .It also has a takeaway service which would allow you to take the cute bottles home.  Travelling along with this bottle in the mall and shopping  is also not a bad idea at all.Try it for yourself‚Ä¶!

Tried this place on Sunday evening and by then most of its stuffs were in over. Of the left overs the person said butterscotch milk shake was best so thought of going with his advice.

They have 2 sizes 200ml and 500 ml.

I tried the 500 ml and it turned out to be really really good. The drink was served in a nice glass bottle. It's a good touch as now everyone goes for plastic or thermocole glasses.

The only and the only let down was that the straw was small and it was a task drinking that.

Looking forward to try their mint Oreo shake!!

And my wait has finally come to an end. Keventers is the hot spot as far as Forum is concerned. Everyone seems to love it and I am no exception! 

Since they only had the 'Classics', I ordered a small Butterscotch shake and a large Cold Coffee. Wish I had ordered the other way around. 

The Butterscotch shake was fabulous! I absolutely loved it! It got finished in no time! 

The cold coffee was great too, however not as nice as the Butterscotch one. 

The service is moderately fast. The bottles are really lovely as well! 

It's a must to try this place out as soon as you can! 

Happy Dining!!

Finally keventers is in Kolkata!! 
#Old memories #old taste. Came here not expecting much as the tastes of a lot of things change as they move to a new city in hands of a new franchisee but to my utter surprise the taste is great the price has gone up but it gets compensated with the cool bottle that we get to take home. 
Would like to suggest that they should start offering a metal wire case (which was used in old days to carry milk bottles) if someone buys 6 large bottles or may b small as well..!

From the Thick Shakes section we took the 'Mint-Oreo Crumble' in small. And OMG, it was like the best. The combination of oreo and mint was so heavenly. üòòüòò
.
Please give the place a visit you guys asap. üòÑ

I had keventers for the first time in Delhi, around 8 years back. 

It's finally in the city of Joy after waiting for years!
I have had 10 different varieties of milkshakes over here, and none of the them disappointed me! 

Caramello, Oreo Crumble and butterscotch are a must try. 

It's very reasonably priced, hence one can visit on a regular basis :)

Location: Forum mall, top floor, just beside Wow momo.

We were just 2 people, so we tried 2 milkshakes of small quantity.

Choc chip :-
this was of the thick variety, super delicious and had a bite to it. The choco chops lend and awesome texture to this shake.

Small quantity: 125+tax=150.

Butterscotch :-
 Man, I'll stop having butterscotch ice cream after today. This drink is so so yum. Unlike the choco chip one, this is super smooth. No chunks of butterscotch whatsoever.

Small quantity : 99+tax =120

I don't know from where they source their ingredients or which animal's milk they use, but the taste is heavenly! Highly recommended.

P.S.- the large quantities are priced upwards of ‚Çπ200 and they come in a limited edition bottle. ¬†And yes, they let you take the bottle home :D

The milkshakes at Keventers are to die for. Had been waiting for it to open in the city. 
My suggestion would be to go with a large group so that you can try several different shakes - I tried the Oreo Crumble, Strawberry and Caramello and i had a difficult time choosing my favorite. 

Must visit! :D

They come in 2 sizes:small and large ( and the bottles are adorable and they allow you to take them home). I tried their choco chip, choco Oreo and choco penut butter and all 3 were delicious. I definitely recommend it.

Keventers is finally in Kolkata!!! Great milkshakes ... you can't praise enough. The price may look on a higher side (INR 150-200 +taxes for a big bottle of milkshake) but is worth it and they let you carry home the bottle :) 
The only negative is: a single person manning the counter and preparing the shakes, so service is a tad slow at times.

Have you noticed the cute little milk bottles on cartoon shows such as Tom & Jerry? Keventers serves delightful milkshakes in such cute, glass bottles. üòä The milkshakes taste heavenly. They most likely won't make you feel guilty on your cheat days. üòã A vintage milkshake brand, Keventers was established in India by a Danish entrepreneur in the 1920's
Variety of flavours will leave you spoilt for choices. Melting roses, Mint Oreo crumble, strawberry, butterscotch, caramel, chocolate hazelnut are just to name a few. üòçTwo different sizes of bottles are available. The larger one is enough for two (depending on your craving and appetite üòú) Go on and add this to your list of must visit, you'll be craving for it much more often than you think! üòä Happy slurping! 

Psst you can also take home the bottles! Do look out for the special limited edition bottles for Kolkata! üòä

Finally we have a keventers in kolkata. Good location to open its first store@forum mall. Felt nostalgic holding the old fashioned milkshake bottle after ages !!! Tried quite a few flavours 2day. Exotic strawberry & exotic blueberry are highly recommended for the fruity flavour lovers. Those who love their chocolate should indulge in choco chip & mint Oreo shakes. Butterscotch flavour is an evergreen classic when your mind is in a fix. Lastly happy to have keventers.....keep shaking like always ...üòçüòç
