Absolutely amazing!  The most sumptuous meal I ever had!  I ordered a chicken lasagna and a chicken tandoori pizza.  Didn't know what to expect,  since it's a new joint.  But truly amazed by the quality of  food  and service being provided.  Biggbelly's concept is unique in Kolkata.  If they keep it up,  they can truly become the next big thing in the Kolkata food scene!  Good continental food is hard to come by in Kolkata.  Biggbelly's efforts are therefore truly laudable.  Great going guys!

A decent place serving quality takeaway foods at an affordable price. I had a chicken Hawaiian pizza. The pizza was thinking crust but the taste was good. Choice of toppings was appropriate with adequate amount of cheese. Only problem was the use of extra pieces of onion. Other than that, this place is value for money. A pizza at 200 INR is good to go.

The best delivery restaurant around Dhakuria and surrounding area. Ordered Fish and Chips and Chicken Steak with Jack Daniels Sauce, the quality and packaging was superb. They have a wide variety of foods and they make authentic Continental food. Definitely a must try.

Food quality and taste both are very good. Food comes in a nice container provided with compartments. Though my house is beyond 4 km from their outlet still they made sure to deliver the food on time. I m satisfied and happy. Will surely order again.

For those of you who stay in Dhakuria this place is located near Haltu. The place looks unassuming in the beginning considering it's located, in a "paara" and not some posh locality. But then, it can give tough competition to even the classy restaurants in terms of food! Delicious Chinese and continental dishes with robust flavours. Neat packaging for home delivery. And very prompt service! Much more than what you expect in a local food joint üòÉ

P. S. I now have a restaurant serving really good food 5 mins from my house!! üòç

Chef cooked World cuisine brought to the customers' doorsteps. Truly a wide assortment of cuisines and mouthwatering fusion platters. Lack of major foodtech companies in kolkata seems to be satiated by BiggBelly now.
