A not so convincing looking food joint,but on the other hand,serves great Chinese food,that's all about Tung Nam.They serve fantastic pork dishes,and that attracts people who are admirers of this eatery.situated in a busy market place ,it's a bit hard to manage parking spot.Quantity and quality would win over anyone who is not looking for a mind-blowing ambience.hidden gem in the old Chinese alley,one must try an eating out here.

Last week visited this place after a long time. This restaurant is situated just behind poddar court. Ordered chicken wanton soup, chicken yaam mein noodles and chicken hamai sauces. Truely speaking their quality has detoriated a lot. I didnt feel that charm in food what i use to get there 2-3 yrs back.

This place will serve you good food at the cheapest price.The quantity of 1 plate is enough for 2 people, and the food was really tasty. But the fried chicken wantons was clearly the show stealer. It was crispy and juicy at the same time.

A typical authentic Chinese Eating House. You might face a problem while locating this place but the people around are quite helpful and they will help you to find this interesting place.We visited this place on the 31st Day of 2017 i.e on the New Year's eve and had to wait for about half an hour as this place has no time breathe because it is always flooded with people. The interior is nothing much impressive but the food is yum.

Coming to the food, we ordered a plate of chicken schezwan rice , chicken fried Meifoon and Chicken Hamei Sauces (supposed to be their speciality and comes with 8 pieces). I must say the quantity was humunguous and tastes wonderful. I'm absolutely satisfied. I also wanted to try out the fried wonton but they said that it's finished , will surely go back once again to try those.

Highly recommend that you need to have alot of patience as there is only one waiter who takes care of everything , from taking the order to serving the food to take the bill.

Just another added information,the menu on zomato doesn't match with the original one currently available at the restaurant.

Go on and give a try if you are a crazy fan of authentic Chinese food. But do keep in mind that it remains closed every Tuesday and the rest of the days it takes a break from 3 p.m to 6 p.m

This place is truly a hidden gem. The 4.5 that i have given is solely for their food. This is a true heaven on earth.
LOCATION- located inside the lanes of teretti bazar. A 10minutes walk from tea board or chandni chowk metro.
AMBIENCE- nothing much. A 25-30 seater. Typical chinese restaurant kind of feel. But when u serve that great food, just a table and chair is all i need.

FOOD- The food they serve is some authentic chinese that you would hardly find at any other place in kolkata at this price. Every dish is a star.The amount they give for every dish is just overwhelming.

We ordered:-
SWEET CORN CHICKEN SOUP- delicious soup with loads of chicken,corn and egg drop in it. Nice thick creamy feel. 2 large bowl of soup was enough to serve 6.

PEPPER CHICKEN- 8-10 pieces of juicy fried chicken. Verry crispy n peppery. Inside the chicken was soft and tender. Tasted great with the schezwan sauce.

MIXED GRAVY NOODLES- a bit like pan fried noodles. Crispy noodles in a gravy made with large shreds of chicken and vegetables. Tasted brilliant. The amount was enough for 2.

MIXED HAKA NOODLES & RICE- again very well made dishes. Authentic chinese aroma and taste. You will crave for more. Comes in huge amount and is more than enough for 2.

GARLIC CHICKEN & CHICKEN MANCHURIAN- soft boneless chicken pieces cooked in the respective styles. The gravy was delicious and went very well with the mains.

SERVICE- very prompt. One waiter for 30 odd people and still they manage to attend each one and serve the dishes piping hot within 15-20 minutes of placing the order.

PRICE- cheapest you can get at a restaurant serving this great quality of food. No extra added gst.

Would want to visit this place again and again for their lovely food.

From outside it might seem to be a small food joint, but its delicacies are sure to blow your mind. The staffs are very cordial. We went there several times, every time it was a great experience.

You'll get the best chilli pork here in the city. Salt & pepper pork also tasted yumm. Chicken hamei sauce, mixed fried rice, gravy chowmein are amongst its notable dishes. The quantity is good, one plate serves 2 people. All the food were fresh, with exhilarating flavours.

Highly recommended. Do try all its dishes.

Food (Quality) - (4/5)
Food (Quantity) - (4.8/5)
Ambience - (2/5)
Service - (3.5/5)
The food was quite delicious and the quantity they served was really good enough. The place is really small for accommodation for huge group but their is a huge demand among the teenagers and college goers.
I went with two are friends of mine for lunch.
 We ordered :
1) Mixed Haka Chowmin - 2
2) Pork Steam Rice - 1
3) Pork Chili - 1
4) Pork Garlic ( Hot & Sweet ) - 1

The Mixed Haka Chowmin was delicious and tge quantity was enough to stay full till dinner. It had both pork , beacon and chicken pieces mixed. 
The Pork Steam Rice was served really hot and had beacon strips and vegetables. 
The Pork Chili & The Pork Garlic was really tasty, specially the gravy of Pork Garlic was really palatable.
The Pork Garlic was also a little bit crispy so a plus point there. 
 Overall I would prefer this place anyday for a wholesome meal at a cheap price.
There is no washroom though. I had to wash my hands and there was no separate washroom. The lady owner adviced me to wash hands in a sink but not to wash my mouth, really adviseful.

Pros
Great quantity
Good quality.
Budget hidden gem
Good service
Value for money
Budgeted

Cons
Needs expanding
Needs cleanliness
Needs to create a good ambience.

Our total bill came to Rs. 830, all prices are inclusive of tax. Highly recommended. 👍

I wonder why the hell haven’t I chanced upon this place after umpteen number of visits to Teritti Bazar. 

Sitting in a corner, this quant, canteen like eatery is definitely a hidden powerhouse of Chinese delicacy. The pale reception of the staff might be a bit turn off, but food is the real talker in this vanity less quarters of old Calcutta. 

My friends and I indulged in some appetite-building exercise with the Salt and pepper chicken. It was followed by  colossal plate mixed fried rice. In sides, we had chilli pork that was steamy and spice and well marinated preparation of pork hot garlic. The food is akin to that we get in China town and could give daunting competition to high-end Chinese Restaurants. Overall, Tung Nam was very satisfying. Go indulge in some authentic Chinese food.

Heard about this eatery from past several years, finally got the chance to visit it...
Decor, service and comfort is not the highlighting point of this restro but the most important aspect of any food joint, the food, is the BEST thing about this place!
Had a gourmet & authentic chinese lunch with my soulmates..
We began with Salt Chicken Pepper as appetizer, with Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice, Pork in Hot Garlic Sauce and Chilli Pork being it's worthy followers!! 👌👌
Rice is well cooked, loaded with ample with egg, chicken & pork (without prawn, as we don't prefer it) and the quantity is also very satisfying!!👍
Pork in Hot Garlic Sauce is pork balls in delightful hot garlic sauce and Chilli Pork is shredded pork pieces in onion and bell pepper gravy! We liked both and the quantity again is superb!!
Would refer this restro to everyone for authentic chinese lunch and dinner at reasonable price!

A hidden gem for authentic Chinese food.
It looks like a old clubroom with 3-4 round tables, but it serves the best Chinese food around burrabazar.
We ordered chicken wanton, chilli pepper pork for starters.
For the main course we ordered mixed fried rice, mixed rice noodles, chicken hong kong, pork in hamei sauce... Pork preparations were  awesome.
Quantities were good enough for two persons.
One must visit this place to have quality Chinese delicacy.

Tung Nam: Good and cheap place to eat. Interior is nothing fashionable but if someone is looking for authentic Chinese this place is your destination. The only usp of this restaurant is quantity and quality of their Chinese dishes  at a very reasonable price. My menu was Wanton chicken Chicken fried rice and Chicken in  Hamei sauce. Wanton chicken is a bit oily tates different may be because never tried earlier. The quantity of Chicken fried rice was more than sufficient for 2 and Chicken in hamei sauce was awesome medium spicy kind of a dish taste undoubtedly good. Loved it.

This is a nondescript shop in a nondescript lane close to Lalbazar. You may have trouble finding it, so make sure you're consulting Google maps or taking a cab there. It's also pretty crowded, you might have to wait for your turn. The interiors are nothing fancy, a few Chinese wall hangings are all there is. There's only a few servers attending to all the tables, best to be patient. We ordered the chicken wonton for starters and the chicken hakka noodles + chicken in hamei sauce for the main course. The wontons are okayish, but I guess authentic Chinese dishes are a bit bland for our Indian palate. The noodles and the chicken were great though. Quantities are enough to fill two people to the brim easy and the hamei sauce deserves special mention.
Price is very reasonable and you'd feel satisfied with the food in your tummy.

This restaurant is a hidden gem in Barrabazar just behind Terretti bazar ! It serves authentic Chinese dishes and everything is made with immense love and care. The seating and the non ac place might not please many but the food is great value for money. I had the Chicken Fried Rice which was lacking a bit salt. As a side dish I tried the Chicken in Hamei Sauce, Schezwan Chicken, Chilli Pork and Fish in Hamei Sauce ! The Chilli Pork was to die for but since we entered towards the end of their service, we were served some fatty pork pieces. Overall a must try for the Chinese Lovers. Enjoy !

If you are a pork lover this is surely THE place which must be ticked off your bucket list while in Kolkata. Visited today afternoon with my cousin brothers , sisters and their spouses. Couple of them have frequented The Chinese mainland and thus is more exposed to authentic Chinese than I am. One of them is currently learning mandarin and is a chop stick enthusiast. Wanted to have their view on food wrt to being Authentic. Ordered Lung fung , sweet corn and Manchow soup along with the Pork Kaptai soup ( without the organ meat ) . Then there was Pepper fish , Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken, Chilli prawn , Chilly Pork & Pork Wanton. In the mains we had gravy chowmein, schezwan mixed rice, pork hamchoy, pork in hamei sauce & sweet and sour fish. And our chinese experts were all praises except for the gravy chowmein and especially for the Pork in hamei sauce. From my perspective, Location is not great. Neither the get up or ambience. But the food is. The service is also decent. Portion served is more than decent and the price is extremely reasonable. What else to look for !! Addition of dumplings in the menu can be considered as an improvement option.

P.S. - Menu prices in Zomato needs to be revised. Mostly all items are now available at Rs. 20 more. Also parking could be an issue , better to use a cab on a busy weekday.

I didn' t have pork, but I saw the happiness in his face after he had Pork. Great quantity and quality. Reasonable pricing as well. The location of the restaurant is a bit hard to find out. But, hey, you do have Google Maps, right. Negotiate through the busy and clumsy area of Teretti Bazar, find the restaurant out and the rest will be a memorable dineout for you, I assure that.

Good and cheap place to eat. Tried its Pork Hong Kong, prawn hakka chow mein and prawn fried rice. The food was awesome.
      Had to spend around half an hour to search for this place after getting down at Barra Bazaar which wasn't desirable. Also, the locality wasn't good. There was just one person taking orders and bringing food which is surely not enough for a crowded place.

Please visit D'Lay eating house just to justify coming all this way to eat pig meat in the city of joy. Also Pork was from a wayyy older animal, and it reflected poorly upon succulence and bite from the rind/fat lining. Cooked in tomato ketchup, ajinomoto and Soy sauce, it doesn't deserve such high praise IMO.

Tung nam was on my wishlist for a long.. Finally gt d chance to go der.. Dis authentic Chinese eatery is a hidden gem..  Simple nd basic decor.. Non ac dining space contains 5-6 plastic tables with seating arrangements for 20-25 people at a time.. 

Location : located near central Metro Station. If dis area id not known to u, its quite difficult to find out dis restaurant.. U can get directions frm google map.. 

Service : quick nd prompt service, well behaved stuff can guide u properly.. 

Food : we ordered American chopsuey, egg chicken noodles, chicken hamai sauce.. 
¤ American chop suey- they served it in a big plastic plate n chopsticks.. Its a one full-meal dish itself..  Which prepared wid crispy fried noodles,mix gravy vegetables, chicken nd garnished wid egg poach.. It was yummy.. 


¤ egg n chicken noodle-(4/5) hakka egg n chicken noodles is one my favorite dish..  Mix veggies, fried egg n shredded chicken sauteed wid boiled noodles.. Black pepper was added to make dishes fragnant in flavor..


¤ chicken with hamai sauce-(4.5/5) 8 pieces of boneless chicken were properly cooked wid some Chinese Spices,sauce, onion nd capsicum.. It was amazing.. A bit 'teekhaa' bt it tastes great wid mix noodles..

Quality nd quantity of food were supreb.. Dis three dishes were more than enough for filling our hungry tummy..  

Pricing : pricing is standard nd pocket friendly..usually thy gve hand written bills,  didn't charge any taxes or gst..  
Over all a good experience..  Wanna revisit again and again...

No words, no reviews perhaps can do justice for this legendary joint serving sheer elegant Chinese items from time immemorial. Tung Nam is love. I am grateful to one of my friends who took me to this place couple of years back and since then I have dropped in for umpteen number of times just to become amazed every time. Starting from their wantons to soup , from yam mein to pork chilly each and every item is always well cooked and bound to tickle the taste bud. Consistency and quality are the 2 main pillars of success of Tung Nam. Amidst the mushrooming food joints Tung Nam will held it's head high like an old Banyan tree and keeping the current quality intact, this hidden gem cannot be replaced.
Most of the time I remain so engrossed to delve in their food that taking picture remains to be an oblivious act. Peace...

Went to Tung Nam on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was full as expected, so we had to wait for our table.
Ordered Chilli Pork and Pepper Chicken for starter. Pepper chicken was okayish, but the Chilli Pork stole the show. The pork item was so juicy yet fried and the recipe was perfect.
For main course, we ordered Mix Hakka Noodles, Mix Gravy Noodles, Mix Fried Rice, Chicken in Hamei Sauce and Chilli Pork ( Again :) ).
All the item were cooked to perfection and the quantity and quality of food was great.
Chicken in Hamei Sauce is worth mentioning.

All in all a good dining experience at a low cost.
Do visit once !

The only thing that stands out is the food they serve especially the dish Hong Kong pork. In terms of decoration, the place needs a total makeover. The servicing has room for improvement as well. Despite all these, the quality and quantity of their food separates them from the pack, one of the best places to have pork. One more thing, no extra burden of tax is there. So I suggest, go there and get your belly satiated...

This restaurant just surviving and drawing customers just on past glory otherwise it's just an utter joke. Gone there for sum work..... Decided to have my lunch there. Must say was really excited about it. After entering the restaurant a waiter greeted me with a smile but that's it  .after that a horrible experience followed... Which disillusioned all my expectations. Orded kaptai soup as starter which was good but a pungent smell of pork was there. After that in the main course I tried egg fried rice and chicken with hamei sauce. Items are good but extremely oily which is unacceptable dining in a authentic Chinese resto. Also orderd mixed noodles for packing which was good but no egg at all. Charging 170 bucks for that. Also the cutleries are really dirty. Unhygienic really. When I pointed out this to the waiter he just behaved as if I have done any offence. Vry bad experience. There are much better dining options than go to this Shit. The management must give proper attention to these things otherwise just relish on the past glory and get ready to be pulled down by competitors.

Went there after being recommended by many of my friends. Easy to locate. Follow the lane opposite Central Metro  gate.
Very simple old school decor and not much hygenic.

FOOD -
Pork Fried Wonton- Crisp , pork filling was well prepared but too oily
Mixed fried rice- Nothing extraordinary, as the rave is
Pork Hamei Sauces- Didn't like at all.

Didn't match my expectations as the buzz is!
Service was good and didn't take much time.
Try to get their before 3pm
Very easy on pocket and serves in good quantity.

Not visiting soon.

Being a chinese freak i had to visit this place.
This north kolkata joint has being serving amazing set of chicken pork and fish dishes over the years.
I was very keen and eager to visit this place.
Well we tried
Chicken hamei sauces, Mixed Fried Rice and mixed noodles.
Everything here was good and wonderful to taste.
The dishes were such nicely cooked that it had great taste to it.
For me chicken hamei sause was the star peformer here.
I would love to back back here for the amazing food that they serve.
If you have a a bunch ready to have a wonderful set of chinese dishes you must visit this place.
This place definetly gets a' Must visit' tag from me.

One of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever visited. Went along with a college senior who suggested me this restaurant. I basically wanted to eat pork so we had fried pork wontons, pork hakka noodles, pork hong kong and chilli pork. All the dishes were awesome. The wontons were crunchy and had nicely minced pork. The noodles were smooth and delicious. What impressed me the most was chilli pork. It was hot and spicy and fatty. It was red hot, spicy, had a nice aroma and was mouthwatering. The texture of the pork was excellent and I can't forget that until I taste something better! Also, the price is so less for the quantity and quality of food they serve. Surely a bargain! ;)

Best Chinese food in town. Period. Locating thus place might be a bit difficult. Its located right behind the KIT Building & the Telephone Exchange. Its not a hot shot eatery with no AC or spic n span tables or shiny cutlery. Just a normal eating house and a mean chinese lady serving kick ass chinese food at cheap rates. Just make sure you visit this place either before 3 or after 6.
We tried out the Pepper Fish and Lung Fung Soup for starters. For the mains we had ordered the famous Pork Hamei and Mixed Mei Foon(rice glass noodles). The Pepper Fish was a pakoda like fried item with a superb batter. Fish lovers can try this item out. The Lung Fung Soup was a chicken and prawn soup with very finely diced and boiled veggies and also the soup was perfectly thick. The Mixed Mei Foon was very good with all sorts of  diced meat making up the dish. The quantity of each dish is so damn decent along with the quality. But the clear winner was the Pork Hamei. After trying all sorts of roasted pork, chilly pork, thai pork etc etc we had got bored. This garlic based dish with shrimp paste making up the gravy was a welcomed change that we were looking for. Any pork lover should try out this dish. They season their food really well too. Visiting this place once is definitely not enough.

Finally managed to visit this place after so many cancelled plans. To start of nothing great about the ambience but that doesn't matter to a foodie as long as it's hygienic. Getting to the food we ordered "dry chilli pork" "pepper chicken" "mixed gravy chowmein" " mixed hakka chowmein" "mixed fried rice" "pork hamei sauces" "hong kong chicken". "Pepper chicken" was crispy outside but it just melts as you eat. "Dry chilli pork" was so tasty that we ordered one more and packed another!!!! Special mention goes to "pork in hamei sauces" which has to be their USP! Rice and noodles were proportionate and price was more than reasonable. Overall a wonderful experience and will definitely visit again.

A sudden urge to hog on Chinese food led us here. Saw the high rated reviews on Zomato and Recommendation over social media. With high hopes we were there. And yes! Not even for a second we regrettted coming here. Starting from the yummylicious and freshly made starter.#pepperchicken. Moving on to the main course dishes #chickenfriedrice and #porkhameisauce it was a delightful dinner with a feeling of sumptuousnes and fullness. 
We just like the others would recommend the place over and over again to others.
Bon Appetit!!

Great food at very affordable prices. This is a restaurant with nothing much other than good food. There is no mind blowing decor or anything unnecessary. But the food here tastes better than many of they popular big restaurants with grand decor and other superfluous stuff. I had noodles and pork and it was really filling lunch for not so much money. Its one of the places that you have to try once to believe.

One of the best and pocket perfect joint for traditional Cantonese Chinese food in Kolkata.
A really small restaurant without any attractive decorations but a traditional Chinese theme. Lets come to food-

1. Mixed Rice: Comes in a huge quantity. One plate is enough for two. Replete with chicken pork prawn egg etc. Tastes really good and different.

2. Pork Hamei Sauce: Just excellent. I never saw this dish in other restaurant. A very different and homemade sauce they use for this dish. Totally different from the non-veg Chinese dishes we are familiar with. They have Chicken and Fish dish also with this sauce.

3. Szechwan Chicken: Chicken cooked in Szechwan Sauce. Nothing special but taste was good.

Good Chinese food at a very low price, Tung Nam is a notable destination. Service was really good and fast.

Next time Yam Wanton is the target dish. Will visit there again soon.

A true hidden gem.If you are foodie & live in Kolkata & if you haven't visit this place yet,you are really missing something.A true authentic Chinese experience we have got there.All Chinese dishes made by Chinese people is the main thing of attraction.It is so popular among foreigners inspite of not having a single ac.When we have gone there,we saw a couple of table had been occupied by foreigners.Now let's talk about the food.Believe me,I have never tasted any Chinese dish so good anywhere except their dishes.Being typical & hesitant about pork,we had "Pork in Humei sauce" & I realised that I will remember it's taste till my death.Wanton, mixed rice,soup were also awesome.Prawn balls in garlic(hot & sweet) was good but the gravy was too sweet.However despite of such location & not having even ac in a modern day restaurant,this restaurant is always crowded because you know what?
Yes,Food speaks.

I mean it made me so nostalgic and remind me of my childhood. The ambience was very good. Now comes the food, we had Chinese at so many places but this just made me feel wow! Perfect taste. We ordered minxed Mein Foon and chicken in Hamei sauce, it was so tasty. And now comes the stuffs, so courteous and we'll behaved, and the old uncle is smiling almost all the time. Loves Tung Nam.

Dissapointing.The fried chicken wontons are bad,oily.The taste is really very plain and its waste of money ordering fried wontons.The egg chow was okay.But extra pepper was used in every items.Maybe that's Chinese secret...it was not something very great as zomato pretends it to be.Then the place is somewhat too bad to eat(Ambience and feel).

Yam Wanton(pork): This was a type of steamed wanton.This was the best dish I've ever had. If you are a momo lover then this is the ultimate showstopper. Highly recommend.
Yam Wanton Soup: I simply loved this soup.
Infact I gave this place a lot of visits and tried many other dishes but these two are my favorite. Please give them a try.

One of the handful outlets in the city, where you get genuinely good Chinese food at the most pocket friendly prices. Yes, some may not find the ambience & facilities, as per the standards of decent or plush restaurants (they still have no AC and don't accept cards). But if you dare or rather care to discount the same in lieu of some good food, this is the place to be. Also for people who are hard on their pocket strings.
Must try items:
Any dish in Hamei Sauce
Their Gravy Noodles (any kind)
Chilli Chicken/Pork/Fish
Hot Garlic Pork/Chicken/Fish
Steamed Wantons
Pork Hamchoy

Bon Appetit!

Well this is indeed a hidden gem. 

I can't even remembered how many times I have visited this place still not bored haha. 
Even that uncle know what I am going order when I visit he brings 1st my favourite soup without taking order just check count of my guest who visits with me large or small. 

Let come to the food 

Amazing just amazing I bet you won't find better Chinese restaurants all over in Kolkata. 

My favourite 
Sweet corn soup
Mix chowmin (without pork) as I don't eat pork. 
Hamei chicken 
And you need someone to share it 

"WARNING"
Don't try it alone. 

They recent increases price just Rs10 in every@ items 
So total cost of the course meal is 420

Finally decided to give this place a visit after seeing such great reviews. Must say the place didn't disappoint us at all. Went with a group of friends and ordered chicken wonton, pork in hamei sauce, hot garlic chicken, chicken fried rice, schezwan chicken fried rice and chicken hakka noodles. Wontons were nice and super crunchy but the pork disappointed me as it had a kind of smell. The rice and noodles both were very delicious and the quantity was really good considering the nominal price tag. For me the star of the show was the hot garlic chicken. Will definitely visit it again soon.

Tiretti bazar is well known for its authentic Chinese restaurants and a quick Zomato search put forward the name of this restaurant as one of the best.. we went there around 8 p.m. the street was relatively empty.. and I was initially having a bad feeling.. but once we reached this restaurant, i relaxed.. the place was crowded.. there were only 8 tables.. and all but one were occupied.. we took the only available table.. there wasn't any menu on the table and it took us some time to get hold of one.. we ordered chicken Hakka noodles and chilli pork.. the quantity was enough for the both of us.. I really liked the noodles very much.  The pork too was good. The only turnoff was it was too salty.. but the pork was well cooked and had adequate portion of both meat and fat.. service was pretty quick.. and the cost for two was around 300.. which is pretty cheap.. no taxes.. I loved that.. overall a good experience..

Tung Nam was sitting in my wishlist since long and I didn't miss the sole opportunity of experiencing this hidden gem for Chinese food! 
Small sitting area.. 6tables all total.. Without any AC.. The saying "first impression is the last impression" probably doesn't apply here! 
Our order conaisted of Chicken wanton soup,  Gravy Noodles chicken, Mixed Fried Rice and Pork in Hamei Sauce. The waiting time was pretty high, though can be considered as this was their peak hour. 

First came the Chicken wanton soup..  Silky wantons in clear chicken broth with Chinese greens.. Just a dash of soy and chili vinegar, and you land into heaven! Not to forget the portion size.. One bowl can comfortably satiate 3 tummies, obviously when you decide to treat soup as an appetizer! 

Then arrived the plate of gravy Noodles, along with the pork and mixed fried rice..I loved the Generous portion of soft boiled Noodles, lightly fried before putting with the gravy.. though I wasn't happy with the percentage of chicken and veggies served! The rice was just apt.. And the pork tasted great!  Some secret sauce is put in that dish and makes it yummy! I only missed the pork fat,  which was present just by a small piece. In spite of that, I so loved the taste, I thought of taking a plate of Chicken Hamei home..! 

But before I could think of anything else, I found a long strand of hair in the Noodles..major turn-off for me. They certainly changed my plate and the entire dish but I had lost my appetite by then. I can absolutely ignore the ambience and comfort factor but cannot compromise hygiene.. And there Tung Nam failed, specifically with their attitude after the incident.. No apologies, nothing.. Just removing the respective amount from my bill. Not going back probably.

Update 27th September 2017-
I am terribly disappointed.The salt n pepper fish was soggy and tasteless.The chicken hakka noodles was tough.The munchurian chicken had hard meatballs.Seriously disappointed.
Sorry .But my money got wasted today.Pulling down the rating.

This is the place where i tasted pork for the first time. A good decision i must admit. Since then i have become a pork lover. The roast chili pork here is simply heavenly. perfect blend of heat and the taste of pork fast....just thinking about it is making me hungry.Tried their salt and pepper fish too. We normally do not order fish while eating out...but yet again this was a delicious decision.The quality and quantity both are perfect. But i must add that the quantity of chowmein they serve is simply huge! One plate is enough for two.Do not go by the looks when you enter tung nam,as seldom would u find a cycle inside a restaurant.....trust me the food here is to die for. This should be the numero uno on every pork lover's list.(specially those on a tight budget).

Keep the good food coming guys!

This place is in terreti bazar area. It looks shabby and is a standalone eating house in this locality. The restaurant is in the ground floor of their home. They take order and cook it then and there so food is always fresh. We had chicken pepperoni, dry chilli pork, mix fried rice, hong Kong pork. I won't recommend fried rice it's different than what we get in other restaurants. Remaining dishes were good.

I had the pleasure of visiting this place. This is not  one of those fancy Chinese restaurants. It is well known among the people who loves Chinese food. The staffs are well behaved and cordial. The food is quite good. We had Lung Fung soup, Pepper Chicken, Pork Ginger sauces, Mixed Fried Rice, Hot Garlic Chicken and Chili Chicken. The quantity is more than sufficient for two people.  The dishes are little oily but they are easy on the pocket.
Surely gonna visit soon !!!

Location wise it's quite easy to locate if one happens to be acquainted with the Poddar court and territy Bazaar area. Alternatively,one can also avail the metro,get down at Central metro station,exit from the poddar court gate and take the help of google maps or people on the streets.

Once one reaches,the looks of it isn't impressive at all. One might even have to wait for a table during the peak hours.Something that should be kept in mind before visiting this place is that they remain closed on Tuesdays and they shut down everyday at 3pm only to open again at 6pm.

Coming to the food and service.
Had ordered their special dishes,chicken wantons and chilly pork along with chicken noodles.

The wantons were really crisp. Loved it.Going back for the wantons.

Chilly pork isn't the best here,it could have been better as I found the portion of pork fat way too much in the dish.

The Chicken hakka noodle was like it is in all other places but the quantity stands out. One plate of the noodle can be easily shared by 3 people with moderate apetite.

The service is quick and decent.
Value for money-10/10
Also,no added tax.

Taking a walk through the dingy lanes of central Calcutta, you shall luckily stumble upon this vintage eatery that has been here in the real Chinatown of Calcutta since its inception. Tung Nam is old and it's wisdom is reflected in the authentic Chinese food delivered on the tables, probably the best and most authentic Chinese after Eau Chew. You won't care about the simple interior which is clean and cool, when the food is delivered to you. It's delicious. The quantity is filling. In short, Tung Nam will blow you away with its reasonable rates and delectable food.
My favourite over here are the pork wanton soup, the mixed gravy noodles, mixed fried rice, pork in hamei sauce and pork in wine sauce. If you love Chinese, you should visit this place.

Heard from a friend..
So while coming to the restaurant suddenly got the smell of fried onions and garlic..and i was drawn to it like Tom towards fish in Tom and Jerry..
Roasted chilly pork...awesome..pepper chicken awesome...
Gonna be back here very soon to try some other dishes..
Only draw back is the ambience..and it non-ac..else i would have given it the highest rating possible...

Tried out takeaway from this Chinese joint after hearing so much about the place and yes, I must say that I am quite impressed. Service was quick.                
                 We tried out Pepper Chicken, Chilli Chicken, Szechwan Fried Rice and Chicken Hakka Noodles. The food was delectable. The food delivers in both the quality as well as quantity aspect of things.

FINAL VERDICT- I highly recommend this place as the food served here is really delicious and you would get good value for money.

A level of delicacy amongst the classic old school chinese eateries of Kolkata. Situated in tiretta bazaar, just behind the poddar court on Sun Yat Sen Street. Been there to experience some lipsmacking chinese with my friends. A simple & well maintained non AC restro with minimalistic decor & normal wooden table-plastic chair. But if you are upto food then this is the right place & to be very specific this is just heaven for classic chinese lover & pork lovers.We started our culinary journey with a bowl of steaming hot "Wanton Soup". It was just smoking hot heaven in bowls. Juicy & tasty wanton stuffed with chicken made us just out of the world. Next we had their mixed fried rice which came along with sufficient portions of chicken,prawn & veggies. This was just outstanding. Next we had "Mixed Gravy Noodles".it wasn't like the typical gravy noodles. The whole plate contains some well cooked noodles along with sone fried & crunchy ones. & then topped with gravy & chicken chunks, veggies & prawn. The gravy tasted just wow. "Chicken in Hamei Sauce" was also lil bit different too. Those who are tired of having manchurian/garlic/chili chicken, just give it a try. Hamei sauce was on a hotter & fiery side which comes with a bit fishy & tangy flavour which seems very delicious to me.
We had all these things which merely costs us only Rs. 590. They dont charge any extra tax & the staffs there are very friendly & helpful. Overall we loved Tung Nam very much as we are crazy chinese lovers.
Looking forward to visit again & again💝💝💝

Tung Nam is an age old Chinese Restaurant. Situated near Tiretti Bazar it's quite a shabby place. Don't expect a good decor here. But the food is the star. We opted Chicken Wanton Soup at first as suggested by many people. Quantity was very good but frankly I did not like it much, far better wanton soup is available at other restaurants in Kolkata. For the main course we had Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken in Hamei Sauces. Both the items blown away our minds...so yummy. And quantity was great as well. We were full even before finishing them. I am going there for Chicken/ Pork in Hamei Sauces again for sure. Price is very reasonable and service is good.

Hidden gem. Clear soup, noodles, chili chicken are best. They also known for pork dishes which i dont eat. But still chicken dishes are very good. Much more quantity in that price. So keep that in mind while ordering. Very much pocket friendly.

This place on my list for quite a long time..
Finally made a sudden plan and went there for some evening munch....

I am not going review this place on decor as this place is not known for their fancy decor, the art they master at is cooking..
We were damn excited to taste their chilli pork and wonton..

Checked in their way early it will be near 6 pm..
Without wasting much time we ordered wonton soup and chilli pork....
The pork wonton came : It was pretty good.. ample amount of pork filling wrapped in a thin paper like dough served in a pork flavoured broth.

Then came the Chilly pork : This is the thing I was waiting for...Indeed this is the best chilli pork I ever had.. They have kept every thing about this dish soooo accurate... The perfect cut of meat., every slice of pork had meat and leyer of fat...
Perfectly spiced.. every peices of pork will just melt in your mouth.

Then we ordered mixed noodels and chilli garlic fish: which was not up to the mark and Noodles was greasy , and fish was not good at all.

Overall experience was good..

Must visit for chilli pork.

Tung Nam was on our wish list for a long time & decided to visit here today . The place is not difficult to find if one is familiar to area near Lalbazar , chattawala gully to be precise . For those unfamiliar to the area , if you are coming from Poddar Court towards Central Metro Station take the second lane on the right hand side & you will find Tung Nam at the end of the lane . If you are coming from the opposite direction which means from Central Metro Station via chattawala gully towards Lalbazar then it will be on your left hand side before the Rabindra Sarani & Radha Bazaar Xing , both routes being one-way traffic regulated . The nearby road is dirty , sometimes full of garbages & if it rains then the  road becomes ugly . Parking is an issue on the working days though much easier on weekends .
The decor of the place is not much to talk about with red wooden tables & plastic chairs forming the sitting area . Service was done by the owner madam who combines as the waiter &  manager &  everything . So far there was nothing much exciting about the place & we ordered the following taking advise from madam ...
Chicken stemed wonton : My 3 year old son is very choosy about anything he eats & doesn't touch the food unless the taste satisfies him . After taking the first bite of wontons he uttered " bhalo khete " ( nice to eat ) & " tasty ".That expression is sufficient to describe the dish as heavenly . The wontons with steamed spinach & spring onion changed the whole perception of the place . 
Pepper Chicken : Tried another appetizer & it was good too . The dish Contained a piece of lemon & the combination of lemon & pepper was brilliant . 
Chicken hakka noodles : Quantity is more than sufficient for a person . It had generous amount of chicken & other vegetables . Tastewise it was very good .
Chicken in hamei sauce : Again quantity is adequate with eight boneless pieces of chicken served with sauce , capsicum & onion . The gravy was not very spicy & went very well with noodles .
Chilly Pork dry : Simply mouthwatering . Pork was nicely cooked & it's fat had turned soft & juicy . Quantity was again adequate . 
Price is very very reasonable compared to quality & quantity .
The owner madam offered our son two packs of Munch which showed her care & love for the guests .
Overall it was like we had gone to a relative's place for lunch & came back after spending some quality time with great food . 
Highly recommended for foodies whose main objective is to get quality food .

asking for Chinese delicacy in Kolkata everyone will say "China Town (Tangra)" without any doubt..
but very few people know about Teritti Bazar / Poddar Coart area where very old & popular Chinese restaurants located, and Tung Num is one of the Best..
It can be defined as the Chinese Nostalgia of Bengali's..

very old and Traditional style of seating n Decor.. very simple but prompt service.. 
but very good quality and quantity of foods.. with a pocket friendly price...
a single plate of main course and side dish are good for two..

in small.. if you love to eat.. this is the perfect place..

This is truly a hidden gem. After a long wait finally we visited this restaurant. The expectations were high; and this place did not disappoint me. If you want mouthwatering, wondering, mind-blowing, authentic Chinese food (i hope you do), then you must visit this restaurant. We tried their chicken salt paper, chicken in hamei sauce, hot and sweet pork garlic and sezwan mix rice. Every dish was my favourite (i dont know how thats possible). I will be returning to try their every dish 😊........

Tung Nam is a very popular name of Chinese in this city.Located in the new terreti bazar area Tung Nam serves decent chinese over years.
Wonton Soup (Chicken) is really amazing,it's delicious in taste,a highly recommended one of them.We have also tried the Manchow soup,enjoyable it was.
In appetizer one should try their Fried Spring Chicken,it's crunchy and excellent in taste.
Chicken hakka noodles is suitable in noodles,enjoyable.Chilli fish was fine with the noodles,fish was tasty and palatable.Schezwan prawn was satisfactory in taste and delightful.
May be the ambience is not like the other restaurants with sophisticated interiors and designs but this place will give you immense pleasure with their quality chinese.A must try for chinese lovers.

Located in one of those alleys inside Bara Bazaar, this place serves some of the most authentic Chinese in Kolkata. Take the help of Google Maps for locating the place and delve into the awesome food served by this place. But before going into the food, you will be taken aback by the warm and hospitable nature of the man who acts as the waiter of the place. We had Pork Yam Wonton for appetizer which looked a lot like a shredded form of our roadside momo but tasted delicious. We had Chicken Fung Mee Mein and Pork Manchurian for main course. Both dishes were adequately served for a couple of people and would fill you to the brim. The Fung Mee Mein tasted characteristically sweet and complemented very well with the Pork Manchurian. All in all, don't expect any ambience while coming to this place but do expect plenty of quality food without burning a hole in your pocket.

I had yaam wonton which I think was the best item of my ordered food. Next I had mixed meifoon and chilli chicken which were really very ordinary. I am not very sure about had gone wrong but honestly I was not very impressed other than for the wonton of course.

Had been in my bucket list for quite some time. If you're coming by metro, get down at Central, and come out of Gate 6. It's very easy to locate. Just turn on your GPS. There is a Pou Chou factory outlet beside it. You'll get the feel of north Kolkata.

Just make sure if you're coming for lunch, make it before 3pm. It's not in a very hygenic place, but the red wooden tools and tables are very welcoming.

For starters we ordered the chicken wanton soup. One of the best I've ever tasted. Authentic dumplings with generous amount of chicken in a soup. A must try.
Next we tried their mixed fried rice and chicken hakka noodles. The quantity given was huge. Two people can easily eat from a plate and still feel stuffed. I repeat, do not order more than a plate for two people.
Mixed fried rice had everything in it. Chicken, eggs, prawns, and pork. The chowmein too had a lot of veggies and chicken in it.
Next we tried their very famous pork in hamei sauce. Well, it was one of the best pork dishes ever found.

We were totally satisfied with such a wonderful meal. The uncle who served us, was all in smiles and very welcoming. Also, they would let you eat peacefully even after 3pm. It's just that the shutters are down.

Take the lane opposite gate no. 6 of central metro station... After about 7 minutes walking distance from there you will reach this small restaurant which barely qualifies as one (so nothing much to talk about the ambience really)...
But if you talk about the food... They specialise in that... I have had chicken gravy noodles at many places but the quality which they provide here is mind blowing... Talking about the quantity, it goes hand in hand with the former...
Have been here multiple number of times... And they never fail to amaze me with their food!!!
Pricing is reasonable if not on the lower side!!!
So if you are low on your pocket and ambience doesn't matter then i would say make this restaurant one of those in your checklist!!! You won't be disappointed..
P.s. haven't tried their pork dishes but have heard much about them...

Location wise it has just 3mins walking distance from central metro station & take gate no. 5 for the shortest distance.

Ambience is not equivalent to today's restaurant. Decor wise it's pretty simple but I'm not bother about all of the these when the food is good.

We ordered #pepper_fish #mix_rice #pork_rice #fish_garlic #pork_hamei_sauces. At the end we ordered pepper fish again, which we treated as desert & it was bang on, on the second time also.

So at the end it is an authentic Chinese restaurant near "Tiretti Bazar". They serves good quality food at relatively low price which also bottle up stupendous taste.

We ordered Mixed fried rice and mixed haka noodles with schezwan pork and pork in hamei sauces. Both the rice and the noodles were good in portion, can easily be shared by two. Though both the dishes were good, i found nothing extraordinary. The pork dishes were really good. The schezwan pork was spicy with eight small pieces of pork. The taste was really good. The dish i liked the most was pork in hamei sauces. The taste was very different from anything that i ever had. Overall experience was good.

any idea why they use so much of oil in Chinese items?  some where this over oily dishes will kill the flavors they are trying to add. it was quite a turn down for us. Everything else was fine. service and cleanliness is quite commendable at this price range. we ordered dry chili garlic paper chicken, dry chili pork, Dry chicken in hamei sauce and Mixed Fry Maifoon. the pork item and the chicken in hamei sauce was over oily. Not sure if close to authentic Chinese dishes have this much of oil or not. My expectation was too high for this place.

This is one of my all times Favourite food joints when its winter time. This is located near central bus stoppage. you just have to take the road towards poddar court and go straight, and then you will find Tung Nam on your left. This restaurant has a homely atmosphere. They do not have ac but fans. I went there for so many times and had so many food items there with no regrets for a single dish. The staffs are very cordial and very attentive. one should definitely try their pork preparations. They do serve amazing quality of pork. But I don't like their fish items as much as I do their chicken, prawn and pork items. Beware of their quantity!! They really give a portion of food which is a way more than enough for two people. So before ordering for so many things at once try to keep the ordering one by one. This is really a pocket friendly restaurant and for so many years they has kept their food quality and quantity same. That is why I love this place so much. Nothing to say much. Just go their and check out their menu and make yourself overloaded with some delicious food!!

The food here is amazing. Its authentic chinese, and flavours are very subtle and easy on the palette. And the portion sizes are absolutely huge.
We ordered Pepper Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Hakka Chicken Chow, Hongkong chicken and Pork Hamei Sauces. All the dishes were tasty. The place is ran by a chinese lady and she is quite friendly.
The tables are a bit small for 4 people and the ambience is not quite upto the mark. They do not chargs taxes and is extremely pocket friendly. For 3 people, our pocket pinch was 720.
P.S. The portion sizes are indeed huge. We 3, all foodies had a tough time to complete all the dishes. A must visit,and will come back soon.

We ordered fried wontons and ‘Mixed Fried rice with Pork Hamei Sauces’. The amount of rice served was truly more than adequate for two people, and the assortment of of prawns and meat that went into it filled our bellies to the brim. Though the taste of pork was richly pronounced, we were expecting the gravy to be more... saucy. What we absolutely loved was the tangy red chilli chutney that came in the small steel containers— it utterly compliments the wontons. The ambience was mellow, the service satisfactory and promt, and the prices justified.

Date of Visit – 06/05/2017

Location – It is located in Chattwala gully on back lanes of Poddar Court building. It is hardly 5 minutes walk from central metro & 2 min walk from lal bazaar.

Ambience – It has small entrance but when you enter the place you find it reasonably big. It's around 40 seater eatery with wooden red tables & plastic chairs. It's a non AC eatery but in scorthing hot also you feel very comfortable there.

Service – They came and took our order as soon as we took our seats. They also agreed to prepare for us a out of menu vegetarian dish. Food serving time was also excellent.

Food & Description – We as part of Facebook group 'Good Vegetarian Food of Calcutta' are on a hunt to try authentic Chinese food. What better place to try Chinese food is to try this legendary eatery. Its authentic Chinese food at its best. Though Chinese food are non-veg oriented but we managed to try some excellent veg dishes here whose taste is unmatchable. Coming to the food:

Crispy Chilli Babycorn – It was crispy, spicy, tasty and had great flavours which is different from any other restaurants. Recommended

Veg steam rice with veg stew – Only a legendary can pull this dish out this way. It was not in the menu and we requested them to prepare one special dish for us as we very pure vegetarian. It was just awesome. Can go miles to have it. A must try here.

Veg Hakka Noodles – It was perfectly prepared. Quantity was huge. Taste was excellent. Recommended


Veg Hot & Sour - It was one odd dish from this gem of the Chinese food eatery. Though it has loads of veggies but it's sauce was not the best. Not recommended.


Overall the experience was great. Food was excellent authentic Chinese food. Though it is non veg oriented eatery but veg dishes which were very limited were also excellent. Highly Recommended.

Pocket Pinch - 300 for 2 approx.

Any restaurant review is basically divided into 4 parts, 
Quality of food,
Decor/interiors,
Service and 
Ambience.
But this place doesn't need to go past the first criteria,
FOOD.

FOOD is awesomer than the awesomet.
Especially pork. 
Best is "chilly pork dry". One of the best I have had in Kolkata.
Better than many top notch restaurants of Kolkata.
This place holds a special position in every foodies heart only for the food.
Cost is highly reasonable. Can be afforded by any average Kolkata restaurant hopper.
Decor/interiors is decent and doesn't promise too good an ambience but as much as one can enjoy the delicious food without fail. 
The place is non AC yet comfortable.
Waiters are very courteous and caters to everones needs. Gives home delivery in central Avenue area. 

I have visited this place multiple number of times and only for the Pork Chili dry and pork fried rice and have never regretted.@

Serves really delicious and tasty chinese food.. we have tried fried chicken wonton,crispy chilli baby corn,chicken fried rice,chicken hakka noodles, chicken schezwan and chicken hamei sauce.. all the items were superb except hakka noodles.. especially fried rice and chicken hamei sauce were mouth-watering.. pocket friendly price and the quantity was also very satisfactory. Food quality was beyond my expectation as I mentioned above.. they provide good service also. Really a 'Gem' for food lovers..

I kid you not each dish is enough to feel two tummies! 
Must try Pork Hamei sauce.  Or if you ain't into pork,  try the hot garlic chicken and for vegetarians veg hot garlic.  Food is amazing, ambience just right if you are with your group.

It may not be well decorated,may not have ac, but from the aspect of the quality of the chinese food it is a legendary restaurant situated at teritti bazar near poddar court (from the central metro take exit through gate no. 5). The ambience was not so good. There were some plastic chair tables. If you want to go to the washroom, you have to pass through the kitchen. We ordered chicken salt paper , chicken fried rice and pork hamei sauce. That chicken salt pepper was outstanding.(5/5) Never had so delicious chinese starter as it before.Chicken fried rice was nothing special.. Just a ordinary fried rice full of chicken.(3.5/5) And last but not the least the pork hamei sauce(5/5). It was beyond the description. The pork was prepared in hamei sauce for which this restaurant is known for. If you visit here, dont miss it. Really its a hidden gem of Kolkata.

They refer it as “hidden Gem” but for the true Chinese food lovers in Kolkata this place is indeed gem but not at all hidden; Tung Nam is glorious with the shabby interior, old red plastic chairs, no ac, and real good Chinese food! There are few places, which are for me cult when it comes to the typical choice of food, irrespective of how plain looking the joint is, how simple the location is, whether the place is air-conditioned or not! I never thought to write about Tung Naam before though I am going there from the growing up years. In fact, I first visited Tung Naam with my father years back when I told him that I wanted to taste real good Pork. Baba loves his portion of Pork and so I am and naturally, Baba decided for the “Parar Dokan”, well almost, as the place is kind of walking distance from my central Kolkata residence. Probably his intention was to help his daughter to indulge the real goodness with moderate price. In fact, that was the first time I tasted Pork and since then Tung Nam is the place for my portion of Pork loaded comfort. After that, I visited Tung Nam several times with Dad as well as with my friends and cherished my food there. As I already mentioned I never thought to write about the place before but as they say better less than never. Probably that is what comfort food does to us, we cherish it, we indulge it without even thinking of sharing the experience. In addition, my last visit was a bit special as it was with my blogger friends and few other foodies who enjoy their portion of Pork.  Those who are not aware of the place, Tung Nam is a famous but small food joint near Podder Court and is famous for their Chinese spread.
                                          ...

This place is a hidden gem in kolkata. Service was pretty good. There was an old man who himself suggested us  about what to order and food was marvellous, no doubt about that. If you can eat a lot then only order one complete plate for yourself otherwise sharing a plate is a good option since the quantity of food is too much.
 Ambience of the place might not be a treat for the eye but for real food lovers like me it doesn't matter.

Note: Pork Chilli is a must order so make sure you don't forget to try out Pork Chilli.

Came to know about this place last year from a friend and a relative and finally tried this place last week ..! 😇
This place is definitely one of the hidden Chinese gems of calcutta .. which not many of you know about .. 
location :-  3.9/5 
it's in a lane near territary bazar if you are going from central avenue then you have to take that lane which takes you to Poddar court and then your restaurant destination will on your way ..! Sounds quite like that google assistant.. 😂 .
Service :- 4/5 
The service is quick and very fast . 
Ambience:- 4/5 
It's a small place in the group floor of a house run by the family themselves 
Food:-4/5 
The food light and tasty ... and the quantity was good for two people as well .. we ordered chicken egg fried rice , with garlic fish and chilly chicken dry .. in starters there was prawns balls .. ginger chicken dry .. all of them were tasty and delicious 
Value for money -4/5 
Not that expensive and very affordable .! 

If you have a love for Chinese food do try out this hidden gem of Chinese cuisine .!

Food? I've been to many of Chinese restaurants. I love Chinese. But Food here is one of the worst I've ever eaten. Edible, I mean it's just edible and you'll not throw up. But the peace of mind you crave for in food as a foodie, you won't get that. Reception and service is not good either.
I won't go there for a second time..

Went there after saw "HIDDEN GEM" tag on zomato.. Located near Territi Bazaar and Central metro station.. Now coming to my review,

Food ordered - Egg fried rice, Hong Kong chicken, coldrinks.

Food quality was extremely good, it was more than my expectations. Rice quality was top notch and perfectly cooked. Hong Kong chicken was also good at its class, though i was not impressed with the gravy quantity. Overall i find food was fresh and perfect. Ambience was ok ok type nothing special and non AC.. According to the price i was extremely satisfied.. Truely i should say its a HIDDEN GEM.
Should i visit again - Definitely, will love to visit again and again.. A big thumbs up from my side :-)

One can't say enough to justify just how good the food at Tung Nam is. Having come across this little place a few years back, I have made it a point to eat every chance I get. If one can move past the filthy surroundings (garbage dumps, shanties, trucks and what not) this is absolutely the place to be. Of course if you are a fan of Mainland China, don't bother. Tung Nam is all about the food and that's it.

Getting down to brass tacks, the pork here is absolutely divine. Start with the Pork Yam Wonton. It is something else. Then the Pork in Hamei Sauce and Mixed fried rice are my go to dishes. Mei Foon is also pretty much the bomb. To be honest I have tried some other stuff and some dishes can be disappointing. The chicken has on occasion been overcooked. And so, I don't mess with the formula anymore. If strong flavours and something close to authentic Chinese is your cup of tea, this is where you can get your fix. And the servings are massive. 

As a warning to all, the ambience isn't much to write home about. The general area is quite filthy. The food has a very overwhelming flavour. And this is absolutely not a place for vegetarian converts. However if you like pork and genuine flavour, dive in and eat till you can't eat no more.

Are you a typical Chinese Lover or maybe searching for some Authentic Chinese Dish which no one in Kolkata can provide you? Then you should visit here once in a lifetime! Because this place has the authentic Chinese flavour in their every dishes! Situated in typical "China" of Kolkata - Tiretti Bazar! You can say it a hidden gems in Kolkata also though this place has become famous for its Authentic Chinese Touch. 

Coming to the review,
Positive Points
1. Food - Typical Chinese Aroma with a lot of difference in every menu they have! 
2. Serving time - They served within 15-20 mins of placing order! Served Hot! It can burn your tongue! Be careful before eating!
3. Location - The best location where a Chinese restro can be situated! Tiretti Bazar, Burrabazar Area! 5 min walk from Central Metro Station!
4. Staff behaviour - Waiters behaviour are good and they will suggest you to choose your dishes!
5. Pocket Pinch - Absolutely Pocket Friendly with zero tax included in their overall bill!

Negative Points:
1. Ambience and Decoration - Yep, this is the point where they can improve a lot! They don't have that ambience and decoration like Chowman or Santa's Fantasea! Absolutely "normal hotel" look in a place like North Kolkata!

We ordered two items:
1. Pork Ham Choy Rice - Loads of Picec of Pork and Hamchoy are cooked and spread over a good amount of White Rice! Delicious and Yummy Gravy!
2. Prawn Hamei Sauces - Prawn balls made in Hamei Sauces. Delicious & Yummy Gravy and Prawn Balls!

The total cost was Rs. 400/- only! Very Pocket Friendly as I mentioned! Please visit, if you are yet to visit this place! Not a place for fancy restaurant lovers but for fantastic, delicious food lovers! Try it, Enjoy some authentic Chinese!

This place serves some really authentic and yummy chinese food!
We visited this place on a food walk organised as a promotional event for a college fest! This place is considered to be the jewel of the city and by seeing crowd over there and the staff; we surely agree!
Now, there are very few options for pure vegetarian folks like us, so if you are a vegetarian,  just skip it. 
We tried Chilli Pepper Garlic Babycorn and Schezwan Veg Manchurian Balls (Dry).
The babycorn was bland and lacked flavours whereas the Manchurian was superb!
Do go to this place if you are a non vegetarian and if you love authentic chinese food!

The best Chinese you can get out of a pocket friendly restaurant as this. A hidden jewel as categorised. The food is very fresh and piping hot. Pork dishes are speciality. Recommend dishes - wanton soup, noodles, pork in hamei sauce. The soup was as fresh as it can get. Beautifully cooked pork with perfect amount of fat on it. A restaurant you can go over and over again.

Tung Nam Eating House is a small joint in Teriti Bazaar. Though it does not look impressive but they are truly one of the best places when one craves for great delicious Chinese. After a day at office, we went there in quest for great Chinese cuisine. We ordered fried wanton pork, prawn fried rice, chilli garlic pepper pork and yaam wanton pork. All the dishes tasted very very good. Although their ambience can seem a little unimpressive, when it comes to food, the taste is surely not a let down. Must go to place if you love Chinese........

Tung Nam is a golden name in the list of Chinese eateries of this city . It's certainly not a new name and those who have had an experience here have certainly come back again . And the reason is their food which is the best possible indianised version of Chinese cuisine . So, those who still have not somehow managed to have a meal here at this legendary outlet, don't expect authentic Chinese meal but the most authentic version of Indian Chinese with a filling experience.

° Location :- Kind of tricky so Google maps suggested for those who are unaware of location specifics . The most popular way is to come by metro and take the central station . On reaching central take the poddar court exit . Once, you are out of the station you will find a Rana Pratap statue just in the front .You will take the left turn and will reach the restaurant after walking 7 to 8 minutes.

° Ambience & Service ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- It is not a place boasting a proper ambience , infact it's as minimal it can get . Few plastic tables and chairs laid down with a capacity of about 25 to 30 people at a time. I didn't see the loo but the washing basin is beside the kitchen so the journey for washing your hands would not give you the best of sights but if you keep those out of your thinking then it will be better for you . The service time was not that fast but considering the time taken by them in cooking up a good meal I am not complaining much .

---------------------------------------------

° Food :- Okay so let's now come to the part where they show their true colors . Me and my partner had 3 dishes and these 3 dishes simply had every ingredients in them to make it a fulfilling Chinese food experience . If you are a completely novice to Tung Nam or Chinese food these 3 dishes will surely blow your mind .

1. Chili garlic pepper chicken ( 5 / 5 ) :- What an appetizer . You won't find this name in the menu because it was suggested by them . We just asked for the best chicken starter available and that's what they suggested . When the dish came we were blown over . There are 8 pieces of the pan fried chicken , which are the softest i have eaten.  Some of them had some chicken fat in them so i was having an awesome time . The pan fried chicken was done to perfection and there were tiny hints of pepper and chopped green chilli on the top . Overall , it is a fantastic starter dish . Moreover , the best dish that can go with alcohol . If you order this item you will know what a fantastic chicken starter dish is all about .

2. Mixed schezwan fried rice ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- The 0.5 was deducted by me because there was nothing schezwan about this rice item . It was not the spicy as we expected it to be . But damn it was so good . The authentic flavour of fried rice and served with a more than generous amount of chicken , prawn and fried egg pieces . Every spoonfull of this dish will give you an overdose of prawn and chicken.  Such a fine fried rice , it deserves to be in one of the best dishes list . The quantity is a lot for 2 petuk people like us . Absolutely highly recommended .

3. Pork hamei sauce ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- The superstar dish of this restaurant and the popularity is fully justified . A pork item seems to be quite a favourite for old Chinese restaurants of Kolkata . And being a pork lover myself I could not resist the temptation of ordering this and my expectations were fulfilled . Tender pork pieces and not slices ( number of pieces were more than 8 ) are cooked in an amazing sauce which has a slight garlic aroma . The dish is such that it will compliment any staple side dish . The pork pieces with the right amount of fat will taste amazing in the mouth . A must must try out item for any pork lover . 

-----------------------------------------

° Verdict :- It certainly won't take my verdict to let u know how important it is for any Chinese food lover to visit this restaurant . Instead I will highlight the main points of this amazing legendary restaurant .

1. Superb starter items . Along with the mentioned item pork noodle soup is also recommended .
2. Even better staple. Any fried rice and chilli garlic noodle will blow your mind .
3. A plethora of amazing pork dishes with hamei sauce being the topper . A must visit for pork lovers .
4. Generous and smart service . 

I have not attached the bill because of its poor state I could not take a snap . But my bill came around 570 which is totally okay for me considering the quality and quantity of the 3 amazing dishes . The meal is more than enough for 2 people . A legend in the list of Chinese restaurants of the city .

I can proudly say that this is one hidden gem of Kolkata. A must if you want to try the authentic Chinese cuisine. Been there a number of times. Nothing can beat the joy of relishing the hot pork wonton soup in a winter evening followed by the hot and spicy pork szechwan. Previously, it used to be a shabby place, but recently, they have renovated the place, which, in my opinion, has somehow reduced that old-world charm. Nevertheless, the food and the staffs are still the same. Still awesome.

The Chinese restaurants in and around Tiretti bazar are renowned, and we were quite excited to try out Tung Nam.
It's a small, inconspicuous place (we actually walked past it, before Google Maps corrected us). Ambience is nothing impressive, but everything is clean and hygienic.
But oh, the food! It's right up there among the best Chinese restaurants I've visited, and can easily give several bigger and more popular restaurants a run for their money. We started off with fried Pork Wantons, which were delightfully crisp on the outside and juicy inside. Next up was the mixed Fried Rice and Pork in Hamei sauce, both of which lived up to the expectations set up by the wantons. The fried rice was heavily laden with shredded chicken, prawns and pork. The pork dish was excellent, the Hamei sauce enhancing the taste without being too overpowering. The healthy portion size and pocket friendly pricing will delight those (like me) having big appetites.
In conclusion, the place is a must for Chinese food lovers, and those looking for great food without being concerned about ambience. I will definitely visit again.

Tung Nam is a shabby looking place near Territi Bazar. Quite close to my place. This place is well known and popular all over Kolkata for Pork lovers. We had Pork Kaptai soup which is made with liver and offals. Pork Pak Choy was the next dish and we had it with steamed rice. Also had a specially requested dish Pork in char siu sauce to end the meal.Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Tung Nam is a famous restaurant serving authentic Chinese dishes, located at Barabazar.

Ambience and decor is very simple and have a homely feel. 

Service is bit slow but staffs are very cooperative.

Tried Wanton Chicken soup, Chicken Hakka Chowmein & Hot Garlic Chicken. 

Soup was lipsmacking , a must try.

Chowmein had ample fillings and was well made.

Hot Garlic Chicken was mouthwatering and spicy.


Pocket pinch is reasonable. 

Quantity is sufficient for two people.

If one mind the ambience, it's better to pack your food coz the food is amazing.

There foods are simply super. Very good Cantonese food is what you get and that too at quite cheap price. Run by a family. Interiors are nothing to write about but quality and quantity are very good. Though the hotel location is not so good but the food are real authentic Chinese. Their dumpling soup and chilli pork are just awesome. If you are fan of Chinese food don't miss this joint.

This is as authentic as Chinese can get. Tung Nam is located near the tiretta Bazar telephone exchange building. Tiretta Bazar is a very famous place, to almost all the people in Calcutta owing to its heritage. A significant part of the Chinese community resides in the tiretta bazaar area and it's one of the best places where you can taste authentic Chinese food.
--------------------------
--------------------------
We reached the restaurant at around 5:30-6ish. The restaurant actually has two working hours. It serves lunch and then again opens at 6pm for dinner services. The restaurant has a very homely feel to it. And it has Chinese decorations adorning the walls. The decor is minimalistic and thus it let's the food be the real hero.

Since we were only two people, we couldn't order much. We ordered chilli "baby corn" and "prawn Fung mee mein". The staff was really helpful in guiding us through each and every dishes. The quantity is quite satisfactory according to the price. And the preparations are really amazing.
Chilli baby corn - this is the first time I had something like this... It's not the usual crispy chilly baby corn that we usually order from the Chinese section of popular restaurants. This particular dish was a simple preparation of baby corn lightly coated in batter and crisply fried to perfection and then tossed in a wok with seasoning and chilly and onion, ginger and garlic. It was simple and TASTY!

Prawn Fung mee mein-- Since my friend wasn't into spicy food, we asked the waiter to suggest us something sweet from the noodle section and he suggested us this. It was your plain wok tossed Hakka noodles, but with a twist. It was tossed in a sweet prawn sauce. This was a beautiful and one of a kind dish.. that I had never tried before.
I have heard that this place is one of the cheapest places to have the tastiest of Chinese pork preparations.

The only qualm that I have regarding this place is the service. The service was really slow, we had to wait for atleast 45 mins for the food to arrive.
Apart from that the restaurant stole my heart. The place is amazing, do give this place a try!
Cheers! 🍻

Been to this place with my friends to try out some pork dishes and their wanton soup which some friends have recommended.
Unfortunately wanton was not available so we had to settle for the mains.
The dishes include:
Garlic pork hot and sweet
Chilli roast pork
Pork in hamei sauce
Pork fung mee mein
Pork in ham choy rice
Special mentions for the chilli roast pork, it is awesome perfectly cooked pork slices tossed in a chilli and  five spice flavour sauce which takes  it to a different level. 
The pork ham choy rice can not be for everyone, steamed rice served with a pork stew which is finished with shaoxing wine, might not be for everyone.
pork in hamei sauce, tender pork jullien fried and cooked in a shrimp sauce, the shrimp paste flavour might tickle your taste buds, so be prepared.

We visited Tung Nam after reading so many good reviews and it really was worth it. 
Veg schezwan fried rice was very light and delicious. Not spicy as hell or red in colour but good in taste. Quantity is really satisfying. It is more than enough for 2 people. 
Chicken hamei sauce was a new preparation I tried. Our server said in was prepared in a sauce made with prawn and red chillies. This preparation also was good. Its enough for 2 people. 
Its a shabby place in terms of decoration. Service was good. The location of this place was the only thing which I didn't like. I would recommend ladies to visit this place preferably for lunch.

Authentic Chinese food at reasonable prices. The only place in Kolkata that offers meat in hamei sauce. They serve pork at cheap rates. A small eatery offering variety of dishes. A good place to go for a lunch. :)

After miles of tracking and descrying we finally encounter with this incognito hub serving the truest sense "authentic Chinese food" on their plates.
Shabby, small and concealed, we surely discovered the "Shangri-la of Chinese cuisine" in the heart of central Kolkata.
The #PorkHamChoyRice filled with a mysterious concoction of all the possible spices and sauces along with a potent flavour of fish sauce is to kill for!

For some people this is like the best chinise food resto ever. Dad used bring fried rice ane chili chicken when i was in school,it was always good. I just had food at a friend's place from here recently, we had crispy ckn,scezwn ckm,fried rice all were good,but the place is a bit unclean and shabby. Take out would be a good option

Tung Nam is a shabby looking place near Territi Bazar. Quite close to my place. This place is well known and popular all over Kolkata for Pork lovers. Their pork dishes are just brilliant to try.
I visited with few of my friends for Lunch and here are the items we tried.
• Pork Garlic : Very good I must say. Comes with eight pieces of Pork.
• Pork Schewan : Pork fried with Schewan Sauce in it. Was hot but taste was very good.
• Pork in Hamei Sauce : This flavor was bit new to me. So decided to try. Pork and Pork Fat very soft and in small pieces in Hamai Sauce. Light and less spicy but the taste was brilliant. This is must try here. The problem is one dish is more then enough for two person. And you won't like having the same thing repeatedly. So its very good if you go in a group of four.
With this we took
•Schewan Chicken Fried rice. Rice was very good and quantity was huge. One dish can feed two person well.
Next we took,
• Chicken Chow Mein hakka. This came in white color, very less fried and not spicy. This went really well with the Schewan Pork.
.
The place lacks decor, but if you are looking for excellent food, Tung Nam is for you. Prices are very reasonable. We six friends had a lunch and the bill was Rs.1200 only. So very very pocket friendly.
.
Must visit.

This is a small cozy little joint in tereti bazaar area, but don't let the decor fool you; once you've eaten food here, there's no going back.. No Chinese will taste the same. It's amazing. Pork yam wantons, chili pork, garlic chicken, Tom yum soup are just some of the best I've tasted. I have been going to this place since I was a kid and it is still one of my favorites.

This place has been in my wishlist for long being a legendary outlet of our city.I have been here on Sunday for dinner with a friend.I came here with sky high expectations seeing such rave reviews.But I was let down terribly.The ambience is nothing to talk about.Honestly I didn't expect a good decor.Came here for some good old Kolkata style Chinese..but food failed to impress.It wasn't worth the effort to find it by so much struggle with google maps, locals, calling at the restaurant..it needed all of these.

The man serving asked us to order everything at one go.So we asked ordered a lungfung soup(small),mixed fung mee mein and pork in hamei sauces.
Now however the place be crowded..how long does it take to serve a bowl of soup? After 20mins passed we started calling out to the servers who kept ignoring us.We even saw few groups of people getting served before us who arrived later.We pointed it out to a lady(maybe the owner/manager) who quite blatantly denied it by saying that doesn't happen.When we asked about arrival of the first course she gave excuse of the crowd(it was 30mins late then).

•Lung fung soup(S)-Finally the soup arrived 45mins later! The prawns and meat in it was fresh and soup was thick.But that was all about it.Where was the seasoning? It also lacked the zing of spice and tanginess that I usually tasted in lung fung soups.This here was totally bland.

Thankfully our next courses didn't arrive this late.After our soup was over we were served with the mains which were better.

•Mixed fung mee mein-The portion was pretty huge.Its more for even two people.Thick of noodles were used which was good.It had a hint of sweet flavour and aroma which was something new that I tried and liked it.But the noodles were soaked in a pool of oil! I am not among too health conscious people and I am fine with oily stuffs.But here it was used it excessive amount..even more than that of roadside chowmein stalls! Completing huge portion of the dish with so much oil made it a uphill task for us.

•Pork in hamei sauces-It was the only saving grace of the night.The pork meat pieces were tender and well cooked.The meat to fat proportion was perfect.The sauce..my God! It leaves u wondering what they used in it to make such a unique flavoured beautiful sauce.When u take a spoonful of it it first gives a tangy feel..then surprisingly u taste something spicy tingling your tongue.This was sensational dish.

Pocket pinch is really low.But I am not sure about coming back here for a meal after this disappointment.

After careful consideration I must admit that the wonton here in Tung Nam is better than Eau Chew as a complete package inspite of the filling being a tad better at the latter's.

This tiny but popular hole in a dingy but bustling lane in Territi Bazaar is a surprise to your palate as well as the wallet. Many office goers seem to be frequenting this place along with serious food lovers who take the trouble to come here and more so if Pork is in your agenda.

We ordered a soup and the broth reminded me of the Galbi Tang a type of beef soup that I used to have in Seoul - and it was delectable. I wish I had ordered one more!! 

The fried wontons were ordered due to pure temptation since we saw it on a neighbouring table and it was not a mistake. The roast Chilly Pork with its fatty pork slices and the hot sauce and chillies were a pig lover's  delight. 

The Pork Yaam Mein (read Noodles lightly tossed in lard with bits of fat, meat and shallots was one of the best that I have had. Simple yet grand!! We also had the ginger pork ( meat balls napped with a not so sweet sauce). But I could have continued with the noodles without any accompaniment. 

If you have been here earlier I am sure you have turned into an addict and if you haven't I guess you are losing out on time!!

Tung Nam is a small restaurant which offers a good variety of Chinese food. Had been there in a group of 11 people and the bill came upto something slightly more than 2400. The food was quite good but the quantity of the noodles surprised us. They were really filling or may be more than that. The ambience is not that great. It's a good place to try out pork. I can't say much about the taste as I didn't try it myself, but my friends said they were pretty good. The owner is very friendly and she herself comes to take the orders. It's pocket friendly and I can say it's a good joint for students to fill their tummy. Not sure if I'd visit the place again but also don't regret going.

The restaurant is a hidden gem located in the lanes of teritti bazaar serving authentic chinese food...having seen good reviews about the joint decided to go for a dinner with my father
Decor and Ambience-Nothing much...there are a few chinese show pieces and pictures to give a feel of chinese restaurant..the place doesnot have air conditioning..you will be dissapointed if you are looking for a classy restaurant
Food-The best part...we ordered wonton soup,chicken in hamei sauce and american choupsey

Wonton soup was the best of the lot...super hot soup with succulent wontons containing fresh chicken in the winter evening just made my day...and if you add the vinegar and the red hot sauce to it...you will get a new twist to the soup which is eqaully good

Chicken in hamei sauce was just mannchurian balls of chicken in some sort of garlic sauce...served as a nice accompaniment to the american choupsey

American choupsey was also authentic..the sauce and the crispy noodles bended together beautifully and the prawn,chicken and pork gave that extra oomph!!

Service-Not that good beacuse the servers are local people of the locality and sometimes may be rude but presentation of food is prompt

Cost-one plate is enough for 2...very pocket friendly..no vat and taxes.. cost us only 540 rs..

Overall a nice joint to try out some authentic chinese when low on budget...will try their pork the next time!!☺

A lovely little place in the Old China Town area of Kolkata which serves some great pork dishes. We had Pork Kaptai soup which is made with liver and offals. Pork Pak Choy was the next dish and we had it with steamed rice. Also had a specially requested dish Pork in char siu sauce to end the meal. Sadly they don't serve any desserts or Chinese tea which would have made it a much better experience.

When its d end of the month and you have no money to burn,and stillll! Your heart says "CHINESE", then u go out on a hunt and find out the hidden gems like "TUNG NAM".
  Its located in the Sun Yet Sen Street, a lane just on the opposite side of the Central Metro station. Just walk a little & there it is , on d left side.
  Decor- A small room with red tables and plastic chairs, and some Chinese accessories, trying to give it a restaurant feel.
   Food- Its really something to tell about.We had Pork Wonton Soup,Mixed Fried Mei Foon( rice noodles),Pork in Hamei Sauces & Hot and Sweet Garlic Pork. The quantity is more than enough for 2 people. Pork in Hamei sauce is a must try.I had it for the first time and it was really delectable.And all it for Rs.640.
Service is so-so. But the taste and the quantity makes for whatever it lacks.

No such decor or interiors as such, but the food they serve is heavenly. Pork wanton and pork in hamei sauce are outstanding. If you are a fancy person, please don't bother going to this place. It's not that you will be disappointed, it's just they can do without you. It's just for stomach, being an open kitchen you can see that the stuff is clean.

After waiting for long, came the perfect occasion for a treat in this much appreciated Chinese joint. The place might be difficult to find for new comers. But once discovered you will genuinely find it as a hidden gem.

From central metro station go straight towards poddar court, on your left you will see BSNL building, take the lane beside the BSNL building and you will see Tung Naam.

Decor : The place has no air conditioning, the decor is not very fancy, so anyone finding for upscale dining experience will be disheartened. The walls are fitted with wall tiles and have couple of Chinese show pieces including an aquarium and pictures of the deceased members of the owner's family. The kitchen is viable from the dining area and is quite neat and clean.
Food : The soul of the place is the food. Awesomely delicious, large in quantity and authentic to taste. We ordered
Pork fried wanton 10 piece in a plate absolute crisp and tasty.
Chicken wanton soup 10 wanton in delicious hot soup. Add the condiments chilli paste, vinegar chilli and taste just boosts up 100 times.
Mixed rice noodles bit small in quantity but full will chicken , pork, veggies, prawns absolutely delicious to taste.
Mixed fried rice good in quantity, too good absolutely good to taste,
Chilli pork dry just one word , delicious. Well spiced well cooked.
Pork Huimei Sauce, lovely, slight gravy good to taste.
Mixed gravy noodles , wonderfully cooked loads of veggies loads of chicken, prawn, pork

Total bill was Rs 1100.

I realised if asked for they provide chopsticks . Next visit will be for the experience of chop stick.

Went wid loadz of great expectations nd was kind of obsessed abt d place after reading great reviews in various places. But d visit was a disaster even tho I was hungry(a person usually feels evrythng a bit xtra tasty dan it actly is) wen I reached d place. Il not tak abt d ambience coz I went wid no expectation aftr seeing pix nd reading reviews.
D only good thing is pork is well cooked nd juicy lse d preparations wer just pathetic. I've had:-
Dry chilli pork- cheap quality chaat fo booze
Mixed rice noodles- one of d most flat dishes I've ever had, lyk no salt, no heat, no sweetness, no sourness, no nthng still better dan d rest of d dishes we had, 
Pork in hamei sauce- signature item of Tung Nam. Pork fat coated wid some tasteless batter fried in fat nd den tossed in fat wid more fat nd served as a fatty so called gravy item wich 1nce again had no taste
Schezwan chicken- chicken fried in a tasteless batter soo long back dat it bcem stale nd chewy wich was served in a dark red colored hot liquid wich can't b called a gravy...
Deeply disappointed.....

It was s references from a keen that brought me to this place. Very simple as a place pretty basic in terms of ambience.Its quite home like atmosphere.I went all pork with PORK WANTON SOUP to start with and finished up with RICE FRIED MEI FOON (mixed rice noodles ), GARLIC PORK & PORK IN HEMAI SAUCE. Quantity of food is pretty more than sufficient. In fact saw a couple could not finish their food & left. Usage of whole green lettuce in soup gives it a pure Chinese feel. Wanton in soups are good. Racing noodles are precisely boiled neither over nor under boiled. Pork is soft and tender. HEMAI sauce gravy is unique. Staffs are though not professional but patient to customers and even showed courtesy to ask customers about the taste. Over all a good place to try authentic Chinese food in a homely atmosphere. Had a good experience with my girlfriend.

Tung Nam, one of the most authentic and old Chinese restaurant in Kolkata.
Location # Central metro station near Teritty Bazar. No decoration.... Just like an old room of a building . 6 four seater tables, 2 six seater and 2 two seater tables. Total accommodation #40 person.

Food is awesome. Both quality and quantity is superb. Almost impossible to finish a single plate of Gravy Chowmin by two person ( But thanks to my giant appetite, I successfully finished both dishes). First time tasted Pork Hamei Sauces recommend by the serving personal. Really like the taste, never tasted Pork like that before.
Highly recommended for Chinese cuisine.

Tucked away in a small lane beside Poddar court, Tung Nam is the perfect place to savour authentic Chinese food at amazingly low prices. The wonton soup is a must try. The chicken and pork dishes are also very good though a little oily. We ate to our heart's content and still had to get some of the food packed.

This place is indeed a hidden gem. Today  i visited this place along with my friends. In the starters we had chicken wanton soup fried pork wantons and pepper chicken. The food was very good especially the wanton soup. In the main course we had chicken hakka noodles mixed gravy Noodles chicken fried rice  pork in hamei sauce chicken in hamei sauce roast chilli pork and garlic chicken. The pork dishes were brilliant. The quantity of the food was also quite satisfactory. One plate of rice or noodles is enough for 2ppl. Moreover the prices are extremely reasonable and they dont charge any VAT or service taxes.

Awesome food. Had Chilli Garlic Pork (Which was not on the menu) with Pork Wanton Soup. For main course we had Mixed Fried Rice with Pork in Hamei Sauce. The food was just out of this world. The quantity they offer in a plate is more than enough for 2 persons. Their hospitality is legendary, we also got to experience when we told them that we may be running low on cash. A true gem of a find..

Situated in the lane between teritti bazar bsnl office and kolkata improvement trust. Ambience ok. Don't look for decor and ambience. All my rating is for food. Ordered pork yaam wonton,chicken fried rice, pork in hamei sauce,pork hamchoy. Wonton tastes different from other chinese(indian) restuarants. Pork in hamei sauce is also fav. You can try pork yaam mein,an authentic tung naam spcial dish and chilly pork which are also great

One of the best affordable Chinese food destination in Kolkata. Located on the by lanes of Bara Bazar, this place just serves food which is definitely out of this world. 

I visited this place for the first time after going through the reviews of Zomato. And I'm thankful that their reviews are actually true. The ambience is okay, but the food, 'True Love'. 

A perfect place for Chinese lovers and middle class people like me. 😂

This restaurant located in the bylanes of barabazar is part of Kolkata's heritage. The pork items served in this eatery is delectable. I with my friends paid a visit to this eatery. If you are looking for swank place then you will be surely disappointed but if you love food then this is the place. We had pork wantons, chilli pork(dry) and mixed Cantonese chow mein. The pork wantons were something I have never tasted , it left us wanting for more. The chilli pork was equally palatable. The Cantonese noodles is one of the best I have tasted till date. The food left us wanting for more.

The most attractive thing about this place is that it is extremely well distinguished from any other 'Chinese' restaurant we visit around the city. Hygiene is important and is the key to success but sometimes our taste buds forgets that bit about an eatery.
Home is where the heart is but for all CALCUTTANS, HOME IS WHERE THE FOOD IS. AN ICING TO THE CAKE is when the food is homely.
Weekend and a pocket pinch calls for a visit to this place. Beware of the cute little flies though. You might have to kill some on the table (no sign of any in the kitchen) .

A shout out to all the foodies out there..if u haven't been to this place,please visit it asap! Not much difficult to locate,if u take a right turn from central metro station while coming from the side of  Mohammad Ali park, and then walk straight for about 10 mins,u ll be infront of tung Nam! U can always take help of Google maps! While this is not a place where u would be looking for ambience and stuff,trust me after having the food, u ll be left amazed and delighted with ur tummies smiling big..all the dishes taste amazing and comes in huge quantities for a very nominal price! So if u r an absolute food lover,u simply cannot afford to miss this out!

I had ordered today from Tung nam few of their dishes namely mixed fried rice,prawn Hakka noodles and pork prawn rice noodles,pork in hamei sauce,chicken with mushrooms and babycorn,chilli pork. inspite of many negative reviews on the noodles,i was not disappointed at all! It was cooked to perfection.the only drawback was the size of the prawns,so it's best to avoid prawns and opt for chicken and pork instead.each of the dishes were extremely tasty and the quantity was quite a lot.each plate of fried rice could cater to 3 moderately consuming people.overall a lovely experience and affordable too!

This is an authentic Chinese joint of Kolkata. I bet none can find any other place which serves such delicious authentic Chinese cuisine. To be very honest, I always visit there to have pork. So, am not so sure about the Chicken dishes they offer. The location is a bit confusing. One can take the road beside Central Metro station, which leads to Burra Bazaar. Though I will suggest to use Google map. But when you devour the delicacy, you'll certainly forget the hassle. FYI, tax free menu. So, eat as much as you can without getting hole in the pockets. My all time favorite dishes are Pork Wanton Soup in starter, and Pork Gravy Noodles and Pork Hamei Sauces in main course. Quantity is large. Though foodie like me won't like to share such heavenly dishes with anyone. Have fun. Bon appetite.

Over hyped place. Located near a slum, cabs do not prefer to go their. Coming to the restaurant, slow service, ugly place looks like a garagee. Ordered Hakka noodles and Manchurian. Hakka noodles was very very oily, and the Manchurian was tasteless. Well I went to this place only because of the reviews on Zomato and coz it is tagged under the hidden gems section. 100% dissatisfied.

Pork here. . . is a special attraction... I tried the 'fried wonton/ pork' and I didn't like that at all.... But that doesn't mean all items here are bad.... Well other items like gravy noodles ... Fried rice .... Honkong chicken.. Were average to taste

If you are not looking for ambiance and only a place to eat good chinese food this is your place. One plate of rice or noodles is more than enough for two as two of us couldnt finish it off. Chicken pork side dishes were awesm. The hamei sauce gravy was also very nice. Loved the experience

This place was in my wish list for quite long, but I totally lost the interest after experiencing the disgusting food of their Netajinagar outlet just three weeks back. This afternoon we had some office work near Chhatwalla Gully. It was around 2:45 pm, luckily a cloudy sky but no rain. We were hungry and looking for a place to have lunch. When Google suggested us this place I thought why not give it a chance. And man, it was such a prudent decision!
The eatery closes exactly at 3 pm for lunch. Luckily their wall clock was running 180 seconds behind the Indian standard time and for that reason we were able to enter the place. The door was very uninviting with a very small sign board. Most likely you would miss it. So safest option is to ask people nearby.
Inside was extremely unimpressive. No AC but ceiling fans above all tables. A few Chinese wall hangings and that 180 seconds slower wall clock. Cheap plastic plates and steel glasses for water. Opt for bottled water (Rs.25) if you dont trust their water purification system.
We ordered Chicken clear soup (1 by 2), chicken fried rice and Sichuan chicken. In one word, all the dishes were outstanding! The real taste Calcutta Chinese!
The chicken clear soup reminded me of the soup I used to have in Tibetan Delight during my college days. The chicken fried rice was exactly same what we used to get in Selina or Peiping some twenty years back. The Sichuan chicken was lip-numbing and spicy. Taste was very authentic. So far, its the second restaurant in Calcutta after Tak Henk, where I found such an authentic Sichuan flavor. Believe me, its very rare to find such authentic tastes outside the five star Asian/Chinese restaurants.
One plate of each dish was enough for two of us. The total bill was Rs. 385 including the bottled water. No VAT, no ST, no extra charge. The taste, quality, quantity and price blew us off!
I would have have rated 5 but the service could be improved. They left the food on the table but didn't ask if it should be served. Initially didn't give any plates to eat. Upon request gave only one plate for two of us! We used the fried rice plate instead.
So thats it. If you are looking for a pocket friendly authentic Calcutta-Chinese and don't mind so-so service and the non-AC ambiance then look no furher. Tung Nam is undoubtedly the best restaurant in this category.

This place is a jem. Not many know of the place and that is indeed a sorrowful thing. I've visited the place over a a dozen times now and the food has always been spot on. The staff have always been great and helpful. This place honestly feels like visiting a Indo-Chinese family who've put together their best meal for you.

Give this place a try. While the location isn't the best, you can always get a takeout.

This is located in a very dirty place ...just go in front of gate5 central metro..then ask where poddar court is located ..then when you hit the Blackburn road ask for the bsnl office..just located beside that(a beggar heard my conversation and assisted me to the restro when I reached bsnl office) ! . The interior is nothing significant....the heat was just toooo much for me ..NO AC ! . Well coming to the food I order pork.hamei sauce ,mixed fried rice,salt and pepper chicken. Pork is veeeery verry oily and nothing so fascinating abt it expect the quantity ...the salt and pepper chicken is good ( I have had a loot bettr at cit cafe) ..the best was the mixed fried rice ....the hamei sauce which is so famous here is just fried porks in oil ..i didn't get any tatste. Maybe other people will love it . Overall not so great if you want me to say about the quality..but do check out other dishes coz ordering all this just  cost me ₹450.

I have read many good reviews of this restaurant so at last when i visited there yesterday for lunch, my expectation was to experience tasty and fresh food. But i dissatisfied with food quality. We ordered chicken in hamoi sauce and chicken hakka noodles first. Chicken pieces were coated and the dish was too spicy. For noodles, quality was not so good, vegetables used here were not freshly cut, hence smelly. It was not a chinese preparation. Later we ordered schezwan fish dry type. This looked good but some pieces were smelly and the onions were not fresh here too. Still it tastes comparatively better.

I am gonna try to give a straight to the point and simple review ,the main reason for my visit was to try out pork dishes for the first time,
1.Ambiance-3/5
2.service -4/5
3.food-3.5/5

The best thing  about this restaurant is the "quantity" 
which is really impressive,we ordered 2 plates of fried rice and to be honest,it was more  than enough for 3 people

we ordered "pork hamei sauces" as i read about it on zomato,but to be honest,it is not that impressive in my opinion.The gravy was  unnecessarily oily,there were  thin slices of pork,some of which were juicy,and some of them were not,meat which contained little bit fat,tasted bit weird,i would prefer if it was more cooked,or atleast more fried or something,but it had the boiled type of flavour inside,and it could be little more spicy so that the distinct smell of meat and the raw taste could go away,he quantity was again good,my rating would  be 3/5

fried rice was well cooked,quantity was good as i said before,no complaints regarding that,
The restaurant is pocket friendly
The service is good and the "KAKA" is a friendly guy :D

Authentic Chinese cuisine. The food quality & quantity is quite good. A frequent Lunch place for me & my colleagues during Office. A very few Chinese Outlet which is Authentically maintained by Chinese Family. The Restaurant is without any decor & it's Shabbiness is the proof of Long Lasted Chinese tradition in "Territty Bazar" Kolkata better known as "Old China Town". The regular visitors are mostly the office goers from various offices in Office Para. At any day one can find, Reporters of 24 GHONTA or ABP having a debate over a Hot Bowl of Sweet Sour Soup.......As far As the Food is Concern.....It's better to do little leg work & taste the authenticity rather read it in Zomato. Most of the foods if taken 1 plate, can be easily shared by two. Oh ! by the way, don't worry about your pocket, it won't hurt much. 🍜🍝

The tungnam eating house is situated on such a location that it is very difficult to find out if one is not well acquainted with the streets and lanes of Kolkata. It is a very simple place to eat. There is almost no decoration inside. Most of the times you have to wait to get a seat . The food is good. And the price is very reasonable. If you are a Chinese cuisine lover and don't want to punch holes in your pocket then you should definitely visit this place.

Location: Take a metro to Central metro station, get out from the "Tiretta Bazar" gate. Turn right and walk straight for 5 minutes. You should be able to locate "Pou Chang's" production house on your left, and then you'll find Tung Nam to your left.

After reading such rave reviews about this place, I was planning to visit for quite some time. But after reading Dr. Kamalita Mitra 's review, I couldn't resist and I went there the next day itself.

Ambience/Decor : The place seems like a big garage which has been turned in to a restaurant. Chinese motifs adorn the walls and Chinese artefacts are kept for display. Ambience is okayish.

The owner and the staff is very very courteous.

Food ordered:

Chicken fried rice: The quality is ver good. Very flavourful and they put in a lot of chicken. And the quantity is HUGE!! More than enough for 2 people.

Pork in hamei sauces: The flavour of this dish was very new to my palette. The pork was delicious! Good cut if meat was served, not crowded by fatty pieces. The flavour of the sauce was very subtle and not overpowering, so you can taste the pork. Again, the quantity was huge.

Lastly, we had a thumbs up and our bill came to total of ₹300 approx.

Definitely recommended!

If you want a luxurious place to eat then Tung Nam is certainly not that place but if you want to have some good Chinese food in a homely environment then surely this place is perfect. Been here two times. Place is decorated like a common eatery. Food was damn awesome. I have tried fried wonton, fried shrimps balls, mei foon,noodles, fried rice, hamei sauce, Schezwan, Manchurian, ham choy (mixed main course, chicken side dish of all)..every dish awesome. Staff of the restaurant also behaves so politely. One drawback is the location. It's better to get in there from Rabindra Sarani (Chitpur Street) than from Central Avenue.
P.S. tons of gratitude to my friend who told me about this place and went there with me. :D :p

I wanted to visit this restaurant since a long time, but since most of my friends trust big names for good food I never got a chance.
Then almost out of nowhere I met this guy, who is (luckily) almost as adventurous as I am; And somehow I managed to convince him to go on our first date to Tung Nam! That too abandoning a Park Street eatery! :P
But anyway, that first date turned out to be a disaster, as that was a Tuesday and Tung Nam remains closed that day. Both of us were starving so the next best option seemed Dee-lay, after much maneuvering through the dingy blocked roads, dumpsters and perked hand-ricksaws we reached Dee-lay.
As anyone else reading this, all I kept thinking through out the meeting was, this is possibly the worst first date ever!
I don't know how many will ever even think of a first date like that, or how many will agree to go on a second date after such fiasco!
But. Here we are... To one year of tolerating each other, and (ofcourse) to getting fat together!!

P.S.- Some of the dishes that you absolutely must try are:
🔸Wonton Soup
🔸Pork in Hamei sauce
🔸Mei Foons
🔸Fried Shrimp Balls
🔸Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken (it's not in their menu, but go ahead ask the waiter 😉)
🔸Chicken Hamchoy

End of the month , strict budget , still got a craving for a chinese feast ; land here. I tried their MIXED FRIED RICE that came with ample of prawns and pork with the most recommended PORK IN HAUMEI SAUCE , the meat was tender and the sauce was near medium spicy. The quantity of food was way too much for two of us , and very pocket friendly. Though the interior sitting is very basic with red wooden tables and plastic chairs in a non air conditioned room , the food and the pricing makes it up. 
Also It would be great if they start delivery through zomato online ordering.

If you want to taste some great Chinese food at affordable prices then M sure you can't ignore Tung Nam!

Situated in a little bit odd location. First locate the Central Metro Station(Kolkata Medical College side part) then you will find two lane which are coming from Lalbazar Side. Then take the lane which are on left side, walk for 2-3mins and you will find Tung Num on your left side!

Decorations are quite basic, Chinese lantern are hanging, clean and cool so no room left for the question about hygiene level!

My first visit was there with my foody friend

Been there twice in a month. The place is closed on Thursdays , just for information . The only thing which this place lack is a good sitting area decoration and ambience . Though nobody goes to look about for interior decor when u are served great food. And that too at pocket friendly prices . Run by a Chinese family this place serves great pork dishes , especially do not forget to try the Hamei sauce pork, or chicken if u please . A plate of mixed rice or chow , contains a great amount of chicken bits , egg, pork bits , prawns mixed together. Quantity is also good enough. One plate is enough to feed two adequately. Average pocket pinch for two would be 450 to 500

Well this is located a few minutes from prithviraj  chauhan statue at central four point. It used to be a dilapidated building ,not that I was complaining , but in recent times they have done some repair work done and the place looks definitely better but nothing much if you are looking for ambiance . The food has been excellent a couple of times. I generally order pork and fried rice over there, specially the ham choy. But the last two times I had visited they were not very consistent and it had been such a disaster that we couldn't complete our meal. the price and quantity are ok. Hopefully they will be back to their best soon.

I visited this place because of its high rating. It's basically street food - taste wise also nothing great to talk about. The good thing is they are authentic in the sense that they do not make any attempts to appeal to the Indian palate/customers.

Tung Nam probably needs no fancy introduction. Situated at Chhattawala Gali, this is the place which carries the heritage of Chinese dishes in Kolkata.

Chhattawala Gali happens to be in the Old Chinese Settlements in Kolkata. Their recipes changed over the time to suit the Bengali tastebud. Still, this is a place to be. If you notice, you might find their rating for Chinese foods is more than even Taj Bengal... :)

I am not joking... Go for Pork in Hamai Sauces and other pork recipes...

Had heard so much about this place that me and a pal decided to take a walk from Esplanade to there, salivating at the different images of awesome Chinese. You have to take a right just crossing the lal bazar police hq building. The restaurant is extremely low key and we crossed it and had to come back again. If you're looking for a casual dining experience with dim lights, AC, music you would do good to look for other places however if you, like me, would walk till your feet bled for some soul satiating food then my friend, you have come to the right place. We took a corner table. The eatery wasn't crowded when we entered. About 8-9 tables. A round one for large groups. An old man came to take our order. Since we didn't have much time and were viciously hungry we went for a chicken fried rice and a chicken in haimei sauce (suggested by the man). The water was served in steel glasses and the food was delivered to us in about 10 minutes in fibre plates. Amazing quantity. Taste? Superb. One may ask how we can judge a restaurant by trying the most common item. I for one think if you can't go right with the common items you should definitely fail with the specials. Fried rice was so perfectly cooked. Rice al dente with ample amounts of chicken, egg and veges. Haimei chicken is something I'm gonna try from now on. Chunky boneless chicken pieces cooked in a prawn flavoured sauce with spices that well complemented the rice. It is a spicy dish and we could feel the flavours of the chicken and the fish sauce distinctly. Our meal set us back by 270 bucks. I would be visiting here for takeaways or dine ins often.

However I wouldn't recommend it at all to anyone looking for an ambience.

Don't judge a book by its cover - this idiom aptly describes  a meal at Tung Nam, ignore the décor and concentrate on the food. When   you think of Calcutta Chinese food ignore tangra for once and seriously consider this place, because boy is the food amazing. Ever since the first time I ate here I have not been able to touch Chinese food anywhere else in the city, and I'm being completely serious. If there was the option of giving a 6 on 5 in Zomato I would have used it. No place in Calcutta does better Chinese than Tung Nam and definitely not at the same price.

Located in the lanes of teretti bazaar( old china potty of kolkata as it is known), this place is a real heaven for all Chinese lovers (don't go for the interiors of the restaurant) ...I have visited this place 5times and finally writing a review.
Yesterday I visited Tung Nam with 4 of my friends. We ordered pepper fish, chicken in hamei sauces, chicken garlic, roast chilli pork (my fav item in Tung Nam), schezwan rice and chicken fried rice.
Starting with the roast chilli pork...according to me they are the best in this in town and if you like spicy foods then go for schezwan rice with this...
Chicken hamei sauces and chicken garlic was also very tasty, specially the one in hamei sauces. The pepper fish was little above than ok.
But once you visit there don't miss their ROAST CHILLI PORK.

A hidden gem located in Central Calcutta in the old Chinese colony near Poddar Court. If you are looking for ambience you would be a tad disappointed.The place is not equipped with air conditioners either. However if you are looking for a good old Chinese meal at a reasonable rate this would be a perfect destination. Their food is simply delicious and the prices are pocket-friendly. We tried their chilly pork, pork in hamei sauce and the pan fried chicken noodles. They served sizeable portions which will surely fill your stomach even if you have a gluttonous appetite. Would surely visit this place again to explore other options in the menu.

Well the place doesn't look extraordinary. You might even walk past it without even noticing it. So be careful... Coming to the food,it is just the opposite. Its just lovely.. We ordered fried chicken wonton, chicken fried rice and chicken hamshei. The starter (wonton) tasted great with the chili sauce provided at the tables. The chicken fried rice rather looked like egg fried rice as only a few strands of chicken were there in an entire plate. On the contrary, plenty of egg was there. The chicken hamshei had an essence of prawn. It complemented the fried rice nicely.
To wrap up, the food was lip-smacking and this place is a must visit for chinese food lovers.

Although the interiors of this restaurant seem a bit quaint, the food more than makes up for it. 
The food is amazing! They serve a wide variety of dishes which are available at a very reasonable price. 
My favourite remains their mixed hakka noodles and chilli chicken with gravy. Only letdown is that they tend to use a lot of oil which makes the food a bit oily. Otherwise the taste is something that will keep making you go back for more. 
If you really love chinese, this is one restaurant you must try out!

Kolkata, the city from where Indian Chinese originated, offers different types of Chinese eateries today, as far as food is concerned. From places advertising themselves as authentic Chinese eateries to the highly Indianized Chinese, and a lot of layers in between them. Tung Nam falls into the category of old house Indian Chinese. When the Chinese people opened eateries it was mostly what they ate at home, modified for our consumption. Simple, tasty and filling.
                                                                ...

Tung Nam is reminiscent of an old Kolkata eating house, probably because it's been around for a very long time. It took me an eternity to come back here, but it was one of the easiest lunches I've had in a while. The problem with going to Tung Nam now is the massive expectation that comes along with. This makes it finding flaws somewhat like a reflex.

The lack of air conditioning will be a problem for most people, considering how the Kolkata heat doesn't go away too quickly. It's also worth mentioning that it's a pretty drab place, which doesn't make for a very lively eating experience. However, if you're like me and you aren't really fazed by anything but the service and the food, the points I've just mentioned will not come off as anything but mere details.

The service is everything you're expecting -- fast and friendly. The waiters didn't seem to need to write down out orders, serving from memory and getting it spot on. Remarkable!

Food is the zenith of Tung Nam. The cereals are packed with vegetables and meat, and the sides are very generous. The Fung Mee Mein was absolute spectacular, and the Hakka was nicely painted. The Pork Chilli is their speciality and rightfully so. They also do a great job with their Chicken -- the Hamei sauces was especially good. The Sweet and Sour chicken was a worthy companion. The best side however was the Sweet Garlic Pork -- basically a stunning dish to accompany a massive portion of chow.

To summarize, Tung Nam is quite rightfully rated as high as it is. If you take a restaurant experience into consideration, then perhaps not. But if you're going to eat at Tung Nam, you're probably more than aware of what you're in for.

Interior/Ambience: 1.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Food: 4.5/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I have made.

Damn huge quantity,
With a plate of chow or fried rice more than enough for one person.
Fried chilli pork was excellent.
Veg Manchurian was decently good.
Baby corn was just above average .
Extremely vfm, but their sky high standards has dropped a little in recent times.
With so many other gems just as chin-wah not very far behind, they would want to buck this trend.
Edit - Went there a second time
Prices have increased
Standards have fallen.

This place was in my bucket list for a long time. Truly a hidden gem, they specializes in Pork items. Located by Poddar Court, the ambiance here isn't anything extraordinary. Rather a basic setup with not so good hygiene or atmosphere, people mainly flock here due to their cheap and tasty food. I came here twice on two consecutive days. Ordered a Mixed Noodles, Chilly Pork and Sweet and Sour Prawn for the first time and for the second time, I just left out Chilly Pork. The Pork was nice and soft, easily melting in the mouth. However, the chilly content was a bit too high for me. The gravy portion for the noodles was exotic and had sufficient toppings of Chicken, Pork and Prawn. My favorite dish was the Sweet and Sour Prawn. It was after a long time that I have had a nice Sweet and Sour Sauce. Perfectly sweet and slightly soury, the sauce went well with the gravy noodles. The batter for the prawn balls was a bit thick though. More or less, the food was satisfactory. May be mainly because, the total price of this dishes weren't anything exorbitant. Would like to come here again the future.

Well, I came across this place for a college project. Initially, my Dad suggested me to check this place out. This is where he used to have Tibetan in his childhood. 
Located in the Old China Town, Terity Bazar area, lies this authentic Tibetan eatery. Tuesdays are closed. Starts from 12 pm. 
We were really hungry when we stepped in.. so could click the pics of all the dishes. But would like to talk about the vibrant rich taste you will get of authenticity, that you wouldn't anywhere else. 
So, it is my request.. do visit this 100year old Tibetan Eatery.. don't let it die. 
A must for everyone.

Tung Nam had been in my wishlist for a very long time. I am happy to have got a chance to finally strike it off . Visited with my dad today. Located just by Poddar court, this hole in the wall eatery rightly stakes it's claim as Kolkata' s hidden gem. We had to wait for a long time after placing the order but was worth the wait. Although I must say the Bengali server person did an excellent job single handedly, the bosses should have at least one more person to take care of the customer. We ordered chicken wonton soup, chicken Hakka noodles, pork chilly, chicken hamei sauce and Mandarin fish. The wonton soup is the best I had ever had... It just melts in your mouth. The pork is delicious. Chicken in hamei sauce has a tangy different flavor to it.... I haven't ever tasted anything similar.... The tastes that Tung Nam produces is easily a genre in its own. At a time when Chinese restaurants mushroom out at every Street corner, restaurants like Tung Nam hold the key to the popularity of authentic Chinese cuisine. Way to go... Can't wait to be back here. Bon appetit !
            

Went there again with my wife. This time we ordered the chicken wonton soup, chicken steamed rice, chicken in hamei sauce & chicken salt and pepper. Again the quality was top notch. I have already become a huge fan of this place.

Been today there. The shop itself is a little bit on the insides to find. The staff was friendly and and the food didn't take that much of time to come. It was tasty and quite enough in quantity. The place has got a nice ring to it through the vintage building quality. Anyways the only minus point is the space is a bit crammed up and I guess they would fix it in the near future.

Tung Nam is an 'old school' type Chinese restaurant, located near Poddar court, just a few minute walk from Central Metro. This traditional joint is surely serves the best Chinese in the town.
This place does not look great but the food they serve belongs to a different level. A foodie simply will love to visit them again again because of their quality as well as quantity.
Every single item was different from each other and Hamei Chicken was best amongst them.
This certainly is a legendary place for food lovers.

Our search for a decent Chinese eatery, nearby our locality, landed us to this place today.  Such a high rating at Zomato with such modest prices, was hard to be ignored. The old proverb, "Never judge a book by its cover" aptly describes 'Tung Nam' at Central Calcutta. Situated at, what looks like a typical lane of the city's downtown, hardly gives any impression of what one would discover inside. This "No Frills" restaurant looks pretty home like, absolutely clean and hygienic. There is no AC, but normal fans does the job well enough. The owner and the staffs are courteous and well behaved. Normal water is served in clean plastic bottles, along with clean glasses. The food was of good quality, and tasted absolutely delicious. The amount of noodles was decent enough, for a plate to be shared by two people. Food was very healthy and devoid of any excess spices. The 'icing on the cake' was the price, which has no extra taxes, and what's mentioned on the menu chart, was all inclusive. Seems like, we have found our place of Chinese food, for our often eating outs. Eager to try the others dishes on our next visit, in very near future. Thanks and best wishes to everyone at 'Tung Nam'.

Aptly featured in Zomato's hidden gems section Tung Nam is a gem of a Chinese joint which won't offer you the elegant or posh ambiance or a superior service but will win your heart with their marvellous Chinese foods. We went in a group and tried out various dishes on their menu namely Chicken Manchurian and Chicken in Hamei Sauces, but the items which really impressed me are 1.Fish Mandarin. Extremely soft and good quality Bhetki did the trick with a Lipsmacking tangy thick gravy. 2. Prawn balls in Garlic Sauce. The balls were soft yet the binding was there and the saucy texture was there in every bite. Not at all bland. 3. Chilli Pork. Mindblowingly awesome. Spicy and Zesty at the same time. Mixed Rice was taken as the main. 

Overall an extremely pocket friendly yet nice little place for good quality chinese. Definitely will try to visit in the future.

This is undoubtedly one of the better Chinese restaurants in the city. The food here is authentic and absolutely inexpensive, the quality and quantity are both praiseworthy. If you love Chinese, Tung Nam is a must visit. Their Chili Pork Fry and Prawns in Hoisin Sauce are delicious. The ambience is not great, and the set up resembles an old Calcutta Chinese eating house but that shouldn't come in the way of a brilliant eating experience. It's important to keep in my mind though that it's not an air conditioned restaurant.

Tung Nam is a name well known to the food lovers. But those who don't know this place are missing one of the greatest Chinese food Kolkata has to offer. 
It's a small walk from the central metro station. While the location, exterior or the small entrance puts doubt in your mind, the food will surprise you. 
There's not a lot of space but the red tables, the kori borga ceiling and those amazing smells will surely engulf you with their charm. 
We ordered chicken wonton, mixed Hakka noodles and sweet and sour chicken. 
I tried the wonton for the first time and it was crunchy and meaty with great flavor. Now you have to try all the sauces at the table because they are awesome. 
Noodles was delicious and adequate in amount for two. The sweet and sour chicken was a star for me. The sweetness of the carrots with soft chicken pieces will make you want more. If you want spicy, you can try chicken sezuan or the chicken hamei sauce. 
The staff are very helpful and suggest you according to your taste. 
Lastly if you care about good food and not about fancy decorations and A.C, this place will be make you come back.

Next time i ordered lung fung soup, chicken hakka chowmein, fish hamei sauce and all are surprisingly good. Do visit this place and you'll see.

Had been waiting to get to this age old eatery for a long long time. Had read all about the mouth watering dishes in the reviews on Zomato. Basically, to help out people living down south.....this restaurant is located in a lane, behind Poddar Court, parallel to Rabindra Sarani. The lane is quite shabby....the appearance of the place from outside is unassuming. You walk in and you appreciate the Old school Chinese hotel feel. No air conditioners, but the fans run pretty well. The food more than makes up for all the drawbacks.
A part of the order was suggested by a very friendly server...Mr.Deenanath. The order consisted of Yaam Wanton, Chicken Yaam Mein, Chicken Hakka Chowmein, Chicken in Hamei Sauces and Fish Salt Pepper.
Each and every dish had its own unique taste. The Yaam Mein...basically boiled chow with a lot of vegetables and chicken in it was a unique dish. Chicken in Hamei Sauces really stood out....never have I had a better Chinese preparation anywhere in Kolkata. Fish Salt and Pepper just melted in the mouth. A 100/100 for the food. The service was homely too.
I was amazed by the cleanliness of the kitchen....the kitchen is huge and immaculately clean.
Good news (given by none other than Mr .Deenanath) for us who reside down south....Tung Nam has a branch at Netaji Nagar, Tollygunge. This was news to me.
Would love to visit this place soon and on a regular basis. 
I look forward to returning to this place (the original outlet of Tung Nam) sooner than later.
My bucket list finally got shorter.

A magnificent Chinese eating house at a price of street side food.
A true hidden treasure.
Soup portions are so huge that you can take a bath in it.
Chicken side dishes are delicious at this price.
Must visit if you love Chinese.

Tiny little restaurant tucked in at a narrow alley on Sun Yat Sen street. The food here is just awesome.. I ordered egg fried rice and pork chilli. The pork dish was just heavenly. The quantity was sufficient for two. Visit here for authentic Chinese food

For the price it's first class. I usually order in and they are quite good in delivering the food in time. The chili pork is very good and try the chicken mushroom with baby corn. Stick to the rice as I find the noodles slightly oily. For 8/9 people it won't cost you more than 2k

This place is located just behind the BSNL building near Poddar Court. It's a shabby looking place with no fancy decorations. The lone aquarium though attracts a lot of attention. Coming to the food, I've tasted Lung fung soup, chicken gravy noodles and chicken in Hamei sauce from here. 
The lung fung soup is not recommended. I've tasted much better in other restaurants around the city. 
The gravy noodles was good with ample amount of vegetables and chicken. The quantity was also good.
The chicken in hamei sauce was the best of the lot. Though, it's pork counterpart is more famous, I'll recommend people to try this as well. Succulent and juicy pieces of chicken in a tangy sauce. This is a winner. 
Overall the experience was pretty good though, for me, at the same pocket pinch, I'll go for D'ley over Tung Nam because of the even greater quantity and taste.

While returning from office, I decided to parcel some of their delicacies since i have never tried tung nam due to timing issues. So today i parcelled the following items:-

1. Chicken friedrice= Normal friedrice with generous amounts of chicken & egg. The quantity was on the higher side & can easily feed 2 persons.

2. Chicken in hamei sauce= This dish was outstanding although popular with pork but the chicken version lived up to its reputation as well. 8 pure pieces of chicken made with tangy sauce which was something unique.

The total bill came to 275 & the old helper over was welcoming & provided good service.

Cheap and Worth the money yes. The Pork dishes are great and so is Kaptai and most of the gravies per se but Noodles and Rice below average. Kim Li/Tung Fong serves more flavourful rice, Mandarin serves the best Gravy Chowmein/Rice.....but Tung Nam gravy noodles is close. Song Hay had the best Gravy chow but sadly closed down......

Another legendary Chinese joint, mostly talked about in the old-school circles, Tung Nam is a small restaurant in the vicinity of the famed Chinese breakfast region around Poddar Court. However, I got to visit this place quite late into my life but the one visit that I have had so far will be forever etched into my mind. When you enter the place, it gives the impression of a no frills place, but the décor is quite interesting. With cracked walls that reflect numerous years, and the Chinese paintings on the walls, the place looks like an authentic Chinese joint, replete even with a shrine!

The food is exemplary and heartwarming, especially their Wonton Soup. It is the best I have ever had, with a clear soup feeding you soul and the pork wontons providing the perfect complement – juicy, flavorsome and melt in your mouth. Wow, even the memory is enough to make me salivate. For the mains, we had a Fish Manchurian Dry, a Pork in Hamei Sauce and a Mixed Yam Mein. Though Manchurian is hardly an authentic Chinese dish, it was unlike any other Manchurian, with a slightly sweet and very garlicky taste, and coupled with the extremely fresh Bhetki chunks, it was a bliss with every bite. The Yam Mein, or thick noodles, was also great, with small chunks of pork and chicken, but it’s a heavy dish and a plate easily suffices for two. The noodles went perfectly with the Pork in Hamei Sauce, which is one of the most unique dishes you will find in Kolkata. A sauce specially prepared from dried shrimps, the Hamei Sauce has a signature taste – sharp and piquant – and combines beautifully with the fried strips of pork. This is one of the fabled preparations of Tung Nam, so do not miss it when you are here.

The prices are extremely moderate for the quality, and you won’t feel a thing after such a good meal. The Wonton Soup and the Pork in Hamei Sauce are sure to etch an indelible mark in your memory which will bring you back to Tung Nam again and again. For me, a next visit is surely due on my next trip to Kolkata.

One of the best in Chinese collections. Went there a few days ago, the ambience is satisfactory considering a small joint in central Kolkata. Pork wanton soup, pork rice noodles and pork in hamei sauce are a must try here. You get authentic Chinese at affordable prices. Service is fast. Overall, a rating of 4/5.

I went to Tung Nam from central metro station on 23rd January 2016 for trying Chinese Food (except noodles) for the 1st time around 2.45Pm. The place was easy to find ( Near a pole mounted transformer) for me. Ambience is okay. Tried Chicken Wanton Soup & Pork Mushroom Baby Corn. Quantity was huge for soup, 2 people can eat from it, totally worth for money. Staff was cordial and for serving, they didn't take much time. Will visit again for try new items.
But if you prefer decoration/ambience more than food quantity then you might dislike it. Hygiene was not a problem though.

Located in Chattawala Gully near Terreti Bazar, this is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. Don't go by it's ambience and decor! This restaurant serves the best Chinese food in Kolkata, in my opinion. Most of the dishes are just too good. You just complain regarding the quantity and quality of the food. And all these comes at a much cheaper price! The Lung Fung Soup and the Roasted Chilli Pork are my personal favourites. This restaurant is one of my favourites in Kolkata!

A small and nondescript eating house in Tiretti Bazar, Tung Nam sure packs a punch with the food and quick service. The food is great, the portions are big and the prices are great. The quality of the food is also very good. Ambience is nothing to write home about, and the service is okayish. The place is popular, so you can expect to wait for a table on weekends! Really good food, though.

Located in Territy Bazar, at the heart of a small Chinese community, Tung Nam offers Chinese food that is distinctly different from your usual Indo-Chinese fare. The shop is very inconspicuously located and is not likely to catch your eye easily. But once you enter, there is an air of Authentic Chinese about the place, the kind you get when you enter a small curio shop in the heart of Chinatown. There was  a golden Fortune cat moving its arm to and fro and its typically unpretentious Chinese decor. Yet,there is an air of simplicity, no posh "show-offiness". The place had been renovated since the last time I had been there (around 5 or so months ago), and had a fresh, new and inviting look. 

Coming to the food itself, their fried wontons are okayish, but the chicken wonton soup is amazing. With chunks of chicken encased in silky smooth wonton wrappers and a clear, fresh broth with a generous helping of greens, it is a very clean and guilt-free way to start the meal. I have tried their chicken and pork noodles, and they were both delicious. The pork noodles were coated with some of the fat rendered off the pork and lent it a very distinctive flavour. The gravy noodles, with all the vegetables, prawn, chicken and pork is a complete meal all by itself. Amongst the mains, the Chicken Manchurian is amazing and packed full of what the Japanese call "umami", an very moreish kind of flavour and makes you want to go back for more and more. The sweet garlic chicken was lovely too, huge chunks of chicken with not too much batter in a sweet sticky sauce. But the piece de resistance are definitely their Chicken and Pork in Hamei sauce. and Roast Chilli Pork. The former, with bits if crispy pork, chunks of crunchy onion, green capsicum and spring onion all coated in a delicious golden oily sauce flavoured with garlic, chilli, and rendered pork fat, I could have had a whole bowl of it, all by itself. The latter, with its fatty chunks of pork, sweet onions and bits of chilli is absolutely stunning.

The service here is excellent. The person who took our order helped us in choosing some of the dishes, and service was pretty fast as well.  Substantial portions of delicious food at extremely affordable prices.... at 300 per head you can eat your heart out. I have been to this place with friends a couple of times now and it has never disappointed. If you want good Chinese at reasonable prices, then Tung Nam is definitely the place for you.

10 minutes walking distance from Central Metro station , Tung Naam is situated in chhatwala gali ... It's little bit tough too find the restaurant through small galis...
So must take the help of GPS ...
The ambience is like a hotel or something... but this place is not known for it ambience... known for its extraordinary tasty foods... Though a big Aquarium, wind chimes ,chinese photos are making this place looks good little bit...
The Chinese we had there was too perfect... not too spicy like street stalls...
We ordered Chicken Wanton Soup, Pork Hamei Sauce, Veg Yaam Mein, Chicken Hakka Chow Mein, Chicken Gravy Chow Mein ...
Every dish was different and had its own taste ... Pork Hamei Sauce is one of the best I had there ...
Noodles are not only tasty but healthy too...
#One of the best Chinese restaurants in Town...

This is located in terreti bazar Kolkata. Also another old famous restaurant in terreti bazar area for food lovers. It has better ambience than other local restaurant in that area. Food quantity is good as you will find in other restaurant in this area but taste is OK to me. But it is always recommended for what you are getting at that price

A gem of a restaurant, small in size and in a not-so-high profile location, Tung Nam offers classic Chinese dishes to cater to the taste buds of all alike. 

Aptly rated, the inevitable dish to be tried out here is the Pork Hamei sauce that is not very spicy yet sharp enough to be converted into a long term memory. With a perfect manner of cooking and quantity combined, this dish can be had with chowmein, yaam mein, meifoon or by itself. Savour the deliciousness that is this dish and it respects the taste of pork as a variety of meat. I have not come across this dish before anywhere even after having at tons of the best Chinese restaurants at some of the best places in the country.
Combine pork meifoon with this and you're golden for a filling lunch on a good day. The quality of meat they provide and the correctness of ingredients keeps you assured of their talent and knowledge in cooking.

At prices not worth wondering about and in an ambience that is of a small, regular restaurant, Tung Nam has now become a must visit for me whenever I go home.  

Hope to try out more and more of their offerings in future.

I visited this restaurant seeing its rating, but was very much disappointed.
The rating of this restaurant is very high than it should be.
The food wasn't satisfactory at all.The chowmein were the thick ones and also taste wasn't that good.
We ordered a mix meifoon, egg chow and an chicken item.
The chicken preparation was good, but the meifoon and chow both were not upto the mark.
It being a chinese restaurant with so much rating; expectation was high, ended with disappointment.

Located at Bara Baazar near Poddar Court. 

This restaurant serves authentic chinese food. Its famous for its chicken in hamei sauce and mixed chicken gravy noodles. The place is very very simple without any grandeur or design. 
The plus point is their budget friendly dishes and their negative thing the ill mannered staff. The management should keep a look at that. Anyway overall its good and enjoy your food. :)

Food amount was massive. Tasted awesome but quite spicy..

P.s. if you have small belly share your plate because the amount they serve is just huge..we were stuffed so much we could barely walk on our way back...

Its very pocket friendly cuz its gonna cost you like 400 for two to the max..  The quantity of the food served is enough for three to have and can fill two of you till your throat. Well the noodles are good but the chilli pork we had was more like a chilli curry. They needa improve that but overall the place is good and i sure will visit this place on a regular basis. Like it

This place was on my wishlist for a long time and finally i got the chance to visit this place today with my friend. This place is located inside a very busy, shabby and clustered lane near central metro station and locating this place might be troublesome if you are not well acquainted with the area. 
                 On entering this place, you won't find the ambience much appealing or even the decor but the food,  it's authentic Chinese and that too at such reasonable prices! 

WHAT WE ORDERED :
Chicken chowmien gravy: undoubtedly the best gravy noodles that i have had till date, it was just perfect and the quantity is enough to suffice two persons! 

Chicken in hamei sauce: this one was recommended by them and this dish really went well with the noodles. The chicken pieces were soft and delicious. 

Chicken fried rice -it tasted a bit different from the usual fried rice that we have in restaurants but it was good and the quantity is enough to fill two persons! 
                Three dishes costed us RS 400 altogether and it was a very pocket friendly affair. During lunch hours, it's quite difficult to get a table over here and we were lucky enough to get one. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food at reasonable prices, tung nam is one such place you should definitely not miss!

Thanks to Zomato to bring out the restaurant. This place is exactly behind the burra bazar telephone exchange. Please do not expect a posh and flamboyant ambience inside the eating house. However where the place speaks out is the quality of food. We did try the chicken items which was delicately flavoured unlike other places serving cheap fare. The gravy chowmein is one of the best I had after a long time. The chicken was juicy and was well prepared. This place is good for people wanting pure chinese food and no other stuff. Prices are reasonable.

Had great food here. I particularly liked, and strongly recommend, the pork wonton soup and the chilly pork. The prawn in hamei sauces was also excellent, though very spicy. Prices are extremely reasonable. Although not located in a very salubrious area, this place is a bit like heaven: difficult to find the way, but once one manages to get through the door a foodie will never want to leave. I wonder how long it will take to try every item on the menu!

Not the most fancy restaurants, I went there seeing the reviews.... May be it was my poor order choices or may be the place is known to serve excellent pork dishes, I felt rather disappointed in their food.... The chicken wanton soup I had was fresh and light and built up my hunger.... The mo fein prawn rice noodles were average....

And you will never know how awesome this place is until you visit it!
A staple for many college goers!
When the mess ka khana becomes intolerable .... Tung Nam is the saviour!
Spend a meager 150 rupees for a plate of great Chinese/Tibetan food!
Be it the pork or the chicken ....just amazing to taste!
I keep coming ....from time to time ...and each time i go back satiated !

This one is indeed a hidden gem amidst the myriad restaurants that this city has. Highly pocket friendly, the quality n quantity of the food is more than satisfying to you. We tried the chicken wanton noodle soup and just one bowl serves 4 stomachs easily. The prawn chowmin and their main speciality, the chicken hamei sauces is a must try here. It's quite spicy but the fire can b reduced on request. But surely order this dish if u visit this place. Overall a great experience.

PORK- the only reason I came @ TUNG NAM with some of my friends. Obviously The exterior view and the interior of the eatery will make u feel doubt about the 'famous' adjective that the foodies use for this place.very common wooden table,plastic chairs(a bike was parked inside when we were in),cold drinks crates,packets can be seen inside.
But don't take this in ur mind at all.
We ordered pork hakka noodles,mix noodles,pork in hamei sauce,chilly pork,shejwan chicken,garlic chicken.
Appetizer was fried pork wantons.
(A WARNING: if u r not a lover of chilly,then don't try the chilly sauce on the table.)
All the pork items were delicious. Specially Pork in hamei sauce.
One drawback,chicken items were not so good as the pork.(according to my tastebud).
Quantity was handsome,one plate of noodles with a side dish is more than enough for one.
Thanks to my friend ARKO ROY for 
Suggesting and giving me company. For Pork,I will surely come back.

Finalllyyyy I managed to visit this gem of a place. It takes 20 minutes to reach this restaurant from my house. And there is no other option except walking. It is near the telephone exchange office near central avenue. From there take left and then right and there you are. Its a clean restaurant. Price is very good as the quantity they give is more than sufficient. I really wanted to order a lot but even my tummy has limits. We ordered  fried pork wanton, chicken wanton soup and Chinese chopsuey. All the wanton dishes have 10 pieces each. The fried ones are crispy  and not soggy at all. The chilli dip sauce they have is really yummy and not just hot. Then came this big bowl of wanton soup. The stock is perfectly seasoned and the wantons are soft like cotton. The chopsuey was loaded and I mean loaded with prawns and shredded chicken.  The only suggestion I have for this dish is that they can chop the vegetables in smaller pieces. But apart from this it is a must an absolute must visit for everyone. Next in list is their pork and chicken in hamei sauces. 
Can't wait to visit again.

First of all let me clarify one thing for all those who will be visiting for the first time.It's very important to know.
If you try to use google map you will get two positions shown on the map.The place named "Tungnam Chinese Restaurant" near Chuna Pukut lane is a hoax.It was probably the old location.Don't try to reach that by foot you won't find it anyhow and might get lost in some small dark lanes which are not suitable to visit at all.

The actual restaurant is named "Tung Nam" in the map and is located near central avenue.while going towards Lalbazar Take right turn just before the ganguram shop.Go straight for a while then take a small left lane.You can ask for directions there.

Its a very small decent place.Have a seating capacity approx 15.The staff behavior is really good.

Now lets come to the food,that was the very sole reason we walked last 30 mins to find this place.

Chicken Wanton Soup: We learned it was a must have and we weren't disappointed.It was really smooth and delicious.The wantons were great.

Mixed Hakka Noodles: It was really tasty with soft shreds of chicken,prawn,pork etc.

Chicken In Hamei Sauce: It was a new experience.Different kind of essence with this dish with a bit of Red Chilli.The chicken was soft and seasoned.

Chili Pork: It was quite good,sliced pork pieces were properly cooked.

Good food took away all the turmoils we faced finding this place.Its also damn good pocket friendly.They also serve more than average quantity per dish.
Surely come back as soon as possible.This place really is a hidden gem.

Well what more to say.... Tung Nam is situated in a very awful place. One may not think of stepping in the busy byelanes of burrabazar.. Which is full of litter shanties and heavy vehicles. But the awesome food they serve you will come by as if blind folded.. One would not mind the ambience... I am not a lover of pork... So can't say really about it. Well we had a large bowl of manchow soup, gravy mixed chowmein sans pork and prawn schezuan. Yes felt like kissing the chef to say this is the best Chinese I have ever had... Then the best part bill was 660. It happens only in Tung Nam. Haka mainland China are hyped soo very expensive... Anyways I will surely visit Tun Nam more often.

Being a foodie myself... I have rated this place only in terms of the quality of Chinese food they serve...one of the best place to have pork dishes in Kolkata.. The pork they serve is totally differently marinated in a spice before cooking..so it tastes heavenly. Their lung fung soup is also the best amongst whatever I had in any other Chinese restaurant. ( specialty: they put tofu in the lung fung soup). The starters be it salt n pepper chicken or fried prawn balls are also great appetizers. The meifoon & the fried rice are great but for me it will always be the mixed gravy noodles which is to die for..with chunks of red pork & lightly fried gravy noodles..just awesome. Whenever I crave for Chinese without burning a hole in my pocket, I will opt for this place. No AC, no comfortable sitting chairs but the food they serve will completely floor you. Must try for Chinese lovers. With

Tung nam is located in one of the lanes beside central metro station. The entrance is small but the interior is quite large, though the no of seats provided are quite less. 

We ordered for chicken wanton soup, mixed yam mein noodles and pork in hamei sauces. The soup was served in a huge bowl. The wantons were very tasty. The soup had a great aroma. A must have in tung nam !!

Next came the noodles and pork in hamei sauces. The pork was very spicy but tasted great. Luckily there was less fat and more meat which is difficult to find in many restaurants. The noodles on the other hand tasted quite bland. But there were huge chunks of chicken in it which added to the taste. I will surely come back to have the pork and the other dishes as well !! :D

I had taken 1each=Mixed Chow Hakka & gravy and Pork Hanei Sauces (shredded Pork) Pork Hong Kong. My friends & family 👪 loved the taste very much. Gravy speciality is they make it in a totally different way not like any other Chinese restaurant. I asked uncle Dina nath Rana-ji for any special dish. He said I ordered the best already. I will 😊 suggest all the foodies to try their gravy. It's a really special one. Mixed chow is full of prawns, pork and lots of tasty 😋 & healthy ingredients. Decoration has the feel of typical Chinese restaurant with a dominant Red Colour, windchime and a big Aquarium in the SW. Cool place to eat. 
Exact Location: Leave Central Metro station & Lal Bazar crossing. Go upto Sivaji's Statue>then take Left 👈 and go straight for 3-4mins. On left 👈 is Pao Chen>then is Tung Nam mean East & West. As I asked the meaning of the name to Dinanath ji. Whom young customers call "Uncle". The service is Fast. Within 30mins I got my parcels ready. Every staff is very helpful & warm. My friends-Apu & Sambhu. Dinanath Rana ji & Me. The Aquarium & Menu Card. The Kitchen.

Covering the basics first- decor is non existent, service is fast and friendly and the food is authentic chinese at its best. The price is really a surprise being really cheap and pocket friendly. Still the thing which really impressed me about this place tucked away in the bylanes of central koljata is the old world feel. Sitting there you could easily feel that you are in the 1960's. And yes it really is a hidden gem. If you know about it or have been there then you truly are a blue blooded kolkatan :p As for the food we ordered a plate of dry chilly baby corn, a schezwan fried rice, veg manchurian balls and chicken in hamei sauce. Each of the items was cooked to perfection and the portions were really large. Highly recommended for the experience.

After extensive pandal hopping in central Kolkata on Chaturthi, we thought of having our lunch in Tung Nam. The problem here was that neither of us knew exactly where it was located. All we knew was that it was near Central metro station, in an alley. After a LONG search, when we finally found it at around 5:30 pm, they told us it'll open at 6. Too tired to move, we actually sat round the corner, on the footpath, waiting for it to open.

From the outside, it seemed like a tiny shack. However, as we entered, we realized it was bigger than we thought, and quite cool albeit without AC. To be truthful, we were too hungry to actually notice the ambiance. We just settled in the plastic chairs and called for the menu.

Our order was a Fried Pork Wonton, a Prawn Hakka Noodles and a Pork in Hamei Sauce.

The wontons were pork balls wrapped and fried in a nimki-like crust. They were beautiful and my friend went absolutely gaga over them. And with 10 wontons a plate for a 100 bucks, they were dirt cheap.

Next arrived the main course. The hakka noodles were good, with a huge amount of prawns in it, but nothing extraordinary. I spiced it up a bit with some red chilli paste and vinegar.

The hamei sauce pork was in a word, heavenly. This is one dish that I have never found in any other chinese eateries before. It was very spicy and a little salty. Putting dried red chillies added a different dimension to the dish.

Our bill came to Rs. 390 with all this and two soft drinks. Do, do, do visit this place if you want an authentic touch to your chinese on a budget.

P.S - Right in front of Central metro station, there is a Shibaji statue. The road divides into two lanes in front of it. Take the left one. Walk straight for about five minutes. You'll find Tung Nam to your left. You really have to keep an eye out for it otherwise you're bound to miss it.

There are some places who are humble subtle and yet their foods speak for themselves. Tung Nam is one of that rarest gem. I won't give any recommendations here as everyone has their own olfactory prudence. If you are having lunch then do visit before 3pm and for dinner before 9pm. Man they are strict with their timings.

Lemme first clarify that i will call him oish and not oishik cz thats how i know him . Tung nam was very sudden and unexpected but as the saying goes all is well that ends well , my evening went just fabulous. Oish and i were desperately searching for a place to have food. As we were in esplanande area i suggested chittoda but he was determined to make me taste the authentic taste of tung nam. After all, everyone who is close to me knows that i love chinese. So before commencing on the review i wanna thank oish from the bottom of my heart cz he gave me good food, good company and obviously a great great evening.

Location-- central metro station medical college gate. Cross the road. Head forward . Tung nam is to the left.

Ambiance-- a simple ambiance. Plastic chairs and non.ac... But who cares when u have such a good frnd and food to accompany u.

Staffs-- we were greeted by a very courteous man whom oish calls sir. Hehe. Then he sugested us some good options. Very friendly and helpful.

Food -- the food was soo good. Had the typical chinese flavour. I mean we ordered

1. Chicken steam rice -- cantonese gravy over normal steamed rice. The rice was very good. It was not spicy at all. And the gravy was delicious. Ample amt of veggies and stuff. The chicken was tender. Loved it.

2. Chicken in hamei sauce-- ohh it was damn spicy man. I mean being a chiliphobic person i was like on fire ( literally ) . But Oish loved it and so did i. the tate was awesome and the chicken was mast. Hehe.

3. Chcken fried rice-- now this is a traditional dish . Tung nam cooks it to perfection. I love the spicy taste. The rice was nice and good. Cooked very nicely.

Overall very very good experience. I loved today's evening.me and oish had a blast as always.. Its good when special frnds meet.

The portions for rice or noodle are enough for two people and the service is really good too.. And to top it all, the price is really cheap for such good food.. Will definitely visit this place again!

My sister and I went to Tung Nam for lunch today. 
Location: We took the Metro and got down at  Central from where we walked towards Welland Gould Smith School. The alley right next to it is the Chatteywali gully. We asked a few people around and so had no problem locating the restaurant. 
Ambience: its a nice, simple and quiet place. No AC but with proper ventilation. Had enough fans and windows so we were comfortable. Spacious and clean. 
Service and Staff: The gentleman who served us was attentive and quick. We hardly had to wait 5 mins for the soup to arrive and within the next 5 mins got the main course too. 
Food: We ordered: CHICKEN WANTON SOUP which was very subtle and flavourful. It had 10 peices of silky wantons. A definite must have. 
CHICKEN IN HUNEI SAUCE which had 8 tasty juicy and succulent peices of chicken cooked to perfection. The sauce is a bit spicy but I loved it. A must try too. 
VEG HAKKA CHOWMEIN was more than enough for 2 people. The yamien was thick and flavourful. Just the way I like it. 
And a bottle of thumsUp. 
Bill: 345rs which is very reasonable. 
Can't say the food is very authentic, straight from China. But this is the most authentic chinese food you can get in Kolkata. Modified just enough to suit our pallet. Loved every bit of it. 
I'l happily visit the place again and again. 
☺

Food is too good. Roasted chilli pork just beyond expectation. Meifoon was sufficient for two of us during lunch. Chicken in hamei sauce(they made it mild on request) was good. Chicken pieces were huge. A bit different. Probably they minced the meat and then made the meatball. It was nice.

Chinese restaurants in and around old china town and through hidden alleys has always intrigued me as it gives a feel of treasure hunt and I have rarely been disappointed. Its a big neat place and its actually a part of the owner's residence. Homely atmosphere serving authentic chinese. Quality and quantity of food was impressive and pocket friendly.

Situated in an uncanny place for an authentic Chinese eatery , this small deceptive restaurant was on my wish list since a long time. I got to know of it from mainly zomato and on seeing this so highly regarded by many foodies of Kolkata I couldn't hold myself back any longer. My friends and I ordered the mainstream wanton soup and yeah it was pretty tasty. Besides that we had mixed yamein and fried rice. Quantity of main dish more than suffices a pair. Pork hamein sauce was succulently delightful. We also tried a chicken starter which I don't particularly remember,but it was good, nothing extravagant. The only issue I found was the shrimps on my main course..they were boiled and appeared undercooked to me and I thought gave a slight smell. I don't know ,maybe shrimp doesn't attract me much. But my friends didn't grouse much though. Overall if u are a Chinese cuisine lover and wanna try the best value for money authentic chinese food in the city , I highly suggest don't miss out on this.

Just now returned after family lunch at Tung Nam. Visiting this place since 90s and it has preserved its delicacy and authenticity since then. Wonderful preparation which I have not yet experienced in any other restaurant serving chinese food in Kolkata. Don't expect air-conditioned ambience here. But the food is superb and at a very affordable cost. Don't forget to try chicken yaam wanton with soup.

I am very glad that few restaurant in Kolkata have preserved the flavour of old school 'indo chinese cuisine' battling against time. Tung Nam is an obvious candidate. 
Foods here are absolute delight. You are not a foodie if you miss this place.
But ambience and service is very down to earth if not poor. Although you gate a huge bang for bucks here.

Tung Nam offers you total value for the money spent!Don't go there if you are looking for ambiance or fancy decor - go for the amazing food and leave satisfied.
The restaurant may be a tad difficult to locate, but once you are there - you will not be disappointed. It's in the heart of Tiretta Bazaar, in the Chhatawala gully and is the best of old school Calcutta Chinese!
Start with any of the amazing soups - the wanton soup is superb - the wrappers are silky and melt in your mouth as compared to the gummy stuff you would get at most places - in addition to that, the broth it's served in, is full of rich flavor!
Dig into more wontons for starters - the pork ones are excellent!For the mains, try the dishes in Hamei sauce for a piquant zingy flavor. 
The rice or noodles dishes can be easily shared by a couple. Try the Steamed Pork Rice or any of the specialty items. The pork items are cooked really well here (and so are the chicken or fish ones) so do try them.

I was willing to taste pork for a long time. Finally I got a chance & decided to go to the most highest rated Chinese restaurant on Zomato. "Tung Nam" has already having the medal for this title. The environment of the restaurant was pretty good, clean & hygienic & having some special decorations that makes you feel you are in China for a few seconds. Just like every Chinese lover I also ordered Hakka Noodles & Chilli Pork with it. Although it was my first time with pork, as per the servant's recommendation I got the dried chilli pork. I was expecting so much from this restaurant just because of its highest rating. But unfortunately the dishes over here only looks good not tasted good. The only taste I got in the noodles is the crispy fried eggs & there was basically no taste overall. My friend ordered Mixed Fried Rice but same scenario was over there too. The pork on the other side was pretty rich & not that soft. Also I discovered that there was a fishy smell coming from all the dishes. We ordered 300ml cold drinks too but after billing we recognized that they charged us Rs.25 for the MRP Rs.15 bottle. Although the prices of all the dishes are very affordable & doesn't need any extra vat charges still I will recommend not to go with the rating & expect too much from them. But the quantity of the food is definitely can fill a hungry stomach very well.
2nd Time Visit : One of my friend willing to taste pork & I don't know why this restaurant attracts me for the 2nd time. As per most of the users review this time we tried the Pork Hamei Sauces & Chicken Rice Noodles with it. I must say the Pork Hamei Sauces is fabulous. My first impression was not that good with this restaurant but what I discovered is the taste completely depends upon on their dishes. Unfortunately the first time Chilli Pork was not that great but this time Hamei Pork made me feel like loving it. Request you all foodies if you are going to visit this restaurant then taste this Pork Hamei Sauce. You will definitely love it.

Searching for authentic Chinese cuisine in a restaurant favored by the Chinese themselves? Well, Tung Naam is the place for you. Ever since I have  first been there 3 years ago, it has unfailingly delighted us with its Chinese plethora. Wanton soup, Manchow soup, Hot and sweet garlic fish, Hamchoy rice, Mei-foons, Yaam-mein, Chicken in Hamei sauce, Noodles soup.. I could brag endlessly about the wonderful dishes and yet that would not be enough. The local Chinese themselves frequenting this eatery speaks volumes about its credibility. The interior decor has been improved recently with an increase in number of seats. The old waiter is an extremely patient man who always answers all our queries about the Chinese names of the various dishes with a smile on his face and even suggests us various mouth watering combos. To sum it up, its the Mecca (or should I say Shanghai) of authentic Chinese cuisine in North and Central Kolkata.

A true hidden gem as the description says...

We have been to tirretta bazar , quite a number of times. A true Chinese heaven with all morning breakfast and Pou Hing near by... now a new addition to my list this one.. Tung nam..

Coming to the food, it definitely serves pretty well to your taste buds.. going through the reviews over here, we had ordered for lung fung soup, chicken in hamei sauce and chicken yam mein ... Soup was pretty different and quite tasteful compared to what I had before at other places.. Chicken in Hamei Sauce was probably the best dish I have had in a long time.. though a bit oily, as the Hamei sauce is made out of shrimp oil, but you can leave your diet regime for a dish like this any-day. For me, Yam Mein was the perfect match with Hamei sauce. Its basically a less spicy noodle marinated with a bit of butter. So, Hamei sauce being a bit oily and quite spicy, Yam Mein was the best compliment to it. Price is very reasonable and keeps your pocket happy..

Finally, ambiance is pretty good, which has been renovated recently and gives a nice authentic chinese  feel..
 You'll leave Tung Nam with a wonderful bliss of satisfaction..!!!!!!! :)

Located in the opposite lane of the Central Metro Station. No such decor or interiors as such, but the food they serve is heavenly. ABSOLUTE BLISS. The Chicken Wanton Soup contains 10 pieces of wanton and it's more than enough for two people. The soup is light and is tasty af. Pork Hamei Sauce is just amazing and will make you crave for it. The Mixed Yam Mein is great too. Every item on their menu card is marvellous. This food joint may look shabby and is not a place to dine in lavishly but these factors become minor issues when it comes to the quality of food they provide. The staffs are polite and they serve you within minutes. Recommended strongly and a must visit for all.

Awesome experience!!! Be it the atmosphere which gives you a feel of 60'  s kolkata or be it the food. They serve you authentic chinese food at very reasonable rates. We tried the chicken hakka chow , pork hamei sauces and crispy chicken. All were excellent . It is a must visit place  for  every foodie.

It's really a "hidden gem" both in terms of its location and the food which is great, both quantity and quality wise.  We ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Pork in Hamei sauce and Fried Chicken Wantons.  All were delicious and sumptuous. This is the first time I tried pork and loved it. I found the ambience of the place quite homely. The behaviour of the staff is praiseworthy. Although the kitchen was closed they didn't turn us away and the food was on the table in record time. A must go place for all food lovers. Looking forward to try the other items on the menu.

This is one of my favourite places to dine at kolkata. Its located in a lane behind Poddar court, Tiriti Bazaar. Its a tiny shabby place but it serves authentic chinese food and has been run by a Chinese family for generations. I absolutely love the food here specially the pork dishes. The gravy chowmien is a hit in my family, so is the chilly pork. You can never have enough of it. the pork in Hamei sauces is my favourite. The food here has a really different taste from the chinese food you get at other places in the city.

Location: take sun yat sen st. From central metro station and walk upto the back side of telephon vaban..you will get..and if you are going from poddarcourt side take the lane opposite to todi mansion and then turn left and walk upto backside of telephon vaban.

Decor: nothing much to mention. People dont visit this place for a good ambience. 
Food: we orderd wanton soup, mixed hakka noodles, and chicken in hamei sauce.
This quality of WANTON SOUP is unavailable anywhere else. The wantons juz melts in your mouth and the soupy part is simply mouth watering. Its  light and superbly tasty.its one of their signatur dish so its a must try. Next comes the MIXED HAKKA noodles. It was a bit too oily which i didnt like butvotherwise tasty. I would like to taste their gravy noodles next time. Now the CHICKEN IN HAMEI SAUCE. Its sonething different. If you r bored of regular chinese then try this.this will rejuvinate your taste buds. But remember if you dont like spicy food then may be its not for you.

Service and price: quiet a cheap place accirding to their quality and quantity. Service is good. There is a old man who takes the order and serves. A decent person to meet. I liked every bit of the place except the surrounding place environment. That can be ignored for this quality of food.

Well well well..I had a harrowing experience ..I had ordered the following for delivery.. dry chicken wanton which was beautifully delicious ..mixed yam mein which was an experiment - it was a lot and tasty but from next time I will opt for meefon. .and finally pork in hamei sauce - pork felt a bit weird perhaps since I was having it after a long time but the gravy was OMG
Meanwhile my futile brain thought to order a pork wanton soup while they prepared the parcel..Mistake Mistake Mistake ..when the order arrived I swear I could have taken a bath in it..It was humongous 😢😢 but a delight to the taste buds after a touch of pepper in it..It had lot of trouble finishing it..finally I reached home and had to start my main course after 45 minutes..The wanton just wouldn't end and finally succumbed at around midnight ...I had started around 7:30  😲😲😲...dig that !!!

So guys don't be over confident..just go slow..The amount that these guys pack in is unfathomable... taste wise superb..price isn't any sort of a hindrance.

Wish u a good game 😆😆

Every time we eat Chowmein, we love to pour lots of sauces over it. It's almost a habit. Lose it people. Tung Nam is the only place I have eaten it where I can throw away the sauce, and eat my Chowmein in total bliss. It's just mind blowingly tasty. But then there's the wonton, there's the salt and pepper chicken and then there's the Schezwan chicken. Accessibility of the place may not be that good but I love the whole true to its roots Chinese home ambience. 

After speaking so much though, who cares. Just dig in to the food. I swear by good food but this one is easy on the pockets too. Anyone who loves Chinese food MUST definitely go to this place and find your tryst with destiny.

It feels kissing your girlfriend after one year. Two of us was planning to visit this place since long. So today we finally became successful. Its located near central and the place is inside a not-so-clean lane. However, foodies paradise it is. We had yam pork wanton which is heavenly. Pork wanton soup was one of the best soups I have ever had. Veg noodles were amazing. And the roasted chilli pork and pork in hamei sauce are the best pork dishes Kolkata can offer. As you can see plates were empty, and our stomach was full. Loved this place. Will revisit soon. Burpppp!

After a lot of hesitations atlast we visited this place yesterday.situated in the narrow lane beside the bsnl building this Chinese eatery knows their recipes pretty well.my companion was not really comfortable with pork dishes so we ordered chicken manchow soup, chicken in hamoy sauce and chicken fried rice.quantities were huge and tasted pretty good too.their dishes are a bit different from usual Kolkatan Chinese dishes.tung fong is actually a fusion of authentic Chinese and spicy kolkatan Chinese.the space is not so shabby as some people have said and waiters are very friendly too.the best thing is the place is damn cheap.may be there is no ac or sophisticated decorations but this place deserves at least one visit and if you like their dishes nothing can stop you from returning again and again. :)

Food is something which is relished by all. There are many aspects of a good dish, its appearance, its aroma,its flavour and lastly its taste and mouth feel... Tung Naam is one such restaurant which has fulfilled all these aspects and has satisfied a foodie like me. It is located just behind Poddar Court in Chattawala Gali and the nearest metro station is Central. The dishes are reasonable and very filling. Due to the area being mostly chinese, you will get pork items as well. The restaurant is not well decorated like a fine dining eatery and it is not air conditioned. But people still come here because of the food. So, for all of you who love chinese food... Do visit Tung Naam for a great experience....CHEERS.

A restaurant is only as good as its food...and if that is good everything else really doesn't matter. Tasty Yummylicious food is the only reason why this place scores big time in comparison to the several chinese eating places in Kolkata. i have been going there for years but only now decided to write a review. Must haves are Pork/ Chicken Wonton soup - the reason we love it is the thinness of the wrapper in which the meat is wrapped, the flavour of the soup which is light and tasty. Pork/ chicken Ya mein, pork fried rice, chilli garlic chicken, Chilli chicken dry and Fish Pepper Salt and their stir fried greens are must haves. The icing on the cake is all that yummy delicious food will hardly set u back a couple of hundreds. that reason enough to go back again and again

lip-smacking chinese food,authentic and just the right mix of spices, unlike the "indian-chinese" foods you get in most places of the city. The ambience is quite home like(no ac). The joint is managed by a local Chinese couple and right from cooking to serving is done by them or their close ones.The waiters there insist on NOT taking a tip from you (great right?)
To reach you need to get down at central metro station and walk towards bsnl office,though keep in mind they are quite strict about the timings, though all the items in the menu are worth trying and very pocket friendly, for your first visit I will recommend you try wanton soup,moon fein noodles and pork in hamei sauce... enjoy,!

500 for two will get the both of you as full as the moon is when the werewolves come out ;)

This place was on the top of my wishlist for a long long time...Finally went today.First of all,this is not at all difficult to locate..just take the lane beside the BSNL building.

This place is a literal wormhole to the past..the yellow pockmarked walls,the chandelier,the aquarium and fans;all had that quintessential aura of old Calcutta.

Enter the most hospitable,helpful 'dadu' in the restaurant. If you are a first timer, you can ask him for recommendations. He will satiate your meat craving.

We started off with Chicken wanton Soup..This is a signature dish of TN.
The soft wantons literally melted in your mouth.The soup was well balanced but if someone finds it bland,they can add vinegar for flavour.

Then came Mixed Yam Mein and Pork In Hamei Sauce.Yam Mein is basically a longer and thicker version of Chow Mein.You can also try Fa Mein(same taste..slightly thin noodles). The Hamei sauce felt like 4th of July in my mouth...tangy..sour...and slightly hot,it exploded like firecrackers.

Now our helpful dadu recommended Pork Steam Rice and Salt and Pepper Chicken(which is off the menu). It's Steam rice with a pork and veggie broth on top.The pork is lean and quite easy to chew. It tasted light and sweet,which was well balanced by the salt and pepper. It was spicy and was fried just right. The pepper and spices just made the combo fabulous.

The bill came out 670..very pocket friendly..definitely going back again

So yes, to me the place looks a bit gross and dilapidated. Even the road which leads to this place is filthy and fills you with umbrage. I mostly would never sit down to eat here!
The hype about the food is worth it though! The Chinese cuisine that is served here is not just authentic and atypical. My takeaway included 
1. Pepper Fish - it looks all red and fiery. Loved the tangy taste!
2.Fried Chicken Wanton - crispy and a little bland
3.Mixed gravy noodles - Loved the gravy, it doesn't leave you feeling bloated
4. Chicken Hamei Sauces - something new and different.
After tasting the food, the menu seemed under priced!

All the reviews say about the ambience, so nothing to say about that.
Regarding quality of food, its grossly exaggerated. We ordered Pepper chicken, tasted nothing better that road side poor quality chicken pakoda, maximum 1.5 for that, mixed fried meifoon, which I can rate 3, fish in hamei sauce, which looked like fish in mutton gravy, I can give 3 for the taste, and fish mandarin, which I'll rate not more than 1.5 in anyway.
My overall experience there was very poor. Am not going to visit again.

The steamed Pork Wonton (Yaam wonton Pork) is the best thing I have had in a long time. That is a must try even for people who normally dont eat pork. 
The chilli pork dry is also very tasty.

This is one of the very few restaurants where I have liked almost every dish that I have tried.

One of the simplest pleasures in life on a cold or rainy day is their wanton soup.I usually go for the pork one, as that is my choice of meat - but the chicken one is equally good. A clear broth with amazing flavours with wontons and some veggies in it - it is brilliant. The wonton noodle soup is a meal in itself, at a very pocket friendly price.

I find it hard to choose a favourite dish here - everything is appealing! Each dish has a character of its own. The portions are very generous for the price. Many of the existing reviews have talked about individual dishes, so I will not venture there.

Equally good is the service. Most of the time, the server was Dinu - who has been around for a while. He has guided me very well through a number of their dishes, including some off-menu ones.

The only thing one may complain about is the shabby ambience - peeling paint and worn out plastic chairs. While this has never stopped me from enjoying a meal there, I will dink half a star for it in my rating.

If you love the spirit of old Kolkata and the old-school Chinese cuisine, you will surely love Tung Nam! You will love the place the way it is today. The place wears a wrinkled look but you need to see through her eyes and read her mind, in terms of serving best-in-class old-school Chinese food she is still the best in town. If you are here at this place you will feel as if you are in a time warp! Many people of my age or younger are unaware of the existence of this place but once you try them out you will surely spread the word, and this word-of-mouth advertising is very much required for this age old eatery. Now let's get down to the review:

Location ---- Couple of weeks back I was here at this place with one of my foodie friends, both of us had little clue about the location. Actually it is a bit tricky for the ones who are not regular at this place near Terreti Bazar. You need to get down at Central Metro Station and take the lane alongside the dark Shivaji statue. You have to walk for a minute or two and then you will find the place on your left. It's best if you turn on your GPS when you are coming out of the Central Metro station. Parking your car in front of the eatery can again be a bit tricky. You might need to park it somewhere near Poddar Court, which is very close though. 

Ambiance ---- As I said earlier the place literally is worn out, it is bit dilapidated with decaying walls and not-so-cool sitting arrangements, simple wooden tables and plastic chairs, and ofcourse no AC. But hey, who cares! Atleast for a foodie like me this is a piece of heaven, one hidden gem! You will find some ancient chandeliers and lamps which are screaming out the tales of bygone era and making things even more enigmatic. On the tables you will find small and cute Coke and Thumpsup bottles as Salt and pepper shakers. Apart from that the cutleries are not that impressive, chopsticks are provided on request. The place is frequented by local Chinese people and Bengali foodies who are surely the loyalists, to say the least. 

Food ---- Both in terms of quality and quantity I will rate this place 5 out of 5, no doubt about that. Most of their dishes can be shared by two. We had ordered for: 

a) CHICKEN WANTON SOUP: It was heaven for me. On my next visit to this place I have promised only to have this soup for my meal, nothing else. One bowl of soup is sufficient for two. The clear broth is extremely flavorful, aromatic, soothing and healthy. It has got nearly ten steamed chicken wantons in it, clear soup with lovely meat chunks, mustard green and silky wanton skins...bliss! Add a bit of chili vinegar, soya sauce, red pasted chilies and you are sure to fall into a state of euphoric everlasting joy! It'll be a crime if you don't try this item out. 

b) PORK HAMEI SAUCES: A dream dish for pork lovers. Tug Nam has been always a heaven for them. Pork in Hamei Sauce is good and goes well with Yaam Mein. It has got one typical smell from the oil of that Hamei sauce which might not suit everyone. The pork pieces were soft and well cooked with right proportion of fat in it. Quantity was good as well. Will try out their chili pork next time. 

c) VEG YAAM MEIN: I absolutely loved this preparation and maybe I'm going to try them out everytime I am at this place. It is one better tasty tossed noodles that I have tried in past few years, definitely at this pocket friendly price. It had the right amount of finely chopped tossed veggies and mustard greens in it, add some green chilies in vinegar, red chili paste and there you go. Must try. 

d) CHICKEN GRAVY NOODLES: And here is the dish most bengalis would feel safe to try out :) As usual one awesome preparation. The chunky chicken pieces and diced veggies, the aromatic gravy everything was just perfect, goes very well with some spicy porky sides. 

Service & Billing ---- The orders are collected pretty promptly after you grab some seat. And the food is served at brisk pace, comes to you definitely by 10 minutes. Polite staffs and helpful suggestions, what else can you ask for. No one can match their quality at these cheap rates. Coming to the billing - Printed bill is not provided at this place, you need to pay by cash and yes, there is no additional taxes charged. Our total bill for above dishes came to just INR 430/-. One thing - Try to reach this place before 3PM (for lunch), the doors are closed sharp at 3PM and no new customers are entertained then. 

Overall ---- This is the place with dark, old and odd looks serving awesome value-for-money old-school Chinese in town. If you haven't yet tried them out please go and have one meal. Try to overlook the shabby interiors and just get lost in the delicacies served right in front of you. Hog as much as you like without thinking about the pocket pinch. Or you may go for take-away as well. After you taste them I bet you will certainly spread the word!

Cheers!

Atlast gave it a visit today after reading loads of good reviews of it for a long time!
Nd like others have said earlier in their reviews, it's really difficult to locate this food joint!
LOCATION: while u r infront of the central metro station, start straight from the Maharana Pratap Statue towards barabazar, walk for around a couple of minutes till u reach the nearby BSNL Building (blue painted) or a green coloured mosque-like structure which actually happens to be a church! Take that lane between the BSNL building nd the church, walk till the ends of the lane nd bingo! U'll reach ur destination! Btw, the area didn't seem safe enough for gals to hang around in the evening alone... so just be careful, gals!
INTERIOR : an old calcuttan shabby Chinese restaurant with no such decor or luxe seating arrangements.. some wooden tables nd plastic chairs thrown around.. u would even see paint coming off the walls.. but trust me, all these doesn't matter much when the things served on plate is brilliant!
FOOD: Brilliant, all of them! Ordered a mixed hakka chowmein, mixed fried rice, fish hot garlic nd a dry chilli pork..
Each one of them were delicious, to be precise.. nothing much to write about the carbs, while the sides were exceptionally good! The fish hot garlic had the exact hint of garlic nd pepper, nd the dry chilli pork seemed like a piece of heaven served on plate!
The three of us washed it all down with some chilled thumbs up! Nd lastly, the extremely cheap bill made us happy even more! We all r coming back here for sure, nd that too real soon, i swear!

Located at Chatawala Gully,Tiretti Bazaar this place is a hidden gem. Nothing much to say about the decor,just go there for the food and the wonderfully homely ambience. There is one old man who serves the food and gives you suggestions regarding what to order,who is extremely well behaved, courteous and helpful. This place serves MIND BLOWING CHINESE FOOD at such affordable prices. The taste simply left me awestruck. We ordered Fried Rice,Chicken Salt and Pepper Dry and Chicken in Hamei Sauces. It was a superb treat to the taste buds as everything was perfect. Cheers! Will go there again and again! ❤

If you are searching for some genuine chinese cuisine which would fit your pocket, then this place is the best for you. The prices are very reasonable but the food is as good as the best chinese restaurants or even better. The wanton soup is a must. The location and interiors are disheartening though!!

All of us are familiar with English idioms like "Don't judge the book by its cover" or "Good things come in small packages" Tung Nam best justifies both these phrases. A small establishment, perched 10 minutes away from the Central Metro station, is one of the best places for you, if you dig Chinese food. Do not get fooled by the shabby interior, or the very simple seating arrangement. The food here is a mouthful of heaven. The prices are astoundingly cheap. The quantity is incredibly good. The food is light and appetizing. We tried the Chicken veg clear soup, which was absolutely marvellous. It has been a long time since I've had such good chinese.

Tung Nam is a hidden rare gem amidst busy commercial section of the city. This is not a restaurant with ambiance but a old factory been turned to a eating house. I guess this is only such case I came across where the ambiance gives derelict impression but food taste-wise till now best Chinese food in the town.

Not a great fan of soup but tried Chicken Wanton Soup here didn't disappointment. Couple of trick to relish the soup. If you are doing take away then ask them to pack wantons separately and mix then while reheating the soup at home. Another option is to enhance the taste is to add few drops of vinegar and chili sauce supplied with it. Thanks to

In Tiretta Bazar... situated in the area between the back lane of Lal Bazar and Central Metro Station. A small place, looks like a garage converted to an eatery. One of the best in Calcutta- style Çhinese food experience (taste- wise). The pork items are superb. 1 plate of pork/chicken and 1 plate of noodles/rice is enough for 2 people, on a sharing basis. Highly recommended. Fast service, no- nonsense behaviour, nice to place to pop in and have a quick meal.

Three friends met up after three years with a mission: To eat and chat. Chinese was the chosen cuisine, being the familiar yet exotic option common to us all. 
Tung Nam had been on my mind since my sister had praised the heart-healing qualities of its wonton soup, a belief which went stronger after i came across Poorna Banerjee's blog post.
The weather was behaving like an erroneous woman, all blue skies one moment, and drizzling just a moment later. Some frentic searching, and then faithful Google Maps came to our rescue. A short walk from the statue it was. 
I didn't bother considering the cards and went for the Chicken Wonton Soup. My friends chose the Pork Wonton Yam Mein and Chicken in Hamei Sauce. 
The wonton soup came first, and i had a dip in it. The warm, slightly bland broth, unthickened by sacrilege like corn flour, put my soul to bliss. As the soup cooled, I put a wonton in my mouth, puckered up with their housemade chili sauce, light soy, and the chili vinegar. 
A skin having the slight resilience of good pasta and yet the thinness of it drifting on my tongue like silk...the filling was ample, chicken with a hint of onion..it was an orgasm in my mouth. It was perfect. 
While I was absorbed in my bowl of happiness, my friends were enjoying too. The chow was fat, well spiced with bits of char siu, and the hamei sauce was awesome. Fishy, spicy, it was unique in its own way. 
All this costed is no more than 400 bucks, and we went out three happy souls, filled to the brim in the joy that was food.

The first time I heard the name from a fellow friend,I imagined it to be a posh restaurant.But when I walked in,with my friends,my heart sank.Located in dingy Old Chinatown,with plasters coming off the walls and very few authentic chinese handiworks and a large aquarium,this place would surprise me by turning out to serve the best Chicken Wonton Noodles Soup with Chicken Wanton Yaam Mein & Pork Hamei Sauces I ever had."You cannot judge a book by its cover"-this proverb truly fits Tung Nam perfectly! Now coming to the part of how much lighter your wallet would feel after you walk out of the restaurant.I suggest you don't give it much of a thought because the food is really cheap when it is compared to how heavenly it feels in your mouth.The Wontons melt perfectly in your mouth.The pork was tangy  and spicy yet somehow tastes exotic when you pop one in your mouth.As for the noodles,it took my palate on a journey of exquisite and mouthwatering aromas.Every ingredient in every dish was perfect.Service was excellent.They served us with chilled water only seconds after we sat down at our table.I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for an authentic chinese cuisine at a very low price.

It is really a tiny place. Mostly a joint. Non ac. Food was good but may be not that good for vegetarians. I am a vegetarian so ordered for a cantonese noodles, shezwan veg noodles, egg hakka noodles, monchow soup,hot and sour soup. Soups were not worth ordering. Cantoneese was really good. Schezwan and egg hakka was average. We ordered for 3 coke n 2 bottle of water and the bill was 690 for four pax. For being pocket friendly i would like to rate it 4

This is surely a hidden gem. But its name is getting around through mouth of word similarly I got to know of this place. Lets get down to business
Ambience: The name is only the snazzy bit about this place rest the ambience is nothing special. Actually its very dilapidated and old. Looking for fine dining then steer clear.
Food: One of the best Chinese experience I have ever had. I have only consumed pork here so can vouch that the pork is best. In noodles pork yaam Mein and pork hamei sauces are highly recommended
Price: Dirt cheap. The quantity is enough to fill two souls.
So come down n enjoy traditional Chinese in affordable price in a not so hip but small Chinese joint.
P.s. The dadu that serves food is very warm n gracious and he gives excellent suggestions ab food.

This place really takes the idea of small and large to a different level- because a small bowl of soup is large n a large bowl of soup is LARGE!We ordered a small bowl of Pork Wonton soup.The wontons were just too delicious and not soggy at all.Then the spring chicken was such a contrast to the soup. The main course was delicious too.One plate of Mixed tossed Mei Foon was more than enough for two people.Pork in Hamei sauce was savoury.Great food at very reasonable cost.(4 items,sufficient for two people,cost rs530)
P.S-do not judge the place by the looks and decor,the food definitely makes up for the lack of lustre there.
Can't wait to be back soon.
ADDITION:- I was here this afternoon,the shabby walls have been replaced by shiny tiles. There are few more tables now. :) Food was still the same.AWESOME.

We have been here many a times , though all the times not out of hunger BT for passion for food.
Last time we visited we had ordered chicken schezwan fried rice and chilli chicken and also salt and pepper chicken in starters.
The fried rice was just awesome. Wid a good amount of chicken and egg in it. It tastes fabulous. The chilli chicken was nt actually like the ones we have in other restaurants. BT whatever it was .. That tasted too good.  was tossed in A good amount of garlic and chilli.
The salt and pepper chicken is the usual chicken pakora they serve tossed in salt and pepper. It was so so.

This is a Wong Kar Wai eating house, that's what I told myself when i visited Tung Nam about five years ago. It's has the melancholic feel of a place that is all but forgotten. But Tung Nam is much more than just a reminder of a bygone era, it is probably one of the most pocket-friendly Chinese eateries in the town. I love their Szechwan dishes and my friends swear by their Chilli Pork.

ambience is fine , service is not good , food also average , went three times , can't tell the difference between szechwan and hot garlic pork , gravy chowmein didn't have enough gravy , had better fried rice for lesser price . pork was not that good , amount was really less for the price , tibetian delight was far better than this with lesser price .

some of my friends were really pleased by the great reviews of this  place and took me with them as well on a fine friday evening , we ordered a pork hong kong , chicken hong kong , szechwan chicken , fish salt pepper , pork fried mei foon , mixed vegetable , veg fried rice . 
      the hong kong chicken and pork just ruined the night , it was a shame , there were solid fakes of ginger , yes ginger in it . made a mess of such a good dish . my favourite pork ruined to hell . the fish tasted nice though salt was a bit more in it . i loved the mixed veg , only dish worth eating , perfect chinese style cooking .

Having visited a few restuarants in the area, this, acc to my opinion is one of the best options here for 'quality at a lesser price' category i.e its main USP is food quality and price ........ the ambience inside is not that good i.e not resembling that of a standard restuarant ..... there is no AC, so going for a dine-in in the summer months is really difficult ..... its the best option for a home delivery or parcel ..... but the food quality is quite good (which matters mainly) ..... and the pricing is quite less compared to its other counterparts nearby like EauChew(it has a better ambience and AC though :) )  ...... here i have tried several items like Fish Salt pepper ..... Schezwan Pork .... Chicken Ham Choy ....Chilli garlic pepper chicken ....and mixed fried rice with pork .... all the items were tasty .... i would love to visit it again but not in the summer months :)

The spread that will be laid down before you after the ordeal will be enough to take you to the other world! Extraordinarily cheap and delicately good food! A must try.

I have been to poddar court for authenticate Chinese breakfast before... But the food of Tung Naam amazed me. After eating food with 'barely there spice' , the spicy and delicious food  of this restaurant came to me as a surprise. My friends have suggested me this place for its amazing pork.. Not only d pork dishes, but the thupka, chicken dishes , gravy noodles.. Evey dish was delicious!! The place is very cheap, but they don't compromise with the quality. 
Recommended for the people who love Chinese food (spcly pork) and also don't want to burn a hole in their pockets!!

So I finally got down to this place afta takin my ICSE marksheet with a 'Tuesday No Meat' friend! Amazing place and not very hard to find. Keep walking straight down the road after getting down at Central walk straight towards BSNL building and then right or left depending on where u are n u will find it. This is truly one of the hidden gems of Chinese food in Calcutta! The decor is shabby but if u are there u are obviously not there for decor.. The staff or the lone manager/waiter is very friendly and the water served is also good! The dishes were superb! Pork Hamei Chilli Chicken n Chicken Hakka Chowmein. Hamei was lipsmackingly good and so was the Chicken with my friend describing it as the best he has ever had! The chowmein was bit oily but very good. The Hamei mixed with Hakka Chowmein was heavenly! So in short if u are ever down that place and u are in a mood for authentic Chinese then be sure to go down there! Afterall a book cannot be judged by its cover

A hidden jewel of old China town. Looks like a garage of old Calcutta. Plastic chair-tables, a parked bike beside you and other stuffs make you feel you are two decades back. Food is delicious. Chinese made by actual Chinese cooks,one should definitely try pork here with chopsuey. Amateur one won't get it and a foodie one will end with licking his fingers. Obviously pocket friendly,a Sunday outing,a suitable place for "cho vai kothao jai,valo lagchhe na".

I had both good and bad experience at this place.I found this small eatery through zomato and went there reading the good reviews and ratings.
we ordered 4 items: mixed fried mei foon, which is rice noodles and chicken gravy noodles, which had big pieces of fried ginger cabbage carrots etc vegetables. The dishes tasted delicious with decent amount for 2 people.
we took pork hamei sauces, which is tingling spicy, they used good amount of dried chilies. Still it tasted absolutely different from regular Indianised Chinese dishes. we also ordered chicken hong kong, which consists of 8 small chicken balls and tasted little sweeter. the interior is not that mentionable with simplest plastic chairs tables and fans. the food tasted just awesome, a good change in tastebuds.the bill was absolutely pocket friendly
now the bad experience: found a dead fly in the pork hamei sauces, (pictures attached) may be fell on it while cooking, our bubbles of great expectations flattened then and there. we ate the dish though cause it tasted awesome.
wanted to rate 4 for the food, but for the fly marks deducted. now whether you want good food compromising hygiene, you decide.
.......................................................................................
After almost 2 years I visited this place. The shabby wall has been replaced by shiny tiles. Food tasted better, rice quantity remained the same huge amount. pork hamei sauces was oily but delicious as before. Again a different Chinese food experience.

I can't believe I didn't know this place existed. The soups are good. But be warned, the large bowl, is really large. Like really LARGE. The noodles are good too. The quantity is large, again. The fish side dishes are worth trying too. I can't think of one negative word about this place. Think of a crowded street in a Chinese market. Now imagine you see a small entrance into a restaurant in that street. Inside, you find a perfect setting for a kung fu brawl: tables and chairs all around, average space, sort of dimly lit. That's Tung Nam.

When they said its in Central Avenue, I couldn't say no, being the place where you get authentic Chinese food being cooked and served by Chinese families that moved to Calcutta from china long ago. The food at Tung Nam is just brilliant as they use simple ingredients but all the vegetables were fresh, the recipes are being followed for a long time and the consistency in their food is what i really like. The food is delicious, quantities are large and prices are very reasonable. The restaurant is small, to seat about 20 approximately, not located in the cream area of Calcutta. The overall experience was good. There are no downers in this place.

Favorites :- 
Chilli garlic pork 
Wonton soup
Garlic chicken

Finally, it happened. I finally went to this legendary chinese food joint in North Kolkata. A long walk from College Street using the GPS of my phone took me here within 30 minutes. The location is very odd. From Central metro station walk into Chattawa gully... And you will find a BSNL buildng. Tung Nam is located in the lane beside the BSNL buildng.

As i was approaching this place I was dumbfounded by the simple entrance of the place. I went in. Majority tables were occupied. The ambience is ok type, but the food makes up for it. There is a large aquarium as well, which attracted me. This is a Tibetan household where the ground floor has been converted into the restaurant and the kitchen.
I have heard so many things about their pork that i went there to eat pork.I was a man on a mission. I asked the waiter about the spicier dish of pork between chilli pork and pork in hamei sauce,he told me that hamei sauce would be spicier. So I ordered one chicken hakka chowmein and Pork in hamei sauce.
The food came after 10 minutes and I dug in. OMG was my reaction. The pork was soooooo tasty, soft, and yummy. The preparation was soo good that I burned my tongue.. Lol. But it was worth it. The chowmein was delicious, not too much oil but tasty to the power of infinity. The pork in hamei sauce stole my heart. It was spicy, but not too spicy, and delicious. The pork had a good amount of fat in it, which made the dish tastier. The quantity was more than enough for one person. I had to take a cold drink at the end to guide the food in. My belly was looking like a giant watermelon when i was coming out of this place. I wil surely, defintely visit this place again, and i will try the rest of the pork items. If this goes on, pork will soon become my favourite red meat pushing mutton to second, :-D

Its really encouraging to discover this gem in d byelane of territy bazar, only gourmets or connoseur r adviced to visit d eataries since outside senario even d decor inside might send a repulsive vive to its visitor but if u r there only for good chinese food it is highly recommended. Though menu seems very simple with known ingredients of chicken, prawn, pork n ofcourse musroom, baby corn but they taste heavenly! Only d smell of humei sause might mk smone feel awkward n meifoon mgt seems avarage otherwise it would b a delightful experience, on my first visit with my friends we just mostly concentrate on pork dishes but considering their quality  i am sure others would be equally good n d plus point is its very pocket friendly n waiters r really amicable n helpful in selection n guidence regarding d food

Shabby place, not at all great decor but the food is WOW! The lane just next to the Maharana Pratap statue, located opposite to the Central metro station gate at the 5 point crossing takes you to Tung Nam. It was near about 12:30 p.m, when we went there and I presume we were the first customers of the day. The elderly attendant was extremely amiable and helped us choosing stuff from the menu. We ordered for Pepper Chicken and Chicken Fung Mein. I loved the Pepper Chicken more. It is what we can call a perfect "Tok-jhal-mishti" blend. Chicken Fung mein is basically sweet noodles, which is a bit dark in colour. Being a typical sweet-loving bengali, i liked that too. :D The bill came within our budget, which is quite pocket friendly. Well, I can definitely claim that this is one of the finest restaurants serving great chinese in Kolkata.

This place is literally my favorite place for Chinese takeout in Calcutta.
The quantity is amazing and even the quality is up to the mark. Pork products are excellent! I'd suggest the pork wantons.
The only setback is the dine-in. But the quality of the food makes up for everything it lacks!

Like all good things, authentic Chinese eating houses are also shutting down today in Kolkata. Someplace with minimal ambience and no-frills professional service- yet people flock there in groups just for the great food with honest price- Tung-Naam is one such place.

“When do I go and how do I reach ? “

Say, you’re standing in front of Central Metro station at the Road towards Poddar court, Follow the road towards the Poddar Court. After around 5 minutes of walking (that road is a one-way for vehicles – coming towards Central avenue), you’ll fine a blue colored building on you left- that’s Kolkata Improvement Trust Building- adjacent to the Teritty bazar BSNL bhawan. Tung-Naam is situated behind the BSNL building, accessible via the tiny adjacent lane.

This eating house if open from Wednesday- Monday (Tuesday closed) 1130-300 and 6-10 PM. And they are quite strict about the timing 

Well, the interior: 

Ahem, no such thing as an interior. You get a room (fairly big one) with wood tables and plastic chairs thrown around. You find an empty table, and try to make yourself comfortable- the menu card arrives along with water.
 On table, as condiments, they serve the standard chilly-white vinegar, HOTTT red-chilly sauce and salty dark soy sauce and standard salt-peeper. 

“Soup and starter” 

Before you see through the menu-card, order a plate of Pork Yum Wanton with plain clear soup and wanton soup. The wanton here is extremely softy and literally melt-in-mouth type. The wanton dough is made out of flour and egg- and here lies the main difference of the same with Sui-Mai. The Sui-Mai wrapper is made with only flour and water and no egg. And Wanton can be steamed, fried or put in broth/ soup- whereas Sui-Mai can only be steamed.

You can choose the filling here from chicken/ Prawn or pork. Tastes heavenly and price only 90/- for 10 juicy, succulent pieces. It goes extremely well with the light clear soup (priced 10/- per bowl). Alternatively, one can have the wanton soup, where wantons are put in the light clear soup itself and served. Both are good.

In the starter section, next came the Chilly Garlic pork. This is a fried pork dish with fiery taste, but brilliantly balanced. Its a typically cantonese-styled dish with lots of green chilly stir fried with marinated, deep fried lean pork and nothing else matters. 

After the bland-tasted Yum Wanton, this dish was a welcome taste and got us ready for the main course(s). 

“The main course”

In the main course section, they got a huge variety of around 60 items. Mostly made for the non-veg crowd, they do make some brilliant tofu dishes along with other veg dishes- but the number is very few.

The first one was something called Pork Hamchoy Rice. Hemchoy is a salt-dried saag. Tung-Naam makes a gravy with it along with meat of your choice and pours it over the Rice/ Noodles. Its like a gravy noodles/ Rice with a strikingly different flavor- a meal in itself.

Along with it, for my friend, came the Mixed schezwan fried rice and mixed tossed Mei-Foon. Its the standard flavor with distinct taste of schezwan peeper- highly spicy (can be customized) and goes well with any side-dish. Please remember, these dishes can be shared among 2 and heavy for one single person. The Mei-Foon is rice noodles (a thin variety) tossed with chicken/ shrimp and pork and garnished with spring onion. this is lightly spiced and is refreshing. A kid-friendly dish.  

Next were the 2 side dishes: first one was Fish with mushroom and bean curd (tofu). This is a mildly spiced dish with 8-10 chunks of boneless fish, some sliced button mushroom and 4-6 pieces of tofu cube. Wholesome, tasty and very much suitable for kids and less-spicy-liking-individuals. BTW, the fish used here is Bombay-Bekti. 

The second one was Pork in Hamei Sauce. This one is pork (60% lean meat with a light fat layer) cooked in a strange gravy called Hamei sauce. This tastes like an Indianised-chinese sauce with flavors of light-mustard/ coriander etc with a strange oriental flavor. A must-have dish in Tung-Naam. But, sadly, they’ve cut down on the hotness quotient on public demand and made it more subtle type. Still, brilliant. 

And the next 2 dishes were Prawn ball with Hamei Sauce and Chicken with vegetables. The prawn ball with Hamei sauce was very spicy and filling in nature. They serve 8 balls per portion which went extremely well with the mei-foon. The second one was bland in nature and that was the beauty. Chicken cooked in own broth with lots of veg (baby-corn, beans, carrot, broccoli and what not).  

Well, the meal is over and we can hardly move. Those who know me personally, may very well understand that I, by no means, am a light eater- but this place always makes me feel like a glutton.  

Overall verdict, an extremely pocket-friendly authentic Cantonese chinese eating house. If you do not care much about ambience or are ready for a take-away, this is a must-visit.

A hidden gem.. It's so well hidden, you might miss the signboard if you don't look hard enough!
Went there with friends .. and one of them had to wash her hands .. and we ended up taking a kitchen tour! REALLY nice folks :)
The whole family cooks together it seems!

The old walls .. the surroundings.. everything.. it's an experience :)

The food now, it was wonderful and porky!!
We had pork hakka noodles, sweet and sour pork and chilli pork ..

The pork had enough fat on it .. yum!
Everything was pretty cheap, considering the quality and the quantity.

Ratings:
Ambiance : 4/5 for me ( I loved it personally .. you might like snazzy malls , but for me this is bliss :) )
Food : 3.5/ 5
Cost : 4/5
Service : 4.5/5 (always with a smile)

Overall verdict : I will definitely be back!

Intro : You would have already understood from all the review s that this is a place for the taste buds and not for the retina !!
Attached photos will validate this claim!!
However  the noodles slightly dented the expectation that I had post reading the other reviews  ...May be had set too high a benchmark...having said that food is at par with  any Chinese joint in Kolkata details follow..
Food :
Chicken Wanton Soup - Just Superb,fantastic,awesome,amazing ...running out of adjectives 4.5/5
This is the best wanton soup that I have and I can vouch you would say this too !
The wantons will melt in your mouth ...voila! 
Mixed Hakka Noodles - nice, adequate prawns,chicken etc ...tastes good , but a tad  too much on the oily side , expected something better 3.5/5
Chicken in Hamei Sauce - very good, absolutely different , spicy but the aroma is just superb ... 4/5
Service - Smiling staff ...4/5
Overall - 4/5
An amazing experience ...real authentic Chinese .I am going back to check out the other items in menu...

We went to Tung Nam with some with my college friends. They didn't provide any maps, so it was bit difficult to locate the eatery at first. But when we got their, it was a carnival of taste. We were running a bit tight on the budget. We were 7 people. So we ordered 2 Mixed gravy chowmien, 1 Gravy Chowmien, 1 Pork Chowmien and 2 Chicken Chowmien. No side dish. The chowmien were great to taste and had loads of vegetables, chicken, prawns and porks. The quantity is apt and quality is good. The waiters were friendly. If you are running low on budget, this place is a must try.

With delicious food and pocket-friendly price,it's a little place of joy for Chinese food lovers!!!
Though it's placed on an odd alley near Poddar Court,don't let it fool you. It tends to get quite crowded after 7pm! Once I had to wait 30min straight to get a seat! But found the wait worthy once the food was served!!

Oh my God, being a self proclaimed foodie, I never reached this old eating house....Shamefull!!!

After some inetresting reviews in Zomato I lastly visited this restaurant a couple of months back. There were so many hints in the other reviews, I didn't have to search too hard to get this place.

On entering the restaurant I was very doubtful about how it would be. Clealiness was ok, but Zero decor. A man took the order for Noodle  Wanton Soup, Mixed Steamed Noodles and Pork in Hamei Sauce. All of these were outstanding with considerable portions. May be the taste were  nearest to the authentic version of Chinese Cuisine. Wantons were so juicy, Noodle was just perfectly seasoned and pork was uniquely tasty. But trust me, my heart is still not fullfilled, there were so many items in the menu card and I just tried 3.
So Tung Nam, here I come soon.....

The old school Chinese eatery in the Poddar Court area.
Well, to reach it you gave to tread over probably the most stinky and congested stretch of tarmac in the city. So a big downer is the location.
The ambience is non existent, but then one shouldn't be expecting much as well.
Coming to the food. We gorged upon Pepper chicken, chicken mei foon, gravy chicken noodles and some chicken main course dish.
The food was pretty decent, and the quantity was sufficient.
The price, considering the barebones ambience is not that inexpensive.

All in all, a decent place to have authentic Chinese cuisine. The big downside being the location.

Visited on 25th Dec. Wanton was not there. They couldn't handle the rush. The food was just average. Only Hamei Pork tasted different. Shredded pork in a pool of oil with a strong punjent smell of fish sauce. Some may like it. My suggestion is never visit on a holiday because they are capable of taking care of few. Even they stop making hand made wanton on a rush day.

Have been a regular patron of this joint since 9 years now, I make sure to visit the place every time I happen to be in Kolkata. The place seems to be stuck in a time warp, you will find very basic table and chairs and not much of decor, wall paint has patches with a huge aquarium with a similarly huge Arowana swimming in it. But apart from from all theses external things the food has the same unique taste and aroma which I found the first time 9 years ago. I can for sure say that this place serves some of the best Hakka Chinese in Kolkata. Make sure to take someone with you who knows the place or else you might not be able to find the place. Do try Chilli Pork, Chicken Wonton Soup, Mei fan noodles its simply awesome and I can bet that you will come back for more.

went there with 2 fellows... 
earlier , i tried to locate Tung Nam(name probably means "what u wanna eat") once, but cudn't find it in the congested chattawala lane,burra bazar...
first of all, the "Old Calcutta" ambience... some wall hangings, beautiful old pattern lamps in wall, a big aquarium, a big chinese sticker which resembled ganeshji...  noise of the busy burra-bazar vanished as we entered there..the gate is too little to find it out..(if u dont know this place,better go with some1 who knows).... one waiter is enough they think... 
coming to the foods here.......
If u dont like pork, dont come here to waste ur time.. chinese soups are great, we took pork noodle wonton soup at first.. fresh enough..The service was quick.....
then "the" chili pork dry..which is making me drool still now.. we ordered 2plates of it along with 2 plates of schezwan pork fried rice..which was good enough........... the most important part is the price at which they offer such good items..approx 200 per capita...   If u love pork, go there without thinkinh, u wil never regret.. fortunately i live nearby .. :D

Calcutta offers a host of Chinese eateries, but very few are as Chinese as "Tung-Nam". It is aptly situated in a old building in the Chattawala Gully. The street, the building are reminiscent of old Calcutta,enter the place and it feels as if you have stepped into a bygone era.The walls with peeling paints, an old ladder resting by, wall hangings, an old cupboard plastic chairs, red table tops are the only contributors to its décor.If you are used to Indian Chinese, you will not be bowled over by the food.This is much lighter on the palette. Their signature dishes are the wanton soup and pork in hamei sauce.Wontons tend to conjure up images of fried dumplings, so if you want to swap it with a healthier image, try the wonton soup over here.Minced meat mixed with salt and pepper , stuffed in thin wonton wrappers and boiled till silky smooth, and placed  in the clear broth with green veggies is sure to make you smile on a cool winter afternoon.Pork in hamei sauce has a light pungent and chilly taste, is slightly on the oilier side but team it up with the hakka noodles and its perfect.If you are one who gets yucked out with liver and bellies, do not ever try the kaptai.Other than that, order anything on the menu and you are assured of a filling, delicious meal.The price is on the cheaper side for the quality of the food it serves.And yes, never forget that it is an old-fashioned eating house run by a family, and not a conventional restaurant-Tung nam serves simple, good  Cantonese food, sans the frills of décor or ambience.

Tung nam is a really nice place to satisfy your chinese cravings. Tung Nam is situated on the ground floor of an old building straight out of an era gone by with plastic chairs, wood tables and sparse wall hangings. The large room with 5 tables and whirring fans and mozaic floors add to the charm.
I have been a regular here and I must say that the pork is amazing! The chicken is good too. Pair the spicy pork in humei sauce with any veg rice and you are in porky heaven! The soups taste heavenly too.
The prices are pocket friendly and portions generous! Paired with a fast and warm service, this place is a gem if you are low on budget but want filling chinese.
The only downside is the dishes are a bit too oily sometimes.

There are places with grand decors serving mediocre food, and there are places with mediocre decor serving grand food. Tung nam falls in the latter category. Inside it almost looks like the remains of an ancient building, however the place is kept neat and clean. The tables and chairs (sometimes stools) are absolutely basic and you would feel they have done nothing to up the looks of this place. And to be honest they don't need to because the food they serve is a gastronomic delight. They make the best wonton soups without doubt. I like their rice noodles which teams up nicely with Manchurian chicken. The chicken haimei sauce which is so popular is a bit too spicy to my liking but very much palatable. Prices are low which adds to the place being so popular. As for the service, it might not be up to the mark, but i am ready to wait the extra minute for food this delicious at this price. I haven't tried their pork dishes yet, looking forward to another visit.

We got home delivery from this small chinese eatery hidden in the hearts of Territi bazaar,Kolkata. 
Order - Wanton Soup, Pepper Fish, Chicken fried rice, Chicken rice noodles and Schezwan chicken.

The wanton soup was simple and delicious. Serving 10 wantons for 100bucks is filling and cheap.
The pepper fish was well cooked. Spiced pefectly and having the correct amount of crisp when biten into.
The rice noodles and fried rice were prepared well with minimum spices and had lots of chicken.
Schezwan chicken is what stood out. Having had schezwan chicken in as many as 7states in India in N number of restaurants and also having had it in Schezwan province in China, all I can say is its the best and the nearest to the original China version (though Indianized). It will make you cry if you are not used to fiery food, but its the best. Its a must have for all.

All this for a bill of Rs.650/- inclusive of all is a truely pocket friendly affair.
I will keep visiting and request you to visit too.

If you like pork and the most authentic chinese (well Indian Chinese true to its roots) then TN is a must. Its located in a very bad place and service is slow and the decor is bad but dont bother about such trivial issues. Go there and be mesmerized by the food. If you're the type who likes the bling and not the food please stay away. Remember even mainland china cant match this joint.

Their soups, the pink pork, the cantonese style noodles, the lovely fried rice, what can I say , the list is long and you cant have everything at the same time. So keep visiting TN and ensure it stays on for may years to come and doesnt close down like Hauwa, freeschool street.

Young people using Zomato who havent heard of this place earlier, you must visit TN if you want to eat some real chinese.

I wont say its a bad option food wise but service is really slow specially pressure time, cause people are waiting quite a long time to get tables vacant and some customers are occupying the tables for long durations which is definitely a matter of thought to either wait long hours or to make up your mind to eat somewhere else considering other nearby options .
Now coming to the interiors i would say nothng much fascinating except for some old heritage photos and paintings as well as some chinese decorative design structures which is definitely has some history behind it and finally talking about the walls , well they need some facelift and whitewash for a proper look of the restaurant and to attract its customers .

My verdict - Its a heritage restaurant so you shouldnt miss it out.

TUNG NAM 

This little shabby joint i discovered while scrolling through zomato , going by its rave reviews and rating we decided to pay this place a visit, easier said than done ,it was a herculean task to get to it, its at poddar court in barabazar, we went to esplanade and cabbed it . Before hand i must tell you don't have high expectations from this place and we went in the afternoon cos frankly i wouldn't go to this place with a girl at night. 

Coming back, i always mention in my reviews and in my blog that decor makes or breaks the joint along with service and food, i was very disappointed with the decor of this place felt like it was just a shelter for refugees , plastic chairs , walls riddled with holes and cracks, we were welcomed by a dadu an we took a seat , i could only see Chinese people  there eating with chopsticks, the menu was vivid and contained a plethora of pork items which was a saving grace, going by the reviews i ordered Chicken fried rice and Pork in Hamei sauces and my friend ordered schezwan fried rice and Sweet and Sour chicken. The ambience was not too pleasant , there was an aquarium and that's all. The server boys were looking at us i still cant figure out why, the food arrived in some time albeit service was prompt, the pork looked very appetizing and so did the chicken , the rice was ample in quantity, my friend was skeptical that the pieces of chicken in her rice were actually pork and i had to taste it to make her believe that it was chicken.

Food was nice although the star was the pork in hamei sauce and the rice was tasty flavorsome and enough to satisfy your craving, if i again go i will go for this item only, agreed its very cost effective but they could give a touch to the rickety interiors. The bill was around 400 bucks which was okay. 

VERDICT - Food was okay ,but the interiors and ambiance not so. Still worth a visit.

Oh my god. Its so good to see your favourite restaurants on zomato.  This is possibly the best ever chinese restaurant that I could have ever visited. Its near burra bazar. On the way from central to tea board. Tuesday they keep shut. No marks for decor, no marks for ambience,  no marks for hygiene issues.only marks given is for goodness of the food. The best yam fried wanton o have ever tastes is here. The chicken mushroom soup. Ooolllaala. The wanton soup. I can kill any one or appease any one to have it. And the best ofcourse is yet to come. The mixed gravy noodles is the best they ever have any where in the city. Loads of pork, loads of prawn .. and what adds to the tastes the fat noodles and ofcourse they tend to fry the noodles a  bit. That in turn adds to the taste even more. I love the hor garlic chicken. Then the chicken on black bean sauce. Then there is this roast chilli pork dry that one can neva finish alone though u would want to. Its this tasty. I bet no one makes such great mixed gravy chowmein in whole of kolkata. So u can definitely try this. If hygiene is an issue. Do parcel it. But definitely make it a point to have it.

Chinese. This used to be my favourite food until my visit to Kolkata. I visited here after I had chinese food for 5 times in last 4 days. So I was already fed up of the chinese food. But, the food was not so bad here. Being a vegetarian, I didn't try the non veg food, which was their speciality.  The chinese people were very friendly. And the chopsticks were the best part. I dropped almost 15% of my food in learning how to use chopsticks, but its very much fun after you get used to it. Ambience was ok. Service was fine. Value for money was good. But in comparison with Ahmedabad, the food is very cheap in Kolkata. So I feel all the restaurants have good value for money. But, it was good. Food was salty.

Ambience: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Value for money: 4/5
Taste: 2.5/5

For a change, this is one place i came up in Zomato and went with my partner. Glad we did.
A little difficult to locate, once you enter, this is an old fashioned eating hall..minimal decor, a big aquarium and a smiling man waiting the tables.
We have been there a number of times. Had noodles / meifoon and pork dishes. Each time each dish is perfectly cooked : meat well cooked, flavors distinct and different. Never been disappointed. And never costed much for the quantity and quality of food they offer.
Still a lot left to try on the menu. Saving the soups and wontons for the monsoon cold ;)
A great place serving good food the authentic way. A big thumbs up for their effort.

A personal favorite, this eating house never fails to put a smile on my face (and my wallet)! A wide variety of food, authentic preparations, many of which I haven't found in other popular chinese food destinations, pocket-friendly prices, willingness to customize the order to taste,.... the list of pros of this place is endless!!

Their soups are plain and refreshing in any weather. The noodles - Yam Min, Mi Foon, and Red Noodles (sweet) are all amazing. I often ask for the Yam Min to be made low-fat and they always oblige. On my most recent visit I tried steamed rice with vegetables. This was another dish which easily worked its way up in my list of favourites - very light, filling, and tasty. If one needs to spice things up a little, just order manchurian balls on the side. There is so much to choose from, that it is really difficult to put it in one review.

Coming to the ambience, it is a very plain chinese eating house that is rather tough to locate and has very modest interiors. I personally do not mind this. In fact I enjoy the reference that the place makes to the good-old Chinatown of Kolkata days - there are chinese showpieces, fish tanks, and a table where you can almost always see a couple of old chinese people involved in community dining. The waiters are friendly, especially once you become a regular. They even allow me to use a personal toilet at the back of the place which is such a boon in the winter months! ;) Another advantage of this is that when you walk up to the loo, you can notice that the kitchen is so clean and well-organized.

All in all, both thumbs-up to Tung Nam. I wish more and more people discover this place, and that they remain consistent with their food and service.

This is a place i go to when i'm happy or when i'm upset or when i have a cold or when i am perfectly healthy....you get the drift...i just need no reason to hit this quaint little eating house standing unobtrusively between central and poddar court.
I wasn't so sure when i entered it...what with the room with peeling walls and haphazardly arranged stuff all around.But the elderly waiter with his smile welcomed me in.Though disorganised,its clean.
I have eaten a vast majority of everything in their menu (and some outside their menu) in my innumerable visits there and i haven't yet found a dish that hasn't pleased me to some degree.The wonton soup,as you may well gather from everyone's reviews,is a legend.A heavenly respite when you are cold.So is the yaam mein and the pork with hamei sauces.These three items constitute the holy trinity in their menu.
Among other delights are the chilli pork,mixed rice,garlic fish etc etc etc. They also make delicious food outside their menu if you ask them to.I've had some stunning new preparations of chicken and pork. The chilli garlic chicken and salt and pepper pork were power packed performances among those extra tid-bits they oblige us with.
This is a place which serves mee min-a sweet noodle dish that is sure to enthrall you.
They have never let me down yet.What with the prices being cheap and the spices creating a riot in your tastebuds...I'd ask you to definitely try it out if u are literally prepared to go great lengths for good food,undaunted by the exteriors!

As they say...Looks can be deceiving....That's certainly the case for Tung Nam.
It's located near Lalbazar central avenue. A very shabby town. It's also known as Old China Town.

The Restaurant is an old - one storied building, with very simple tables and chairs. It's non-air conditioned. The decor is very minimal with some Indo Chinese wall hangings, with the plaster peeling off the wall.

But honestly...Don't be fooled by the looks of this place...The food packs a punch.

I had my friends with me. We ordered Wanton Soup, Mixed Gravy Chowmein, Mixed Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken Hot and Pork Hamei Sauces.

The wanton quantity is a lot. It comes in one big bowl with several pieces of wantons. it's clear based soup with greens. You need to add some salt, pepper, soy, sauces for flavouring. But if your looking for a light soup with minimal flavour this is the one.

The Mixed Gravy Chowmein has a decent quality for two people to split. The gravy is very smooth and not too starchy. The vegetables are cut in thin slices which are an inch or so long. The meat is well assorted with pork fat also among them. During the cooking process, the noodles were slightly charred (burnt) for crispiness and flavour (at least I love it).

The Mixed Fried Rice also has good quantity for 2 people. The rice is well cooked with the vegetables being cut  into nice small pieces. The meat is well assorted with pork fat also among them.

The Garlic Chicken Hot has 8 pieces of chicken made into small chicken balls, stirred fried with garlic, red chilli flakes and it's oil based. The gravy/oil has all the garlic flavour which is nice and hot to taste. The chicken as a stand alone piece might be a  tad salty. But the dish tastes really good.

The Pork Hamei Sauce is almost like chicken garlic but the flavours are much different. It's oil based with chilli flakes and the meat is cut in small slices with pork fat also there. It's very much on the spicy side. Overall it tastes really good. By the way this is the only Chinese restaurant which offers this on the menu.

Overall the experience was good. The staff is very friendly. The prices are very reasonable. A meal for two would cost around Rs. 300 - 400.

I would love to go back for more.

Today while searching for good chinese food at cheap price came across this name on zomato and decided to hit .Convinced a friend to accopmany .Its a long journey from my office which is in saltlake to central.From ultadanga to shova bazar then finally central metro.For the first timers its hard to locate.U need to get down at the central metro station near by poddar court.Then take a right towards poddar court.Aftr 5 mins u reach BSNL bhawan(grey tall building).The place is just behind the builing.
Please dont expect a posh or good ambiance.Very normal place with plastic chair and tables.Outside its written "Eating place".
The name is justified,Its a eating place only which serves only good food and nothing else.The place is neat and clean.

After this long tiring journey in this hot humid weather it took me some minutes to settle down and then the order was placed.
Going by the reviews it was easy to make.Chicken wanton soup,egg fried rice and chicken in haimei sauce.Since my friend was not interested in pork had to go with chicken.


The soup came quick.This one large bowl.More dan enough for two people.

Honestly the soup is nothing great without the dumplings.They are soft and smooth.Never had something like this before.
The fried rice was good.like perfct chinese rice.Not too oily not too fried ,perfectly cooked ,good to taste.
Now the chicken in hamei sauce is something I never had.I wondered whether it was actually a chinese dish!!!

Its very spicy and very differnt to taste .The quantity again is more than enough for two.We finished the food in some minutes.completely satisfied with quality,quantuty and taste.


The bill was 320/-

If you are in bara bazar  or central or chadni chowk or near by places during lunch time this place is a must visit.

I visited this place yesterday after reading the reviews,and truly this is an awesome place for people who really like chinese food.Going by the reviews,I ordered for the chicken wonton soup which was more than enough I must say, for two persons.The wontons were too silky and the dough was a perfection.Overall the taste was awesome.
Next was the chicken fried rice,noodles and chicken in hamei sauces..The rice was good and the amount was ample.But the chicken hamei sauce was a real treat.As soon as I first put it in my mouth there was a dashing flavour of spice and chilli.I had no clue what this dish would taste like,but thanks to previous reviews that helped me choose it.
If you expect good furnishings and interiors,you will be annoyed.The place is kinda shabby one,but clean and the hall is quite big,though there are very few visitors.
Lunch time:12 to 3pm 
Dinner: 6 to 10pm
Note that there has been a rise in food prices from the ones given here on the menu card by approx Rs.10 on every dish.

Today i went to college street to visit one of presi friends. After we were looking for nearby places and we came across and based on review decided to go for it. Finding the place is bit difficult and finally google maps came to rescue. The eating house is just spacy big room with around 20 plastic chairs and the room in serious need for attention. But soon we enter we were greeted by warm helping waiter. Based on zomato and waiters help we went for wonton soup mixed yamn Mein chicken in haimei sauce and two drunks. Soup arrived quickly in a large of bowl where broth was soo light and refreshing with melt in the mouth wantons. Yamn mein was well complemented with hamnei sauce which was tangy spicy and tasty all at the same room. Really had a good meal at economic price. 
P.s spice and "jhal" lovers will have a treat for their taste buds! Bon appetit. :)

The signboard outside the eatery calls itself a "eating house" and one will encounter the same inside. The hall looks like the hall in a house/home and one gets to see sections of home and family members. It is not a restaurant in the classical sense of the term but does the job of providing a tasty, wholesome and cheap meal very nicely. The hours are a bit strict and if one walks in around 3 in the afternoon, chances are that he will be shown the door. I walked in just after 3 and was curtly asked what do I want and when I asked apologetically (glancing at the clock) if  I could have some lunch, the lady showed some kindness. I had a Pork fried rice as that was readily available and it was delicious, filling and pretty good. I ate my lunch alone in the hall as the lady and others had disappeared inside the house but I was served hot food and all the sauces and accompaniments were provided without asking for it. In fact, since it was closure time for them they switched off all lights but kept the one above my table glowing. A little girl came out and dumped her school bag in one of the tables, I guess she was supposed to do her homework but seeing me, she went inside. I felt like barging into someone's home and finished my lunch quickly.

I wish to go back with a couple of friends one day, positively much before 3 and have a good full course lunch. My experience today tells me that we are going to love it.

This is not an easy place to locate if you are going there first time and its not near 'Chaatwala' gully. Its the 'Chatawala (read Umbrella)' gully. Appears out of no where and dont expect ambiance, decor or awesome service when you come here, but you can very well expect awesome taste if you plan to land up here. 

We went there few weeks ago on a Sunday breakfast but given our love for sleep more than anything else, ended up there for lunch. Going by the reviews posted on Zomato, ordered the Wonton soup but the Chicken one. Its true that 'silky' and melts in your mouth. And the soup was warm and clear with loads of wontons. Next we ordered Pork Chilly and it was damn tasty. Its different from other places because they had good quality pork and not filled up with just pork fat, although the dish was quite oily. But pork chilly is must have. Mixed Chowmein and  Chicken in Hamei Sauces needs no introduction (all the reviews talk about it already. Both were sufficient and very tasty. 

Have to get back there soon to taste more on the menu :)

Went to this place after seeing the reviews and the ratings. Had some problem finding the place but eventually got it. If you are looking for good ambiance and hi fi decorations then u r just at the wrong place.The neighborhood and the look of the restaurant might suggest that they don't give good food but wen u have it ur view will definitely change. We ordered for Pork Wanton Soup,Pork in Hamei Sauce and Pork Chowmein. One bowl of soup is quite enough for two people and the wantons were really tasty :-) Next came the noodles and the side dish. The noodles was good in quantity and contained a great amt of sliced pork pieces and the side dish was full of small small pork pieces. Overall the food was really nice and made my day :-) Now coming to the service. The person doing the service was really helpful in choosing the dishes to order for us and we are really thankful to him for the nice service he gave us.

You haven't had Chinese food this good, I assure you.
I was apprehensive: the restaurant is somewhere among warehouses and located in an area that not many frequent. The eatery's sign isn't prominent either. Yet, what lies within is the surprise. 
The chicken wanton soup isn't like any other I've had before: the wantons melted in the mouth. The pork dish (sweet and sour, I think) was equally mind-blowing. The noodles was oily and the chicken in hamei sauce was oiler! 
The last surprise was the bill. So much food and only Rs 475! 
I'm going again!

Okay, firstly, this place took me a good twenty minutes to find, as every single local frowned when we asked them for Chatwalla Gully and finally one realised "Oooo, Chhata-ola Goli? Oi Khabar jayga? Oidike!"  For those lost like me, Take the left before Poddar Court if you're coming from central, and as much as you're likely, do not miss this while walking by. It's a small joint, no frills. The walls looks damp, the room kinda shady.

But wait, do come here nonetheless. Cause I can swear you haven't had such Chinese food in Kolkata, right hand to God!

They close at 3, and it was 2.45 when I and my partner got there. They were quick enough to get us a menu. We ordered Pork Wanton Soup (Reviews helped), Chicken Hakka Chow Mein, Chicken in Hamei Sauce (had no clue what that is, but again, <3 zomato) and a coke! The Soup came quickly enough! Piping hot, it gave away a heavenly smell. We dug in, and boy oh boy, was it the best! The wantons were the tastiest I've ever had. They were perfect. The skin was unbelievably soft, they were full of seasoned, ground pork, and there were Ten of them! :D The wantons literally melted in my mouth, and I could see my partner closing her eyes with every bite! The soup was clear, Veggies floating,with a beautiful, silky taste. I could come back here and order it again and again, every day. It's THAT good!

The Chow Mein was good, a tad oily. Probably vegetable oil! The Chicken in Hamei Sauce was again delicious. Didn't know Hamei sauce is so spicy! The combination gave a nice punch. Took a sip of Coke with every spoonful, and I was in the zone! :) Had no idea when the clock went 3.15, and yet the people there were gentle enough not to rush us, the kindest gesture you can think of when you eat. :P Thanked them. Twice!

Loved it. I don't care about the shady gully, the sad looking interiors, and neither should you. The food is delicious, price is cheap, this place is exactly what a foodie wants. Will be going back to try every dish on their menu.

I discovered this place through my boss and this is a place where we sometimes come over for lunch, our office being near. I have got my mother over as well a couple of times and both of us find the food brilliant and completely authentic.
Every time we try out some different dish (and definitely not Chilli Chicken which is boring!) but what we always keep intact is the wonton soup (pork/chicken).
The food is awesome otherwise I wouldn't have been back.
Tip: Try out this stuff called "Choi". It is not on the menu, you need to ask the waiter specially to give it to you. It's very tasty green vegetables.
I second the view that the food is just as the Chinese have them. If you don't like it here, then it can be safely said that you don't like Chinese food! The taste is obviously different from that of other Chinese restaurants but the quality is top class.

Kolkata's very own Chinatown was originally in Tiretti Bazzar in the Bara Bazzar area of Central Kolkata and not in the Tangra locality off EM Bypass. This was a tidbit of history shared by the server at Tung Nam Restaurant. The owner, manager and the servers are all descendants of the city's old Chinese community. A local meeting  place, you can also find a number of Chinese senior citizens lounging about. It takes the motto Authentic Chines to a new level. Following in the steps of most eateries in its vicinity, Tung Nam is also heading towards being closed down and soon. So, If anyone fancies going there, now would be the time.

The restaurant has definitely seen some great days in it's time but now it looks like an empty godown. The plaster is long gone and the furniture is unsteady. The cheap Chinese lamps and wall hangings look like they have been bought from Esplanade. And the customary laughing Buddha has a solemn expression. The atmosphere, if any, is certainly laid back. Service however is prompt and courteous. The menu is well stocked with exotic sounding chinese delicasies. Prices are average across the board. Just close your eyes and pick anything from the Vegetable, Pork and Chicken sections of the menu. Because, chances are that you wouldn't have heard about any item on the menu. The noodles are divided into Yamm Mein, Mee mein and Chow mein; the principal difference among them being the length and width of the noodle strands. It's interesting to know that cooking styles vary greatly among them. You can avoid the rice noodles or Mei Foon's as it's not entirely Chinese in pedigree having been developed mainly by south asian cuisines nearer to home. 

The food is just as the Chinese have them. If you don't like it here, then it may be safe to say that you don't like Chinese food. The taste is obviously different from that of other Chinese restaurants but the quality is top class.
 
The Prawn Fu Mee Mein was soft, long noodles garnished in spicy vegetable oil. It had little shrimps cooked to crusty perfection accompanied by a mix of vegetables. The taste was light and dry.

The Pork in Hamei Sauces was a more eccentric choice. The tangy sauce led a beautiful contrast to the sweet and sticky pork. The hot chillies provided the kick. Though the pork had a leathery skin, the inner meat was soft. The dark flowing broth gave the dish an unique appetizing visual appeal.

Chakraborty Tip : The tables may seem to be arranged in a careless fashion. That's nothing but the Feng Shui. :)

Tung Nam

The last time I went out in search of Tung Nam I got lost and ended up at Grub Club. This time too it was not an easy task to find the place so before talking about the place i would like to give exact directions to the place. Be on the side of the road with has Raymonds at poddar court and face it. Then turn to your left and walk straight. Take the first right and keep walking straight. Then take the next left and if you have followed the directions precisely Tung Nam should be a little inside to your left hand side.

When you will first enter the place you will wonder if you are at the right place or at a cheap knock off of the right place. Fret not,  just sit down and ask for the menu. The food here is amazing. The decor might be old and shabby but that should not dishearten you. 

The service is quick and precise, the waiters friendly and knowledgeable. The food absolutely amazing.
I ordered a Pork Wonton Soup and a chicken hamei sauce. Both were brilliant, the soup had subtle but flavors that gave a big punch. The wontons just burst in your mouth and have a silky texture and oodles of flavour. 
The chicken in hamei sauce had a mustard flavor that did not overpower and let you just enjoy the chicken. For those who like to experiment put a little of the hamei sauce in a spoon of soup and experience your mind be blown. I just adds a new richness and kick to the soup.

Opinion - A must visit for any person who wants to experience good authentic chinese food where the sole goal is not to make the food very spicy but to make it flavorful.

Cheers to Tung Nam, I really want you to open a branch in Bangalore :p

Absolute perfection when it comes to authentic chinese. Places like Mainland china and tung fong does not come close  if it comes down to comparison. Situated off chatawala gullee in central north kolkata, this place is hard to find at first. But when u r done with ur lunch or dinner, it is really hard to leave. situated in a chinese house, the people living in there themselves cook the food in their 'rannaghor', kitchen that is. When u give ur order, u dont even have to wait for a second longer than 10 minutes. In my first visit, I ordered pork wonton soup,pepper fish, mixed mei foon and schezwan chicken. The wonton soup comes at a furnace hot temperature to ur table. But cools down in ur bowl at an exponential rate. and the wontons, oh my sweet mother of god of all culinary skills, they just melted in my mouth. Never tasted such amazing dumplings. the flavour and steamyness was exceptional and unparallel compared to all other wonton soups i had before. The pepper fish was out of this world. The outside of the fish pieces were crunchy and palatable to the ultimate extent. When u bite into the inner flesh, ur eyes will get closed on their own. The mixed mei foon has an amazing taste, and the schezwan is the real hot and tangy schezwan. Will nearly make u shed ur tears just by the flavour. 

P:S: - Do not add any sauce or vinegar or any other thing whatsoever. The food which u will taste there will make u come again and again, and most of all, it is an exceptionally budget eating experience. All of the above items are enough for 2, and it will cost just 500 bucks  (no vat or any other costs,yes nothing except food price) .

how the hell on earth places like these go unnoticed and places not worth mentioning get established as popular food destinations??? god knows why. do try the pork in hamei sauce and chilli pork also. they are nothing short of a masterstroke by tung nam.
kudos and vamos to tung nam

Do not come here if you are a stickler about posh places and big names. Tung Nam won't offer you those things. What it WILL however offer you is something else - food which is good for you. On this occasion I had a sore throat and a bad cold, and I wanted soup. Tung Nam delivered perfectly in the form of Pork Wonton Soup. Silky wontons in a thin, translucent broth, with fresh mustard greens sprinkled on it to add to the bitter quotient, balancing out the mild flavors perfectly. It was a soup which cured my sore throat, made me feel much better, and the broth was exactly what I wanted. Perfect on a day when I wanted nothing more than soup. Apart from the soup they also make amazing kaptai noodles that should be ideally paired with Pork in Hamei Sauce, but that is for another day.
            UPdate: If you like Char Siu, tell the owner a few days in advance and they will make it for you. Also, they make a mean braised pork belly, but again, you have to tell them ahead of time.

First of all, this place isn't situated near more close to Central Avenue than Burrabazar. It's at Poddar Court, behind the BSNL Telephone Exchange building.

I have been to it a couple of times and have always to go back on my way out. It leaves you with a sense of having treated your taste buds to an aesthetically Chinese wonder that is their food. The food along with its simplistic ambience leaves you cocooned in a world far away from the dashy new restaurants and the hustle bustle of the city.

The Yam-mein (which is basically steamed noodles tossed in flavoured oil) gives you a new dimension in the Chinese world if you are fed up with trying to choose between Hakka and Gravy. 
The Hamei sauce (prawn sauce based) coupled with Fish/Chicken/Pork is a must for anyone visiting  the joint.
Mee-mein is a sweet noodle dish that most wouldn't have come across. Although I am quite accepting to anything that elicits new kicks from my taste buds, its not everyone's cup of tea as I found out from the reactions of my accomplices. 
The Garlic chicken is too sweet for my liking, but to each his own perhaps.

Will surely return for more.

Tired of Kolkatan Chinese? Go back to it's roots.
Tung Nam Eating House is located on a garbage strewn street of Old Chinatown, a stone's throw away from Central Metro. Stepping inside, the contrast hits you in the form of the cleanliness, the traditional Chinese decor, the parrot cage in the kitchen, the minimalistic but adequate table setup and the friendly service. 

The food is grand...GRAND...the comparitive price cheap....CHEAP....

The Wonton Soup was tasty and filling with small wontons swimming in a clear base with spinach.
The Chicken fried rice was nice and smoky with shreds of  tossed chicken.
The Chicken in chilli garlic sauce was an experience having been cooked in chilli oil and having a light, pungent yet spicy  taste.
The Pork in ginger sauce was a delight with the pork balls cooked in a ginger and plum sauce gravy...just right...

Please do visit this place for the contrast, awesome food and the almost-lost charm of the eating places of Old Chinatown.

I have been going to Tung Nam as a child and it is definitely one of my favourite places for authentic Chinese cuisine every time  I come back here.
The pork Char Sui is off the hook which is best eaten without it being fried.
One of my other favourites Is the Mein foon (rice noodles) as well as the fish ball soup.
The list goes on and on and never fails to impress me!
Ambience ... Well who cares :)

Tung Nam is a tasty little morsel stuck in an insignificant lane. But the food is very good! Very authentic Calcutta Chinese. In fact if you have been in and around the old Chinatown, you will know that there are some very amazing hole-in-the-wall restaurants that serve wonderful food in these lanes.

And Tung Nam is one of them!

The place itself might put you off - it is very basic - but the food is delicious. The "smoked" flavours of their noodles and rice are just mouth-watering. Though it's a very basic dish but the Chilly Chicken with green chillies is perfect!

I have the luxury of being very close to them and thus they go an extra mile and deliver it to my house too! Another excuse to sample it's amazing food!

If it is Chinese in Calcutta it should be the restaurants around the Old Chinatown of Tiretta Bazaar. Tung Nam is one of them. This old place might not have great decor, but the food here is excellent.

Personal favourites are Pork wonton soup, Mixed noodles (both hakka and gravy), chilli pork, pepper fish and prawn in hamei sauce.

They also sell prawn chips packets and Chinese sausages.

A great value for money place for tasty and quality Chinese.
