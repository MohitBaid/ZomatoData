This place is a hidden gem. A small joint that serves amazing biriyani and Mughlai food. I found the name to be really interesting, tbh. The service was quite fast and staff were very co-operative and polite. The decor is minimal, painted with red walls and large glass windows. They could work on the decor a bit, I would say. 
Now coming to food - 
1) Chicken Reshmi kabab (6 pieces) - It was well marinated. Chicken was juicy and very tender. It was lip smacking and succulent. Totally worth a try! (Rating - 4.5)
2) Chicken pasanda - It's a dish with shredded chicken in a very creamy gravy, that is just oh-so-delicious. Although it's a non-spicy dish, they made it spicy exclusively on request. Recommended! (Rating - 4.5)
3) Butter tandoori roti - The roti was soft and buttery! It tasted the usual. (Rating - 3.5)  
4) Chicken biriyani - They boast their biriyani for a reason. The quantity and quality of the biriyani is splendid. One of the best biriyanis I've ever had. It wasn't too greasy, very light and delicious. It comes with a big potato and a piece of chicken. Highly recommended. (Rating - 4.5)
If you're looking for a filling, mouth-watering meal to eat, at an extremely reasonable price, then this is your place. Go ahead and try out their food. Happy eating. :)

I am quite regular ordering from Hanglatherium's Garia branch which is nearby to my place and that probably was the reason I ended on choosing them for a bulk order (for around 45 People) a few days back. I requested them to make combo(s) for 45 People with biryani and a chicken side along with raita  to be be delivered in sector 5 and I told them the budgetary limit as well which was max 200 per person. My order was delivered on time from the prince anwar shah branch, perfectly packed, and needless to say more than sufficient biryani and chicken bharta along with the raita. The combo actually was having full plate of biryani. In fact the owner took the pain to deliver the food. Her happy face probably acted as positive catalyst along with the great food. Everybody was happy with the food and so was I, the humble host. Thank you guys! It was worth ordering from you,

Quality comes with reasonable price.... Quantity is also fine. We took 2 plates of Chicken Biriyani with a plate of Mutton Hanglabari which is the signature dish of the hanglaatherium nd it proved why it is special and a Firni.It came at 650/- and they don't charge GST separately.I think its included in their dish price. Delicacy comes at every bite... 5 pieces soft mutton pieces with a unique gravy. Biriyani was also good . But specially Hanglabari was too good you can even take it with simple basmati rice or any kind of roti it will taste better.Besides behavior and etiquette of the staffs were really appreciable.

I am a regular at these place as its just 2 mins walking distance frm my place... I personally think they make one the best biriyani in south kolkata.. their chelo is also good. Bt frankly speaking they dont know how to make galawti kabab.. as our galawti were hard.. very hard.. but other kababs r very tasty soft and deliciously well cooked.. and once the biriyani was also a bit off.. still a 4 star as their staffs r very good and very cooperative.. and the decor is also cool...

Foods we ordered:
1) Chicken biryani
2) Non veg kulcha
3) Chicken pasanda
4) Kesari Firni
Chicken biryani was good but it's not the best place to have biryani. Yes their kulcha and pasanda was going very well together giving it a very stable taste(Do Try It)and their firni is average.

Price: It's super cheap.
Staff and Service: Excellent
Decor and Ambience: They have to work on their decor immediately. Seating capacity is quite less.

Good small restaurant. Location, you need Google Map if you are not local. Decorations is inspired from Mumbai local restaurants. Food is OK. We ordered gawloti kebab, biriyani and their signature dish mutton hanglabari.Biriyani is OK OK type. But I think one food stop's signature dish should be unique. They have only uniqueness in nomenclature.Staffs are good and friendly.There are enough scope of improvement. But I will suggest it for casual dining when you really feel so lazy to cook.

Yesterday total 8 of us visited hanglaatherium... A small outlet and to be very honest the look and feel of the restaurant did not impress us much but when the food came, it was every bit worth!!!! We ordered Mutton Galawti kebabs that came with complementary paranthas which was a perfect wow!!!! Then in the main course we ordered special chicken biriyani and mutton hanglabari... The quantity of 1 plate biriyani was more than enough for two people and taste was yummy for sure... The dish mutton hanglabari is also a winner and it is their signature dish as well...only one small con is we have to wait a bit long for the food but that was managable since we were in a group and we took a little time to convert the place to our adda zone!!!! This place is a hidden gem among lot of small eateries in prince anwar shah road...Cozy restaurant with delicious mughlai khana that too in reasonable price.. What more can we ask for a chilling Saturday night.... :-)

Went there on a Winter afternoon. We ordered their Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala, Mutton Biriyani and Butter Tandoori Roti. Received the food after a Long wait.  The Chicken preparation was good, but very rich. The mutton biriyani however was a disappointment. It had a distinct smell of Rose water and Kewra water which overpowered the other flavours and the quantity was very less. The roti was okay, nothing extraordinary. Overall an Okay-ish experience.

One of the best Biryanis and Kebabs in town. But special mention has to be the Mutton Hanglabari. That's a sellout dish and something worth a try. And rest assured, you will get back for the same multiple times. Another dish worthy of mention is the Chelo Kebab and they do make a rather good one!

We literally had to play a treasure hunt game in order to find out this place üòÇ took almost 45 mins to complete the game. However the food, the ambience, the service did not let all our efforts go in vain. The place is spacious enough. What I would like to add is, they play really nice songs in there that would soothe your ears üòõ we took the chicken biriyani combo, chelo kebab and kesar firni. The food was too good. The quantity served cannot be questioned. The biriyani tasted awesome and the kebabs were delicious! Their firni was the best among all the firnis i ever had till date. Service was very friendly and not very slow! The price chart is also fair enough. All in all, it was a great experience in there. 

P.S- please update the correct location in google maps asap!..

If one wants to enjoy delicious North Indian food at pocket-friendly prices, then Hanglaatherium is the place to be.

Conveniently located just opposite Sanghati Park, it's quite a small joint painted red and white with a brick-styled wall, quirky Bong mural, framed classic movie posters on a wall and lit with hanging lamps.

Was treated here by a close friend who lives in Germany, and on his short visit to Kolkata he'd wished to indulge in some typical North Indian delicacies, partcularly the Indian-flavoured biryani that he missed, so we'd chosen this place.

The hearty full course meal consisted of Fresh Lime Soda and Chicken Achari Kebab for appetiser, Special Chicken Biryani and Chicken Pasanda for the main course and Special Kesari Firni for dessert.

The lime soda was exquisitely refreshing with the perfect blend of sweet and sour tanginess.
The kebabs were too good, best of the lot. Biryani was light and flavoursome, with big chunks of lightly-cooked chicken.
The Chicken Pasanda - a shredded chicken dish cooked in yoghurt and gramflour gravy, whose recipe originates straight from the Pashtun kitchens of Peshwar in Pakistan and which would go well with the biryani as the server informed - were light, not so spicy and extremely satisfactory for the tastebuds. Firni too was divinely tasteful.

Overall, both of us were pleased with the quality and quantity of food served and presented. My friend himself being a confidently good cook showered praises on the kebabs. At such affordable prices this place is truly a hidden gem that must be visited by anyone who is looking forward to some really praisworthy good food.

Year end celebration done at Hanglaatherium with friends. A fare price budget restaurant with good food, service, and ambiance. As its popular for Biryani. We had Order Biryani along with Chicken Pasinda, Chicken Reshmi Butter masala, butter nun, mixed raita and day's special starter Dally 6. At first the Dally 6 kababs were served. It's quite tandoori styled kabab and it's was just toooo good. Biryani was also good. Among Side dish Reshmi Butter masala was better. We are really satisfied. If you are searching for a restaurant near South city, this is best place. Even students also can afford.‚ò∫

Have ordered from them quite a lot of time and have never been disappointed with their food. Their biriyanis are light yet full of flavours. Mutton Kosha tastes brilliant and I prefer it more than their signature Mutton Hanglabari dish. I also absolutely love their special chicken bharta. It's quite rich and heavy and goes really well with rotis/naans. Their service and hospitality is another thing which has made us their patrons.

Dint got a chance to review their dishes which i had ordered before from Hanglatherium... But this time i had to make sure to review their So called Signature dish "Mutton Hanglabari" which is superbly awesome. Though i am not the first one to praise the dish as my fellow food lovers were already going gaga over it. I will recommend this dish to all mutton lovers.
Ordered Chicken Reshmi kebab too a few days back but it was nothing to write home about. It had the aroma but the kebab were neither juicy nor tender & the pieces were also very small.
4.0 rating only for Mutton Hanglabari.

A good place to visit. Ordered for mutton biriyani and mutton hanglabari. Loved‚Äã the biriyani its taste good but I personally don't liked the mutton hanglabari though the taste was new but it was too sweet as I like spicy food that too with biriyani. But I think it can be a great combination with 'roomali roti'. Ambiance was good.
But please don't to the place as directed in Google Map you will be landing in a wrong place. Place go as per the direction shown in zomato it's showing the correct location.

'Wow..!!' This is the first word from my mouth when I heard the name 'Hanglatherium' for the first time. And it is also the same word which came out of my mouth after having a lunch here. First one for its unique name and the second one for their great food and service. 
After so many failed plans finally we(A group of 8 ) bumped into this place. Though it was a busy day  they conducted with us very nicely. 
Now the main part FOOD..  We had some great delicious foods over there. Totally worth it. Loved it. We had Biriyani, Butter nan, kadhai Mutton, Kebabs.
Their service is also very nice. Very warm and friendly behavior.
Overall I had a great experience here. I will definitely visit here again.

I have ordered Special Mutton Biryani few days ago. First of all th took more than an hour to deliver the food. And secondly when the delivered it to me at that moment the Biryani was cold. Taste waise not so good. The pices of mutton were too small. I have heard lots about this reataurant and ordered Biryani but it made me totally disapointed and waste my money. I never ver going to order food from this reataurant. Totally bogus. The quality of road side biryani shops are better than this.

First of all the biriyani was good, aromatic and had a nice flavour to it..even the rice was well cooked too thrn comes the "mutton hanglabari" , ordered it as a "side kick" to my biriyani üòè, i liked its flavour, it was tasty, less spicy but was disappointed at the pieces of mutton that they served. The pieces were well overcooked and contained too many bones. Would have appreciated if the pieces were boneless otherwise it was a great afternoon for me . Overall it was a good experience.

biryani was not so good... chicken kadhai was something like improvised dhaniya chicken with capsicum and onion saute, liked it, but it was not kadhai chicken at all. nun was very stiff and hard to tear. Not satisfied with the food, expected much better food from a restaurant with such a comprehensive rating at zomato.

Reviewing based upon delivery orders does not always give the overall picture but it is indeed an insight. Ordered tanduri lachha , mutton hanglabari , achari chicken , chicken chatpata and special mutton biryani via foodpanda from this joint. Delivery was made within an hour. Well packed and proper hot. But I am not satisfied with the quality of the biryani. Yes the mutton pieces were soft , the aloo well cooked but it lacked the essential aroma and hence the taste. Mutton Hanglabari was good - a little sweet owing to the beresta I guess. Achari chicken was not bad, maybe a little too sour for my taste - not sure if that is what it meant to be but the chicken pieces were soft and succulent. Chatpata can easily be passed upon. The idea of tanduri lachha was good but the execution perhaps was not. Nonetheless , the 40% discount was the star of the show. But the biryani leaves a lot of room for improvement.

Awesome food. We took Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Pasinda. Another dish was mutton biriyani along with Mutton Hanglabari. Nice decor, courteous staff, good location, and yummilicious food. Chicken Pasinda and Mutton Hanglaabari are the best to have here.

The location to this place is pretty confusing to many. One easy way to arrive here is to enter Lake Gardens from Lord's crossing and then take the first lane on your right. It's opposite to the park which lies ahead. The second way would be to head towards South City from Lord's crossing and to enter the lane on the left before the Apollo clinic.

Now coming to the food. 
For a newcomer like Hanglaatherium to make a name for themselves in the Biriyani domain deserves applause,given that there are other famous establishments all around the city.

They've only looked forward since, bringing forward their Mutton Hanglabari and Chicken Pasanda as two of their other bestsellers.

There is no doubt that their Biriyani is good,but I've felt that the Chicken/Mutton pieces are smaller than what is given in other places.
The same applies for their Chicken Chaap.

I liked the Chicken Bharta which tasted different from other places.

I've also tried their Lunch Combo. The yellow dal and the Chicken/Mutton kasha type item were really good.

Pricing is decent.

Can't wait to try their Hanglabari and Chicken Pasanda!

I found mutton hangla bari a little bit sweet.. chicken pasanda and chicken tikka masala were top notch.. just loved the dishes.. pricing is good.service is prompt and service guys are very courteous and helpful..

Hanglaatherium has been a part of my wishlist for long. Got a chance to visit today and devour in some Biriyani. The Chicken Biriyani and Mutton Biriyani focussed on health and taste as it was less oily, yet gave the experience of standard, warm Kolkata Biriyani.
The dish which earned this restaurant a 4 rating from me was Mutton Hanglaabari (the star of the show). The name and taste is really unique in all respects. A complete worth for money.
The firni though delicious and creamy could have been more in amount. In all a really comforting luncheon with a hearty welcome.

This place was always on top of my whislists.so last Sunday I went with friends.

It's located near to south city mall.If you walk towards opposite of jadavpur thana,from the mall.it will be on the right hand side,a small lane.then take right,you will be right there.very small place but neat and clean.having some catchy wall poster also.

We ordered 

mutton hangla bari 5/5

chicken pasanda 5/5

tandori laccha 4/5

tandoori roti 3/5

chicken biryani 4.5/5 (.5=egg) :P 

Each and every item was delicious and the good thing is that this place is not overpriced.i just forgot to ask the name of the stuff who served us,he was very good, polite and funny person.

so will visit again soon to try other dishes :)

Hanglaatherium situated a bit inside of a lane at Prince Anwar Shah road is a cozy joint. The food variety is amazing here. It has got a very cultural Bengali ambience. The rates are quite reasonable compared to the variety & taste. The staffs treat the customers very politely and they are very cooperating also. I am very pleased with my experience here. Hoping to visit again.

I ordered mutton biriyani and chicken pasanda. It was worth it because FoodPanda gave a 40% discount. This is the second time (in as many years) that Hanglatherium has disappointed me. The biriyani was really dry with no flavour at all and few elaichi strewn about. The mutton piece was small and piece of 'seena' (lower rack), definitely not suitable for biriyani. Where is the aroma? The chicken pasanda was not bad but it was little more than a single serving .. no way two can share a plate of the pasanda. 

At 40% discount two plates biriyani and chicken pasanda for Rs 321 it was more than worth it but at list price of Rs 535 .. no way I would ever buy it. 

Both times my complaint (last time after FB message to PB and SB had replied via FB messenger) has been same .. small pieces and flavourless biriyani.(Go to FB messages 20/06/2016 11:04 AM from Arijit to PB and HT). Calcutta biriyani is Awadhi biriyani brought here by Nawab Wazid Ali Shah. It is known for its rich texture (from ghee) and aroma. It should also have a rich taste. This is what one can eat at Nizam, Aminia, Arsalan and Royal (Chitpore Road).

I am really happy, that Bengali entrepreneurs are trying hard to succeed. It is very refreshing, very inspirational .. but Hanglatherium has to question itself .. does it want glowing reviews from college goer and young professional millennials who do not know their 'chaap' from 'raan' or 'zafran' from 'jaitri or does it want to impress semi-aficionados (I purposefully refrain from the overused and underwhelming word 'foodie').

The Ambience was nice and calm. The decor was quite attractive.

We ordered Chicken Tikka Kebab, Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, firni and their patent Mutton Hanglabari. The service was prompt. The kebabs could have been better. The pieces were too small. 
The biriyani was delicious. The quality and quantity will definitely not dissapoint you. Mutton Hanglabari also tasted nice. A little on the sweeter side, Its flavours were beautifully satisfying to the tastebuds.

The pocket pinch was about 840 which is quite reasonable.

If you are looking for a biriyani with lesser spices , this is the best bet in Kolkata. It is a bit dry but it's very much tasty. Try raita with it. The best part is the kebab platter. The fish kebabs , I ordered it twice. Please choose the table near to the kitchen, for luminaries they have used.

Holds a special place in my heart for their dedication to create less spicy less oil and super tasty biriyani. 
Hanglabari mutton is a must try dish here. 
Chicken pasanda is  medium spicy and comes with a thick white gravy with shredded chicken. 
The ambiance is lovely.
The service is lovely. They even help you with chosing the dish. 
Located in a quite corner away from the cacophony.
If you are in kolkata and love food, don't leave without visiting Hanglaatherium. ‚ù§

Last year I visited their Anwar Shah outlet during the pujas. We had gone their around 10 and were seated immediately. We ordered mutton biriyani, Tandoori roti and their signature dish Mutton Hanglabari. The Biriyani was really light and not too oily. The Mutton Hanglabari was just AMAZING. I fell in love with the dish. The Tandoori Rotis were really hard though. And it was difficult to eat them. The prices were reasonable. Service was slow. Overall, a good enough meal. They should pay more attention to customer hospitality.

Heard a lot about this place. But sadly what we had yesterday turned out to be a complete disaster. We ordered chicken biriyani and chicken pasinda. The biriyani was undercooked and the meat was also undercooked. We asked the staff to change it. After much of arguement they did change it but even the second piece of meat was undercooked. The side dish was ok. But not great. The service was not good either. Basically i might not visit this place again. This kind of  food quality was just not expected.

I have been listening about this place for quite a few months now. So, finally I decided to visit this place myself. Honestly, turned out to be a bigger disappointment than I expected.
Hanglaatherium is located near South City mall. Decent outlook , good interiors and classic bengali movie posters add a Fusion Bengali atmosphere to this joint. So on a weekday noon with almost no one around, I visited this restaurant with my mother, expecting a prompt service.
We went in for a full course meal.
I ordered Chicken Seekh Kebab for starter. For main course, rather than going for the signature Mutton Hanglaa Bari, I ordered the Chello Kebab , a personal favorite of mine, and a Hanglaatherium Special Fish Biriyani Combo. To wash these down, I chose a pair of sweet lime sodas.
Astonishingly, the soda was served first. As a host, I would not greet two famished guests with Soda in the beginning. I was expecting the waiter to serve us with the appetizer along with the drink, but that was somewhat okay.
Chicken Seekh was tender and juicy , served along with a simple onion salad and a dip. Things took a wrong turn when Chello Kebab and Biriyani Combo was served.
The Chello is messed up in every possible way. Mutton kebab was dry and full of splinters, the roasted tomato or any other vegetables were missing, Chicken pieces were also not very tender, mashed potato was unnecessary as well as too salty. Most importantly, the sunny side up was left raw near the yolk. One could wash down the raw egg whites with a spoon, which was totally unacceptable from any cook. I was not so happy to find a piece of onion, burnt to death, in my plate.
The Biriyani combo, I felt, served too much of rice and not much of fish. Or may be they forgot to put fish cooked with the rice.
The fish tikka kebab was somewhat good, but the tikka masala turned out to be a disaster. The gravy exploded a weird spicy taste inside my mouth. Sadly, salt or chili were not a part of the gravy at all.
So in the entire meal, the only things worth our time was the Soda and the Appetizers!!
In addition to our tough luck that noon, a pretty chaotic family shared the room with us. Kids running, crying and howling accompanied by their ignorant parents added disgust to our awful experience.
The restaurant authority kept mum, and rather than ordering anything from the dessert section, I decided to book a cab.
Sorry guys, I was expecting more than that.

Before going to the restaurant, I pre-decided what to order by seeing from zomato. The interior was good and as it's said, it can accomodate 16 people at a time. The location is the lane beside the Firefly cafe.

Now comes the food, we ordered four tandoori rotis with butter, two parathas, chicken pasanda and the famous mutton hanglabari.
I normally take pictures as soon as the food comes, but I actually forgot to take it because the food was so tempting. After eating two three bites, I took the pictures.
I really don't know what to say about the food because it was perfect. Lastly we realized that all the prices were including GST so we ordered a special firni. My partner couldn't resist the raisin on the top of the firni, so the picture of the firni has a missing raisin. And all this things priced Rs 615 only!
The staff was courteous and asked us many times how was the food.
Overall: I'm waiting for my next visit. Must go!

We took Mutton Biryanis and their signature, Mutton Hanglabari.

Pros:
Great interiors.
Great mutton side dishes.
Good biryani.

Cons:
While the Biryani they provide is good, it is also very dry and this begs for a side dish. If you take the mutton biryani, the mutton piece that comes with it isn't satisfactorily big enough.

Would I go again? I used to order on a regular basis from here. Would continue to do so in the near future.

We went for lunch to this place yesterday. It's a cozy little place. But the food was not up to the mark at all. We ordered garlic naan, butter naan and mutton hanglatherium. But the quantity was so less we had to order chicken pasanda just to finish our naan. And I have never had such crisp butter naan in my life. It was breaking apart like papad and was burnt at some places too, garlic naan was better but it was burnt too. The side dishes i.e mutton hanglabari and chicken pasanda were really less in quantity. And tasted average. The only satisfying thing was the fresh lime soda. And the bill came up to 660/- for two people and trust me it was not worth the money.

After hearing and checking the good reviews at zomato i along with a group of friends decided to pay a visit to the prince anwar shah road outlet of this restaurant...first of all it's really difficult to locate this place being situated at a narrow alley opposite to south city mall....
The decor gives you the charm of street art..but that's it...because my experience with the food was really horrible...we ordered starters of chicken n mutton haanglabari...while the chicken tasted good,the mutton was real disappointment. The pieces were too stiff...then some of us went for biriyani platter....the platter was decent with keema,cold drink n a sumptuous amount of biriyani...I personally ordered their much talked about fish biriyani and that is where I was really really disappointed.. Too much of garam masala n spices... For the first time ever we wasted biriyani(being an ardent biriyani lover)....not to forget this place is not only over hyped but also too expensive when compared to the food and taste...will definitely not pay any more visit ever...

Great ambience and great food. Order the biryani combos and kebab platter. Biryani, chap, kasha everything was delicious. Even the raita tasted somewhat different from the raitas I previously had. The tikka kebab was very good but I'd say I had the best tikka kabab at Aminia. The biryani was top notch and I could clearly see why it is included in the list of best biryanis in the city.

A group of us grew bored and hungry in college which led to an internet search for affordable restaurants near Jadavpur. The name and location caught our fancy so one packed Uber and some confusing directions later we trooped‚Äã into this little place. 
We had their Reshmi Kebab and Special Mutton Biryani and washed it down with some disappointing Fresh Lime Soda. The Kebab and Biryani were okay but I wouldn't recommend this place based on this lunch. Their portions are quite generous and thus filling.
Maybe the other dishes they serve are better so go ahead and test it yourself.

Accompanied by some of my known fellow foodies on the day of panchami(Durga puja) for the first time in my life I visited this FAMOUS outlet(For those who have no idea this is a so called restaurant located in an alley opposite to South City Mall). Previously I was made sure by some of my friends that this particular outlet avails the best biryani and mutton dishes. I have no idea for what reasons but all of us were quite shocked after having a meal. The service was very bad, accompanied by the waiting time and rude waiters. But the most important thing is food. I am quite sure that the street food stall serve a better quality of dishes. Simply waste of time and money.

The line of conclusion can be drawn by simply stating this place over-rated something just like coffee house.

I was just waiting to write the review for it. It was not that we decided to go there on the day. We went for feast Street of lake gardens and unfortunately it was closed. Now where to go, it was around 4 PM, at we were pretty hungry as we planned for it as lunch and it ended up at 4 PM. Then we thought of many options near by like Abar Baithak. And atlast my friend's mind and Google came for the rescue at it was decided let's go to Hanglatherium, near by.

Location:
___________

This is a small outlet having sitting arrangement of 16 people or so. It's located near to south city mall. If you walk towards opposite of Jadavpur Thana, from the mall. It will be on the right hand side, a small lane. Then take right , you will be right there.

Decoration:
______________

Very small place but neat and clean. Having some catchy wall poster also.

Food:
________

Now coming to the main segment.

‚úì Special Kebab Platter : this platter had 3 Chicken Malai Kebab, 3 chicken tikka kebab, 2 fish tikka kebab. Chicken pieces were soft and juicy. Though the fish was basa, the kebab was made pretty good.

‚úì Special Mutton Biriyani: it was owsum. Having 1 piece Aloo and 2 pieces Mutton. Rice cooked perfectly with less oil . And the Mutton piece they were just too soft. Fantastic in taste.

‚úì Mutton Hanglabari : this dish will surely make you hangla. Owsum in taste. Cooked perfectly with caramelized onion.

‚úì Chicken Pasanda : shredded chicken cooked in yougurt and gramflour gravy. The recipe came from Peswar as they said and it taste superb.

‚úì Fresh Lime Soda -it was nicely done. I wouldn't say it was great but pretty good. Took it twice.

Each and every item cooked with proper perfection. The quality and taste and quantity of food just perfect.

The hospitality of the person of there, need special mention.

All that cost 1110 INR for 2.

Hanglatherium , to me you would be remembered as - a perfect place to serve excellent items of food with a quite reasonable price.

Side dishes are delicious.

Hanglaatherium was on our list of to do things for this Puja (2017)... Skipped home lunch and took a cab to Gariahat. AFter trying to locate the joint for over 30 minutes, realized it got shut down (doesn't mention that anywhere). Took another cab and reached this joint near South City Mall. 

Apparently, their Biriyani is great but we didn't try that. We went for the Chello Kebab (two for two of us), as some friends said that they are selling better CKs than Peter Cat these days. We really doubted that as we are a little biased towards PC CKs. We did ask for the recommendation from the attendant, but he was not very helpful. Anyways, had to wait for exactly 30 minutes in an empty restaurant (they were busy clearing online delivery orders on priority) with just the two of us.

The CK made its appearance and it was underwhelming. The small rice portion looked dry and discolored with a tiny bit of butter on top. Two small pieces of chicken kebab and two small sheekhs. There was one red potato mash (something we usually don't get to see), and yes there was a sunny side up. The vegetable kebabs were almost fully burnt. I took less than 10 minutes to clean off the plate... yes I was hungry. Surprisingly the red mash (they call it a tikki or something, but it tastes exactly like the potato mash of phuchka, very tangy and spicy indeed) was the best part of the dish. Not bad... in fact, I would be very appreciative if some amateur invited us for lunch and served this dish, but frankly, I won't spend money to eat this again. 

But then I am not rating too low as we didn't try their biriyani, which apparently is very good. 

PS: Loved the Dimpong song on Youtube. Good job on that! The decor was OK, more like a college cafe with Mario Miranda like wall painting. Service can be improved, a lot.

During our pandal¬† hopping on Saptami, 2017 , we decided to have our lunch here, this place is located in a by-lane just opposite to South City.¬†
This joint was very crowded, but fortunately, we did not wait¬† as there was a two- seater dining table vacant.¬†
Now coming to our food, we had their special mutton biriyani, mixed Rayta , their signature dish called Mutton Hanglabari , One butter nun and Two fresh lime soda.¬†
Biriyani was of pure Kolkata style along with a large piece of¬† potato and the mutton was soft and properly cooked. i loved their Raita. I really liked the Biriyani raita combination.
¬†Fresh lime Soda was proper as well. I somehow find that in Mutton Hanglabari, they put a bit more cinnamon paste which was not necessary. Otherwise, the quality of mutton was good.¬†
So we had a decent food on Saptami, and the good thing is that this place is not overpriced. the stewards were cordial as well.

I usually get my food delivered from here and there's just one thing I'd specifically mention, during Durga Puja when the quality of food served by most of the restaurants degrades majorly, this is one place that'll still pack a good piece of mutton with the biriyani. Food here is really good. Kebabs are soft and delicious, the chicken tandoori is sexy. When in  doubt, this is the safest option to order for kebabs and biriyani, they barely disappoint. Also, the delivery time is shorter than a lot other places.

Mutton hanglaatherium is a must try. Biriyani is like home cooked and delicious. Chicken pasinda is good. Mutton hanglaatherium could be tried with polao. Haven't tried other dishes, but got a feeling that those will be well cooked also. Pocket pinch is well within budget and the price in the menu card is inclusive of taxes.

Ambiance is simple with old Bengali film posters hanging in red walls. Sitting arrangements are limited, so better to book a table prior to visit. Overall, a good restaurant to try out if within vicinity.

Well we went there to have the Mutton Hanglabari but unfortunately it was out of stock... instead we ordered a plate of Chicken Kadhai and Tandoori Roti.

It was an usual day of work where to respond to my rumbling tummy after midday, I was in search of a new place to satisfy my tastebuds and it so happened that I stumbled across this place and boy was it a pleasant stumble. So I had heard of the place but never visited prior to this. For my first experience, I only had two things, the keema stuffed kulcha and the Hangla Bari, which the claimed to be something special. Well, let me tell you, that IT SURE WAS. Succulent pieces of spicy mutton mixed with a sweet flavoured kulcha filled with meat (possibly reducing my lifespan by several minutes) gave me a heavenly pleasure which I felt with my eyes closed after the first bite (Literally).¬†
I could not gulp down anything after 2 kulchas, so having to rate everything on these two things only. I do plan to go back and try out the other kebabs and biriyanis as well and recommend you, fellow foodies, to do the same.
Oh, and I loved the menu art.

Restaurants with quirky names never fail to pique my curiosity. Hanglaatherium was no exception, although I had no idea what sort of food they served. I was in the mood for a plate of biriyani yesterday, and was going over the options available in Swiggy, when 'Hanglaatherium' caught my eye. The rate and the delivery time were reasonable, and I ordered a plate of their chicken biriyani.

Having been exposed to various styles of South Indian over the past few months, I wasn't sure as to what sort of biriyani to expect. It was with immense pleasure that I found that it was the old-school Calcutta biriyani, with a piece of chicken and half a piece of potato. ¬†There was no egg and I didn't care about it. The amount of oil was just right such that you could enjoy the dish without choking on the rice or worrying about your cholesterol levels. And the quantity was sufficient for one. Well, no amount of biriyani can ever be enough, but you would feel quite full after a plate of their biriyani.¬†

Verdict - I'm glad to have found a no-thrills biriyani place which can put up against the Aminias and the Shiraazs.

Located in the by-lanes opposite that of south city mall, this place is a bit hard to find.
Ambience wise a nice cozy place with not much of decoration to win your adoration, and not too bland to talk about too.
We ordered :-

1. Mutton biryani: it was really nice, and was cooked with less oil which is definitely a plus. The mutton was also well cooked. And they also provide sufficient quantity. Good one indeed.

2. Mutton hanglabari: Well, this is where the disappointment kicks in for me. After seing the name in under the recommended list in zomato and also hearing much about it, i seriously was expecting much more. Sorry, but didn't like the taste at all. And i also found mutton to be a little undercooked too.

3. Tandoori lachha

4. Masala coke

All in all, an average experience. Good for one time visit. 

P.s. the price in the menu are all inclusive of tax

I have been to this place earlier right when it opened up in a bylane of Jodhpur Park. Now it has three outlets and a fair fan following. I ordered the Special Mutton Biriyani and the Chicken Bharta. The Biriyani was excellent.. but without the trademark boiled egg which I missed. However there Aloo and the two big chunks of mutton near about made up for the loss of the egg. The mutton was oh so soft and the potato was perfectly charred and incredibly tasty. The rice was light and oil free. The Chicken Bharta had a boiled egg cut in half placed on top of it. The curry was rich but not heavy, and full of flavor. I was very impressed that Hanglaatherium had held on to it's quality even for a home delivery. Would definitely order in a second time!

The decor was quirky, but with full of warmth. Went there in a rainy day, only to find two other tables engaged. The staffs welcomed us heartily. 
Virgin mojito - though it had a hair strand in it, when we informed them, they had the courtesy to change the glass and make a fresh one in front of our eyes. I was amazed at this level of service and courtesy.  
Starter - chicken seekh kebab ( two wonder pieces, with appropriate blend of spices and essence ) 
Main course - had two chicken kulcha and mutton hanglabari. Initially we ordered 4 kulcha,  but the staff asked us to try 2 first, since it is very big, then if we still want to, we can take 2 more. The kulcha was so big that we over ordered even with 2 of them instead of 4. Mutton hanglabari, their signature dish, was on a sweet side, but was amazing. The fresh soft mutton will immediately melt in your mouth, leaving u awestruck. 
I am coming here again and again and again. I have to try all their recipes.

By far the best biriyani in kolkata. The place is pocket-friendly. The quality of rice is outstanding. The preparation was light hence it was easy for the stomach. The mutton was succulent even ordering food at 10.30 at night. The quantity is sufficient for a regular eater. However Missed the presence of boiled egg. Even the fish biriyani is worth a try. Will be trying again and again.

Had an awesome lunch here today & oh My My... What can I say about the quality and quantity of the food. I was just spellbound.¬†
We had¬†
1. Mutton Chatpata: Spicy and Hanglaatherium special it was.
2. Mutton Biriyani: It has a light and simple taste, only thing was that it was not THAT spicy.
3. Mutton Hanglabari: It was a just too good to taste. I mean I had heard about that but when I tasted it my mind just blew away. Everyone should taste it once in there life.
4. Masala cola: SURPRISE.. SURPRISE.. SURPRISE.. They made the masala cola right in front of us and it was the real MVP. It has the perfect proportion of everything. I just watched that they made it with utmost care & I think I will go there again just to try masala cola again.
The ambiance and Decor was Excellent too. I liked the transparent glass view. ¬†The Graffiti and the classic movie posters took the decor into another level.

First I give a compliment for the environment it's very neat and tidy.

Now coming to food I visited first on last Friday and have mutton kosha with butter tandoori roti which was really awesome. The taste of mutton kosha is really good which was contracted with tandoori roti.

Next I went to the same place to give a treat with my friends and have mutton biriyani with their signature dish  mutton hanglabari and butter tandoori.. biriyani was awesome as butter tandoori but I was little offended about mutton hanglabari as the it is sweet in taste and the pieces contains bones.. that's why I can't give .5 else I believe it can be improved.. I will visit the place soon as it nearby my home.

This is located in Jodhpur park. Close to South city Mall. The place is small but it has a beautiful view of the outside. We ordered tawa chicken kabab,tandoori roti, tandoori laccha and handi chicken. And also masala cola. The masala‚Äã cola was extremely sour when first served but they were very humble to take it back and bring back a better one. The food was inclusive of all the taxes so the cost is pretty reasonable here. When it comes to food the quality was good. The ambience was a bit congested somewhat. Lighting was not that good. All together its a good budget food place.

Chicken Tawa kabab was awesome. Chicken tikka butter masala was average in quantity but the quality was very good. Chicken kadhai was good in taste. We had issues with the taste of masala cold drinks so, they change it. The price was reasonable and the staffs were very helpful and courteous.

People say Hanglaatherium is a hidden gem. Well , if you ask me it's absolutely true.
Whether it was on my bucket list or not that really doesn't matter anymore. It is now one if my most favourite places. 
Tried the Mutton sheekh kabab, turned out to be quite good. Then came the house speciality Hanglaabari accompanied by tandoori lachha. If food can get married then these 2 definitely should. Probably the best combo. The mutton pieces of Hanglaabari were succulent, spicy yet not overpowering.  With a glass of fresh lime soda the meal for 2 was delicious. 
But that's not all. Then came the bill. Shocked me and my friend for a few minutes. All those stuff collectively cost only a mere 630 rupees . Yup not joking. I have heard the term "pocket friendly" but this was something else altogether. 
I would definitely suggest this place. Its low budget, great food, nice decor, what else do you need.
Just lose your self restraints and be HANGLA for a day.

This is one restaurant specializing in Mughlai Cuisines but screams So Kolkata! Their hospitality is so warm that even sipping on a Sweet Lime Soda feels everything. Did I mention I can sip the whole glass at one go? The Biriyani is moist and unlike the most over rated joints they ensure you get the taste and a bite of every ingredient used to cook the delicacy, and that includes the humble aloo bukhara (Dried Plum) in every serving. The Kebabs are scrumptious and the breads are succulent. 
While you guess where exactly did I deduct that one ‚òÖ, well I am sure they can do a lot better when it comes to their decor. They do have a very impressive wall art but such a delicious place can look way more gorgeous.

Well the connection may be sudden but certainly the one to savour for times to come. It was only when I met the owners in a busy Book Fair stall, that I came to know about Hanglatherium. A warm invite followed. And it took six whole months to drop in the cosy corner of Lake Gardens with a beautiful decor and good ambience. 

We ordered, Hangla Bari (the specialised Kosha Mangso) along with Mutton Biriyani, chicken Kali mirch, Fish Tikka, Chicken Bharta with lachchha paratha without the usual dollops of butter and raita. 

First the Biriyani. Its good, real good. No overpowering perfumes of mashala. But a sweet aroma of Basmati along with fried onions touched the pallets with the right proportion. The Biriyani is fluffy and light with well cooked Mutton and soft piece of potato. The flavours are subtle. 

The Fish Tikka was better than the Chicken Kali Mirch. But the surprise was the Chicken Bharta. Beautiful in taste and soft in the mouth with a tinge of properly proportioned mashala. 

All in all a great place to have dinner. A certainly recommended place to be.

With restaurants opening left and right in south Kolkata, it wasn't a surprise that I missed this spot earlier. Been in it's vicinity numerous times, this place always eluded me like Jerry does to Tom! But yesterday was a different picture altogether. With initial talks about where to go, we finally decided to give this place a visit.


I was quite taken by surprise by its quirky decor with its mood lighting and wall arts exhibiting a street art charm. Coming to the food, the menu was nothing out of the ordinary. We straightway went with the house speciality - Mutton Hanglaabari. Accompanying with this signature dish was two Non-veg Kulchas (stuffed with minced meat). The kulchas though had a considerable amount of filling still it didn't taste so well. But the Mutton Hanglaabari was the star of the day! The pieces were succulent and it oozed out a unique flavour (never tasted this flavour before). The tenderness of the meat and it's taste satisfied our hearts and tummies! 


Coming to the service time, it took a lot of time for the plates to arrive at our table. But the waiters were extremely cordial and friendly. The pocket pinch is also quite reasonable. It's not a place to be highly recommended but if one is in it's vicinity do give this place a visit.

A quick search for nearby restaurants revealed this cozy and stylish eatery, a place which can be described for me as 'yes it's in my bucket list but...' The 'but' was challenged today, BUT, I'm not kidding, it remained with an asterix still. 

Almost empty at 5pm, this place catered the much needed calm amidst a hectic day and with a decor that pleases the eyes, sitting near a large glass panel, facing the tiny alley and a park begged for a little drizzle on the pane...

Coming to the food, we ordered two non-veg Kulchas and a plate of Mutton Hanglabari. While the ambience demands numerous visits, the food was a mixed bag. The first bites satiated the expectations but as soon as the hunger pangs curbed a bit and we could judge with a clear mind,I realized that the meat was a bit tough, although replete with flavor. The kulcha seemed a bit bland, even with the tiny chicken shreds running all through it. It was overall a nice experience with the food being just the right amount of okay to warrant a smile. 

But as I said, the dilemma... Yes, the dilemma was heightened farther from an okay place to 'no, this is a place I can bring my friends for a cool hangout' when the hospitality factored in. The staff was nice and helpful, from the walk in to the last request of taking pictures of the whole place. This place, thus, again entered my bucket-list.

The place had been on my list for quite sometime and recently I got to order from the restaurant. Popular for its mutton preparations and biryani I got a combo meal ordered which was quite sumptuous. The biryani preparation was highly commendable and instantly made it to my list of favorites. The platter consisted of chicken kebab which was equally good. Though the firni wasn't as good as expected but it did not diminish ta overall impact of the meal. The behavior of the staff was what added to the experience, they were extremely friendly and very helpful. Would strongly suggest this place is one is looking for some good food to relish.

Hanglaatherium is one place I visit often, situated near the south city mall area and still hidden inside the some small lanes it is one of the best places if you want to have north Indian dishes with an essence of Bengali cooking. The atmosphere is excellent, the decor, the lights, the posters, everything speaks volume about their choice and I think that is the unique ingredients behind their success.

I went for lunch in this outlet last afternoon with my Man. This was my first time here. 
We placed ourselves at a cozy corner of the Restuarant. Honestly, we like Combo foods but were hesitant to order at first. 
After a lot of speculations, ordered a Chicken Biriyani Combo (Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Kosha, Chicken tikka, Onion salad, Raita) and A Plate of Chelo Kabab. 

The Chicken Biriyani combo is a good one. The Chicken Tikka that came with it was delicious! The Biriyani was tasty too. The Chicken Kosha was ordinary, like something that we at home usually but it's all worth the money! 
The Chelo Kabab was not as good as the Biriyani Combo. The Chelo Kabab combo had buttered rice, Mutton Kabab, Chicken Kabab, Aloo tikki,  some tandoored veggies and my favourite poached egg. The Aloo Tikka tasted horrible. The Mutton Kabab was too spicy for my taste. Nevertheless, it could be eaten.
We wanted to have Firni that was not available unfortunately and instead had Thumps Up. 
With a bill of 630/- both our stomach and pocket were happy! üòÖ
Oh yes! 
The staffs were very nice! And the decor of the place is nice too. 
You can visit this place if you are near South City Mall and having not much in your pocket. üòâ

I have tried all the Biryanis-mutton, chicken & egg from Hanglaatherium (all home delivered). When I ordered for the first time, the quality of the biryani was really good, especially the mutton biryani. Spices, tenderness of the meat, etc. was perfect. I still remember the good smell of the Biryanis, and the taste of the apricot. But, lately, I observed that the quality of all the Biryanis is declining. Hoping that Hanglaatherium will make this up, and continue serving best quality with great taste Biryanis.

We had ordered special mutton biryani.. Tandoori laccha paratha and chicken tikka butter masala.. And everything tasted perfectly done.. The mutton just melted in the mouth and the chicken tikka was tender with just the right amount of spices and consistency.. It went perfectly with the paranthas.. Will surely step in there again to taste the other fares... The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.. And the best part is you pay what you see.. No hidden costs.. No GST....

This was my first time at this cozy hub.. The moment i entered i felt comfortable.. The decor does that to you.. Coming to the food.. I have everything positive to say about it.. We had ordered special mutton biryani.. Tandoori laccha paratha and chicken tikka butter masala.. And everything tasted perfectly done.. The mutton just melted in the mouth and the chicken tikka was tender with just the right amount of spices and consistency.. It went perfectly with the paranthas.. Will surely step in there again to taste the other fares... The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.. And the best part is you pay what you see.. No hidden costs.. No GST.... Best value for money...

"Amazing Chicken Biriyani" are the three words that come to my mind. Perhaps one of the best in the town.The long grain rice and juicy chicken make the perfect combination. Value for money as the quantity is great. Reasonably priced menu offers great choices of Chicken/ Mutton sides and apart from the Biriyani.

It's a very good budget restaurant for relishing North Indian and Moghlai cuisines. The hospitality is also very warm. Don't think just go there and enjoy the mouth watering delicacies!

The outlet is located at walking distance from South city but is a bit interior...This place undoubtedly serves some of the tasty dishes at low price...We cashed on chicken tawa kebab, biriyani and hanglabari...All the dishes deserve special mention but hats off to hanglabari and tawa kebab...They were so tasty...A must hang out place for all....

Though a pretty small place still the food and the ambience makeup for that. The interior is quite funky and good place for selfie freaks. The staff were cordial and quite jolly. Food was good and the quantity too. The "Hanglabaari" a mutton dish was something that made me parcel it for my home too. A must try out place with pocket friendly menu...

Well well this joint has a name for itself, and why won't it after serving one of the best mutton delicacies in the city. Their Mutton Hanglabaari is a must try, succulent mutton pieces just perfectly cooked with the special bong spices with a tinge of Punjabi tadka to it melting in your mouth. Their Mutton biriyani is one of a kind, it's different from every other biryani in the city, well it's much lighter. Diet mates do give it a try for the lighter version of biriyani. And the biriyani mutton is as tender as it should be. Though I felt a bit more of spicy would have been better but can't complain because they claim their biriyani to be light. Apart from these murgh pasanda is fine, a bit too much flavoured with cardamom. Lastly their tandoori laccha is a perfect bread for any gravy, getting oil less laccha paratha is now easier with them. All in all hanglatherium is a must try for all foodies. Especially because it's a fusion of typical bong and North Indian food. Cheers.

Being a typical south Indian, Hanglatherium really did not work out very much for me.But the ambience around was so beautiful, one can not hide their admiration to this place. The couple that handles this hotel- people hats off. You are treating that hotel like your very home- the cleanliness, the generous welcome and the subtle atmosphere.There is creativity in every bit of this restaurant. The Kebabs is the wow material of this spot. We tried the biryani too- but I don't think a typical hyderabadi biryani lover can really appreciate it.They were kind to fulfill our order for 4 with an hour. We had a movie plan at south city mallso we were in a hurry, a big Thanks for that night.

We ordered one special chicken biryani combo and another with Mutton Biryani. The combo contained 2 chicken Tikka kabab, 2 pieces of chicken kasha, biryani with potato and your choice of meat with complementary chutney and salad. We also ordered Reshmi kababs and a tandoori roti.
Kasha was good. 
-Tikka kababs had too much garam masala. I didn't like the sharp after taste. 
-Biryani was good but very oily. Chicken and Mutton, both were undercooked. 
-Chutney was too sour.
-Reshmi kababs were really good.
-Roti was fine.
-Service was good. 
The restaurant was too quiet. It felt weirdly lonely to be eating there. Maybe some music will help. Decor was different and nice. I would go there someday again just for the reshmi kababs. 

Recommended!

A no-frills good place to eat. 

Lets get the cons out of the way: 
Its just a painted room(albeit a cross shaped one) with some paintings in the walls and decent chairs n tables and AC. 
.
.
Wait, why is that a con ? Because we often like to go to very photogenic places and take photos more and eat less n all, and such simple decor isn't helping that department. 
.
.
Personally, I don't care.. this has always been a place to eat, and at that, it excels! Which brings me to the pros...

GOOOD FOOOD!!

This place, per my palate, makes a deliciously juicy chicken tandoor ! And their baked lachcha paratha is massive !! I had two and it filled me up ! And I didn't feel guilty on the indulgence either.. as so often happens with other places whose lacha paratha are dripping with oil! This one, being baked.. had no such consience jerking side effects üòä


Great food, tasty chicken, oil free lacha, and a nice big window seat..  all in a very budget friendly package.. i love this place !

Went here on a casual lunch ! Located near South city mall, this place is a bit tricky to find! The inner space is small but neat. We ordered two plates of mutton biryani and the taste was indeed superb! We we're tremendously hungry yet the quantity given was not superb, but yes more than satisfactory! And the best part is they charge no extra taxes! Thumbs up for that! Recommended!

One of my best food experiences in Kolkata. We went there with my team of 6. The order consisted of fish, chicken, veg and mutton dishes including fish biriyani, peas pulao, chicken pasinda, chicken tikka butter masala, mutton hanglaabari and mutton biriyani. Each and every dish was delicious. The meats were cookes perfectly and were sumptuous. The quantity was enough for us and we were struggling at the end to finish all the courses. Lastly, the ambience and the service was pleaseant and courteous. Thank you for the experience. Highly recommended.

Hyanglatherium is truly a hidden gem and wonderful resturant.  

We visited hyanglatherium last evening. We had prior used the Zomato book a table feature to book our table. Firstly they confirmed our reservation within 5 mins. And seats were ready by the time we reached. 

The resturant is small space located Infront of South city. Like most biryani joints they have their focus on deliveries. But in resturant service was good as well. 

It has good seating arrangements, but it is limited to big groups. So highly recommend booking seats if you are a big gang (Like us). The ambience is neat and simplistic. And it doesn't smell like biriyani!!

We ordered sweetlime soda and masala cold drinks for drinks. Starters : Fish Tikka Kebab! ( absolutely delicious) , Chicken Kebab (average , the chicken was rather chewy! The only average thing on the menu), and Mutton Bhuna Kebab! (It is the best mutton preparation I've had in really long time- succulent pieces with spices- cooked to perfection)

Mains : Mutton Special Biriyani with extra aloo because why Not! Mutton pieces were soft, but pieces!
Chicken biryani was well cooked as well. The Biriyanu did not have overflowing taste of grease nor overpowering smell of rose water.
Side dish we had ordered Mutton hyanglabari their speciality- another great mutton dish.. 
The tandoori lacha was rather delicious and very less oily.   
Chicken Bharta and chicken tikka butter masala was good.
 
We didn't get to try the phirni. 

What you must order: Mutton Biriyani, Mutton bhuna kebab, mutton hynaglabari and tandoori lacha.

Go there early, they run out of stock very fast !!! 

Would I recommend! Totally !!!!

Horrible experience with the place when I placed an order online through Zomato.. the restaurant asked for 1hr time and even post that they had no clue to as where the food is.. the managers‚Äã response was the guy is out for delivery but has no clue as to where he is.. and not to mention prince Anwar shah is exactly 12 mins walking distance from my home.. the food arrived after 2hrs and was completely cold.. one cannot expect anyone to have cold chicken tandoori and it doesn't make any sense to re heat the food I order because that is not what I paid for.. on enquiring with the manager the Manager is asking me to 'adjust' this time and that it won't happen again.. which is not an appropriate response from a manager .. I returned the food and asked for a refund which has been initiated but the waste of time and effort is all I had at the end.. and obviously not to mention that ordered food from different restaurant not using Zomato this time and had to wait an hour again for the food to arrive.. pathetic on your part hanglaatherium

One of my favorite biriyani restaurant in town. i visit this restaurant several time in several location (jodhpur park), but  i must say when i first visit this restaurant opposite south city mall in very small joint with only 4 table for sitting no a.c. since now big sitting arrangement with a.c and wonderfully decorated restaurant but the food and hospitality all are same noting change. i just love theirs biriyani, chello kabab, chicken bharta, fish tikka kabab and others kabab, all the item are excellent. and best part of this restaurant they still not take any tax in the bill (before GST).

Ok.... so I have there been a week ago. The food which we ordered was chicken rezala.. tandoori roti.. and chicken biriyani combo... which contains chicken biriyani,chicken chaap ,onion raita and salad. Wel the rezala along with tandoori roti taste so good. But on the otherhand the biriyani taste more than average bt less than good...chicken chap that was served alongwith it is not at all lyk that...or rather it was lyk chicken kasa and was enough to spoil the combo.. talking about qty it was good.... bt you should not give a dish of kasa chicken in the name of chicken chap. Ambience was good...

We went for a late dinner so couldn't order much. Heard about this place from my students a lot. We ordered fish combo biriyani and mutton combo biriyani.
The fish was basa. In combo they gave tandoor with onion salad and green chutney and Biriyani and a side dish. 
The quantity is good and the biriyani also taste good. But not as good as I heard. Fish was good however the chicken curry served with mutton combo was a bit plain.
Over all price at par food.
Liked the ambience very much. Staff behaviour is also very good. 
I will go again to try more food.

After reading a hell lot of reviews on zomato, my friends and I decided to try this outlet of Hanglaatherium. The mutton biryani here is supposedly lip smackingly the best in kolkata. But unfortunately, it turned us down, COMPLETELY. This was so not expected!! 
Yeah they did provide a good amount of it, but the taste was nothing even in the proximity of being worth a whopping 175 bucks. Dude, you have WAY BETTER places to go for biryani..and no egg in the biryani! Not satisfied. Especially because we came all the way north kolkata, for what? Mutton hanglabari was good. Non veg kulcha and chicken pasanda were both okay. Nothing too remarkable. Really expected so much more. But it was too average. Disappointed. Totally.

Not very difficult to locate, this place has a good ambience and great food. It was my first visit to Hanglaatherium and I must say it was a really good experience. First and foremost, the biryani was great, and of ample quantity. The most hyped dish served here, which is also their signature dish, the Hanglabari was just mouth-wateringly good. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.

I went there 1 year ago.
we went there for celebrating success in college Fests.
We were about 20 in numbers.
We pre booked the table for us.
But First visit was not too much impressive.
We had biryani combo combo pack with Chicken biryani,kababs,pokora and raita.
Raita,pokora and kabab was very good.
But the main item i.e. biryani and potato was stale.
We could not even able to have it.
As my last visit was 1 year ago, i wanna visit again to check reality.

Last time I went home to Calcutta, I visited this place. We ordered mutton galawati kebab, mutton biryani, mutton hanglabaari and finished the meal with firni. The galawati kebabas were little bit burnt, the biryani was ok, I had better biryani in Calcutta, the mutton hanglabaari was perfect though , one of the best mutton dishes I have ever eaten, a must try. The staff was really polite and nice. The manager even came to us and asked about the food. I will definitely visit again,¬† mainly because of the mutton hanglabaari and the polite staff. They could use the empty spaces on the walls, and hang more picture frames though.

I've been here a couple of times and I must say it's a place of it's own kind.
The name is the first and foremost attractive feature of the restaurant and is quite the habitat for Hanglaatheriums like me.
The best dishes I've had here are the Mutton Biryani, Mutton Hanglabari, Mutton Rogan Josht, Masala Kupcha and Mutton Kosha. The quality of the meats is unparalleled and much can be said of the beautifully flavourfula nd aromatic biryani they make. The Rogan Josht has a decent flavour but I'd enjoy its gravy to be thicker. The other dishes are well seasoned and have distinct tastes so as not to confuse the palate. The Mutton Hanglabari is an unique dish and a must try for all who make their way to here. The Kulcha is well made and soft and has a mild flavour that would go well with any good side dish.
I hope that Hanglaatherium keeps on going and attracts more Hanglaatheriums like me to quench our unquenchable hunger for great food.

Shout out to all biryani lovers... 
If you haven't visited hanglatherium, you are missing out one of best places in town which serves mouth watering biryanis. Among other outlets, this one easily wins the top spot. Although, it is located just opposite to south city mall, you may need to use google map to find the place. 
Coming to the food, obviously, biryani is as always awesome. Combined with mutton hanglabari, which is also their signature dish, it's a treat for your taste buds...

I was tired of having Arsalan's biriyani for a long time, for a change I went to this place today and trust me the veg biriyani tastes‚Äã amazing and I like the way they have added berries into it gives a tangy taste , usually for vegetarians it's tough to get veg biriyani at affordable price range but here it's best from both the side taste & even the price. Talking about the quantity, it's going to make you feel full and happy for sure & my friend who ordered naan & chicken tandoori masala, said it taste delicious too. I would like to visit this place again & will try other vegetarian dishes, it's a best place for the college students like me, that the price won't pinch my pocket. Ambience is simple yet cool.

Went to Hanglaatherium on last thursday with my friends for lunch. Our prime reason behind visiting this food joint was to have a good lunch without spending a lot and it was fulfilled totally. They serve good food at a reasonable price. The decor and ambience is simple as we expected. We had Chicken Chatpata, Tandoori Laccha and Mutton hanglabari (their signature dish). Chicken chatpata tasted good and a little spicy which was doing justice to its name. Mutton hanglabari tasted very very good, the mutton pieces were well cooked but the only dissapointment was we found more boned and less meat. Which I loved the most was the tandoori laccha paratha...it is innovative in concept and it tasted really good. If you want to have a good lunch spending little this one can be your destination.

First thing first, not very hard to locate but the location doesn't seem so favourable. The menu card was lovely and oh so inviting!! We ordered mutton hanglabaari, chicken biriyani, chicken haandi masala, naan and plain rice. It had a decent affect on my taste buds bt the mutton hanglabari is a must try. The pocket pinch is too low and that just adds to it. Overall,  if you planning for a dinner party while on a low budget,  this can be one of the best places to plan for!

wanted to visit this place for a long time and finally got the oppertuinity . this place is easy to find just follow the zomato map . i did the same and found it easily. just 2 3 lanes after the bike showroom . nice ambiance and simple decor. food didnt take much time to arrive . ordered a mutton biryani two tandoori lachhas and chicken pasanda . interestingly the tandoori lachha looks like a lachha but tastes like butter naan . i liked it a lot along with the chicken pasanda which is a shredded chicken item sweet in taste . the biryani had a small mutton piece (expected a little better) a well cooked potato and good quantity of biryani rice. taste was good. but they dont give egg with their biryani . prices are inclusive of tax which is a very good thing . all these summed to a bill of 425 . thats very pocket friendly . great thumbs up and will surely revisit to try some of their mutton dishes and of course their signature dish tandoori lachha.

The food is just brilliant. Mutton hanglaabari and chicken pasanda are just to die for. The biriyani is also good and food are of good quality and quantity. The service is satisfactory. Although we have to wait a really long time to get food or even get table.

The mutton quality was very good..And so the Mutton Biriyani...But the peas pulao was awfully colored,probably by synthetic color,which is just not done...Pl.try to serve natural rice in pulao and certainly not artificially colored..

Casual Dining restaurant in bylanes opposite South city

Food: Ordered a plate of assorted kebabs and two plates of chicken biryani. The kebabs were pretty good. The biryani was fine. Nothing extraordinarily good about it. It wasn't bad either. Just a normal plate of chicken biryani. Not exactly the kind of food u expect from a "Brilliant Biriyani" listing.

Ambiance: The place is pretty spacious with walls decorated in Bob Dylan, Beatles, Bob Marley photographs. There are 2 dining areas. The internal dining area seemed better as u get better privacy there. Lighting n washroom facilities are good.

Service: Staff were friendly. They took the order and suggested that instead of ordering the chicken hariyali kebab, we take the assorted kebab platter which was actually a better choice. Serving the order took some time though.

Overall: Place is a bit overrated. But overall makes palatable food. However, the price is attractive if u choose their combos. Might come back, not very sure though.

I've never visited the restaurant but i've ordered food from this place a couple of times. I've had both chicken and mutton biriyani which was an absolute delight. Mutton piece in biriyani was soft, tender and succulent, the rice was fluffy with the right amount of spices and oil. I loved it absolutely. So Yesterday, to end my weekend on a beautiful note I decided to order food from this place again. I ordered chicken tikka butter masala, mutton kosha and butter tandoori roti. 
Chicken Tikka Butter Masala had four chunky pieces of full tandoori chicken cooked in a thick gravy. I prefer boneless chicken in this type of side dishes especially if it's tikka butter masala. However chicken was soft and cooked properly, gravy was thick and spicy. It was an ok type dish. 
Mutto kosha was very tasty and cooked to perfection. The only disturbing element in this dish was the tiny fragments of bones, which we found in almost every bite while chewing with roti.
Butter tandoori roti was more like a normal tandoori roti with no hint of butter or whatsoever. Roti was soft but the fluffiness was missing.
The prices they charge is pretty resonable. Highly recommeded if you are craving mughlai and at the same time you don't want to burn a hole in your pocket. I would love to visit this place and try other items.

My first visit to this place..üòä The outlet is situated at a 5mints of walking distance of south city..‚ò∫
Nothing too fancy about thr decor..red and black chair tables,with clean and courteous staffs..a good place to hangout at a really cheap budget.

We actually wanted to order mutton hanglabari , which is one of their signature dishes I have heard. But it was not available that time...üòü So we ordered one chicken biriyani combo and one chelo kabab along with masala cold drinks and lime soda.

They took like 15mints to serve...and the biriyani combo had a portion of chicken biriyani,two pieces of mutton chanp..raita and salad. The amount of biriyani was good for one person only, it was flavourful..a bit oily but really tastyü§ó ..loved it..served with a big chicken leg piece, which was cooked nicely and tasty as well..üòä The mutton chanp was tasty and mutton pieces were soft and juicy..‚ò∫üëå The combo was really worth the price. üòä

Next comes the chelo kabab..a portion of butter rice in the middle,with two chicken kababs.. Which were really juicy and tasty..üòç loved thoseü§ó...two mutton seekh kababs,which were comparatively not too good..üòê and two aloo tikkis...ü§î Which I wonder why they had put in a chelo kabab platter..üò∂ And last but not the least..one sunny side up egg...ü§óüòá

The drinks were good...but a little too sweet for us.. Overall we had a nice time,the bill was also pocket friendly..üëç

For our next visit we tried their famous mutton hanglabari,..juicy tender 4-5mutton pieces,that melts in ur mouth,spicy..and spices were totally absorbed into the mutton...and maybe cooked fr a long time,fr that lovely dark color it had...oh I just loved that dish..perfect to accompany with tandoori roti or even biriyani..üòçüòç Must try if u are visiting hangalaaterium.ü§ó

Order Item
1 x Chicken Biriyani Combo
 ( chicken biriyani + Chicken Kasha + Chicken tikka )
2 X Mutton Bhuna Kabab with Bone [6 Pieces]¬†
2 X Bengali Pulao

Order from Hanglaatherium - Prince anwar shah rd, ¬†for the 1st time after going through the reviews and rating in zomato, but was ....... ~~~ !!!¬†

1) Quality of rice both in biriyani and Bengali Polao was not even half done .... god knows how come they are sustaining with their eatery with this kinda food quality .... !!¬†

2) The items mentioned in Chicken Combo was not there when delivered. Secondly the quantity was astonishingly poor if I consider this with any standard portion served by any restaurant.
I hope Zomato will take care and validate before registering their business partners

The girl gang decided to meet, and we beat ¬†all odds ( rain, traffic, scarcity of transport and what not) to eat up at Hanglatherium. We orederd a SPECIAL MUTTON BIRIYANI COMBO and a MUTTON BIRIYANI.¬†
The combo was served with Chicken Kosha, salad and kebab. It is more than enough for 2 people. I think the value for money in these outlets is a major attraction. The Chicken Kosha was spicy heavy gravy, and shouldn't be missed. The kebab was light and a little charred, it was good. The only complain with the biriyani is it's a little dry. Otherwise the mutton pieces were succulent and properly marinated and cooked. The biriyani tastes unquestionably delicious, however it being dry requires a coke to down it.¬†
Hanglatherium boasts a very courteous and helpful staff, they are doing a commendable job. :)¬†
The decor is cute with vibrant red and white paint and graffiti on the walls. The lighting is kinda mystique.¬†

I heard about this place from a friend of mine. The location of the place is a bit difficult to find. The restaurant is a small one. The interior is well decorated. We ordered mutton biriyani combo which was great. The taste was pretty good. Then we ordered tandoori roti with a creamy chicken preparation[the name I don't remember ] was also great. At last we ordered firni which was pretty good as well. The staff was pretty friendly. Surely a must visit again. The best part they don't take tax !

This place has been in my wish list for a long time, previously I tried but could not locate it but I made it finally. In one word the wait was worth it. It's located find amjad habib salon with dine in facility.

We ordered mutton hanglabari , chicken biryani and a butter nun. The mutton hanglabari was mouth watering with 5 chunks of medium sized mutton enough for 2 people , biriyani was good less oily, and the butter naan was seasoned with a good amount of butter.
The staffs were prompt and well behaved, the manager was very welcoming.
Coming to the price and interior our bill came up to 480 only, which was pretty reasonable and the interior with the music gave a homely ambience on the whole.
I would rate hanglatherium out of 10
Taste: 9/10

Quantity: 9/10
Quality: 9/10

On a whole it was an amazing experience do visit and never miss out on mutton hanglabari it's the ultimate.

Many reviews on this restaurant so without any wasting time lets review food..
Food Ordered - Chicken butter masala, Chicken bharta, naan, lacha paratha, fresh lime soda, firni..
P.S - Chose different food rather than biriyani
Food review - Just loved the chicken butter masala, finger licking good.. Chicken bharta was good, not excellent i would say.. Didnt liked the fact that they used tadka masala for chicken bharta. Nan and laccha parta was very good, no complaints. Fresh lime soda could have been better bt its ok. Firni didnt tasted so cnt comment..
Negetives - Gravy of chicken butter masala was very less. Not sufficient for 2 people also. Even i personally told them before ordering to cook gravy more.. They apologized at the end for the fact also.
Final verdict - Anyway food was good overall.. I should have given 4.5 bt will not for the fact they made a mistake.. So 4.0 overall frm my side..
Should i visit again - Yup, need to taste biriyani on my next visit.
Like my review and follow me if you found my reviews are helpful.. Thank you :-)

1.chicken reshmi butter masala was just amazing amaaazinnggg best ever butter masala had üòç

4/5
3.chicken bharta was good butter after having the butter masala couldn't just retract my taste buds in it..It had tadka masala in it.. Didn't expect that
3/5
4.Kesar firni was good.. just good  3/5
5.sweet lime soda was better than firni  3.8/5
No extra taxes included

The other occasion,tried mutton biryani and chelo kebab.
I personally didnt liked the Chelo Kebab,but my partner did liked the presentation.
Overall,its okayish.
Price is moderate.

Intro : This joint is behind the Amjad Habib salon near South City .This had been in my wish list for some time now and finally could visit .
Food ambience - Nice wall creative , comfortable sir conditioning and a warm welcome was given to us .

Food :

Chellow Kabab - The legendary dish :

Must say that they have done a uoerb job :

The mutton sheek Kabab was soft and succulent- it just melted in the mouth - the aroma of spices all around activating the nasal buds ! -Superb 4.5/5

Chicken Sheek Kabab - Very nicely done again sir and succulent - could have been a tad more softer - good stuff 3.5/5

Aloo Kabab - This was just too good - super taste 4/5

Rice - Good quality rice with a bitter cube on top ( which I passed on to my daughter !) -3.5/

Sunny side up - Good usual stuff

Overall - Just a superb experience - I am sure that they use very good quality oil as after a Chellow didn't feel over eaten though stuff was filling. 4/5

One of the best place to have Biryani in Kolkata. We ordered Mutton Biryani, Chicken Pasanda and Tandoori roti. Everything was fresh and quality was good too. The biryani was lighter in every possible way from other famous biryani joints in kolkata. The service was prompt. The mutton pieces were soft and the Chicken pasanda was gorgeous. I'll be back soon to try their kebabs and mutton hanglabari.
P.S -They don't provide finger bowl and sitting in the passage area felt hot than the sitting area in the front.

Location is bit tricky but Not too far from south city. Good food joint with good interiors and ambiance. Staffs and manager are well cordial. Food quality is Fab, visited almost 3-4 times with friends and family. Service is Good. Assorted kebab platter(you get to taste many variants of kebab) and fish tikka masala is a must try.  Biryani is good. But the side dishes are better. So you can opt paratha or naan with side dishes. Will visit again to try their galwati and chelo kebab.

The Sunday lunch at "Hanglaatherium" was absolutely awesome. The ambience and the staffs are one of the best I have ever seen. The Biriyani and Chicken Kosha was really tasty... However, it was the NonVeg Kulcha that left me dumb...It was just....... Beyond words... It was the awesome Non Veg Kulcha that made me "Hangla"... Would soon visit again... Thanks a lot...

We had a small family dinner last Sunday. The place was quite and not crowded at all, yet you can feel footprints of its demand as the phone in the counter incessantly rang for home deliveries. We had Chelo kebabs and Tandoori Chicken Masala with tandoori lachha partha. The chelo kebab was ordered for comparisons sake and it really matched the original from Peter Cat in every quarter! I feel the mutton kebab portion in Chelo was more evenly marinated and softer than I had last time at Peter Cat. I had only a morsel or two of the tandoori dish and found the blend of spice and tender meat(yet neatly grilled) very satisfactory. We ended with Firni which was good too. If you are budget conscious like me then  the price points of the place will add a pleasant touch to your satiety. The decor has a dollop of fun and taste in it. Over all its just "the place around the corner". Hope they preserve this feel as they grow.

This restaurant makes excellent biriyani! It is comparable to the best biriyanis available in Kolkata! The chicken bharta wasn't that good though. However, since the biriyani was so good, I decided to give 4.5 stars. I only hope they maintain their standard.

Really impressed by the Biriyani served by Hanglaatherium. Low on oil, good taste and enough quantity. Mutton Hanglaabari is a treat to the taste buds though thr dish is bit oily and rich. The galouti kabab is too good to resist. The ambience is refreshing as the place is not at all cramped up. The service is prompt and the staffs are polite. The store manager himself enquired about the food quality and happened to be decent and courteous. 
I am looking forward to make further visits at this outlet to try out other dishes. Overall a big thumbs up to Hanglaatherium..

Today i went to this place with my sister and my experience was as follows  (though it can be guessed from the ratings üòù) 
Location- as you walk from south city mall towards lords crossing,  you would get a restro called 16 ana bangaliana on the same foot as that of south city,  then you can see a lane opposite to that,  take that lane and you will find sanghati park,  hanglaatherium is located just opposite to the park (we called them and they helped us properly with the direction) 
Ambience- quite nice,  themed in red and white,  the place was very clean and lighting was good too.  A huge glass window complimented the look of the restro.  But the ac was very low for us even after telling to increase it
Hospitality- very nice. The waiter helped us with the food and they also asked how the food was. A very warm behaviour they have towards their customers. 
Food- we ordered
1. Chicken chatpata kebab- succulent pieces of chicken fried with onion and capsicum,  it was spicy and very tasty . 
2. Chicken sheekh kebab- minced meet kebab served with green chutney and onion.  It was less spicy but tasty. 
3. Butter tandoori roti- soft and had enough butter
4. Mutton kasa- had 4 pcs of mutton with thick brown gravy,  we told them to make it spicy..  It was the star of the show.  The mutton pieces were soft,  succulent and decent.  Very very tasty. 
5. Lime soda- as it should be.. 
All the foods didn't have too much oil,  hence felt light on stomach
Price- reasonable..  No extra tax.  Everything is inclusive in the menu. 
Overall our experience was great. Will definitely revisit to try their biriyani and other stuffs üòä

Although this place is rated highly but I was disappointed with my first visit. We had a small success party here for one of our college fests'. We had pre booked the place for 20people or so. We had a biryani platter which had chicken biryani,kabab, raita and another item maybe, which I forgot since it has been two years. But the sad part was that, the aloo in the biryani was stale. It was even smelling and none of us could have it. Otherwise the food was ok. It was bad luck for us that day. But I hope to visit this place once more to find the reality.

Small and cozy place. The food is good. However the food quantity can be improved. Have been there twice. Both times we ordered Biryani and though the taste is fair enough the quantity was bit on the lower side. The prices are reasonable and are inclusive of Tax. The staff is friendly and helpful.

One of the good place to have biryani in Kolkata. Have tried their Chicken and Mutton biryani. Both are good. They also serve special chicken biryani with with  two piece of  kabab and chicken curry besides the usual chicken in the biryani. The Chicken Bharta is also good at this place. Kababs are served with the usual green chutney made with mint and curd.

Thanks for the awsome food on this holi festival when am so far from my family. And being a bengali holi means a lot of bangaliaana mutton kasha and rice. Thanks to zomato and ofcourse Hanglaatherium for the delivery! Along with work some awesome food on this occassion didnt made me miss home and mother's made lunch much!!
Delivery was just too good. I got served before time. Thanks once again :)

Dropped in for a lunch with my friend. We tried the Special Chicken Biriyani combo which was decent enough. They could have done it with a bit more of rice. But you couldn't ask for more at such a reasonable price. 
Overall the food quality was great. All the items in their menu are VAT included. Would hopefully tried their other dishes in my next visit. Huge recommendation for the varied combos and their reasonable rates.

So I decided to go to this place for dinner with my mother. They have a very homely ambience and located very close to south city mall. The staff was very courteous and kept asking us at intervals about how we were liking the food. We ordered :

‚Ä¢Butter naan - Warm, soft and thin makes it a tasty bite. I give it a 3/5
‚Ä¢Chicken pasanda - Extremely tasty chicken dish made of a thick creamy gramflour based gravy. It was rich in exotic spices but wasn't spicy at all. I give it a 4/5
‚Ä¢Mutton hanglabari- It's their signature dish for good reason. Needless to say that it's very tasty, but the pieces of mutton were surprisingly juicy and succulent and a little soft. Could have been softer but I thoroughly enjoyed the preparation. The gravy was rich but it had a hint of sweetness. I give it a 5/5
‚Ä¢Chicken biryani- Flavourful and tasty. Not at all oily. I give it a 4/5
‚Ä¢Boondi raita- I don't like Boondi raita but I fell in love with this one. Their Boondi raita is slightly different because the Boondi was crispy . The curd was fresh and not at all too sour. Very very tasty and refreshing to the palate.i give it a 5/5
‚Ä¢Firni - Good. I give it a 3/5

Overall a wonderful experience. Will come back soon.

We had dined yesterday night with Hanglaatherium. Good experience but compared to the price the food quantity and also in some cases food quality is not up to the mark. The menu card displayed here is also not updated in zomato. Kindly update the same.However the ambience is good, well decorated and the restaurant is clean..

Visited this place in the evening with my friends. If you aren't using Google map or navigation then this might be a bit tough to find since the restora isn't by the side of the main Street. Located close to South city mall,this is an excellent simple restora to hang out with your friends after college or work. The ambience is good,food is very good and the rates are pocket friendly without any taxes. The biryani combos are really nice though I wished the biryani quantity was a bit more. Also tried the chicken bharta and it was really tasty. The staff is well behaved and the owners were also very friendly asking how was the food and if we had any complaints etc etc. Overall a good experience.

The experience of this restaurant was more than delightful. The ambience is quite charming in a simple bold fashioned way. The service was good. No extra tax was charged. All prices are even included VAT. Food quality is more than average. The attendant really showed a good amount of priority. You may want to try Hanglaabadi Kabab in mutton section. It's very charming.

I ordered for one - Special Mutton Biryani and Hara Bhara kebab. The biryani was not dry like last time and the oil used to cook is also much healthier than other Biryani outlets. The potato was done to perfection and mutton pieces were big and well cooked. The Hara Bhara kebab was a revelation. They were big chunky kebabs, 4-5 pieces I think, very soft, fresh and the perfect accompaniment to the biryani. Keep up the good work and 425 is a very reasonable bill for tasty, filling, healthy, hygienically prepared wholesome food.

Kabab were soft creamy and tasty though.                   But most worse part there service.very poor quality service they have.

If I give the gariahat golpark branch a 4-4.5 rating, I will give this branch a mere 3 rating. Reasons being:-
1. Food was home delivered cold
2. Mutton biriyani had such a piece which didn't have any meat on it
3. Mutton special biriyani again had a meat-less mutton piece along with another small piece of bone, no meat again (god knows where the meat goes)
4. The biriyani was too dry to eat

Only positive were that the chicken biriyani had a good 'meatful' piece & the reshmi kebab was very tasty; which is what Hanglatherium used to offer, 'tasty' food. Hope to see some improvement from them in due course.

A few weeks back when I went to this place, I went with the idea of having the best North Indian food in the city and it was totally worth it. Located near South city, it took a little bit of time to locate this place as they had shifted a few weeks back to the new location. The inside was cozy and the staff were very gracious. The reception was quick. We tried out Chicken Tikka kaba, Chicken biriyani, Biriyani chaap combo and the special kabab platter. The tikka kabab was extremely yummy and melted in my mouth. The Biriyani was an authentic Kolkata one replete with aloo and everything. The Reshmi kabab and fish tikka didn't dissapoint either. You just cannot walk away from this place feeling hungry and the food is the best value for money that you'll get anywhere. Overall a 5 for the food and a 4 for the outside display, so a 4.5/5 for me. I urge every one to try to out this place atleast once if you lovee your North Indian or Mughlai.

One of the best place for having biriyani... placed online order through zomato.. process was smooth... mutton biriyani was just too good. Mutton and aloo was perfectly cooked and gave a out of the world taste to our taste buds.. we ordered paneer achari tikka and chicken reshmi kabab. Both these dishes taste good.. but one issue with delivery, it was late by 50 minutes.. otherwise perfect destination for taste issue...happy tummy...

I have ordered home delivery from this food joint many a times. I simply love their biriyani, kebabs and their chicken kassa. The biriyani is always very light on flavour, not too spicy and oily. Their kebabs are also well-grilled and succulent. I am a fan of their chicken kassa, which has a homemade feel to it. It's a perfect balance of spices and aroma, and it's not throat-burning stuff like Golbari's Kassa Mangsho. I find it to be perfectly paired with rotis or parboiled rice.

Ordered the mutton biriyani combo on home delivery.. delivery took bit time but the food was worth the wait. The biriyani was good in taste and in quantity.... the accompaniments chicken kasha and tikka were also delicious. The delivery guy was however without any change and also did not have a credit/debit card number and hence had a bit difficulty paying him.

Hanglaatherium is a nice restaurant if you really wanna eat something and don't wanna go for a very exquisite dinning. Ordered chicken handi masala and biryani which was good. Handi masala was very spicy as I expected it to be and it is very recommended if you want some spicy stuff. Only thing that was bad was the decor and the tables and the constant noise from outside. The decor is much of like a gambling adda of 70s Bollywood movie.

One of my favourite place for biryani. A big thank you to one of my friend who introduced me to this place. Ever since then it became my go to biryani place. 

Recently the changed their place, and the new outlet is much better with proper sitting arrangements good ambiance, and yes some music. 

Chicken reshmi kebab, chicken hariyali kebab, mutton galwati kebabs are my favourite among the starters

For main course I always treat my self a plate full of chicken biryani and chicken bharta (extra spicy) 

I can come back to this place again and again :D

We ordered for their Kebab Platter with a combo of Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Chaap along with Salad. The Kebabs were good, nothing great though. But the worst part of the meal was their Biriyani combo. The Mutton was awful. Even after we complained about the food, not much attention was paid to it. I would rather eat from a roadside cart than go to this place and waste my money again.

Coming over food,  quality of food is excellent,  they never disappoint me. We ordered a Mutton biriyani combo, laccha paratha, ND chicken bharta.  Rice is comparatively less in the combo, so take time before ordering it, think twice..

My foray into North Indian Cuisine and loving the subtle delicacies like the different kebabs  started when I experimented with a restaurant call Hanglatherium. I was attracted by their simple yet eye-catching decor.One thing that constantly amazes me is their Biriyani. It never stops reaching new heights by lowering the oil used in their Biriyani without tampering their signature taste and flavour.So foodies like me can never get fat by consuming large portions of Biriyani.Besides the amazing taste of the kebabs, the hygiene factor or the cleanliness of their food ensures that my tummy is safe and will be able to consume more food.The Chelow kebab of Hanglatherium  holds a striking resemblance to the original Chelow kebab made in restaurants in Iran,a feat that has not been achieved by any restaurant in Kolkata .For a very wholesome and warm family experience I would suggest a visit to Hanglatherium.
Thank you and a good day the readers of my review.

Its Sunday afternoon and me and my friends decide to visit their. The name is very unique. In bengali hangla means greedy so we went there as we are really Hangla about food, and started with mutton bhuna kebabs and mutton galwati kebabs both kebabs were just excellent. Mutton was really soft and smoky flavour was really good. Then we ordered spcl mutton biryani and mutton rogan josh, the biyani taste just waooo, rogan josh was also good. We really like their hospitality, its really a hidden gem for mughlai lovers.

After a hectic day in office and then rigorous shopping at scm... Me n my bestie decided to give this place a shot as we had this in our wishlist for a very long time. There was no crowd just one guy eating quietly. We were greeted warmly and though the decor is nothing much hi fi... Some thing like u can say a old world charm was present. Old bengali posters framed... Red walls... Medium lights. Nice over all. Coming to food.... Though the person attending us suggested that chicken chatpata is their speciality,  but it wasn't available that day.  So upon his other suggestion we opted for tawa chicken, one mutton biriyani and a mixed raita.  Tawa chicken was really tender moist n juicy. Tasted good.  Mutton was soft n tasted very good as well. Biryani had quite a quantity and flavours were light n nice. It wasn't oodling oil and quite light on your stomach! Raita was fine... Accompanied biryani very well.  Staffs are courteous and helping. Good job done well.

One of the best biriyanis.
They definitely lived up to our expectation.
Though it was a little difficult to find the place but once we had reached this place wasn't disappointing at all.
Loved the mutton biriyani and chicken chaap.
Service was upto the mark and they even asked us if the food was okay after we were done with the meal,which was a sweet gesture on their part.

Would like to visit this place once again :)

This place is a bit hard to find, but when you reach there, it has good food to offer. Dropped in for a quick meal one afternoon. Ordered chicken bharta and paratha. Bharta was tasty but the quantity served could have been more.
Space crunch is an issue, but I really hope they set up franchise elsewhere. The staff here's well mannered.

It has this unique tangy flavour with a sweet tinge and really well cooked mutton pieces. We also had their kali mirch chicken kebab, another perfect and delicious dish. The price is very decent.

Had Christmas dinner as order-in from this place. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, butter naan, mutton hanglaabari and fish banjara. Overall, the cost came up to be quite on the reasonable side. No excess taxes charged, which is always a bonus. 

The chicken reshmi kebab did have all the flavours right and should've been great. However, the chicken was slightly overcooked and hence, dry and stiff. Not quite "reshmi". The taste was spot on, though. 

The mutton hanglaabari was the dish I expected great things from. I've seen my cousin's review of the dish on zomato and it seemed to be some kind of culinary wonderment. Yet all I felt while eating it was slight disappointment and a sense of anticlimax. The taste of cinnamon was far, far too strong in the gravy - to a point where that was all I could smell with every bite. The mutton pieces were soft and lovely, the cook on the meat and the gravy was gorgeous. If not for the overpowering taste of cinnamon, it would've been an amazing dish. All I can think of is perhaps it was a mistake in the rush of Christmas preparations... Not that that is any excuse whatsoever. 

The fish banjara was a hit. Spicy, hot and with melt in the mouth, smooth gorgeous fish, we loved licking this one clean. 

The naan was slightly on the smaller side, but the food is greasy and heavy enough for us to be full easily. 

I wished for a better experience, to be honest, I'd only heard greatness about this place. It just turned out to be utterly ordinary.

I have visited Hanglaatherium last month with my family. Its very near to South city mall and a must visit for food lovers.
We hade gone for a lunch here. The place is small and cosy. Although the decor is good. Stuffs were courteous and service was really fast.
We ordere Chelo kebab, Chicken Reshmi kebabs, Butter naan, Mutton Biriyani and Mutton Hanglaabari and firni in the end.
Kebabs were soft succulent and very tasty. Biriyani was so good, aromatic and tasty as well. mutton was well cooked. Now mutton hanglaabari stole the show alone. We loved the preparation. Had an amazing lunch time here.
Just one suggestion from my side is to widen the area as it really deserves. :)

Location : 5/5
Food and Service : 5/5
Ambience : 4/5

Probably one of the best places to have biriyani and kebabs in the city. This restaurant is located near to Sanhati Park in anwar shah road, opposite to South city mall inside the lanes (5-6 mins walking from south city). The moment you enter, you will be cordially invited which immediately gives you a positive vibe about the place. The ambience - not the best, but they surely have a scope to improve. I felt a bit suffocating inside, since all the windows were closed. Now coming to the food, it was awesome and finger licking! The chicken chatpata kebab as starter is a must try! dont miss it. We also ordered tandoori and chicken tikka butter masala. The chicken was very juicy and well prepared. Thwt's what you expect, isn't it? Additionally, they don't charge VAT as of now so it is very pocket friendly. I will be coming back for sure :)

Went back to this place after quite sometime and it was a delightful experience! A great place for biryani hoggers, Hanglaatherium is a well known destination for all foodies in this part of the city. 
Famished on a cold Monday night, I was in for a full course meal and they didn't dissapoint. 
Since Chicken Tangri Kebab wasn't available I had to go with Reshmi Kebabs. The soft, chunky and succulent pieces of chicken had a very distinct smoky flavour which was commendable! The Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala was wholesome, the chicken well cooked but the gravy was unnecessarily oily. Perhaps the only negative I could find. 
Extremely polite and courteous staff made the experience a perfect one . The striking red, small, neat and tidy layout and picturesque decor make the place stand out from other places. 
Definitely recommended for everyone with a voracious appetite!

Yesterday evening me and my friend, planned to go for dinner at one of the nearby restaurants. I searched for a good place to nullify our hunger & selected this restaurant, a 4star on zomato.

ADDRESS:
238B, Sanhati Park, Prince Anwar Shah Road, near Lord's More & opposite to Southcity Mall. It's a bit tricky to find, Google map helped us. I live in Lake Gardens & didn't know about its existence.

A LITTLE DESCRIPTION:
It looks more like a flat for living with a big signboard & hardly looks like a restaurant. As you enter there is a balcony, 3 rooms - 2 of them have sitting arrangements, the other being their kitchen. The place is simple & good though.

MENU:
I am a big fan of North Indian dishes & on the menu you will find a good list of traditional North Indian food ranging from starters to main course & desserts.

MY EXPERIENCE:
We immediately sat down & I knew, I wanted to try one of their starters followed by some meaty dishes. We ordered

Chicken Chatpata: 6 pieces of hot, juicy, tender chicken, with some vegetables. The spices were really Chatpata & I liked it! Rating - 3.5/5

Mutton Kosha: 4 good pieces of Mutton with perfectly cooked spice blend. I just loved it's heavenly taste. Rating - 4.5/5

Tandoori Roti: Very well made. Parts were fluffy, parts were crunchy. It was perfect to go with the Mutton Kosha. Rating - 4/5

Special Mutton Biriyani: It had two big chunks of tender Mutton. The Biriyani was delicious, I loved it. Rating - 4/5

All the dishes satisfied me completely.
The staffs were really helpful & cooperative as well.

PRICE:
Prices in the menu are inclusive of the tax. That whole delicious meal was of 620 rupees only, cheap enough. I think it serves better food at a lower cost than many other places in Kolkata.

CONCLUSION:
It was one of my best experiences in recent time. Didn't expected the food to be that delicious. It is truly a HIDDEN GEM! You can try different combos at a very reasonable price. But that Mutton Kosha with some Tandoori Rotis were my personal favourite.

A big thanks to Hanglaatherium for that amazing food.

This place is great. Although the location is not very spottable, you need to walk a bit from the main road with Google maps and it's this tiny place.
The decor is minimal, nothing extraordinary with some Satyajit Ray film posters. 
It was two of us and we ordered the Mutton Biriyani Combo.
The food was tasty, it satisfied our hunger. 
The combo had Mutton Biriyani with one aloo and a piece of Mutton, two pieces of chicken kasha and two pieces of Chicken Tikka. 
The Tikka was succulent and not dry and the kosha was spicy and rich. It was accompanied with salad on the side. All of this for 265INR inclusive of taxes. 
The service is prompt and the people extremely helpful.
A very good experience for people with money constraint. 

Only suggestion: Work on the entrance and decor inside.

We actually visited this place a long time back when it was just starting operation. The good quality and amount was quite alright.¬† The sitting arrangements were a bit crummy as there were were only 2-3 siting stations. However they have now shifted to a bigger area or so I have heard. Now I order food online from them a lot as we are not always able to go out. 

My experience with them has been mind blowing to say the least. 

From timely delivery to polite customer support and not to mention awesome food quality - Hanglatherium breaks the myth that for good mughlai khana is confined to certain pedigreed restaurants like Aminia, Shiraz,¬† Arsalan,¬† Nizam etc. These no doubt stand tall but Hanglatherium is the new kid in the block and a force to reckon with in South Kolkata.

Last night we ordered mutton and chicken biriyani, mutton chap, chicken masala, chicken reshmi butter masala and butter roti. 
The biriyani was succulent with just the right amount of moisture in it. The meat was excellent - juicy and well done.
Butter roti was soft and not too chewy just the right amount.
Chicken side dishes were both flavorful and fragrant with right amount of spices.
Mutton chap was the most extravagant - packed in a modest unassuming container was resting two most tender and almost melt in the mouth pieces of mutton as i have ever tested. I am always partial to mutton chap and find a fault with even the best of them, but this was exquisite. Probably the only other chap that can surpass it are from Aliah and Aminia (both venerable names in Mughlai khana circle so that speaks clearly of the quality). The only complaint - a little more gravy couldn't have hurt.
And the best thing - all these was delivered twenty minutes flat.

Keep up the good work people and please introduce some other traditional mughlai delicacies like mutton pasanda.

Tried this place for the second time. We ordered just chicken biriyani. The taste of the spices had not entered the chicken. It tasted as if the chicken was added at the time of serving. The rice was too dry. And nothing was served with biriyani, not even onions.

As we know most of the popular biriyani restaurants are limited to park circus.. i.e Arsalan, shiraj, zeeshan, aminia, Afza etc... I wanted to try Biriyani out of the box... so we decided to go to this place... as we heard a lot about this place ... my expectations were lot high... but frankly speaking i am little disappointed.. not to great extent.. but a little......¬†

Location : its close to lords more... but its little tricky.. as it got no placard mentioning the direction.. it was little confusing to locate it...

Decor : fine.. just a 2 bedroom flat turned into a restaurant....

Food : We ordered mutton biriyani, Mutton Hanglabari, Chicken Dopiyaza...¬†
Mutton Biriyani was very ordinary... must say extremely ordinary..... i was little disappointed with the biriyani.... i expected the biriyani little traditional ... soaked in oil/ghee... the way we kolkatans are familiar with biryani....though the mutton in the biriyani were extremely soft and good....But quantity was not right...

Mutton Hanglabari, this was the dish which i was looking for.... the number of compliments made on this dish was too high... ¬†and it lived upto its expectation.... ¬†this dish contained 5 decent pieces of mutton with little curry... and i must say.. it was tasty...

Chicken Dopiyaza : I did not taste it.... but as per persons who tasted it... it was good and tasty......

Service : Fine.. bit slow.. but adjustable...

Price : Fair... Neither very cheap...nor costly....

Everything was fine.. but since the main dish i.e the biryani disappointed me a bit... i cant give them more than 2.5....

Hanglaatherium, located in the lane opposite to 16ana bangali, the one near Lord's More can boast of its cool cultural decor. A two room eatery it has some really great posters. However they can make a display their collection of books and magazines instead of placing them deep inside a shelf. Coming to the food we ordered chicken biryani, mutton hanglaabari, and cello kebab. The biryani was nicely done, simple and goes easy on your stomach, the hanglaabari was particularly savoury though I would personally prefer a little less bone content. The cello kebab was a spot decision which was celebrated perfectly by Hanglaatherium. The mutton sheek kebab deserves a special mention. It was truly awesome! The manager of the joint Mr. Bijoy was especially cordial and really looked after the needs of the customers. With him it never felt we were in a restaurant, but actually in a house and he was the perfect host.
We have been to hanglaatherium before, and besides food, the little touches like these make us want to go hyangla again!

This has to be one of the best places to have good biriyani. Located at anwar shah, near south city mall, this place has a very nice ambiance. The decor is quirky and simple. The staff is very friendly and polite. I've tasted the kebab and the biriyani combo which was very nice. They place is moderately priced and serves good food.

I went to this place during durga puja on panchami. The ambience of the place is average but the staffs were very cordial and the service was pretty prompt. We ordered chelow kabab, special chicken biryani and kadhai chicken. The chelow kabab and the biryani were absolutely lip smacking but the kadhai chicken was a bit under cooked which is a big disappointment. The pocket pinch is low. So, overall the place is an average.

Location is a bit tricky. But once u manage to arrive here, u will surely to be rewarded with delicious Biriyani and Mutton hanglabari. There is a combo, that has Biriyani, chicken kasha, chicken Rashmi kebab and is hugely filling. Seating is a bit tight and on weekends there might be quite a bit of wait. The staff is extremely cordial and service is quick.

Hidden Gem is what they said.. pure bliss is what I found...heard 2years back that it won the Kolkata Biriyani competition nailing to the wall the likes of Naushijaan Biriyani... I found the Biriyani Good(can't say exceptional though, its Pujo in Kolkata). Same goes for the side dishes like Fish Banjara and Chicken Handi and Firni... Mutton hanglabari was my first preference but it was out of stock...if you compare the price by quality ratio, it would have got 10/10...also I was very flattered by the hospitality of Vijay da, the manager of the joint..he was constantly assisting and serving us promptly...tidy neat decor, service and hospitality and finger licking Biriyani will drive and drag me to this food joint over and over again....

Ashtami night(9.10.2016) ended on a great note thanks to them and their great food. This small cosy restaurant is located in the bylanes of Lake Gardens opposite South City Mall. One will have to ask around for a bit if they are not well acquainted with the area. I don't know why but the place was not crowded at all. Not complaining but it was weird not to see people queuing up in front of the restaurant. Anyway we got there at about 10.15pm and were seated immediately. Hardly 4-5tables were there. The inside looked really beautiful to me. The walls were painted red. There wasn't much of a d√©cor but I loved the frames of Beatles, Gone with the wind, Joker , Nayak. We had ordered Mutton Biriyani, Mutton Hanglaabari and Tandoori Roti. The Mutton Biriyani was really delicious. I was glad to see that they have not compromised on their quality even during the Puja. The Mutton piece was perfectly cooked. It was soft and succulent. I was really impressed by that. Coming to the Mutton side dish, I could see why Mutton Hanglaabari is kind of their signature dish. It was just THAT good. I don't know how to describe the taste. But the dish was absolutely delicious. The only thing that was not good was the Tandoori Roti. They were really rubbery. Still I can say that overall I loved their food and look forward to eating here again.
P.S. Their Staff is really untrained. They took a lot of time just getting the bill.

One of my friends have been waxing lyrical  about Hanglaatherium for a long time. So when I had to decide on a restaurant for some takeaway food one Saptami evening, I chose Haanglatherium. We ordered Chicken Biriyani & Mutton Chaanp (Tandoori Roti ,unfortunately was not available). The quality of food was decent, no complaints there. However we were disappointed to see that the mutton channp serving contained only one piece, even though both the printed takeaway menu handed to us at the restaurant & the menu at zomato state that it should contain 2 pcs. That's the reason I gave a comparatively lower rating to this eatery.

We had the most amazing saptami lunch at Hanglaatherium. The decor was lovely with some great framed Heath Ledger's Joker and Gone with the wind and the cartoon graffiti on the wall. We had a juicy Chicken achari kabab and a juicier Chicken Tikka Kabab for starters. We ordered some Tandoori roti and Lachha paratha along with Chicken Bharta, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Chicken Handi Masala and a Chicken Biriyani. The Chicken Handi Masala was delicious and the Chicken Bharta was nicely done. The food was great and so was the staff. The pocket pinch is unbelievably low. Would love to visit again.

We went to this place with a lot of high hopes but were terribly disappointed. 

Ambience: The best part. 10/10. 

Service: We ordered some kebabs, chicken biriyani, chicken handi masala and mutton hanglabaari. We had to wait an hour for the food and the restaurant didn't even have a lot of people, so that was disappointing. 
Request was made to cancel one side dish since it was getting pretty late and we were at the verge of finishing our meal but they assured us that it will be delivered soon. Sadly, we had to wait even more. 

Food: The mutton hanglabaari was delicious. The chicken biriyani was okayish. The chicken handi masala seemed like ordinary chicken curry with some large pieces of capsicum. 

I don't know if this is because of Durga Pujo, but even if the service is late, a little bit of cooperation always helps. (:

This is one of the places in Kolkata where you can have some pocket friendly good tastes. Coming to the items, I must say that the Mutton Biriyani and Mutton Hanglabari are the two dishes which I just love to have here. Biriyani over here is much lighter, making no compromise with the taste. Mutton Hanglabari, garnished with coriander leaves, has the ability to steal hearts. Although it is less spicy, the uniqueness in its taste is its signature. This is a must-order item over here.

I dropped by here with group of colleagues during for lunch in between pandal hopping.Came here with high expectations but it wasn't much satisfactory.The decor was very quirky..ideal for adda sessions with friends.Gives a very energetic vibe.

For the starters we ordered

‚Ä¢Chicken reshmi kabab
‚Ä¢Chicken tikka kabab

Both of these were very good.The reshmi was smooth,creamy type while the tikka was spicy.The smokiness was perfect,kababs were very soft..just melting in mouth.

This has set the bar of expectations on our side but things went downhill from here.The mains and desserts were not upto the mark.We took mutton and chicken biriyanis,chicken pasinda and mutton hanglabari in mains.Biriyani was good but I had better.It didn't have the oomph that was expected from an outlet which is featured in "Brilliant Biriyani" collection in zomato.Quantity was huge.
Mutton hanglabari was very very good.Mutton pieces were soft.The gravy was perfectly spicy and fabulous.
Chicken pasinda was a white gravy dish.Till date pasindas I had were red coloured and spicy.This was less on spicy side.

For desserts we had firni.It was good but can be improved.

We took 4cold drinks and one of us took a fresh lime soda.It didn't have much of the lime flavour.What they sprinkled on it tasted like garam masala.

What I liked about the management is that they patiently listened to the negative criticisms and promised to work on it.Good luck to them.

Excellent food and pocket friendly - a perfect place for jomati adda, felt like i am going back to my college days. Uniqueness about is place is the staff opened the door with a warm welcome saying 'kemon achen'. Felt like a second home that we know each other since long... Coming to food i would recommend every Mughlai lover to try out their mouth watering signature dish - Mutton hyangla bari (out of the world), the gravy goes perfect with bengali polao and mutton bhuna - the dry minced masala goes with soft flaky tandoor lachha roti. Will visit this place again..

One man was quarrelling with the manager regarding the bad taste or quality of biryani when i checked in over there, i thought at first there's nothing to say like that but really it's too bad.

In the main course we took Tandoori Roti with Chicken Bharta, it was also very good. Roti was soft enough with good amount of butter spread. Chicken Bharta tasted very good perfect amount of everything in it.
Next we took the Biryani. This place is really known for its Biryani and we could not miss it. Biryani was exactly as people described. Just wonderful.
Prices are decent and quantity is good.

Food is really made of less oil compared to other biriyani chains.
Now the address of the Prince Anwar Shah restaurant has been changed. The quality of the food chain is increasing day by day since it's inception. And the staffs over here are just too good.
I've become such a big fan of yours really.

Haangla is a Bengali word which means greedy in a funny way...at times in a derogatory sense too...use of this word in the name of a food chain is quite innovative and adventurous. Expected the same kind of novelty in the food...but that is only present in the way they have made combos..otherwise food is quite similar to all run of the mill mughlai joints....fish tikka was good, tandoori roti was rubbery and the Biryani..quite dry..did not make me Haangla for more...

Very quaint little restaurant, far removed from the busy main roads of South Kolkata - so much so that you might have a hard time finding it! We were recommended this place by some friends, specifically for the biriyani, and one lazy afternoon we decided to try this out. It's a residential apartment renovated into a restaurant, with several rooms and partitioned seating. Posters of old Bengali films on the walls and the dim lighting add to the laidback and sleepy atmosphere of the place.

We ordered biriyani, of course, along with a chicken side dish. The most striking feature of this place is the prices, it almost seems too good to be true - especially when it's located about five minutes away from South City Mall. On the whole, the food is great and the quantity is more than what you'd expect at a standard restaurant. The only downside is the slow service, and behaviour of the staff who are not very welcoming per se.

Three of us visited this place after a gruelling aptitude test in college to lift up our spirits. We ended up chatting and spending about 2.5 hours, much longer than we intended to. The location is good with local people directing foodies to this little joint. The ambience is very relaxing and casual and we spent about half an hour sitting and chatting even after paying the bill. It's the ideal place for long lazy adda sessions with friends. Coming to the food,  we ordered a chicken meal and mutton biriyani. The chicken meal came with chicken biriyani,2 types of kebabs both of which tasted delicious. The biriyani both mutton and chicken are very light but successfully eradicates the hunger pangs. The kebabs, chicken and mutton pieces are tender and succulent and goes well with the small potatoes. All in all a very good experience. Needless to say it'll the first choice henceforth for subsequent post college hangouts.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: We were the only ones in the restaurant that day. So ambiance was very boring. Service was lousy inspite of us being the only customers. Made mistakes in our orders.

FOOD: The Tandoori kebabs were really delicious. A good Tandoori kebab I've had in a long time.
I didn't quite like the Biryani. It was too dry and the rice grains turned hard like it was in the open for long before being served.
The sweet lime soda was okay.

Not really a pocket friendly restaurant.
But definitely coming back for more kebabs and other stuffs.

A quaint little place with minimal decor which is quite lovely for a lunch date. The food here is absolutely delicious specially the mughlai cuisine specially the reshmi butter masala, chicken bharta and kababs. A must try. Cheap compared to the high end restaurants. The staff is friendly and food was brought to us right on time. So highly recommended place. Must visit.

Hanglatherium is a small food joint located in the bylanes of south kolkata. It is extremely difficult to locate. We had a lot of troubles in finding this place and upon finding it we not quite impressed with the look of the restaurant. It's a small and simple place. Not much of any decor. There was only a single waiter serving who was quite fast and good. The food  was tasty. The biriyani was light and non oily.  We had a ordered a chicken biriyani thali which had two chicken kebabs a chicken kasa and a biriyani. This thali was quite tasty and filling. This place is very affordable and is a good place to visit for the people living in the south.:)

Had lunch here! It was pretty hard to find for me and my friends were visiting the joint the first time.Small place but cozy ambiance. Will accommodate 12 people at a time.Well lit and decorated.We had ordered chicken biriyani chicken bharta, chicken rezala and firnis.Each and every dish was worth the buy. Perfect cooking great aroma. chicken bharta will be my pick of the order. Just fabulous. Firni was very delicious. the kesar over the top was the best part about it accompanied with the essence of rose water.Must visit. great food appropriate pricing..

A group of 6 freinds visited here last day...its a small cosy place to hang up. Mutton Hanglabari is the signature dish...the gravy was lip smacking. 
Mutton briyani was okk ...not as great as Shiraz or Arsalan. We had also offered for hanglaaterium mutton nd chicken Combo meals...the kewabs nd the salad were not up to the mark. Although succulent..we could make out it was previous day's food...
Once a visit is fine...

Been to, or ordered from this place atleast 8-10 times in the past 6 months and it was an incredible experience every single time.

Food : Every dish is a treat to the tastebuds, nevertheless I am recommending a few of my favorites. Let's skip their mouthwatering lip-smacking biriyani for now and move on to the sides. Mutton handi and hanglabari are my absolute favorites. Their chello kabaab will remind you of park street, without creating a hole in your pocket. The naans are tender and go well with their sides.
As for their biriyani, well somehow these days whenever I think of having biriyani, it has to be from here. The succulent juicy humongous pieces of mutton accompanied by the light yet tasty and optimally fragrant rice is a must-have, regardless of your prejudice for the dish.

Ambience : It gives you the feel of a cafe sometimes, but the behavior of the staff is outstanding. They guide you, pamper you and see to your needs without asking. The manager is a very nice gentleman always attending to every guest, keeping a keen eye on the guest's needs and making sure they are satisfied with the food and service. The walls are embroidered with posters of legendary movies and tastefully selected artworks.

Pinch : Well this is perhaps one of the few value for money restaurants which serve you such good food that you want to pay a few bucks more at your heart's content. A tummy-full for 3 people including 2 starters, 2/3 cereal based main courses, 2 sides and 3 drinks will cost you around 1600. Roughly 500 per head.

I am a big fan of this place and I will continue revisiting and ordering from this place if they maintain their trademark quality.

Aaaahhhh... what a Chelo Kabab(as being first timer so tried chelo only, next time something else)....just right to satisfy your soul and a memory to cherish. Jioooooo....keep it up...had food at many eateries n restaurant but Hanglaatherium is best....aaammmm looving it....

I am a regular at their Kamalgazi outlet, being located very near to my place. Have been to this outlet a couple of times - first time was about 3 years back when they were just set up.

The Biriyani and the Mutton Hanglabari are excellent. This outlet was just a take way place the last time I visited, with just 8 covers - not sure if this has changed now !!

Came to know about this hidden gem from zomato and thought of giving it a try. Me along with a friend went there for lunch. I must admit it took me quite a while to find the place. It is a very small place of seating capacity of about 30. The decor was plain and simple but the wall arts will definitely catch hold of your eyes. As soon as we entered we were greeted warmly and was escorted to our table.
We ordered chicken reshmi kabab for starters. The chicken pieces were fairly of good size. It was well cooked and the pieces were really soft with full of flavour. Then we ordered special mutton biriyani and mutton hanglabari. The biriyani was quite light and tasty with good pieces of mutton. The quantity was quite good and can be easily shared by 2. Mutton hanglabari was the icing on the cake. I must admit it was one the most tastiest dish I have ever had. This is a must try if you happen to visit this outlet. We ended our dining experience with sweet lime soda.
The only cons for me was the lighting. It was way too much dim for my liking. And a little slow music would have been good. Looking forward to try the other dishes too.

The food quality was below average and really disappointing. 

Surely avoidable given there are other better options available. 

Too much of oil in the mutton and the Biryani was heavily scented with no taste and aroma.

If you are a true biryani lover then please it's suggested to visit this food joint once. It's really a hidden gem in Kolkata. 
Location: We used to visit the original Lake Gardens branch. Located conveniently at a stone throw away distance from the Lord's more off P.A.Shah Road.
Ambience: Nothing much to describe, overall simple decor, with few glimpses of Satyajit Ray' film posters along with some hilarious wall paints with very basic furnishing.
Service: Well, I visited this joint thrice and all the times I met the same waiter who is a gentle yet informative kind of guy with nice behaviour.
Food Quality: Tried Mutton Biryani, Chicken Biryani, Mutton Hanglabari, Fish Biryani, Chelo Kebab, Boondi Raita, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Chatpata and few more dishes. Out of those mentioned, I bet, you won't get chance to taste better biryani than this in any other places in Kolkata. They are really awesome and mouth watering. But I didn't liked their Fish biryani. Also Chelo Kebab was a bit different one..though not bad but also not as good as that of Peter Cat.
Overall: Good food joint, both for casual dining and take away, at some reasonable price for real quality foods.

Hmm. Had heard about this place for some time. Read many reviews. Then, visited the place. Not very well placed. Quite narrow entrance. Not spacious inside too. Could not find any easy exit or emergency exit.

We had ordered rashmi kebab, galouti kebab to start with. A plain rice, yellow daal and some simple stuff for my honey bee. Rashmi kebab was very good. Well coocked and juicy inside. Galouti kebab was not that good - disappointed. Honey bee enjoyed her food quite well. Rice quantity was good. Then time for us, ordered special chicken biriyani and mutton hanglabari, both to be their signature items.

I did not find anything to wow about the biriyani, except being less oily. Had similar experience with Alibabba's special biriyani. Chicken was not as tender as I was expecting. Quantity of rice was balanced. Chicken size was good. Surprisingly, potato was so well coocked. Spice distribution and flavour was well balanced. Overall, a good biriyani experience.

Mutton hanglabari, extremely disappointed with the quality. Gravy tasted good and the good experience ends there. Mutton was not at coocked properly. The meat was hard. It was almost not possible to chew but swallow. Had provided a open feedback to the staff.

Inside the furniture was very ordinary. AC was good. Staffs were well mannered and very good to interact with. 

Impression: Nothing special and does not justify the name, but good for unplanned lunch/dinner.

A tricky location that leads the way to some finger licking good food... Welcome to Hanglaatherium!!!
1stly this might make your search a bit easier- if you walk from south city mall towards Lords, u will find a restaurant named '16 ana bangali'.. Simply take the lane opposite to it and just after a couple of turns u will end up over here.
Coming to the food, we ordered special chicken biriyani, mutton bhuna kebab, mutton hanglaabari, salad and cold drinks. The biriyani was nothing special but but but the mutton dishes were exceptional.... Mutton hanglaabari undoubtedly deserves a special mention. A small advice: DO NOT MISS OUT ON MUTTON HANGLAABARI.... In fact it was sooooo good that I immediately started recommending it to my friends.... 
Overall a very good experience..... Staffs were courteous and helpful and the price is reasonable as well... :)

The experience at Hanglaatherium proved to be moderate to be honest. The food was delightful. The Chicken Biriyani tasted nice. The Tandoori Roti tasted delicious. We had Mutton Do Piyaza and Chicken Bharta along with Tandoori Roti. The pieces of mutton were well cooked and delightfully soft. The Dal Makhani which some of my other friends took did not rise to our expectations however. The place is a bit too small. The interior decor was one of the best that I have seen till date. The waiters were a bit callous with their serving, spilling a bit of left over food on my friend's dress. Moderate experience.

Fabulous!! Just don't go by the looks. Try the food, you'll not be disappointed. The chicken biriyani is one of the best in Kolkata, and you know how we don't have dearth of restaurants that serve Mughlai style biriyani in Kolkata. 
Finding this place can be a little tricky, it's near South City mall. Love the biriyani. The chicken tikka masala was also delectable. Once in a while I love thalis or combo meals. And the chicken biriyani combo of hanglaatherium is one of the best I've had. Pocket friendly. Judging by just the flavors, I'll rank it quite high.

We ordered a chicken biriyani and a mutton biriyani combo and to be very honest the food turned out to be exceptional if comapred to the ambiance and location. They are well known because of their biriyani. 
The service they provided was also good. The response was prompt and nice. The menu was quite cheap and very much affordable. For a place like this the price is quite justified. 
The overall experience was really nice and i would say its simply one of the best.

For starters we had mutton bhuna kebab and chicken kali mirch kebab...the kebabs were delicious n had an originality in their flavour...for main course we had chicken biriyani and their signature dish-mutton hanglabari...the biriyani was not at all a dissapointment...it was light and tasty and unique...the mutton hanglabari is a must try...overall a good xperience

Really best biriyani in kolkata right now-truely said - Biriyani ka Badshah üëç
But for me this restro is perfect combo of every kind of dishes.
Chello kabab(ahhhh what can I say,mouth watering),Biriyani (as I said previously üòòüòç ) Masala cold(suppppper duper hit)
And another important thing is Very Pocket friendly (y)
Even I've tried fish biriyani, awesome awesome awesome. Donno that any other restro serves the fish biriyani or not,though I'm a die hrt biriyani lover, but itz awesome to taste some diff. Kinda biriyani.
This restro have combo systems too which is sufficient for one person. Ambience üëç
Location is 1mnt walking distnce from South city mall(oppos. Side).
Though I'm a north kolkata person and it situated in proper south kolkata, but yeah I would love to visit this place again and again.
Heard that,most probbly they r opening soon at north kolkata and behala side üòç

Hanglaatherium is a cozy restaurant lying somewhere beyond the opposite side of south city, near lake gardens. I've been there only once and ordered the mutton biriyani platter. The biriyani and the assortments were pretty good, although not the best. Having been brought up in the vicinity of the legendary dada-boudir hotel, few biriyani serving restaurants can please my gastronomical desires. I think the most difficult bit in making the perfect biriyani is to preserve the juiciness in the mutton or chicken. Hanglaatherium falls short, like most other restaurants. However, this is one of the best biriyani destinations in south Kolkata, or at least near my locality.

Today I had my lunch in this Hanglaatherium outlet which is situated near to South City Mall. This Restaurant features in the hidden gems and honestly I will say that this is the best hidden gem that I have visited. This is a small restaurant often remains crowded but well managed by their staffs. The Ambience is decent and the staffs are very well mannered.

Coming to the food I ordered Chicken Biryani,Tandoori Roti and Chicken Bharta (Shredded). The service was quick and prompt within 5 mins the food was served. The Chicken Biryani tasted like an authentic Lucknowi Biryani. The Bharta was awesome. The quantity of both the dishes were good.

And a thank you to all the reviewers as well as Zomato without your valuable feedbacks this wouldn't be possible. At last the staffs came to us and asked whether we have any problem or not usually in other crowded restaurants we don't get to see such things and they also provided me a feedback book and I rated them excellent and here too I rate them with 5 ratings. Looking forward for a next visit.

Dated- 9 October 2016

After having a great experience quite a few months ago here I come back again this puja to grab something new from this outlet. This time I came with my family and had our lunch. We ordered Tandoori Roti, Chicken Kasha, Egg Kasha, Aloo Jeera, Dal and Steamed Rice. All the items were good. Though dal was a little salty but this sought of things can take place during rush hours of Durga Puja. So it is negligible for me. The Aloo Jeera was the best among all. The Egg and Chicken was also good. Quantity was enough. Service was prompt and the Manager was very friendly and helpful, he had a nice talk with us, he also clicked pictures with us. Usually we don't get to see this kind of behaviour from such big restaurants. Overall it was a yet another wonderful experience at this place. And my ratings for this place remains same.

We ordered chicken bryani combo meal that includes chicken kosha and kabab. Tikka kabab was good but chicken kosha is very ordinary. But the biryani was fantastic. Not so oily and with a different taste from arsalan or aminia biryani. We also tried masala cold drinks which was very good. One should definitely try masala cold drinks and biryani. Overall experience was good serving was very good and staffs are well behaved that's the best part I think. I will definitely visit again. :)

I have been to, and ordered from this place on several ocassins. This has slowly become my go-to biryani place. Their special mutton biryani is great, with the mutton pieces always being juicy and soft. 
The kebabs are pretty good too. I have tried their chicken tikka kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, mutton gulawati kebab and chelo kebab. Each one was well cooked and properly seasoned.
The mutton biryani combo is a great buy, being pocket friendly and quite satisfying at the same time.
Fantastic little place. Definitely worth a visit. :)

finally we had our hanglaatherium day! it is not at all hard to find if you are careful. while coming towards navina cinema from south city,you will come across a restaurent named sholoana bangali on the left side of the road,in front of that restaurent you will find a park..hanglaatherium is very near to that. we had ordered chicken biriyani and chelo kabab. the delivery was prompt. the staffs were courteous enough. though the place is small,you can't complain about the ambience at all! and nothing to tell about the food,its great,you know!:)

We visited the restaurant soon after it opened.The place is opposite to south city,but quite far from the main road. We had a little problem finding the place..We had the chicken biriyani combo which had biriyani,chicken kosha, kabab and onion salad and also the mutton biriyani combo. The food was okay.. not that good.

Went to have lunch here with friends a few days back. We were looking for a moderately priced place near jadavpur area and this is what popped in our heads. Now coming to the restaurant, the place is quite quirky decor wise with the red walls and old time movie posters. The food is good both quantity and quality wise and the staff is cordial.What we ordered-
Chicken reshmi kebab
Chicken Biriyani Combo
Mutton Biriyani
Mutton Hanglabari
Chicken pasanda
Chicken tikka butter masala
Butter nan
Laccha paratha  
I loved the mutton Hanglabari, it tasted really nice. The Biriyani was good like any other standard Biriyani place. The chicken pasanda was not up to the mark and the tikka butter masala was okayish. The laccha paratha was more of a tandoori roti, I don't know why. But overall it was a nice experience.Worth a visit for a quick bite.
Happy Dining Peeps :)

After collecting 9th semester mark sheet I went there with my friend.. We ordered 1) Special Chicken Biryani, 2) Mutton Hanglabari ( this item was the one and only reason why I wanted to go there, 3) Mutton Bhuna Kebabs, 4) Salad, 5) Coca Cola.. Liked this food joint..I did not like the taste of their biryani but but but hanglabari and bhuna kebabs, OMG!!! they were just awesome.. I liked the quality and the quantity of those items.. Ambience was good but I did not like the d√©cor ( specially those red tables and red chairs ).. I think they should decorate this joint with nice stuff.. Otherwise if anyone wants to have delicious mutton recipes, this place is ideal.. Totally recommend it to everyone..

Went there on an afternoon after reading a lot in Zomato. The place is not easy to locate. A small but well-maintained restaurant. We tried the combo mutton biriyani meal. The kabab and biriyani were good. But chicken kosha was not up to the mark. The ambience is nice. But the lighting can be little better and some background music¬†will add another direction. The best part was some book was there which you can read along with Hangla¬†magazine. Overall a good restaurant¬†keeping the money and hospitality they offered.

Today Went to Hanglaatherium, a nice and cosy food joint near South City Mall. The ambience is very nice. A Retro theme that is going very well with the decor and the Owners are warm and friendly. and the food is just too good.. Its rich on taste but not on oil. The Special Biryani was excellent and their special dish Mutton Hanglaa bari is amazing.. They really know how to maintain quality and standards. Give it a try.

Me & my wife visited this place on weekday, google map helped us to find this place, Car parking is a bit of issue here.

About restaurant: Firstly  this is a very small place, & the place not made for a restaurant, totally residential area, they convert a house's ground floor as restaurant. 

About Food: I searched at zomato & read many comments about their briyani & Mutton hangabari. We also ordered that & paratha too. For my opinion Mutton Briyani is not soo great, I mean it's ok, but not that tasty. Briyani's mutton was soft & good.
Mutton Hanglabari item was really good & I loved that dish.
Paratha was not good.

Overall, If u planning to visit with ur big family & friends then this is not the right place, they don't have that much space.
Try to avoid on weekends bcoz of car parking.

My third visit and I am always satisfied with this place. Biriyani combo is what I tried earlier too and it's a great pocket friendly package. This time I found the chicken kosha tooo much tasty. The new addition is Chelo kebab. And I just loved it. Extremely good. The mutton sheekh kebabs were thick and tasted superb. Even the chicken kebabs were so well cooked. Rice was in good quantity. We also ordered fresh lime soda(sweet) and it was very refreshing. The waiters are extremely courteous and very attentive. It is a small place, very comfortable and homely.
Tips: They should make their signature dish Mutton Habglabari always available. We ordered but it wasn't available. Firni too wasn't available. Although they said this crisis was due to some huge order they took earlier that day.
It's a brilliant food joint. A must try..

I've order three times from this outlet through Swiggy, and every time I have been left with a feeling of satisfaction. Their biryani is simply delicious, along with their chicken bharta and egg curry. I've order these same items every time, and the quality and quantity is quite consistent. Two biryanis are actually enough for three people, which can hardly be said for any other biryani outlet in my locality. Thank you for such wonderful meals.

I ordered achari kebab, kali mirch kabab, butter naan, chicken do piyaza and firni. The kebabs were good, mainly the kali mirch. The naans were great, the chicken do piyaza was a bit flat and the firni was great too. But the best part is their service. The waiters were so well behaved and they gave me a card were I could have reviewed their ¬†food place. From that card they got to know that yesterday was my birthday and immediately wished me.

Homely place with a pleasant decor that's Haanglatherium! Beginning with the starters we had kebabs which was succulent and juicy.. I just loved it! The chicken biriyani was light and not that spicy which is good because we don't feel comfortable after having rich and spicy mughlai food. We also order butter naan, chicken bharta which were okay. The food quantity could have been bit more to make us feel worth the price! Over all experience is good!

After having Hanglaatherium on my list for a long time, finally had the chance to visit the place on a Saturday afternoon. After a little difficulty in finding the place, when we entered the place we were really hungry. It was quite empty and we liked the interiors and the quietness. There were a lot of things in the menu that we wanted to try, especially the kababs. The waiter insisted on trying their biriyani but instead we ordered chelo kabab, tandoori rotis, lachchha parathas and mutton hanglaabari and coke. The service was late and we were so hungry that we finished our cokes before the food came in! But when it did, we had nothing to complain about! The chelo kabab was okay altogether but the kababs were tasty. But oh! The mutton hanglaabari! It was absolutely delicious! So the place truly satisfies the tag "hidden gem". Would love to visit again.

Hats off to Google Maps! I would never find this restaurant without GPS!¬†
Located in the "Golis" opposite South City "Chottor", this place is a Gem of a place!

Food: We ordered Chicken Biriyani Combo and Mutton biriyani Combo and both of them tasted heavenly. Hanglatherium Special items could be the others item on which I can bet will be tasty.

Ambience: Ambience was so so. Its neat and clean. The place is pretty small. Rush hours will surely make you wait. But the wait will be worth when you get to eat the food finally.

Service: The waiters and the manager were all very nice and served and answered every query with a Smile.

Price: The food, its taste, the quantity and quality is worth the price. There are places which costs thirce and gives one-third satisfaction of what we had here.

Verdict: Definitely¬†worth atleast 3-4 visits if not more!

A must visit HIDDEN GEM !! A very fun place to enjoy the delicious Kolkata Biriyani. The place is 5 minutes ¬†walking distance from Lord's More bus stand. We went there on a busy sunday afternoon and the place was packed. The staff actually converted the table where the owner ( i suppose,or manager maybe ) sat, into a dining table. I was really impressed that they felt it was very important that we shouldn't have to wait! ¬†Now coming to the more important details.¬†

Food: The biriyani was excellent. The right flavor , the right amount of spice but not excessively oily. 10/10 indeed. We also tried the Chicken Hariyali Kabab which was also very good. The fresh lime soda and masala cold drinks went with the biriyani like magic !¬†

Ambiance: The ambiance here is very rustic with red being their theme color. The portraits and posters added to the beauty.

Service: The staff were by far one of the most polite bunch i have ever seen! They were super nice !!¬†
¬†Even though the place was packed, we got our food quick enough and we finished it even quicker !!

A great place to tickle you biriyani cravings, at a very affordable price !! Will come again and again !!

This one is mainly popular for home delivery so you will find long list of orders to be delivered by mainly Swiggy and Food Panda.  If you are real foody you must try :)

After hearing a lot and looking at the ratings was very exited to visit this place. The place was pretty in from the main road we managed to walk through the zic-zac road and finally reached this place. We asked what's best and the waiter suggested that they are called biryani ka raja by some radio channel! All exited we ordered for the special chicken biryani and the zomato suggestion mutton hangla something! Waited for the biryani and mutton to arrive and once it did looked promising! And then as we started digging the err! Moment arrived the chicken wsnt properly cooked the mutton was chewy and sweet due to extra onion. To save my self from the dry biryani tried ordering onion raita who the hell goes wrong with isn't it ? But to my sheer amazement Tht too wasn't good enough it was totally smothered with some masala Tht was imparting a very weird sweet taste. After this when I went back to rye ratings I questioned myself either my taste is really weird or these ratings are hoax! Anyways the service was good hence my ratings are generous. Still on my way to better food.

While searching for a place near Anwar Shah to have lunch after movie, we settled on this joint. Though it didn't live up to it's hype on zomato, the food wasn't too bad either.
Coming first to the location, it's somewhere beyond the 'gali' beside the Honda Showroom opposite to South City Mall and can be a bit tricky. Now the joint itself is really small but not cramped. We were a group of 8 people and it was a bit of 'jugaad' to get us a seat. But the ambience made up for it. Quirky posters of legendary movies made it a really cozy joint. Service was prompt and waiters were polite.
Now the actual deal, the food, was kinda okayish. The Chicken Seekh and Tawa kebabs were great and the Tandoori roti not at all stiff. For the main dish we'd 3 Chicken Bharta and 2 Chicken Handi Masala, the later being a tad sweeter than our taste. The peas pulao was good though.
The bill was around 2k, which was about right for the quality they serve. So it's NOT CHEAP, the quality is such. Overall, not a bad experience but won't be visiting again.

There are of course numerous places where you can have good biriyani in this city. So I will not go into superlatives. Sometimes simple facts are more important. Hanglaatherium serves wonderful biriyani. It's moist, tasty, not excessively oily and value for money. Their other dishes, especially the specials and combos are good too but this is primarily a biriyani place and it doesn't disappoint.

A little place,very reasonably priced but a new addition to the biriyani family in Kolkata that I believe will stand on it's own quite well. Located close to South City mall. We had their mutton haanglabaari which was yummy. Their murg mussalam and chicken n mutton biriyanis were delicious as well.
Must visit for all.

Certainly does not come under big restaurants that is in terms of their infrastructure but certainly comes in the category of big restaurants in terms of their food quality(specially biriyani).

This is their 2nd outlet that i have tried, and its even better than thier first one. Biriyani is really awesome and certainly falls under the "best ones" in kolkata. Though the place is not too big but it can accomodate a gang. Seats are comfy and place is clean. Staffs are good. 

They have some preety killer combos. 

Most likeable thing about them is that all their outlets are pocket friendly. You will really be surprised as to how they can provide such nice service in that price.

Well we ordered chicken biriyani  and firni,after having one spoon of biriyani it felt like mmmm! lovely.. The firni was too good.  The ambience and the staffs were good and helpful respectively. But sorry to say last time when I made a 'take away' service it disappointed me, there was an unpleasant smell in one of the biriyani tub. I took 4 biriyanis and 2 of them smelled unpleasant.

This place is near the Lord's more. Quite a famous joint.
A small restaurant, probably known for it's biriyani. The interiors were neat but the lighting should be considered. Too red.
Now coming to the food, we ordered chicken biriyani and fresh lime soda. The chicken biriyani tasted good. Chicken was cooked well. The only con was the biriyani was served cold. Also it comes with a huge chicken piece and a boiled potato. The rice was long and fine.
The manager came inside and asked everyone whether we're satisfied or not. I really appreciated that.
The fresh lime soda could have tasted better. 
Over all a nice and pocket friendly biriyani joint.

This was the 3rd time I visited this place. I can easily rate this as one of the best biryani places in South Kol which is easy on the pocket. The atmosphere is good & staff are friendly too. The Hara Bhara Kabab & the Biryani combos are my favorite. The quantity too is sumptuous and kebabs are fesh n juicy. So a big thumbs up from my side and a must try place for Biryani lovers. No wonder why it features on the Zomato hidden gems list :)

On my bidthday I decided to go there for dinner with friends as it near to south city..By google map finaly I reached there as its 1st time for me I really take little bit more time to fine..its near kfti institute.The restaurant gives a classy look with glowing red coat and different collage photos of old tolly film stars.On that day we are only at that restaurant so 1st time feel something awkward.But their servce was good.specially when my phone battery about to die they provide charger with a request though it is very unexpected for me.They also provide good suggestion to choice their food.we ordered kali mirch kabab,rashmi kabab,special briyani(chicken),hanglaaritherium special mutton.Among them Iliked kali mirch kabab with an unique test,resh kabab has no speciality but i really didnot impress by their popular biryani I felt it was some how dry and last their mutton dish was very sweet not porperly combined with the taste of briyani.I expected fur better taste what I got yestarday.

This place is indeed a Hidden Gem!!
Initially this place was quite hard to locate but the food was enough to wash away all the disgusts for finding the place.
The warm welcome,classic Bengali movie posters,red and white decoration made the perfect ambiance . The place was not crowdy at all.
Let's come to the food. we took achari kebab,Kali Mirch kebab in starter as suggested by the restaurant staff. Those were yummy. Chicken biryani was light but tasty.We tried mutton hanglabari as side dish. All were perfect. Staffs were very cordial and very polite.
I am highly recommending this place and would definitely like to revisit the place.

Otherwise everything is just grt. A must visit for all biriyani lovers...

Both food and ambiance are good. We ordered kabab platter and mutton biriyani along with sweet lime soda. Kabab was delicious. Biriyani portions are huge. 2 biriyanis should be enough for 3. I will deduct 1 point for the following reasons: a. The biriyani needed a pinch of salt to taste best, b. The portion of meat in the biriyani is less, compared to the portion size. But we enjoyed the evening a lot.

Tips: The restaurant is hard to find out. Call for directions.

Not too spicy but quantity was bit less. Overall nice place and really good food.

It's difficult to locate the place. The restaurant space is small, they are shifting soon at a new place near main road for some more space. Service & staffs are good. Tasted their mutton biryani combo. Biryani is tasted really well, light oily & less spicy. Quality is good, quantity of rice is less. Mutton piece is juicy & soft, potato piece is small & not properly boiled. I don't like their chicken kosha served within the combo meal, tiny 2 pieces of chicken with some gravy. Tasted really bad & the chicken isn't properly boiled. Chicken tikka is fine with pudina chatni. I personally suggest to taste their single plate of biryani only, chicken or mutton it's up to you. Their combo meal is not up to mark in terms of taste and quantity. And hanglaatherium pls do use a better cooking oil to prepare your excellent biryani.
Rated 3.5 only for the taste of their Biryani.
- 0.5 = food quantity & quality in combo meal.
- 0.5 = faltu chicken kosha within the combo.
- 0.5 = combo meal & prices with added tax are sucks!

Wanted to try a new restaurant for long time, found this place in zomato and I m absolutely amazed. This place is pocket friendly as well as awesome.

Finding this place may seem a little difficult and also the ambience and restaurant itself is not so impressive but if u are a foodie u are going to fall in love with what they serve. 

We started with kebabs...ordered kali mirch kebab and jira kebab and those things blew me away. They tasted too awesome to be described. Then after the biriyani came we knew it had to be awesome with that aroma. Biriyani was very nice, less oily, mutton piece was perfectly cooked and soft. We also ordered chicken pasinda and mutton hanglabari and I would recommend everyone to try these especially chicken pasinda, with biriyani it tasted out of the world. 

Coming to the end I have to say this I am very much impressed with their behaviour. The person in charge was very polite and was taking care of our each n every small needs. For biriyani lovers this place is a must go!

Hanglatherium has always been one of my most favorite haunts,specially for their delectable signature dish mutton hanglabari.Went there after quite a couple of months.Ordered masala cold drink,mutton biryani and hanglabari.The cold drink came first which was not quite my type..a bit over-spiced but not bad as a whole.The biryani was decent,light and flavorful as always...but the hanglabari deserves special mention.The taste,the aroma..the tenderness of the juicy succulent mutton pieces..i loved every bit of it!Hanglatherium is surely a heaven for biryani lovers.Every single staff at this outlet are really friendly and courteous..which is a huge plus point for the eatery. :)

Mighty impressed with the biriyani. This might as well become my next favorite biriyani destination.
I settled for a home delivery yesterday, ordering through zomato and the food reached me in half an hour's time though the requisite time limit demanded was for an hour.

Our order comprised of a chicken biriyani, bengali polao and mutton rogan josh.

The biriyani as mentioned above, impressed me thoroughly with its aroma, flavors and its all over lightness. The distinct sweet smell of the alu bukhara was so impelling. The aroma of nutmeg and mace were also distinct. The best part is, the smell of the rose and keora water was not over powering, which is generally the case with biriyanis served at most other places. The chicken and the potato were melt in the mouth.

Now coming to the other dishes. When I order a Bengali polao, i expect it to have that hint of sweetness. That is what makes the polao the perfect compliment to any spicy sides. Well the sweetness was not there at all. Though the rice was perfectly hued yellow, and it had the right ratio of garam masalas and dry fruits, it still was denied to meet its sweet fate thanks to that lack in sugar.

The rogan josh too needed a little bit sugar to balance off that sour flavor coming from the yogurt. Apart from the slight lack of balance in these two dishes, the meal was enjoyed thoroughly.

This place is pretty difficult to locate. I went with a friend and it took us 20 minutes to locate. Google maps saved the day!
The ambience is good, with nice graffiti on the walls. Moderately spacious place, with friendly staff. Service is neither too good, nor too bad. But no complaints there.
We tried the chicken biriyani combo and we were delighted. Generous quantity, biriyani is really good. So were the two pieces of kebabs. But for me, the chicken chaanp stole the show! It was the best of it's kind that I've ever had. Tender and moist chicken, amazing gravy: what more could you ask for? They give you a pudina sauce which is spicy and fresh. And then there is lots of fresh onions served. So if the biriyani or the chaanp gives you a carb attack, those two are sure to put your pallete back on track. A bit more expensive than the 'Tandoor House' combo, but the quality is way better as well. You truly get your money's worth.
Chicken biriyani combo is recommended!

In the food section, I would recommend everyone to try out the Egg Kosha and Mutton Hanglaabari as these two are probably the best dishes they have. Service was a bit poor, and it felt they could have added more space, but overall, a great experience. Recommended for everyone looking for some good food in a tight budget.

Visited this place based on very good reviews, but was rather disappointed. The starters - Kebabs were just about ok to begin with although not what we expected, but the much praised Biryani,though not very spicy and oily which is good , left us heavily disappointed as the mutton in the biryani was very dry and rather hard, not at all succulent as one would expect. The other mutton and chicken dishes too were rather disappointing as the gravy was same for both.

To top it all, the Bill was inflated as extra items were charged. It was however rectified when brought to notice.

All in all a rather disappointing experience. Wouldn't really suggest this place for an eating out occasion. At best can be visited for a quick hunger satiation if one happens to be around that area. The Price and quantity were reasonable.

In terms of the hospitality, this place can score a perfect five.  I have never seen any other restaurant with such a good hosting.  The ambiance is nice, and the food is nice ( especially the biryani).  Although I am not happy with the other mughlai dishes,  and kebabs definitely need improvement. Even though the place is not easy to find, but still worth a visit just for the biryani.  And the service is very slow, but on the other hand it gives you more time to chat with the other person.  And if you are unfortunate like me you have to cancel the order of dessert üò•.

Went there with a friend few days ago. We ordered chicken reshmi kebabs, mutton biriyani with mixed raita and salads. The kababs were soft, tasty and well cooked. Coming to Hanglatherium's mutton biriyani ,it was cooked with less oil, but i felt there was some compromise with the quantity. But it was tasty. The staffs are well behaved and well trained.

This was in my wishlist for a long time and it is not an easy place to find. Take the lane beside LederLand opposite South City Mall and go straight and take a right and go on asking people from there on where the place is. :P that is how I reached the restaurant. This is a small outlet with 3 4 chair tables and was not air conditioned when I had visited ( it was a long time ago ) It was mostly for takeaways. So I had got 2 chicken and 1 mutton biryani packed. 

A huge container for each biryani and is filled with rice, good big piece of potato and a meaty chicken and mutton piece respectively. Loved the taste. This has been by far the only outlet whose biryani did not make me crave a thums up and that is something of an achievement since I always need an aerated drink after a biryani. kudos to the owner.

While searching for a place to eat near South City Mall, I came across it. The reviews and ratings talked about the famous Biryanis and the kebabs and hence decided to try it out. 
The place is small and was totally empty even though it was a Saturday evening (Strange). We sat and were talking to the waiter when he told us that the biryani is soo good that The Bengal Tiger, Saurav Gangully gets it from them quite often. So we ordered one Chicken Biryani, Chicken Masala, chicken tikka and Paneer chap with rotis.
Overall the food was really good. Chicken was soft and well cooked. Paneer was also fresh.
The service is bit slow but overall a place to try out.

So, wow.   The mutton Hanglaabari was wow.   The biriyani platter was good.  The phirni was good, again.  Just that you might not get all the dishes all the time.  :-( Taste wise, yum yum yum.  Not very fancy appearance wise.  At times, only the food matters and this is one such place. Oh, I almost forgot: value for money.   College goers delight.

I visited my friends place in jodhpur park and we ordered from this joint, my friend usually used to order f this joint and said they serve good enough Mughlai food so I thought of trying it. The biryani was bland and the chaap was literally the worse chaap I had till date. It had gotten late and we had nothing else to order.

It is a good, calm and quiet place...food was very tasty and of good quality...the interior is good, decorated with old bengali movies but this place certainly needs some promotion because it is difficult to spot and find unless you are very known to the area. owner n waiters' behavior is very good.

Again a place which is pocket friendly and yet good. The chelo kebab , that was recently launched was the best at such a price. The aloo tikki offered with the chelo kebab platter adds a level to the preparation. The kebabs were juicy and well cooked, tasty. Quantity was great. The biriyanis there are cheap and tasty. Its so budget friendly that u wont think twice before going there.. Its in my most preferred list of restaurants i would go to when i am low on budget and high on hunger.. Perfect place for hangla's. :-) :-)

A nice little place not far from the south city mall. But finding the place can be tricky as it is not situated beside the main road. The decor is simple yet nice. Now coming to the food, other than having varieties of Indian dishes, they also had combos there too. We had opted for Chicken biriyani combo and mutton biriyani combo. They had served ni@ce amount of biriyani, kebab, a chicken side dish and salads in the combo. The quantity was fair enough. The taste was great. And their service was surprisingly quick. Other than these, we had masala coke and firni. Well, thumbs up from me. Will definitely recommend others.

This place is quite hard to find if you have less idea about anwar shah road. Me with my two friends went there this Friday. As it is hyped for Briyani lovers. 
Now let me talk about the food and other stuffs. The decorations is simple with movie based themed. 
We ordered mutton Briyani, kebabs, salad , and chicken kassa. The Briyani is light and tastes good, kebabs and chicken kassa is good too but what I didn't liked is the food they served as we ordered combo they give us in a steel plate with everything on the plate, it's more like old time INDIAN RAILWAYS  food plates üòúüòúüòú

Other wise it's a good experience and pocket savings.

Superb Biryani & Mughlai Mutton

Date of Visit - 3rd April , 2016

The name is really catchy and unique.

FOOD
Fish Achari kebab was succulent and flavourful.
Mutton Galawati Kebab was soft,tasty & good meat quality.
Main Course
Mutton Hanglabari was good but the gravy could have been a bit less sweeter.
Chicken Kosha was authentic and simply delicious (Best with the lacha paratha)
And ofcourse Biryani had to be ordered so we ordered a special mutton biryani and a chicken egg biryani .. The mutton biryani was really really good.. with the right amount of flavour and the mutton was soft (good pieces). Dont have the same opinion for the chicken in the biryani though.¬†

Service
Service is a bit slow but the order takers and waiters try their best to make you comfortable.
The cutlery could be a bit more cleaner and neat.

These people know their food well.
Authentic Bengali Mughlai food of good taste & quality.
Do try their mutton dishes & the biryani.

Seating is limited and a bit congested when full.
Great for takeaways and Delivery.
Packaging is also good.

Location- Interior Bylanes
Parking can be a major issue here..
Please book before visiting.

Do Visit with friends/family if you love Biryanis & Mutton.

Cheers

Visited here for lunch. The interior is simple and practical. Ordered the mutton biryani combo meal. It consisted of muttom biryani, 2pcs of chicken tikka kebab, 2pcs chicken kosha nd onion salad. The quantity was ample. The biryani was tasty with no excessive scent nd masala, and the mutton was cooked well. The chicken kosha was also wonderfully cooked. I didn't like the tikka kebab much. The waiters were cordial. It was a departure from the usual biryani joints nd the experience was one to cherish.

The place compelled me to write my¬† first ever review on Zomato! :D
I was celebrating with a special someone, so we were looking for an inconspicuous location which would not attract a lot of crowd. The place was a little too hidden, though. But once we reached, the first thing that caught my attention was the decor-posters of films and a bookshelf. I instantly knew I had chosen well!

Besides films and books, a true Bangali only needs good food to clinch the deal. And we were served exactly that. Since it was our first time, we did not know about the quantities, so we ordered the Hanglaatherium Special Mutton Biriyani Combo just to be safe, and Firni. When the order arrived, I was surprised at the quantity. It was quite a LOT. The biriyani was so light, not greasy at all, well flavoured, and distinctly spiced. They gave a decent piece of mutton too, which was soft enough to be broken with the fork. So were the pieces of chicken as the chicken kosha and tikka kebab. By the end of the combo, we were both so full, that we had to ask the staff to kindly wait for 15 minutes so that we could make some room for the firni, which they did most diligently. The firni though, was just a tad bit disappointing, as I had had better firni elsewhere, even though my partner thoroughly enjoyed every last spoonfull. For me, the rest of the meal, and the very polite staff, more than made up for it.

I have already verbally recommended Hanglaatherium to many of my acquaintances, and I would do so to everyone, mainly if you want to have a light biriyani which does not leave you burping the entire day (yes, that happens). So, keep up the good work! :)

I'm indeed a HUGE fan of their biryani! Prices are a steal. Quantities are very good and it does not feel heavy after just half a plate, unlike most other places, and you can comfortably hog an entire plate in minutes. Or might just be the delicious taste! Finding this particular branch might be a bit of a problem if you're visiting for the first time. However, they had been extremely polite to answer my repeated phonecalls asking for directions! Yes, their behavior is great. The d√©cor is quite funky, with comic strip wallpapers in the outer room n nice popular culture posters in the other. This is honestly my favourite when I'm starved n on a budget n craving amazing biryani!

Had dropped by exactly an year ago. Took me some effort to find this inside the bylanes though. Came across a manager whom I knew personally to be serving at a joint nearby my place who left his job there and joined this particular brand.

Ordered for a take-away consisting of their Mutton Biryani, Mutton Hanglabari and Chicken Tikka Kebab. The Biryani was decent but not on the likes or quality maintained by Arsalan or other reputed brands. The Side Dish had gone sour. They didn't bother to check the quality of the dish before packing it up. The Kebab was chewy and hard. Waste of sheer money!

Hanglatherium is one of the few restos i dont mind going over and over again. In my hagla review about hanglatherium, gariahat branch i had mentioned how their staff is courteous.. the same experience here again.

It was a nice sunny day when i dropped in to have a taste.

Location - the location is a bit jalebi types. Now go to south city ..there is a park in the opp foot. Take the lane adjacent to that park. U will have to go a semi circle. Then u can see the resto in its typical red cover.. Trust me. Call those guys. My direction sense can make u mad.

Ambiance - the resto is fully red in colour from inside. Its funky its cool its red, one of my fav colours. The place is cool for a casual lunch or dinner with family and friends.

Staffs - in my gariahat review also i had mentioned their staffs are super cool and very friendly. This place is no exception. They asked us 5 times if we liked the food or not. One of the few places where u can feel at home. Hangla u r surely the best in these matters.

Food - onek din holo gechilam. As fasr as i can rem.. we took the chicken biriyani combo and mutton hanglabari.

Chicken combo r description ta dilam na. Check my gariahat hangla review. Tate amar ekta view barbe! Ki moja..

Jokes apart. The combo was as usual good. Biriyani better than most well knowned biriyani places. Kebabs and chicken side was friendly to my taste buds.

Now coming to mutton hanglabari. Its apt .. it seriously makes u hangla. I am in love with this dish. It was recommended by my zomato friend

It's located just opposite of South city mall. It's really cheap. They serve too quick fortunately when I was there it felt like I reserved the entire restaurant as no one was in there at that time so that may be a reason behind quick service. And the food is good with respect to what they charge for that. So if you are hungry u can surely try this one out.

Hearing and reading good things about this restaurant... we just decided to order food from here... we ordered tandoori chicken, the bengali polao, tandoori roti, paneer chap, kashmiri aloo dum and firni.. a few years back i also had their mutton biriyani and mutton hanglabaari which were amazing... so thought of trying these... well, coming to the food...
The delivery was just on time.. nothing extraordinary about their food... the tandoori chicken was good... the polao and the paneer were very fresh and tasty.. but the kashmiri aloo dum was not upto expectation.
All the pieces were not properly cooked although the gravy was nice.. then came the tandoori roti.. the rotis were hard and chewy.. and last but not the least.. we had the firni which was good.. the food could have been much better... not that much satisfied...

one of my favourite take away food joint. Tried there mutton biryani, fish biryani, mutton hanglabari and firni. mutton biryani was good.
sufficient for 2 people. mutton is soft and juicy.
Fish biryani was also good. Most probably fish was boneless vetki and the most imp thing is 
u won't find any fishy smell in it Mutton hanglabari is there signeture dish. gravy was a little sweet , that prep is non-spicy and non-oily. Not like typical "too much oily" side dish.
Overall a good experience. a recommended food joint for south kolkata people.

Review for this restaurant should be like a good restaurant serving awesome food. gone there..but this time have taken a home delivery via swiggy...really serving awesome food in this price..ordered Bengali pulao. Mutton kassa and firni. For Bengali pulao it was really delicious..each and every grain of rice providing a subtle flavour of cardamom in your mouth...tastes really really good..and mutton also was full of flovour, real spicy goes well with this pulao. But the firni wasn't up to the mark..its like good..can play the game anyway.but those two were really the winner.

Waited for a long time to visit the place and finally we made it.It is situated just behind the Sanhati Park, a few minutes walking distance from the South City mall.
We ordered: Chicken tandoori,Mutton hanglabari,Tandoori roti and fresh lime soda.
Tandoori chicken was damn good and the pieces were soft and juicy.
Roti was nice and soft.Mutton Hanglabari had 5 pieces of mutton and was on the sweeter side to my taste and the pieces weren't very soft.Lime soda was very refreshing.
The place is well decorated and staffs are very well behaved
They have a few pocket friendly combo plates also. 
prices are also reasonable.
Worth a visit..

The outlet is in a bit awkward place. Worth finding for, beautiful ambience with a tinge of college adda in the walls made us comfortable. The waiter were very friendly and made us feel at home. We were hungry enough so went straight for the plates. As starter we started with Chicken Tikka Kabab. Devouring on kababs which were so so we ordered the main course which comprised of Tandoori Roti, Laccha Paratha and Chicken Bharta and Chicken Kadai. Overall the meal was good enough, we went on the occasion of Good Friday. Having such beauties by side one can hardly concentrate on food still in a nutshell the ambience, food and service was very good. Hoping for a next visit.

Hanglaatherium is located in the by lanes of lake gardens, close to south city mall. The ambience is average. Food is good. The chicken tandoori kebab was quite good so was the sheekh kebab. But the galawati kebab was quite disappointing. It tasted more like mutton chop. Overall it was a fine experience. Could redo the place with more wall painting and good music.

It may be a little painful to locate this small shop amidst the by-planes near Lords, but it's worth the find! Undoubtedly serving one of the best biriyanis in town, it is also the most affordable biriyani. Even if they offer combos, I would recommend going for only the Biriyani, since the other dishes in the combo aren't particularly good. Also, try their Mutton Hanglabari. It goes down with the Biriyani like bread and butter. And if you want more, go for the Raita. You will be back with a full-stomach and a resolution to visit again!

Located near south city, behind sanghati club this place is really very nice as a whole. We ordered Special Kebab Platter, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Biryani, Special Mutton Biryani Combo. The kebabs were too good as was the Biryani - both the types, the Chicken, Mutton and the Aloos ( in the Biryani) being very tasty and cooked to perfection. The chicken kosha in the combo biryani plate is also delicious. One more thing, the fish kebabs in the kebab platter were lip-smacking. The best part are the quantity and the price of the food - extremely cheap (the amount of food being sufficient) compared to other food joints serving same quality North Indian food. The staffs were well behaved and very generous. Shall visit again and try other variety of kebabs and dishes. Highly recommended.

We have tasted as well as enjoyed thoroughly, 2 of their new entries, namely Chelo Kabab and Parda Kabab. Chelo Kabab comes with their own innovation and that strikes the right chord. The mouth watering Parda Kabab is another item which can be answer to your search for 'a little hatke flavour.'
Waiting to taste other new items, waiting for more Dimpong affairs.

It's been long since I was looking for an alternative to Aminia where I am kind of regular. However to be honest, their prices have increased bizarrely and quality has really gone down. To combat with my craving for Biryani, I was exploring few different restaurants lately when came this restaurant which was long under my scanner. Hanglaatherium for now seems to be the perfect match or rather a gem I would say. I visited this place today with my parents.
I ordered Kaali Mirch Kebab and Masali Pepsi for the starters and for the main course Chicken Biryani Combo,Fish Biryani Combo,Mutton Hanglabari and butter Naan.
Firstly the kebab was delicious.Good thing was that it was not at all oily in nature and the aroma was just pleasing.
Now the chicken biriyani combo meal consisted of chicken tikka kebabs as starters with salad n dhaniya chutney...chicken kosha...n fish combo which my dad loved it.
Chicken kosha was delicious...lastly the mutton Hanglabari....the dish was just too good with butter naan. I must say this one was the best in the lot.
The staffs were well mannered and cared about hospitality...

Well, the name "BIRIYANI KA BADSHAH" is well deserved!
In a nutshell, I would say that they serve one of the best biryanis in town easily comparable with big names like Shiraz, Arsalan.I will surely be visiting the place once again.

Went there with some of my friends. It was a recommendation from on of my friend....and I was shocked by there quality.... Ordered kababs biriyani and some sides. Each and every item was on top of there line..the quality and quantity both left a huge impact on me....I can bet that in 30 40 years people will use Hanglaatherium in the same sentence with arsalan and paradise.... Atmosphere and the service was also great..there new approach is a fresh wind in the face of Kolkata..... Huge love and respect you people....you rock

We ordered Chicken Chatpata, Chicken Haryali Kabab, Butter Naan, Fish Masala, Mutton Biriyani and Mutton Hanglaabari. Mutton Biriyani was good, but the Hanglaabari was the showstopper. Staffs were nice. The place was not so crowded which made the experience worthwhile. Would have rated 3.5, but Hanglaabari itself can draw another half star.

Tasteful biryani, delicious chicken kasha, and large portions make this place a must visit for any biryani lover. I ordered the combo meal which had 2 pieces of chicken tikka kebab, 2 pieces of chicken kasha, and onion salad with biryani, for a reasonable price of only ‚Çπ230. I can say it was a feast St that price every single item on the plate was delicious, and the quantity was too good. I am a big foodie and I was extremely full after completing the meal. Would surely love to visit this place again. They can work on increasing the area and improving the ambience a bit, if they want to improve the dine-in customers. It seems they rely mostly on home delivery.

This is one of my go-to places for on-the-go Moghlai ever since their inception. Their combo platters are really economical yet fulfilling choices if you'd like a little bit of everything. I used to like them a bit more, earlier, because of this certain strange homeliness in their preparations, now it has become a little more commercial. And I do miss their Hangla Barir Kosha Mangsho; last time I checked they didn't make it anymore. Their delivery is really prompt which is a bonus. All in all, a really nice place. 

Edit: Good news and sorry for the misinformation: they do make Hanglabari. Please check it out if you like some melt-in-the-mouth spicy mutton curry. It's amazing. :D

After speculating much appreciated reviews, I decided to visit this place with my friends.
So, it's not too tough to locate... Few minutes walk from Lord's more towards South city near Sanghati park.
It was a nice cozy place with cordial staffs..
We ordered Chicken biriyani, Mutton biriyani combo meal.
As we waited for the dishes...the staff surprised us with house special thumps up...complimentary drink for Thursday :)
Now the biryani portions were huge... Never tasted such perfectly cooked alu in biriyani...the biriyani was quite flavoursome...
Now the mutton biriyani combo meal consisted of chicken tikka kebabs as starters with salad n dhaniya chutney...chicken kosha...n mutton biriyani ...
Kebabs could have been better... Chicken kosha was delicious...
The staffs genuinely cared about hospitality...
Well, the name "BIRIYANI KA BADSHAH" is well deserved!

Well heard a lot about their biryani before so, it was obvious to give it a try. But alas! We came pretty much disappointed. The biryani they offered was not that good and the ambience was also pretty average. The side dish was average though. I also took biryani for my home which was also of the same quality. Expected a better experience. dissapointed :(

Ultimate place to have kebabs. Noone can actually stop you from gulping!! Well let's come to the review. After getting various reviews and listening to the Dimpong song, me and a friend of mine planned to drop by this Prince anwar saha joint. We ordered fish tikka kebabs, mutton hanglabari, kaala mirch chicken kebab (special mention) and chicken biriyani. The kebabs are simply lip smacking. Mutton hanglabari is something that they are known for. So try to have it if you are a mutton frenzy! But something that surprised me is the kaala mirch chicken kebab. It's awesome! Just go and grab 'em all! I would love to visit this place again to try out the other hidden kebabs!

First thing first, biriyani, awwwwhhhmmm, it's great. We ordered mutton biriyani, mutton hanglabari, chicken pasinda gravy, tandoori roti and lacha paratha. The quality and taste of the food is on the better side, biriyani is simply delicious certainly among one of the best in city, mutton hanglabari their signature dish just too good, it's a must try. The quantity of all the food is ample. But the chicken pasinda was quite average and lacha paratha was miserable, really it's nothing better than a oily papad. But the other dishes were simply mouthwatering and pocket friendly.
The ambience is decorative, eye-catching for youths, a huge thumbs up for this. The staff is very cordial. So, if you wanna go for a full Indian extravaganza without spending much, this is the place, my friend.@

Me and some of my friends went to this restaurant last week as one of my friend recommended me this restaurant. We had special chicken biryani combo meals which had chicken tikka kebab and chicken pasanda but in the menu it was given chicken chap,but they told us they will give chicken pasanda instead of chicken chap.And it was not a big deal for us because it taste good along with the chicken tikka kebab which I liked the most.But personally I felt the biryani just okay and it was not so special for me.The quantity was good.And before that we ordered chicken reshmi kabab which I didn't liked it so much as It was bit charred to me.
Overall the experience was good and the behaviour was courteous.

After hustle and bustle in the university, we felt a sudden urge of Biryani craving. So, we decided to go here which was there for long time ¬†in my wishlist. It is situated just behind the Sanhati Park, a few minutes walking distance from the South City. We were there at about 4 pm which was ¬†a quite odd time to have your lunch. So. the restaurant was all empty. It is basically a house converted into a restaurant. The walls were decorated with film posters and dim light was giving a dishy ambiance. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
¬†¬† ¬†We ordered :
Hanglaatherium Special Kebab Platter
Mutton Biryani
Chicken Biryani
Fish Biryani
Mutton Hanglabari
Keshari Firni
¬† ¬†The platter contained 8 kebabs of different types like chicken reshmi kebab, chicken tikka kebab, fish kebab. The kebabs were really sumptuous and gave tantalising taste to our taste buds.
The taste of the mutton,chicken and fish biryani was okayish type. The staffs told us they had used Basa fish in the ¬†Fish biryani. But we were highly disappointed of the quantity of the biryanis which were not even close to satisfy one person.¬†
Mutton Hanglabari had 5 pieces of mutton and was quite delicious with soft ¬†muttons pieces.¬†
Keshari firni was a total disaster. Even a butterscotch ice-cream could have tasted better.¬†
The staffs were courteous and prompt though.
But they even charged a service tax of ¬†5.6% on the bill which we thought was not expected from a restaurant like this.¬†
Ambiance: 3/5
Decor: 3/5
Food Quality: 3/5
Food Quantity: 2.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
We went there with high expectations but Hanglaatherium completely frustated us and there's nothing special about this restaurant.

After a busy day in university, we decided to go somewhere to have some food but in low budget... searching about nearby restaurants I found about Hanglaatherium... It's a small outlet at prince anwar shah road opposite of South City Mall... It was almost empty when we visited... The decoration is ok... it's a small restaurant in a ground floor of a house and mainly for takeaway...
Now talking about food, we had

Hanglaatherium Special Kebab Platter
Chicken Biriyani
Mutton Biriyani
Fish Biriyani
Mutton Hanglabari
Keshari Firni

Special platter had total 8 kebabs of 3-4 types...Taste of kebabs was really good...
Biriyanis were ok... but quantity was not sufficient for one people! Fish Biriyani was good and they said that it was made with Basa Fish (type of catfish)...
Mutton Hanglabari was best among all dishes & the gravy felt quite good in our taste buds... But Firni was not so good...
Service was prompt... Overall It's a good restaurant in low budget if a sudden crave about Biriyani appears...
But we were disappointed about the quantity of Biriyani and taste of Firni...
and in this small outlet and normal food 5.6% tax is not expected...
#For a sudden hunger or to take away...

So it was a beautiful rainy afternoon when we visited Hanglaatherium yesterday .The decor is decent with very nice posters on red walls.Ranging from The Beatles to Heerak Rajar Deshe.Let's talk about food!:) We ordered
1) Chicken Biryani
2)Egg Biryani
3)Mixed kebab platter
4)Mutton Hyanglabaari
Their BIRYANI.IT HAS BECOME A FAVOURITE. HANDS DOWN IT'S ONE OF THE BEST BIRYANIS IN KOLKATA.
The egg biryani comes with two eggs.
The mixed kebab platter was great. With 3 assortments of chicken kebabs (2 each)and 2 fish kebabs of one kind.I liked the chicken haryali kebab the most.
I have saved the best for the last. The star of their menu is Mutton Hyanglabaari. It's indeed the best mutton dish I have ever tried in a restaurant.
Added to the great food is their staff.
They are extremely friendly and their manager deserves a special mention for his cordial and warm behaviour.
They also have a new anthem for the restaurant called the 'Dimpong Song' which was playing in the restaurant.
Very catchy!:)
Considering the fact that this place is really picket friendly too,it is
A MUST VISIT.

I ordered chicken biriyani combo, with kebabs and chicken kosha, tandoori roti and chicken bharta. Biriyani was okay, good quantity, average in taste. Kebabs were fine, a bit charred, but was juicy from inside. I took a parcel from here, so having food here might be a better option as it will be served hot. The tandoori roti was soft and the chicken bharta was delicious. The location of Hanglatherium is good with close proximity to south city mall.

I was quite familiar with their preparation of biryani(specially mutton biryani) because I use to stay very near to their Fern road branch in Gariahat. But it was kind of disappointing ¬†for me to have their biryani yesterday.                                                   I would not argue with the fact that they have sufficient amount of rice cooked to perfection with not-so-heavily-aromatic ingredients (which absolutely good for me !).Well the bone of contention (pun pun !!) was their mutton piece which kind of was not satisfactory .Specially the size and the taste, but that mutton was perfectly tender and was a succulent piece of meat. I would still insist to the management to look after the meat pieces b'coz they make Hanglatherium a tad different from others :)

Dream came true but bad experience..
let's start from the ambiance full of red and simple which I liked it especially red and white balloons..
Food we ordered:
*fresh lime soda - it's was sweet and salty refreshing.
*chicken tandoori half plate- small piece,tasteless because it was burnt, lemon not served with tandoori..
*mutton biriyani combo( 1 plate mutton biriyani with potato, 2 chicken kebabs,chicken kasa 2 piece,salad and green chutney) - it was not biriyani it was sweet polao quality is poor of rice, chicken kebab was bitter in taste due to heavy masala and it was burnt.
*salad if it's a Indian dish I believe we don't serve Capsicum as salad üòíüòí
Manager is good and their staff..
Can't recommend.@dhruv

This place! I am in love with it. Right from the cute,simple decor till the yummy food along with the gregarious staff and pleasing hospitality, Hanglaatherium, though a bit difficult to locate, is a must visit place for every foodie. Cool place to hang out with friends, your loved ones, and click lots of pictures. The food arrives without much delay. We were four people, we ordered a bengali pulao,egg kosha, mutton biryani combo, kulcha, and chicken kosha. The bengali pulao and egg kosha combo is delicious. The gravy of egg kosha, perfectly cooked eggs and the authenticity of typical sweet spicy bengali pulao won my heart. The well prepared masala kulcha, the spicy buttery chicken kosha also go well with each other. The mutton biryani combo is value for money platter with quality biryani served. You will be impressed by this place undoubtedly. Do visit this place.

They called us after 10 minutes.we ordered mutton biriyani combo, mutton biriyani, reshmi kebab (chicken), and masala coke.unfourtunately they gave us chicken biriyani instead of mutton biriyani.. mistake happens- not a big issue¬†
. they later changed the item .
¬†now the food quality
¬†mutton biriyani- one of the best biriyani in town r8 now. 

kebabs- damn good. pieces were soft .

After a sumptuous meal, who likes to be honked at by hundred cars heading at you from all directions?One can actually eat like a horse and take a breath of fresh air when he steps out.The food was excellent so compliments to the chef! I personally enjoyed the mutton biryani.Even a little under cooked or over cooked actually leaves me feeling nauseating. There was that sweet guy waiting on us who was very helpful with the choice of main course to be paired with the various entrees.I get tired at times eating; their special soft drink was exactly what I needed. It was so refreshing.This restaurant is worth every penny and I will highly recommend to anyone visiting South City to find their way to this really nice Italian type joint in a peaceful alley

Just 5 mins walking distance from South City mall, but located inside the alleys. Good luck finding it without the help of Google maps. But once you find it, you won't forget it. One of the best and most economical Bong cuisine restaurant that I have been to until now. I had heard that their Biryanis were out of the world, but I was in a mood to have some pulao. So we ordered Bengali pulao and Mutton Hanglabari. The quantity was sufficient for a light lunch for two people, and the Mutton was soft and delicious. I'm definitely going back very soon for the Biryanis I keep hearing about. And if anyone knows the meaning of the restaurant's name, plz let me know. :)

A not-so-big place near Sanhati park,Prince Anwar Shah Road. I went there with two of my friends for lunch. The place is cozy... Decorated with some framed posters of famous Satyajit Ray films. I quite like the idea, but the lighting can be modified,as those posters appeared a little bit dull for the red colour.(personal opinion) 
About the food, I would like to say,affordable and tasty. We ordered chiken tikka kabab, mutton biriyani and special biriyani muttton. The kabab can be a little less salty. The biriyani was good in taste,less oily,especially the mutton was soft and juicy. 
Good food,good staffs...go for it friends :-)

Been here to celebrate my hubby's birthday with some of my friends.
Decoration was excellent as I had portrayed them. I, my hubby and rest of my friends were happy by their decoration.
Foods? Ordered mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani, chicken kosa, kababs and masala cold drinks from desserts. All items tested yum and delicious. Chicken pieces were well cooked and tender to bite on. Biriyani quantity was good.

Staffs were polite, courteous and helpful.

We had ordered Hanglaatherium Special Mutton Combo Biriyani which has a pocket pinch of ‚Çπ240 inclusive of taxes. The staffs were really good. Now coming to the main part.
The combo includes - Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Kosha(2pcs), Chicken Tikka Kabab(2pcs), Onion Salad, Chutney.
Biriyani was of sufficient quantity but it would have been better if the quantity goes up a little bit in the combo. It includes 1pc of Mutton 1pc Potato. The Chicken Kosha tasted good but the Chicken was a bit stiff even when it was hot IMO. Otherwise the Kabab was also quite soft.
Ambience - 3.5
Value for money - 3.5
Service - 4
Taste - 3.8.

The first thing that I want to mention that the staff members of this place are really humble and patient. They listened to all our requirements and followed all the instructions carefully. The food is decent and the price is too much pocket friendly. I tried one of their combos. Not really happy with the quantity. But all in all an average restaurant for the locality.
Edit: Around 2 year later I went to this place again and tried the same combo that I had last time. The taste has really improved. Quantity of the Rice has increased significantly, but the gravy should have a quantity proportionate to the Rice. IMO they should reduce the quantity of the Rice a little bit and increase the quantity of the Gravy significantly. Also I would like to mention that that have changed their location and their interior a year ago which is a significant improvement over the last one. All in all good environment, good food and very much pocket friendly.

Read amazing reviews and decided to give this place a try.
Can be a little tough to locate; so we called up the restaurant and they give us details. Otherwise; You always have Google Maps at yoyr service :)

It is a two room restaurant; seating capacity of about 30.

We ordered Butter naan. They were soft and well made.
Next was Chicken Reshmi Butter masala. They give you 10 pieces. The pieces are rather small and account upto 6 pieces really. The taste could have been wayy better. It was a 6 on 10.

We had their Firni as dessert. It was delicious.

Thumbs up to this tiny place :)

I've tried their chicken and mutton biriyani. They make authentic mughlai dishes and yes,they are pretty good at it. I've also tried their chicken chaap recently and yep,it was very tasty. The flavours and the texture are just perfect.
I've mostly ordered from here so always deliver it on time. There arises no questions on quality and quantity as they are very hygienic and provide quality service to their customers.
Keep up the good work!!

Heard a lot about this joint from friends and relatives, but always because of some reason or the other, could not pay this place a visit. So, much out of curiosity (and also to some extent, frustration) ordered for a home delivery from this branch of their franchise.
Without digressing much, let me come straight to the dishes that were ordered:
(1) Mutton Biryani (one word is sufficient to describe this dish - galvanizing - galvanizing to the gustatory senses. The blending of the spices demonstrated culinary acumen; if you are to ask me whether they used ersatz colors, my answer would be: at least I found none)
(2) Egg Biryani (much like the previous one. The only difference being that this one contained two pieces of boiled egg in place of the medium-sized mutton the previous one contained)
(3) Chicken Tandoori (the four medium sized pieces of chicken looked a bit over-cooked; but nonetheless tasted soothing when dipped in mint sauce and savoured)
(4) Hanglaatherium Special Mutton Biryani Combo (the platter looked like a conventional Thali with partitions for the items. It contained generous portions of mutton biryani, chicken kosha, chicken tikka kabab and mint sauce. The item that stood apart was the chicken kosha. The aroma of the rose water - the one that's used for cooking purposes - was distinctly discernible)
The items were promised to be delivered within an hour of placing the order; they arrived within half-an-hour or so. Hence, no complaints.

First of all, the tikka kebabs were awesome. No complaints about that. We were a group of 10, and neither of us were dissapointed. But in the special biriyani combo, the rice was less. Like too less for a proper filling. Otherwise its a good place to eat with a nice atmosphere

Dear Hanglaatherium Team, before I start writing, I am sorry to say that I liked your Kamalgazi outlet more than this one. I have already reviewed about your Biryani. This review is specifically on one of your dishes. Which is Galawti Kabab. There are few places where I tasted this Lucknow Cuisine. I must say that your's is the best. Surprisingly I never knew Galawti Kabab was available until one of your staffs suggested the same. I am so sorry but I forgot the name of the person. But a special thanks to him for suggesting this delicacies. What impressed me more is the way you serve it. The complimentary dry paratha added more happiness to my dinner.¬†
I wish I could taste the same taste of Biryani here. It is almost same but somehow I found the biryani at Kamalgazi better than this place. Decor wise, this outlet is much better than any other outlets of yours.¬†
Keep preparing such nice foods for us. I am sure you will remain blessed. :) Thanks team.

After months of speculation, finally visited this place with friends. We were a group of 3 Biryani lovers, out on an adventure to try out their version of the delicacy. And each one of us were blown away by the taste.....simply put this was exhilarating stuff. We ordered Mutton Biryani, Mutton Hanglabaari and Veg. Biryani. Each of them tasted exceptionally good...actually beyond our expectations. Also on the order list was Masala Cola which was very nicely done. Service was very good too.
But one thing which took away from the perfection of this experience is that they were callous with the billing. We were charged for Special Mutton Biryani when we had ordered plain Mutton Biryani. When we pointed this out they were quick to apologize. Had we not carefully gone through the bill we would have ended up paying more.....so they need to be a lot more careful. Would have given them a fiver....but minus 1 for the experience at the end.

Had heard good things about Hanglaatherium, and T and I finally managed to drop here for a meal about a month back. We reached at around 6:30 in the evening, and the restaurant was empty except for us.

We immediately ordered a Chicken Biriyani, a Mutton Hanglabari and a Butter Naan to go with it. The biriyani was excellent. In fact, we found it to be much better than the degraded version of biriyani that Arsalan serves nowadays. The Mutton Hanglabari was also tasty and went well with the Butter Naan, though a few pieces of mutton were undercooked and were thus rubbery. We had a Kesaria Phirni for dessert, and it was good too.

The decor was minimalistic, and the service was good. Will definitely be back again.

Rated 3.5 for some obvious reasons. I visited the place few weeks back with my friends. The restaurant was pretty vacant to find a place for 10people. 
We ordered variety of items including biriyani,  tandoori rotis,  butter nun,  chicken bharta etc. All these food items were served cold after around 30mins of ordering. Quantity not appropriate according to price. 
Ambience- ok
Serving time- too bad,  they took long time to serve few dishes. 
Quantity- not up to mark
Quality- ok
Really disappointed..

Visited yesterday, ordered Chicken tandoori as starters, it was good, nicely roasted. Then we ordered peas polau and Chicken kasha, chicken kasha was really good not extremely spicy so tastes superb, peas polau was average. Lastly we ordered fresh lime soda it was good. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. The amount was fair enough and the prices were cheap too. It was a right selection.

Not a good place for a vegetarian, but for a non vegetarian this place serves one of the best biryani in town. The rice was perfectly cooked with just the right spices & flavor. Been there during the lunch time, so the seats were easily available. But with this quality of food and the small area of service, not finding a table would be common.

I was here a few days ago after my exam got over & was DAMN hungry!!! Finding out the place was little hectic. I called them up & got the direction from Lord's more. It's just a 5mins walk from there.
Now coming to the food..After having read the reviews on zomato I  definitely ordered chicken reshmi kebab, chicken biriyani & mutton hanglabari. :D
The kebabs were juicy, tender & the fact I liked mostly about the kebab was it's smoky aroma..it was excellent!..& I mind you again, I was damn hungry!! :D
Then the biriyani..I won't boast much about it cause the biriyani was just normal..just like any other biriyanis from famous biriyani joints..& then I come to hanglaabari..ladies & gentlemen, DON'T just DON'T miss ordering hanglaabari if you are visiting hanglaatherium! I don't normally have mutton from restaurants cause I don't like the taste but this was exceptional & above everything!! A perfect bliss! So don't miss it!
Now coming to the ambience & staffs..the staffs were friendly,helpful & courteous..won't comment on ambience cause I took a delivery & was asked to wait outside the dinning area..though I took a picture of a wall art of the area, where I was waiting when I got bored waiting for my order to come so I will be attaching that here. :D

Waited for a long time to visit here as it is very highly rated on zomato.  Also many of my friends suggested me about this restaurant as it is one of the best in Kolkata. I had been in their Gariahat branch in the pujas. Now coming in details about everything about this restaurant. 

1- location- it is located in a nice area although it may be a little tricky to find it easily. But the surroundings are good.  (3.5/5)

2- interiors and decoration- it is a small restaurant having two rooms for dine in. The seating arrangement is good although the furniture are very moderate. The rooms are of red colour theme and the walls are surrounded by many vintage bengali posters which is very nice. (3/5)

3-food- we had ordered chicken and mutton biriyani, naan, chicken masala... 

Biriyani was on the average side.  I think its better than that of the Gariahat branch though the chicken and mutton piece both was very small in size and very hard too. It was good in quantity though. 

Naans were also very hard that it even tough for tear and chew. Some of them were excessively burnt too. 

Chicken masala was good in taste. But as they are giving only 4 piece of it that too with bone. Hence they should increase the sizes of the pieces as with there wasn't much of the flesh.(2.5/5) 

4-servicing- the servicing was vere good., prompt and friendly. (4/5)

So i must say that i had a much more expectation about this place but it totally disappointed me. I had heard a lot of good reviews from my friends but surprised not to have that of my own. May consider a revisit here but hope to had better experience that this time...

Wanted to taste Firni, but unfortunately that was not available and they promised us to serve us firni the next time... üòä We are 'hangla' and we will certainly visit Hanglaatherium again... And we would love to have one outlet here in North Kolkata... Cheerss... üòä

I visited this place yesterday with a friend of mine.. We were really hungry and ended up ordering a lot for just two people...
chicken tandoori for starter- it was good, but nothing extraordinary.
mutton biryani, chicken masala, mutton hanglaabari for main course- this was the best part.. The biryani was light and had a beautiful aroma. The sides were equally good and came in great quantities.
So, to conclude, this place is a great option if u r in a mood to try biryani and Indian stuff being somewhere close to south city area..

This is a charming little place, just behind Sanhati Park. I liked the minimalist d√©cor and clean environment,a nice place for a meal with friends and family. The staff is well behaved and helpful. We ordered special mutton biriyani and chicken pasanda. I loved the pasanda and would recommend it. About the biriyani... It's good but don't expect it to top Arsalaan's. Food quality is excellent and is reasonable. We ended our meal with kesari firni, which wasn't very impressive. However I will surely visit again to try their mutton hanglaabari, which my friends had recommended, but was unfortunately out that day. 
So, good Mughlai food at a very reasonable price is only a few steps away from South City....go dig in. üòä‚ò∫

Extremely bad experience with the service. We ordered three plates of the lunch combo and one chicken biryani. Everything was cooked well except for the mutton. The mutton preparation that came with the combo was almost raw. The pieces were like rubber and it was not possible to even bite into it. When we brought that to the attention of the manager it was met with a general "I'll look into it". No efforts were made to compensate us for our bad experience in any way. He said that what can I do for you, you are already done with lunch. I went there with my family after reading the good reviews on zomato, but I'll never revisit or recommend this place to anyone else solely because of the pathetic customer service.

I have had their Chicken Biriyani which is one of the best I've ever had..the quality of the rice is fine..the chicken pieces are juicy and sucullent..the potato is melt in the mouth and the aroma of the biriyani is just awesome
Chicken masala is also quite good
But from the chicken side dishes try Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala..it is amazing..heavenly!
But what blew my mind was Mutton Hanglabari.it is i mean a revealation..just cannot describe it.
Cant wait to go again

A place which you cannot easily locate . Opposite to venus gym . At lake gardens. Yes we headed der for the very first time and saw a small place which was nicely decorated . So we ordered the special mutton biriyani , chicken bharta , garlic nans , tandoori roti, chicken handi . Though the biriyani was extremly light .N the mutton pieces were very small. Chicken handi and bharta was tasty but very less quantity . Not satisfied with the quantity they serve . And the waiter and the manager they keep poking and stares at your plate . That is too irritating .

Hanglaatherium, a 10 minute walk from South City Mall, is a place which is considered a 'hidden gem'. It is one of those places which have a small but neat space, and the walls are decorated with frames of classic movie posters, like Rubi's Grill. My first time and I brought home some parceled food. Not much to choose from so Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Masala and Onion Raita. The Biriyani is the usual one, quite similar to the ones you get at the smaller Biriyani shops, with one piece of mutton and a potato. You need to pay an extra Rs. 10 for an egg in it. The Chicken Masala on the other hand is quite tasty. The pieces are soft, and they even put an egg over it thus enhancing the taste. The Raita too was very good. Actually great. It would be better for their business if they expand the menu a little. And I'll certainly have to try their kebabs the next time I visit. Food is good considering the price.

Decent place, 2 mins walk from Lord's more, not difficult find but very easy to walk by and not spot it. 
The interiors were clean and well maintained with super attentive staff. Inexpicable behaviour n quick service where each staff kept asking whether we needed anything from time to time including the owner which makes me feel they r dedicated to provide the best service. 
The food quantity doesn't justify the prices though. Even though the menu card says prices are insclusive of taxes, the actual prices on the bill were more. Like Kabab of 140 sweetly became 150 etc.. that was a disappointment plus they did add service charge extra. 
Coming to the food, the Biriyani tasted great. The aroma and the spices were uniformly blended. It was one of those good biriyanis you can have in town and it is a must try. The kababs were good but a bit costly, 6 small pieces for 140...umm 150 on the final bill.
Overall it is a great place and I will definitely go back but I will hope next time their quantity on the place will justify their prices.

An old school friend of mine and I discovered the place walking around outside South City Mall. It's understandable why this place is categorised as a hidden gem. We were the first customers probably that afternoon and were greeted warmly as we walked in. The place is cosy and decorated with Satyajit Ray's movie posters here and there on the walls. Personally, I thought they could have done a better job at it. We ordered a plate of Chicken Reshmi Kabab for starters and it arrived fairly quickly. I did not expect a place such as this, which is not exactly an authentic mughlai restaurant, to serve such perfect kababs! The meat was soft and had that perfect smoky flavour we all love in our kababs and the crisps around the pieces were delicious too. Next came our mutton biriyani and mutton handi masala. The biriyani was excellent, both in terms od quality and quantity. It was a pleasant surprise to see such good quality of biriyani at such a low price. The only complaint I have is about the mutton handi masala. The dish was not exactly a handi dish. It was more of a red curry. Handi dishes do not have pieces of capsicum or onion. Nevertheless the mutton was properly cooked, but I've had better. If only the dish had been named anything other than 'Handi Masala' it would have been just right.
Staff is very, very friendly and service was quite prompt, even as the place slowly began to fill. That being said, it's a wonderfully pocket-friendly place which serves soul food and I would definitely visit again.

Just one word for it...WOW just WOW..!!!It was a one of a kind experience that we had today at Hanglaatherium.The place is located in a lane near the Lord's Crossing which makes it a bit difficult to figure out but the staff readily assisted us with the directions and we located the place within 5mins.Now coming straight to the food-

For starters-chicken tandoori and fresh lime soda,it was the best tandoori I ever had..moist chicken along with the spicy and tangy sauce was the perfect start to the meal.The lime soda they made was equally good but a bit expensive(Rs.50) considering the rate of their other dishes

For main course-Chicken biriyani,Bengali pulao,Mutton Hanglaabari,Chicken Masala.The chicken biriyani was good but the chicken in it was a bit dry,the bengali pulao was tasty and made perfectly.The star dish was Mutton Hanglaabari which had a smokey flavour and tasted like Heaven.The Chicken masala was also very good and was garnished with crumbled eggs and cream,it's taste was slightly on the milder side.

For dessert-Firni which was creamy and full of flavour.

P.S--> A 0.5 more for the courteous behaviour of the staff...each and every one of them are extremely helpful and friendly.

We ordered food for a lazy Sunday lunch from here and it was quite disappointing. They forgot one dish when the order was delivered the first time but that wasn't the sad part of the meal. Not very sure if all the dishes were intentionally kept a little sweet, but that was definitely a huge turn off. We ordered the chicken kadhaai,  chicken bharta and mutton  hanglaabari. The lachha paratha was very oily and very thick to be eaten as a bread accompaniment. And we were most disappointed by the biryani, which we had heard is one of the best in Kolkata. There was way too much gulab jal flavour to it, which marred the complete taste of the dish. 
May have been a bad day, but the experience was not good at all.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: This resto is been like a hide out. It is so inside that a new to this place won't be able to find it. Being so popular here located at Prince Anwer Shah just before South city mall. Frankly i have never heard about this place before but came to know about the popularity that day. Well Known for their food as well as their service they provide here. Reached here for Lunch with family and friends as well as for my surprise birthday celebration.

AMBIANCE ¬†AND STAFF: As i said earlier it too inside from the main road but still looks equally facinating from outside. Huge board of the resto & Zomato just at the door to greet you. Not too big but looks very classy with the red paint and the unique pictures they displayed all over their resto. A very unique idea it has been for this place. Run in full A.c this place is very well decorated neat and clean. Staff here are very friendly and cooperative as well. Thanks to Mr. Pandey (if i remember the name excatly) he has been with us throughout the lunch and managed everything for us.

FOOD: Finally dropping down to the main feature. The famous food of Hangla.¬†
We have been lot of people on the big family table so it had to be variety. Beginning with the Chicken Tikka Kebab followed by Chicken Bharta and continued till Chicken and mutton Biriyani as well. For the veggies It was Veg pulao and Panir Butter Masala followed by the raita and tandoori roti. And lastly Onion Salad and MIneral Water.

Chicken tikka Kebab was just excellent thou i had a small of it but it melted like an ice cream. very soft and smell was even delicious.

Chicken Bharta was on a ordinary side, being brought on the plate looked good with an half egg over it. Very disappointed with the bharta i will say. It was tasting like gravy chicken and quantity was even poor for two to three people.

Tandoori roti was very good. Soft as well as hot.

Biriyani was very good. Taste was Fab. Chicken and mutton pieces were nice and huge. The smell and the color was just perfect. Comparing to Biriyani tycoons like Arsalan and Haji it was very close.

Veg Pulao was a bit ordinary. Too much of vegetables included that made the thing a bit worsed. But overall it was ok.¬†

Panir Butter Masala was good. Panir was Fresh and the gravy was thick and tasty.

Raita looked good but didn't tasted so can't give anything false.

CTK : 9/10

C B: 6/10

BIRIYANI: 8.5/10

VEG PULAO : 7/10

P B M : 8/10

RAITA : NA

NAN : 8.5/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the dishes are very good. The food served looks nice and fresh on the table. Lil worried about the quantity because at some point when you pay such amount you expect good quanity. Prices are ok as they hold a particular name for them.

CONCLUSION: Well A sudden visit here for a lunch was kind of satisfactory for me. But still believes they need to work on the Quantity.

NOTE: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place

¬∞Perfect Service. 
¬∞Perfect Food. 
¬∞Deducted 0.5 for quantity (compared to the price) 
On entering, we came across a room which had an orange tinge and a refreshing aroma. Extremely clean and well maintained. A small and cozy restaurant which a comforting atmosphere. The name (creative one) indicates it's main cuisine is Bengali, but it mainly serves North Indian and Mughlai dishes. 
The lime soda tasted sweet. A refreshing drink even on a winter afternoon. We ordered Chicken Tikka as a starter, Mutton Biriyani, Tandoori Rotis, Chicken Reshmi Kabab as the main course and a Firni as dessert. 

Chicken Tikka (6 pieces) were absolutely delicious, like they usually are, the green chutney that came with it should be avoided. Not saying it was bad, but I have had better biriyanis in town. The mutton piece could have been better. But overall it tasted good enough. The tandoori rotis were well made, soft and easy to chew. We know how rotis become inedible when they get cold. The Chicken dish was sweet. I didn't expect it to be sweet. It was less in quantity. But tasted very different (in a good way) from most other restaurants. I wanted to have more, but it was all out. Since I am a 'Jhaal person', I like my side dishes to be red and hot. I never had Phirni before, but I liked it a lot. Go ahead even if you don't prefer eating sweets. 

The best part was when the waiter served us with hot water bowls for us to wash our hands in it. This is what impressed me a lot. The service was extremely polite and well behaved. They constantly checked on us if we needed something. The owner himself asked us if everything was alright. This sincerity is what sets this restaurant apart. I am taking my girlfriends to this restaurant next month for sure.

Got the biriyani combo home delivered. The kebabs were so soft , the chicken kosha was well marinated and really succulent , the biryani was also really good and had enough chicken in it. The food was delivered really quickly and the quantity was good for the price charged. Would definitely eat here again and recommend it to others :)

Even though i stay at a stone throwing distance from this place...i didn't realise it was there for almost 3 years....so evidently its perched at a wrong place...its difficult to find...
I went with a group of 8 people from office...even though the place is quite small ..we settled comfortably...ordered for chicken reshmi kebab...which i would say are a must...fish tikka kebab...was fresh..and soft..as for main course...the biryani was nice...less oily...but could do better..as they called it there speciality...the special hangaltgerium chicken masala..looked sumptuous ..but was a lil too tangy for my taste...other than this we ordered for garlic naan..chicken handi masala...veg biryani...malai kofta and veg navratan...each of which was well made...
All in all...this place is a hidden gem i think...even though i was highly critical about the food. .special mention for the cordial staff..great place for small gatherings...and amazing juicy kebabs...

I have been hearing rave reviews about this place for a long time.

The restaurant is quite small and the interiors done in vibrant red.

Ofcourse we ordered the mutton combo biriyani and mutton hanglabari.
The combo was definitely worth every buck.They really know how to make fantastic biriyani.The other chicken items in the combo was okayish.

Mutton hanglabari is a sweet mutton item and your tongue will try and decode all the ingredients that went in to making this item and I am sure it will fail miserably.

I was quite surprised by the mannerisms of the staff.They asked whether everything was okay 3 times.This kind of friendliness is unseen in a restaurant where the bill comes to about 500 bucks.

I want to try their full biriyani the next time I visit.

Ordered mutton hanglabari with roti and mutton Biriyani combo. Tasty food and sumptuous quantities made it an experience to cherish and I must mention the pricing which is more value for money compared to similar other joints. 
Will surely recommend for a quiet lunch or dinner.

Another place I was dying to visit, mainly because of the great stuff I heard about it. Must I say, I was not in the least bit disappointed. We ordered the reshmi kabab which was soft and succulent and melted in the mouth! The biryani was great too, and the chicken masala, as recommended by the staff was a lovely chicken preparation with shredded boiled eggs and dollops of cream! The place had good vibes too and one of the walls, with a perfect picturisation of Calcutta reminds one of Mondegar Cafe! Wish I could give it a 10 out of 5. Good food at good prices: happy tummies!

A small joint,a few minutes walk into the lane opposite to South city this place is a small joint with evn smaller sitting arrangement.........But as they say big things cme in small packages...The Biriyani they serve is quite good and almost gives a stiff competetion to the big biriyani joints in the city....the only problm in my prsnl opinion is that the biriyani is a bit dry...bt that really dsnt minus nething frm the tste....Mutton Hanglabari will be an obvious side-dish choice.....and if u r looking for the post biriyani drink Bhurani,u wl get it here too provided u dine in !!

It is small joint located very close to South City near Songhoti Park. On entering you notice the walls decorated with various art and the dim lights give a very homely feel.. We had Mutton Biriyani which tasted very good ,Garlic Naan was soft and Mutton Hanglabari in side dish which was amazing. Its is their speciality the mutton pieces so juicy and succulent. The first timers must give this one a try. You won't be disappointed. The staffs are very polite and friendly and they kept asking us whether we like the food. Overall it was a great experience without any hole in the pockets. Hoping to visit again.

Been there for a dinner on a monday night. As the saying goes they prepare food with love and yes its TRUE. Ordered reshi kabab,mutton biriyani,chicken chap,butter tandoori roti,dal makhani,chicken kosha,lime soda. Reshi kabab had 6 pieces of tender chicken which were soft and very tasty, dal makhani was a typical north indian dal makhani, butter roti were just as it should be, biriyani of this place lives up to the expectations and best thing about it is not oily so no dis comfort, the chicken kosha was just amazing something we find in other restaurants, it was prepared like a chicken kosha without the thick gravy we tend to find in restaurants . overall the food was fresh and served hot without any delay.....service was excellent and the staff are very amiable and well behaved that does make a difference . Couldn't help myself taking parcels from there so that i could rejoice the food for another day. Looking forward to visit again. Keep up the amazing work. ..! Cheers...!!

This place is gaining popularity for their fast service and awesome biriyani. The most important thing is they use good quality oil due to which you can eat without any discomfort. The price of the items are also reasonable compared to other places. Delivery was in time. quite happy with the service.

Location: It'd be a paragraph. A bit difficult to find out.. Take the 2nd Lane at right leaving Sebastian school at the left. Go straight until you reach sanhati park. Look diagonally and yayy destination is found -_-  it sounds tricky but it's actually easy :p we found it without seeking help from locals (and without Google map)

Decor : tiny gem. Divided in two sections. Lovely interior. Homely ambience. 

Chicken biryani - plentiful. Two plates were sufficient for three people. And yes, brilliant taste!

Fish tikkia kabab-  I'm running out of words -.- excellent

Mutton hanglabari- expected it to be piquant. Public Misconception :p. It was not even spicy. Do not let the photos fool you :p
Lastly masala cold drink.
Moderate prices (until we had masala cold drink. 1glass took 100. a unique price beyond prediction, literally :3 )

Service: good. They asked frequently to let them know if we're lacking something..

It Has been resting in my wishlist since a year. I'd like to bookmark it again :) May be someday I'll withdraw this review to put a better information-rich review about their delicious dishes. i want to try their remaining dishes,
It's a privilege.

Visited during durga puja with family . First of all undoubtedly the place is a difficult find.The decor was good.As of food is concerned its homely,not too spicy .The menu was limited as some specials were not available due to puja.Though i dont understand the logic yet the menu should be more for puja if not less . We tried mutton biriyani well its not the greatest but was ok . Chicken bharta was great went well with the butter naan.The kebabs were soft .Mutton kasha was properly cooked and tasty went well with the pualo .The chicken rezala was a let down since it was under cooked but after informing, it was cooked properly and we were given a fresh plate . In the end we tried the firni .
Overall a nice experience though lot of improvement can be made in terms of the taste of the food.Service was excellent.
One suggestion is to put some banners for directions or some sort which may guide first time visitors,you dont want your customers to find it out using a GPS.

after months going through Hanglaatherium reviews in zomato, decided to celebrate my birthday with friends over here. and i feel, by heart, no other place would have been better than this. absolutely perfect for hanglaa people like us!
location: not too hard to locate if one has good access to google map. just follow the lane opposite "solo ana bangliana" and you will reach sanghati park. take left turn and you will find the place.
ambience: no words to express how good it is. the filmy decors, the red walls and the hospitality we got.
food: we had the biryani combos. perfectly filling and the taste is heavenly. the scculent kebabs, the rice... aahh!
price: pocket friendly
verdict: will visit this place more and more.
special mention: the staffs are extremely sweet and co operative.

When I first visited this place in March, I liked the Biriyani. It was light, aromatic and flavourful. However, my recent visits have disappointed me. The Chicken Biriyani I had there today lacked salt. It also tasted bland, because the flavours were not powerful enough. The rice did not taste very fresh. On the whole, the dish tasted the same as when Biriyani does when we keep leftover Biriyani after Dinner in the fridge, and then reheat and have it for lunch the next day. I'm not saying that that was the case here, but that is what it tasted like. The potato too, was not cooked all the way to the middle. However, the chicken piece in the Biriyani was just right.

Update: April 24th, 2016: The Haanglabari Haanglatherium is the best mutton dish. PERIOD.

First Review: This review is solely based on my First Home Delivery Experience via Zomato.

Tried the Mutton Masala Hanglaatherium and the Mutton Hanglabari Hanglaatherium as mentioned by peers here.

Mutton Hanglabari Hanglaatherium (3.5/5)- The Mutton Hanglabari Hanglaatherium was, as the name suggests deeply spicy. I know this is one of the signature dish of this place. Still, I must say the spice was a bit undercooked. The smell of undercooked masala was little pungent and strong. Had it been cooked for some more time, it would have tasted better. The mutton was definitely well cooked. For a price of 195, it was "Just-Nearly Value for Money"

Mutton Masala Hanglaatherium (3.0/5) - The best known dish from this house. It consists mostly of bits of Omelette, boiled peas and Mutton pieces. The broth had more omelette/egg flavor than Mutton. It had just managed to overpower the mutton. Being a dish with a Mutton base, I would have liked a little less-omelette-more-mutton flavor.
This was an experimental flavor combination for me but it tasted pretty good. Obviously, there are better ways to a Mutton dish but egg-lovers out there (e.g.¬† ) would definitely fall for this dish.
5 pieces at 215 was "Nearly Value for Money"

Zomato does charge an extra 50 for packing and delivery, worth their effort.

its true to be a hidden gem for the biriyani joints in Kolkata. The biriyani was awesome¬†nor too much oil nor too dry. The pieces of mutton were so tender, maybe it was exquisitely cooked 5/5 for that. But I expected the firni to be as good as the main course, I¬†would say that was not that mind-boggling. So, This joint is "hatke" compared to the traditional biryani¬†joints due to the young vivacious ambience of the restaurant.

After a long planning we reached the restaurant with our old college buddies, but had an awful experience. We were 8 of us busy chatting while waiting for our food, a couple from the opposite table suddenly rushed at us shouting and houling and verbaly abusing, as in why we were talking. The restaurant staffs came there only to stand behind, and talk at the back. Well they agreed, it was 1st time they faced such a problem but still they should had known how to handle their guests. other than this part i must say the food was good and worthy too.
A nice cozy place for a lunch over some tasty biriyani calls you.
Taste and quality of the food was good..  and we did like the place. But a request to the employees to handle their guests well, because you do face people of this kind

Have been here on Saptami this Durga Puja with my girl friend. Though the place is not so big but there isn't any compromise with the food and service. This restaurant is well maintained with good staffs and service is quick. Now the food,
Chicken Reshmi Kabab:  I tried chicken reshmi kababs here as because I m a great lover of it, it was so well cooked and so soft that it melted in my mouth as i put it in.
Chicken Bharta:  Had chicken bharta which was awesomely cooked with nice spices and nicely chopped.
Biriyani: .The quantity of rice was ok and taste was quite good (not upto the mark like Arsalan or Aminia). 
The staffs were inquired number of times that how is the food,did we liked it or not. That was something I saw for the first time in any restaurant.

loved this place,not easy to find out,in a bit interior part...the search was worth it. Ambiance is great,a bit filmy yet classy look. A small place,but still good one,opened till late so that helps at times.

the service is good, the food is flawless
the mutton is amazingly well cooked,can be easily cut by spoon,very soft..the biriyani is light and tasty,bot very rich..
the food has a very bengali home made touch,
would love to be around again.
price is moderate,quality is good
non veg kulcha,mutton hanglabari and hanglabari mutton biriyani combo.
every dish was tasty and no complains.looking forward for the next visit

was a part of my wishlist,and happy it was such a nice experience.

Although the flavour of their food is fabulous....they should & muuuuust focus on the service & management proformas.

I was their for lunch in a sunny afternoon.... I opened the door & felt quite nervous not to see any waiters around the premises.

Their absence confused me whether I should leave or wair a few minutes....

There was already 3customers sitting & waiting for the waiter to provide the order....I sat on & the eternal waiting had started.... A waiter appears after 15mins... Started to clean tables.... Then he welcomes me with a glass of water....took others order....then took mine.... I was summarily surprised to see they are in plain cloths like us... Usually I'm accustomed with the typical waiter special apparel in a restaurant....

Coming back to quality.....ordered a special chicken biriyani combo...along with Raita.....all the things tasted well.....chicken kasa made me mesmerized.....tried raita for the first time....it was cool üòä

To conclude, the service should be improved....
Else Hanglatherium golf green outlet is all ready to make a new history in the world of fine dining...

Quick service, courteous staff, reasonable rates and the best Chicken Biryani I've had in Kolkata.
I'd also ordered Chicken Kosha and Chicken Tikka Kabab both of which were really good. And the x-factor for this place would be the low amount of oil they use in their preparations, almost Homelike.
Hanglaatherium scores highly for me and is highly recommended.

Visited the place on 8th November, Sunday. We were the only people who were dining in the restaurant. It felt very strange. The staff was friendly and the d√©cor was simple but cozy. There was a 4 year old in the group. We ordered laccha parantha and chicken reshmi kabab for her. On our request they made the kabab dish without any spice. For 3 adults in the group we ordered Achari murg kabab, fish tikka kabab, mutton hanglabari, mutton kosha, one chicken special biriyani and one mutton biriyani. Tikka and kabab were very good, pieces were soft and well marinated. Biriyani tasted ordinary, the chicken pieces in the chicken biriyani tasted blunt, though quantity was good. The star of the dinner was mutton hanglabari. After gorging on one serving we ordered for another plate but it went unavailable, therefore we settled for mutton kosha but there is basically no comparison between the two. must try is parantha, kebabs and mutton hanglabari, for biriyani there are better places in Kolkata.

I heard a lot about this food joint from my friends. Especially they got a very good response of foods during durga pujo,generally u ll not find many food items listed in the menu card. i went there only for mutton hanglabari as i find mutton my all time fav and it was awesome. biriyani tastes average, familier to all kolkata type biriyani house. i reccomened go n grab mutton hanglabari only as take away and enjoy with 'maa er hath er ruti' in ur home.

Visited the place on a sunday during durga pujas! Being near to south city mall i was expecting a crowd at the joint. The place was empty instead! I tried the fish biryani and another friend tried the kali daal and kulcha. The biryani was simply amazing. The rice was perfectly cooked and was not dripping of oil. The fish pieces were generous too. Coming to the kali daal and kulcha it was over the top too. The daal had been slow cooked in butter and cream and the kulcha was soft and tasty. The restaurant needs some recognition! Being empty on a sunday night is not justifiable for a place so good on the food and price.

I had  the chicken biriyani here. It was really good. The quantity was also good. The biriyani was really light. The price is also easy on the pocket. So every body must try here atleast once..they wont be dissatisfied. I am eager to try their rest of the dishes. The only problem that it is a little bit hard to locate.

Visited Hanglaatherium, Lake Garden this afternoon for the first time. A bit tricky to find this place without GPS.

Ordered Chicken Tikka Kebab, Paneer Butter Masala, Butter Naan, Pulao and Mutton Hanglabari.

Kebab was really nice. It was soft, delicate and with chutney made a nice combination.

Paneer was not satisfying. Expected a more spicy dish.

Naan and Pulao was up-to the mark.

Best part of the afternoon was the Mutton Hanglabari. A must try dish. I and my friend was delighted. Mutton was nicely cooked, perfectly spicy and tasted very nice to us.

There service was quick and ambience was quiet good with all those movie posters hanging from wall.

This place is budget friendly and will surely recommend it to others.

The place is owned by my mom's friend but still I'll give an unbiased review. The ambience is quite good with all the movie posters and old memory bringing decor. The hospitality is brilliant they treat you very well enquiring about your comfort and the quality of food and how you like it, if the preparation is ok? They are a small place that is a setback. The food is very good here. I ordered parantha with chicken pasanand. The chicken had a bit more salt about which I informed the waiter and he brought me a fresh dish. Their Biriyani is a must try as I noticed that most returning customers ordered it and I came to know that it is special there. The resturant is very budget friendly, it won't burn a hole in your pocket :p Overall the place is very recommendable and I definitely recommend it.

I have had my meals thrice from here. But those are all through home deliveries, haven't visited their place. But regarding the food I would say really a strong competitor to the other biryani makers. Food is really good. Loved the mutton rogan juice. One must give it a go. The quantity is also very attractive as well as teh price compared to others. So I would definitely recommend Hanglaatherium to any of my friends.

Hanglaatherium (Prince Anwar Shah Road branch) was my 2nd food-stop for Kolkata Pujo+Food Tour. I heard lots of good reviews about this place at Zomato as well as from my friends, so I decided to give it a try and yes I was not disappointed.

Location:

If you are not familiar with this area, then it is a bit tricky to find out this place without any help of GPS. Whatever I think if you follow my instruction, then it is not very difficult to find this place.

If you are going towards South City mall using Prince Anwar Shah Road, then take left from Lord‚Äôs more. After that, take the second right (within 100 meters from Lord‚Äôs More). You will find a park within 100 meters. Then take the left turn and you will find it on your left hand side.

Ambiance:

It is a small place. They have ac. It is a well-decorated place. Different movie posters are hanging from the wall.

The main con of the ambiance of this place is the location of its bathroom. It is inside the service area which is very awkward.

Rating: 3.5/5

Service:

The service was fast. The servers were courteous.

I think it is better to provide finger boil which is another negative point of this place.

Rating: 3/5

Cost:

Cost for two is approximately 500 rupees. Accepts both cards and cash. There is no extra VAT over the price. Only 5.6% percent service charge over the price. It is a VFM place.

Rating: 3.5/5

Food:

We ordered chicken biryani with egg, mutton hanglabari, special keshari firni.

Chicken biryani was good. It was typical Kolkata styled biryani. It served with a piece of potato and a piece of chicken. One can add boiled egg with it by paying 10 rupees extra. The chicken piece was good in size (could have better in size). Rating: 3.5/5

Mutton hanglabari was great. It was a semi-gravy dish. There were 6 to 7 small pieces of mutton. The mutton pieces were succulent. Strongly recommended dish. 4.5/5

Firni was okay. There was nothing special about it. Rating: 3/5

Rating: 3.5/5

Suggestion: Mutton Hanglabari (try it with biryani)

Day 1 : Their chicken biriyani is simply brilliant. I will surely visit this place again with friends and family. The location is a bit inconvenient, but the biriyani served here more than makes up for the bad location.

Their service is prompt and the staff is polite and courteous.

The chicken chaap wasn't that good. The piece that was served to me had too little chicken and the gravy wasn't that great. If this is rectified the next time I visit, this place will surely get a 5/5 from me!

Value for money too!

Day 2 : I had to wait longer than the previous day for Biriyani. That was a busy day and today we were the first to enter the restaurant. Yet it took them much longer to serve us. The rice used in the biriyani was also a bit hard today, although the taste was the same.¬†The Chicken Tikka Kebab and Chicken Reshmi Kebabs were great. There was nothing wrong with the taste. The pieces were a bit too small. I've had better portions at other places at the same price level.

I was extremely satisfied with what they had served me on my very first day, but I was slightly let down today.

I don't know about old days, but elated appreciation about the mutton biriyani from close friend led me to this place.
The number of seats might have increased but, sorry to say, the quality of food is not worth that appraisal. And the same goes for the service. We went there about 9 pm, and mutton hanglabari was not available at that exact dinner time, on these puja days, notable yeah! For 2 full Chicken tandoori they made us waiting for more than 20 mins. Mutton biriyani was not at all over standard, even it wasn't hot the way it should be. Even with tandoori, they forgot to serve onions, and it's good to not mention about the quantity of the green chatni with 4 pcs of tandooris. We ordered mutton masala and fish masala(hanglaatherium special), and we wondered afterwards if we ordered the same gravy with different non veg items. They do taste same almost and not at all spicy, then why do they name it masala? The mutton tasted a bit sour due to curd in the gravy, and surprisingly and annoyingly sweet! I admit that it may be my personal taste, but why 'masala' then?
The quality of mutton in the biriyani was good and it was tasty. The stuffs behaved well and apologized couple of times for our inconvenience. But can that complement the food? Whatever, for a good rising restaurant, puja days' service shouldn't differ from other days(even the place was not at all crowded). Hope they will snap a good review from me in the 2nd chance...

Absolutely delightful Mughlai experience.

It is commendable how their food is not too oily or heavy yet so so tasty.

We had two chicken dishes. Chicken pasanda was good. Chicken bharta was amazing! Biryani was light and perfectly-cooked.¬†
The Raita was the best one I've ever tasted,just that it had an excess of onion. Otherwise it was great.

Service is good and the decor is very chic,the red colour enhancing the charm of the place. Plus points for the quirky cartoon on one of the walls which adds a touch of Bangali-ness to it,a lot like our Anandabazar Patrika cartoons.

Great start to the Pujos! :D

When your stomach craves for some good delicious food after some tiresome shopping restaurant's such as Hanglatherium serves your purpose. 
Needless to say Mutton Hanglabari along with Mutton Biryani did serve that purpose. 
Mutton Hanglabari stands out to be one perfect dish for me. Loved the food to the core! :)

Came across this little gem a few weeks back. My friend and I were having terrible biriyani cravings and needed to find a new place nearby. And we incidentally came across this place and decided to give it a go.
I really loved the ambience, a cozy environment with some brilliant posters on the wall, it was quite lovely.
We ordered mutton biriyani, mutton kasha and mutton do piyaza.
The biriyani was good, definitely not Arsalan or Aminia level good, but it was fine. The mutton pieces were juicy and real soft. The kasha tasted good, very well done and soothing to your taste buds. The do piyaza was little disappointing as it turned out to be a hotch potch of flavours which didn't compliment each other very well. They could improve on that.
It was a good meal. And quite light on the pockets. And the portions were quite a lot and very filling.
I saw that they also serve combos which I plan to check out sometime soon.
A must try for biriyani lovers.

You ask for anything apart from Biryani, it's either not there or not possible now. Even if they have it, it's not good enough. The kababs were under cooked, couldn't differentiate between reshmi kabab & 'tikka' (strange) their insides were pink or sometimes red. It's not the kind of restaurant you'd want to go for a celebration it's the today-i-don't-want-to-cook-let's-eat-out kind of restaurant. It's ok (not good).

If you're in love with the oh so deli ious Kolkata biryani, you can't really go wrong with this place. The service is excellent and even the home deliveries are on time(which are quite rare for other home delivery joints). The one thing that stands out of amongst all other dishes is the mutton hanglabadi. It literally provided me with a whole new perception of mutton dishes.

Tiny place in a lane opposite Sholo Ana Bangali on PAShah Road. 
The biryani and kebabs are impeccable. 
Good food at an inexpensive price. 
I would suggest the non-veg biryani combo to have a bite of all that the restaurant has to offer. 
Ambience is nice, homely. The staff are polite and very helpful. Just that the place is doused in red light. Not pleasant.

I was very frequent to Hangla's previous outlet located at Jodhpur park. After they've shifted to Lake gardens I'm not that frequent nowadays I occasionally order for home delivery. Well unlike the previous outlet which was mainly a take away joint, now they've place to dine in. The restaurant is very well decorated. Now let's come to the food part, Hangla's Biriyani is not so oily yet so tasty and it goes best with Mutton hanglabari.( I've mentioned about food broadly in my last review and quality and taste has remained same) I know few of their staffs personally, they're very polite and service is also quick.

Ambience - 3/5. 
Food - 4/5. 
Staff behavior - 4/5. 

Starting with ambience the though it's hard to find this place is well decor with red walls and paintings but very small in terms of restaurants is concern. Outer room is not furnished with A. C though you'll get the same facility inside.

Move on to the main part that is food. I had ordered full plate tandoori chicken which is nice and tender. Fish Tikka kebab is also good but very less amount of flavor you find in it. Their speciality mutton hanglabari is good with Lachha paratha and firni in desert is icing on the cake which is good in taste as well.

Behavior - They are just masters in this part. Each and every employee is very much concerns in this part. They are always asking from you about the food quality. Though all the items in the menu is not available they overcome this part with their behavior and helpfulness.
I have heard a lot about their Biryani's so I am looking forward to discover that as well very soon.

This is our first visit in Hanglatherium. This restaurant is nearly 5 mins away from south city mall but finding it is little bit tricky. Place is very small but well maintained. Only 8 tables in total. We ordered butter tandoori roti, chicken biriyani and chicken bharta first. Later I asked them to add Reshmi Kebab but they served Chicken Reshmi butter masala, they keep saying that I told him butter masala instead of Kebab.
Biriyani taste is very good, as well as roti. I found chicken bharta is somewhere different in here which is very likable. Last but not the least all prices are vat included you have to pay 5% service tax only so it's pocket friendly also. 
I'm giving the 4/5 only for the food they served, nothing else.

I went to Hanglatherium this Saturday with a friend. I had planned a visit since opening of this outlet because I know that this would be the place where I might rate a perfect 5. When I consider the overall package.. This place deserves a perfect 5.¬†
Ambiance is simple, neat and reflected the character of the city. . The behavior of staff was homely. We ordered for one Nan, One Mutton Hanglabari full, One Special Mutton biryani (with 2 pcs). I also took one kebab platter and one mutton biryani for take-away, The mutton in the biryani was soft and the piece was chunky. I would rate this biryani better than most of the so called old names in the trade.. Mutton hanglabari is the signature dish of Hanglatherium, Kebab was also good. I paid just about Rs900/- for all this. Hanglatherium leads in value for money¬†
Long live Hanglatherium, May their efforts spread through the city and beyond..

Zomato recommended this place to us and it did surprise us, in a good way :) We played safe and ordered the biryani combo and it was worth every penny! Well, apart from the fact that it was really affordable, the combo is more than enough for a single person and i simply love those places who offer more than you expect ^_^ I had a small dinner gathering of 10-12 people and was more than happy to get help from Hanglaatherium. They pack the plates so efficiently that you need not worry about anything.. jus open up and dive !¬†
Keep up the good work guys!

P.S - kebabs can be a little more juicy.

Someone told me this restaurant is good for Mughlai dishes. This outlet is very nearby from my workplace. When I reach in there, it iwas a very small place for having food. I took the parcel from here. I ordered one Mutton Biriyani combo which includes 2 pieces of Chicken Tikka Kebab and a portion of Chicken Pasinda then one normal Mutton Biriyani and one Mutton Hanglabari which is a Hanglatherium special dish. I am totally impressed with the food packing. The way the pack, there is a no chance to damage the food during the journey. This kind of packing I never seen in Kolkata restaurants. Next the food taste. Biriyani was good, but not the best, I thought It taste a little bit dry, maybe due to the food parcel or not. Chicken Tikka was good in taste also Mutton Hanglabari. This is a really special dish. Chicken pasinda is normal taste, Overall is good and I really enjoy the food.¬†

Food: 4/5

Pricing: 4/5

Service: 4/5

Ambiance: not applicable for parcel.

After a long wait.... We friends decided to have a quick lunch at hanglaatherium.... We took chicken biriyani combos.... Kebabs were good.... The biriyani was very light yet very tasty... The potato was perfectly cooked too....The chicken kassa was good bt a little sweet for my liking... Minimal and intellectual decor in red....:-)

I have ordered for home delivery from this joint several times, but last week went their with my parents for lunch. They have shifted to a new place, a 5 min walk from my home. May be a little difficult to locate for non localites, but take the hardship, because you wont be dissapointed.
The place is small with hardly a seating capacity of 20 people.. Coming to their food, its simply awesome..
They have a rare biryani combo in their menu, and having not tried previously, we went for it. The chicken combo with biryani, kebab and pasinda was superb.. But the fish biryani combo was even better. Their biryani definitely competes with the best in Calcutta.
I was amazed by quality and quantity they offered at such low prices.

If you are ordering for the first time go for their mutton hanglabari, its heavenly

Its a small, but gem of a place..try it.

We ordered mutton biriyani combo and fish Banjara hearing about the good reviews of the place. The rice was nice but the mutton was full of skin and very stiff, not well cooked..The fish was however very good in taste.. The pudina chatni gave in the combo meals we felt was not fresh and smelt little sour..

First of all Very very difficult to find this Place. first time we went at 2PM on Saturday . they told no tandoori item can be taken order. mean you can't order started.if you order any things it will take time. then we ask him what to order? reply you can order combo biriyani. then we shoked and ask how will give tandoori items on it. reply we will manage. So we order Combo Chicken biriyani only.Second time we went we order chicken masala , spl. chicken biriyani & onion salad. and ask him to bring biriyan first and chiken masla with one tandoori roti after. He bring all together. then we ask him to get one roti he reply OKHON BOLAYA COOK REGA JABA So,i ask him to get two roti. we are waiting for the roti for more than five min.a lady came to ask how the food is we tell her about this . but no positive reply ..
The food was very good. as i use had the food at gariahat branch . that place is small so we go to this place as i stay in new alipore So for me is both are same distances. the people are in gariahat. they are very good. the dada at the counter he is very good.i can give gariahat counter 4.0

Since I got my order home delivered, so couldn't get to feel the ambience of the place. My order consisted of Tandoori Roti & Chicken Do Piyaza. The food though visually appealing lacked flavor and was bit on the sweeter side than to my liking. I have had better tasting version of the same dish at other joints. All in all, it was a neither good nor bad kind of an experience.

Hanglaatherium in short: Nice, cozy place offering Mughlai dishes at a reasonable price.We ordered Reshmi Chicken Kabab for starter, and really liked it. Soft and juicy chicken pieces (no complaints size-wise), served with green chatni and salad.

Next, we wanted to try two special Hanglaatherium special dishes- sweet lachha parantha and mutton hanglabari. I personally didn't like the sweet parantha much, though the mutton pieces in the hanglabari was perfectly cooked, and it tasted quite different.

The next thing we ordered is the thing they're famous for- the biriyani. It was less spicy and less oily, yet not dry. That light aroma is definitely something I look for in Biriyani- not too rich and not completely blunt.¬†

Firni was good, could have been a bit more sweet though- personal opinion.¬†

This place definitely serves some good food as already mentioned by fellow foodies, but not something to go gaga over. The price mentioned in the menu includes VAT, though they charge service tax extra, maybe 5.6% on your bill amount.

3.5 for the food and .5 extra for the simple and cool decor

They have the best fish biryani in the city hands down. The platter was simply out of the world. The out of world fish kebabs with the fish masala by the side. I completed my meal with a portion of the delectable phirni.
Totally loved the food. Service was impeccable.
.5 mark less than a perfect score for the tiny space.

Visited this beautiful eatery yesterday with a friend. The restaurant is cosy and pretty sober. We ordered special mutton biriyani and mutton handi masala. The food took a little longer to arrive, and I have noticed that not only happened to us but also the other customers (don't know what was taking it so long). Anyway, when the food arrived it was a heavenly feeling, the biriyani tasted amazing and so did the side dish. The service was good as well. All in all, I really like the place. Will visit again.

Got home delivery from this joint this afternoon for lunch. Chicken biryani was pretty good, though a little too oily. Chicken pieces were very succulent though. Chicken reshmi kebab was tasty. 
Quantity is standard but I'm not quite happy with it.

This is one of my favourite food joint. Pocket friendly but the dining space is too small. There are two sections..only one of them is air conditioned, the other part is too stuffy. Now coming  to the food, my patent dish is the chicken /mutton combo which costs you only 200 rs. It includes biryani, two small pieces of kabab, a non veg side dish , a chutney and salad. The biryani is excellent here...not too oily, the taste is heavenly..the non veg curry is also delicious. It usually consists of two pieces of mutton/chicken. Now the kebabs are okay..nothing special about them...the salad is also ordinary...however the quantity is very good...i would say it is totally 'paisa wasool'. The ambience is not that good but if you want to experience quality food then this is worth a try.

So after reading the positive reviews in Zomato , I was much excited to dine at this place. My boyfriend and I finally landed there without much of a hassle bcs we had already made a note of the address from the comments . Coming to the food, I dnt understand what made the biriyani lovers love the biriyani. It was grossly dry , tasteless so much so that I couldn't finish half of it inspite of being a hardcore biriyani lover all the 21 years of my life. Pathetic experience ever. The hanglabari that we had ordered seemed good in the beginning but it was very oily. I never write so much negative points regarding anywhere I go fr a meal but in this case I was compelled to do so.

The Hanglaatherium combo platter they provide is tasty as well as awesome! The Reshmi kabab as well as the Biryani is great. The firni in the end was icing on the cake! The thematic ambience is good and the staffs are polite and great too. Recommended.

We had ordered chicken biryani,chicken achari kabab and shahi paneer. Biryani was tasty,better than biryanis of many famous places in kolkata. Chicken achari kabab  and shahi paneer were fine.

I had their food before in take away and liked it... But today was the first time I visited their outlet near south city... Small n cozy one with interesting decor.. The red red table chairs were giving very zomatoish feeling :P...

Food wise I must say they are one of the best when it comes to biriyani.. I am not a very big biriyani lover but I loved it... The kebabs are also very nice specially the fish and its quality.. I appreciate the quality as they are maintaining this with a reasonable price range... Also to add on to this ... The behaviour which was very polite and pleasant... Additional 0.5 star for that :) I wud defiantly visit them again ... Recommended :)

Visited on 10 August, 2015.

Before Hanglaatherium expanded into a multi-outlet food joint, they had a small outlet, mainly for take-away, and a few seats. Being a resident of Lake Gardens I'd often pass by it, but never had a chance of try out their foods, until last day. Since Zomato is full of positive reviews about this food joint, I decided to give it a visit..

LOCATION: Google Maps gives an accurate position. Moving from South City to Lords more, there is one 16 Ana Bangali. Cross the road, and take the lane just opposite to it. Head straight and you'll find a playground with a club, move around the ground, and walk in the same direction as you were, and you'll spot it.

AMBIENCE: On entering we were met by a rather disturbed person who said, "Hya bolun, ki lagbe?" That was annoying. I later found out why he was a little vexed with our arrival. Going further inside, we found out about 4-5 men, sleeping, lazing in the seats and chairs, taking their afternoon siesta. They managed to wake up, and a man led us inside, into one of the tables. This restaurant is done in red, from tables to curtains, and even the walls. It was dimly lit, and had quite some cool posters.

FOOD: We were told that their kitchen was undergoing a maintenance work, and half of the items wouldn't be available. That meant, they wouldn't be able to provide any side dish. Disappointed, we ordered Chicken Tikka Kebab and Reshmi Kebab, and Chicken Biriyani. The kebabs arrived a few minutes later. Neither of us could actually differentiate between the two. Tikka and Reshmi kebabs tasted similar. The chicken was a bit dry, and tough. Some time later the biriyani arrived. The quantity was good. The rice was good, and the spices were right too. But the chicken was a disaster again, was so tough that I had good jaw workout while eating it.

PRICE: Pricing is very decent, less than other similar restaurants. While foods are inclusive of taxes, they did charge ST extra.

CONCLUSION: A bad experience at the much praised restaurant. I don't mind an untrained staff at such a casual dining restaurant, but they should at least greet those who enter instead of sounding repelling. I went there with a lot of hope, but I was let down.

The experience with Hanglaatherium is mind blowing. Decor is intellectual and vibrant. The service is very good and there is a friendly atmosphere. Coming to food, its awesome. The food items we adored:
Reshmi kebab- they were soft juicy and delicious
Chicken biriyani- the main attraction of Hanglaathelium. The biriyani is heaven. Its is so yummy and tasty. Loved it
Butter naan- they are good in size and is damn tasty
Mutton chaap and chicken bharta- yummy
Firni- awesome in taste. The sweetness is appropriate.
On the whole i would love to visit the place again with my friends also.

The Biriyani is dry and non-spicy. It does not taste bad, and seems to be very light.

But, the most disappointing thing about this place is Customer Service. The owner seems to be rude and non - cooperative. Our friends wanted to bulk order from here to a place near Wellington where the bill priced upto Rs. 10,000. But, they were always Hell bent on charging us with a delivery charge in spite of such a bulk order. Other joints, deliver food for free for a mere bill of Rs. 500. I spoke to the owner and requested her to waive off the charges. But, she was rude enough to tell me that I could cancel the order if I could not afford the given delivery standards, as she had her own principles to abide by.
Long story short, it's not always about the money. I'd probably tip the poor guy the delivery charge, or even accepted to pay for it - had they requested me properly. But, I was taken aback by the way the owner confronted me.
We can never come back to this place again.

It was my second visit to the place and I started loving it even more. Being very new to the city this restaurant still managed to grab eyeballs, courtesy Radio mirchi and zomato. I went with my girlfriend and we ordered tandoori chicken and chicken biriyani. Undoubtedly one of the best biriyani restaurants in Kolkata. The best part about their food is that they always serve it hot. Quality is too good. Price as we all know is much cheaper than the other biriyani faves of Kolkata. I loved their approach and effort towards customer satisfaction. After serving the food and before leaving the place we were approached several times to enquire our needs and food quality. 5/5 for that. Ambience might not be a certain bellagio or silver screen but its definitely good enough. Will I comeback? Hell yeah!
P.s. our bill was exact 350/-. Great guess zomato!

Came to know about this place from zomato, so big thanks. And thanks to Hanglaatherium for having biriyani combo in the menu and that too at such rates. We got it home delivered. Along with it we had mutton kasha too. 

The biriyani was good but the kebab could have been better. The mutton kasha was definitely the winner amongst everything. Hope to oder more from here in the near future.

Before I get in to the quality of food and everything else, there is a complain regarding the location of this food joint. Unless you're super versed with Google Maps, it's difficult to spot it. 

Now coming to the food I had, today was one unlucky day when I was running short of appetite. So I just got to try out a couple of fish tikka kebabs, shared a special chicken biriyani with my fiance and tasted boondi raita. The quantity was perfect and we were quite full in spite of sharing from a single plate. The fish was soft and juicy which made the kebabs quite a hit. I didn't find the biriyani too extraordinary but the boondi raita was a super hit.

The staffs were very humble and friendly and even the restaurant's interiors were amazing.  Can be a bit noisy when crowded though we were lucky to have not faced any such distraction.

If you want something pocket friendly as well as good Indian/ Mughlai food, Hanglaatherium is one of the best option for you.

* Our order- Veg, Mutton and Chicken Biryani, Murg Musallam, Nan, Paneer chaap, Shahi paneer, Malai kofta, Matar Paneer, Jeera Rice, Achari Paneer (PHEEEEW!!! ) My rating 3.5/5
But mainly I want to discuss about their speciality.

*Food for thought-
1) Chicken and Mutton biryani- Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from the Lucknow style. The poorer households of Kolkata, which could not afford meat, used potatoes instead, which went on to become a specialty of the Calcutta biryani. Meat is also served along with it. The Calcutta biryani is much lighter on spices. It primarily uses nutmeg, cinnamon, mace along with cloves and cardamom in the yoghurt based marinade for the meat which is cooked separately from rice. This combination of spices gives it a distinct flavour as compared to other styles of biryani. The rice is flavoured with ketaki water or rose water along with saffron to give it flavour and light yellowish colour. You will find the same taste in Hanglaatherium. Not much oily, very soft and tasty potato, well boiled mutton, and juicy yet not spicy, delicate and divine biryani( ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶§ ‡¶ù‡¶æ‡¶≤ ‡¶ï‡¶Æ ‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶®, ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ú‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá ‡¶â‡¶™‡¶Ø‡ßÅ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§) within 125-135 rupees. I find it better than Park Street.

2) Murg Musallam- Murgh Musallam literally means whole chicken. The dish was popular among the royal Mughal families of Awadh. Ibn Battuta described Murgh Musallam as a favourite dish of Muhammad bin Tughluq. The dish was also served to the Delhi sultanate. And when you eat this, you will the creamy eggy sweet layer on the chicken, a flavourful mince of pistachios, Cashew, raisins and almond sliver exploded in ecstasy, showering bliss on the jaded palate (400 rupees ). It‚Äôs a bit sweet, so people, who don‚Äôt like to eat sweet stuff with Pulao, avoid it.

*Service- I have no idea about the service as we took it parcel for lunch. But packing was good.

Looking forward to come to shop and attempt alternate dishes.

If you are on a budget and good food is what you seek, Hanglaatherium is most certainly the place for you.
Located in one of the by-lanes of Jodhpur Park it is a bit tough for newbies to locate but once you are there you won't regret all the time you spent searching for it.
The food is too good! We had the Biriyani combo platter, peas polao, mutton biriyani and Chicken tawa kebab. Each and every item was   delicious.
Their menu doesn't have an array of choices. Maybe that's why they can maintain the food quality.
I'd certainly recommend this place to anyone who's looking for good food at low rates.

Thus i end my review for now with hanglatherium.. Located on prince anwar shah road, get down at lake gardens, take the left lane n walk for sometime.. You will reach a chai break.. Take right from chai break and walk for few minutes.. You will get the park.. Jus left to the park is hanglatherium... Or you can use google map also... Now ambience, it is based on Satyajit Ray's hanglatherium... All over, you will find posters of Satyajit Ray and Uttam kumar... Overall nice ambience... Coming to food, one of the finest, non greasy biryani you get here.. We settled for one combo biryani which consisted of 2 kebabs, salad, chicken kasha and chicken biryani and one egg biryani.. Quantity is surplus and food tasted good.. Staffs are friendly and attentive.. A must visit for biryani lovers!!

The location of this place is much hidden... Its a 5 min walk from Lord's More toward Lake Gardens... It's a bit difficult to locate for the 1st time... Well, after reaching the restaurant, we were welcomed by the staff, but there were not much staff there, perhaps it was because today was a rainy day... The interior decoration is very nice, featuring various famous movie characters...

Now coming to the food, lemme point them up...
1. Chicken Tikka Kebab: It was soft and tasty but the size is pretty small. But the flavour was very good.
2. Chicken Biriyani: Well, 3 out of 5 of us had this, so I won't write about it.
3. Mutton Biryani: This was very tasty, though the quantity was less. The flavours were very nicely distributed all over the rice, and it was very tasty.
4. Mutton Hanglabari: This is their speciality, but unfortunately, none of us liked it. It's sweet and not at all spicy...
5. Chicken Handi Masala: I didn't have it, but my friends are saying that it was very tasty, and the quantity was good as well...
So, overall,its a great value for money, and should be tried by those who stay around Jadavpur and Prince Anwar Shah... And this is also a must try place for Jadavpur Students as well... Cheers :)

Because of the high rating on Zomato, we decided to give this place a try. We ordered mutton biryani, kosha mutton and peas pulao. The biryani is probably the best I've had in Kolkata. It's light, not seeped in oil like biryanis in most other places. And it's very tasty too. Has that authentic Kolkata biryani flavour that we crave for in biryanis. The peas pulao was very well made too. Kosha mutton was decent. Delivery was prompt and on time. Overall, if you're in or around Jodhpur Park and if you're in the mood for some biryani, this is a place you should definitely give a shot.

I am writing this review a bit late.
Hanglatherium is a place where food is served with care and passion. It has a small sitting arrangement so please dont compare with other restaurants and their ambience. Its mainly a take away joint.
Food quality is good .Biriyani is the something you should try along with any side dishes preferably Mutton. 
Overall a very economic place with good food
Small request to management if you can please make a bigger sitting arrangements

Me and my friends went there for our Sunday lunch...we did hear a lot of praises for it from others..its a 5mins walk from lords...the food was awesome in flavour and taste...we had kebab platter, biriyani, mutton hanglabari (the signature dish) and kesari phirni.... I would also like to mention here that the food had been cooked in low oil and fat but without compromising its taste..all biriyani lovers of Kolkata must give this a try....

I have not been to this place, but had their platter at a friend's place.. So my review is on the basis of their platter.. It had chicken/mutton biriyani with potato and no boiled egg.. Along with two kababs, chicken preparation, green salad and chutney.. Biriyani was really good and tasty, but average chicken and kababs..

~as suggested by a friend of mine thought of trying some Biryani. Well !! The Biryani's are awesome so are the raita's and reasonable as well. Quick Service with nice red ambiance...
Wasn't satisfied much with Non-Veg Biryani-Combo.

Home delivery always comes with a hassle that you have to order above a price limit and then only the outlets will get it delivered but this particular outlet do not comes with such baggages, cause  whenever I  have ordered even just  a plate of biryani then also they have delivered within stipulated time and without any extra charges.. About the food biryani is their speciality and it comes at a very affordable price.. So people who stays within the Jadavpur vicinity do try this place once..

Located near a club in between Lords more and south city,this place is quite a difficult one to locate if you are not from lake gardens..
To start with the decor there is nothing worth mentioning ,however not as clumsy as the one in golpark..

As far as the food is concerned they serve you food which are less oily ..the kebabs taste quite good..the biriyani which they are said to be famous for isn't really something great ..you do get better biriyanis in kolkata..
The highlight of this restaurant is its mutton hanglabari and it tastes splendid...
Prices are on the lower side
Service is quite quick...and definitely worth a try if you are hungry but don't have much to spend.

Located in a very odd place,a 5 minutes walk from lords more, this place is a little delight! It's small, cosy,dimly lit. The ambiance is not something exceptional but their food will just blow you off. Mutton biryani is scrumptious and the chaanp is different but delicious! I was especially impressed with the succulent muttons and the low oil content. Their kawsha mangsho,though not that "kawsha" is rich in taste. Service is quick and its pocket friendly too! Do pay a visit. You'll not be disappointed.

its a small joint (2 small rooms) with properly maintained decor.
 Went thre with a bunch college friends and seniors on the occasion to celebrate the grand success of our college film festival (HFF). ordered 'Hanglaatherium special non-veg biriyani combo'. It was delicious and quite an ample amount was provided to fill all our hungry souls in one platter(each). 
Price wise its okay.
Content wise fine.
Quantity wise good.
Quality wise not bad too.

I am very upset ,firstly they were extremely callus when i was giving the order for home delivery ,talking to other workers constantly as i was giving it ...then they said two of my orders includin chicken tikka masala was not available, so i gave a another order. Then when the order came fairly 15 to 20 mins later ,they gave the tikka masala in the bill though i didn't order it after they said it was finish ...i had to pay more than what i planned for ...then also if the food would have been good i would have not been so angry, my tandoori rotis were all burned ...i have to throw away more than half of each roti ,the tikka masala was not good to taste and the pieces were extremely small ...overall ...i hate their service and food

Before I start writing about the review, let me tell my experience of jut ordering the food on 2 different occasions. On both the occasions, I was told that the food was finished and they didn't have anything left for me. And after few minutes, I was too that they just have 1 packet of biriyani left. On the 2nd day, ended up having a biriyani combo. All the food items were just ordinary to taste and specially the chicken piece in the biriyani was just boiled and served. I ended up throwing the entire chicken piece after just a single bite.

Hanglaatherium as the name suggests is a perfect place for pocket friendly food for the ideal hanglas.¬†

Well on the eve of eid, my dada & I went for a nice lunch after hearing a lot of great reviews of this place. The place wasn't crowded as much as we expected it to be & hence got our table easily. The place could hardly accommodate 15-20 at max. You will get to see many movie frames which would give a great idea of the ambience.

So coming to the food,we ordered the following:-

1. Chicken Tawa Kebab= Although originally we had ordered the special kebab platter but since it wasn't available so we opted for this dish. The dish was prepared in a smokey tandoored way along with onions,bell peppers,capsicums,tomatoes. The dish was fine overall with the chicken nicely cooked & tender but to my liking it lacked a bit of salt but still was tasty.

2. Chicken Biriyani Combo= Light & very maginal biriyani served with a medium sized potato & chicken piece along with 2 kebabs(Hariyali kebabs in our case),chicken pasinda,pudina chutney & onion,carrot salad. The biriyani was nicely made & so were the kebabs but the chicken pasinda literally took the cake. It was absolutely mind-blowing to say the least which complemented the biriyani so well. Aso the quantity of the combo meal is also very good & is enough to fulfil a person's hunger.

3. Kesari special firni= Tasty firni with a tinge of kesari taste to round off the perfect wholesome lunch.

4. Sprite

The total bill came to Rs.680 inc. taxes. The service was very prompt & timely as well.

Overall Verdict= You will get value for money for your food here. A must visit if you are looking for light & tasty biriyani. Recommended place & a thumbs up from me.

Only thing I think would make it more amazing..had the kitchen been located a little away from the eating place.Overall a great experience.

Being born in the land of biryanis, the quest was always to look for the next good biryani. Which brings me to this joint. We ordered home delivery of a tawa kabab, chicken biryani and mutton chap. Some reviewers have praised the biryani as being light and flavorful and I agree. The flavors are subtle and there is hardly any oil. The natural consequence is a slightly bland potato which could spoil the party for some. The chap was sweet and creamy and did not remotely come close to the competition. One can go with a slightly sweet rezala but a chap isn't meant to be that. As far as the chicken tawa kababs were conceded, the honest effort into the prep didn't yield the desired results again cos it was so light on the spice element.

This restaurant is located in between lords more and south city mall, just behind the sanghati club .. Well this is a very small place, and very noisy also .. Their kitchen is very near to the place where you have to sit in the restaurant.. After some time me and my partner was suffering from an eye irritation .. Donno the actual reason of it .. Ambience was not so good .. In fact food quality wasn't satisfied also .. very very disappointed .. Quantity was good .. We tried chicken biriyani and egg biriyani ,, their special Mutton hanglabari and sweet lachha paratha ,, and last but not the least Chicken hariyali kebab.. Really the kebab was superb and the sweet lachha paratha also but biriyani was too bad .. I am not going to recommend this restaurant to anybody .. Fully disappointed..

A tad upgradation of the standard of my birthday treat happened when this week i decided to treat at this joint only. After last year's debacle at fire in the belly, i was quite apprehensive of playing safe this year. This joint as it is was highly recommended by friends. So we went along and had one of the best experiences ever. 
Ambiance: Awesomely indie, good upgradation from the previous dingy shack. Lighting is good, gives a cosy feeling. The posters of Ray's films, beside the good the bad and the ugly, sure adds up to the charm. Result, you feel as if you are enjoying a meal at home itself. 
Food: Their Biryani is highly recommended. Aptly priced, the meat is supple and great in taste. The rice was perfectly cooked, no extra oils and stuff. The kulcha and the butter nan were delicious too. We had chicken bharta and hariyali kebabs which greatly increased our liking of the place. 

Overall this joint is highly recommended. Do visit. It will be worth your while. üòä
P.S. Do watch out for the fresco at the left hand side wall when you enter the joint. You will get to see some awesome indie graffiti works.

The Biriyani is very light and tasty. If you are looking for a low ghee biriyani then this is your place. Mutton Hanglabari is an awesome dish. The taste easily beats Golbari Kasha Mangso.
They also have some love ly combos which is a perfect choice for lunch time.
I hope the add some lovely tandoors to there menu soon.

It was a Saturday that we visited this place near Lords More. Apart from the location I personally liked everything about it. Me and my girlfriend had taken 2 Chicken Biriyani Combo. Not only the biriyani was tasty,the kabab and the side dish that were also equally good in quality and quantity. In chicken biriyani combo they would serve you a chicken biriyani, chicken kabab,a side dish of chicken,and chutni. Within 200 rupees where do you get so much of quality food these days. Guys do visit this place. Yes the location is a bit weird. But I bet you would love the food.

Well it was a horrendous experience last night.I ordered three plates of chicken biryani from the Prince Anwar Shah Road Haanglatherium outlet.I heard it beforehand from zomato only that it was quite famous for biryanis.But after the food arrived,I was quite disappointed.The quantity was okayish.The potato was not cooked tenderly and it had a sourish taste.Even the chicken piece was broken.They are taking 125 bucks but i didnot expect such a low quality food.I really doubt whether i would recommend about this outlet to anybody.I would be really happy if the owner of this restuarant takes a due notice of this and makes the necessary amends as soon as possible

This was on my list for sometime and finally got to visit this place. Only a takeaway counter at first, this place now has a small dining space, nicely lit and AC'd. Well there's a nice feel to it. It's not hard to find as you get down at Lord's more on your way to South City, take left then go to the second right and then turn left. There it is.

Ordered  a Chicken Biryani and a Mitton Biryani combo. Well the Biryani was indeed one of the best in Kolkata, less oily and really well made. The quantity was enough for one. Coming to the combo. Had two kebabs which were well made and crispy and a Chicken chap or kasha, again two pieces but the taste was not upto thr mark, a bit salty for my liking, prefer a bit more chilly. The mutton in the Biryani was really well made and was soft snd tender. For Biryani at least, definitely visit this place, better than the reputed Aminia's and Nizams.

What i really liked about it is that they provide you with hot soap water afterwards to wash your hands, really a nice gesture. If you ask me, i would recommend.

This place had been on my wish list since I came across it on zomato as one of the best places for biriyani.  Today finally I went to this place with a friend. We ordered chicken biriyani,  chicken bharta and mixed raita. The biriyani was just yum...just as I have heard... Absolutely oil less... And the bharta was different than the usual type... It tasted too good.. And to add on it was the raita which was absolutely delicious... The staffs were very good and cordial.... I would love to go back to this place once again and try the other items on the menu.... :)

Their kitchen is under renovation for some period of time now, so when we reached there at around 3.30pm on a rainy afternoon, they were closed temporarily and were in the process of getting the evening meal ready. However I was impressed by their hospitality. They assured us that they would have the meal ready in about 40 mins, so we preferred to wait, and we were not disappointed.

I liked the decor, I liked the cozy atmosphere, I liked the staffs' behavior, I liked the food too. We ordered Mutton Biryani Combo. It had a couple of pieces of chicken kebabs and side of chicken kasha, containing 2 pieces again, along with salad. The biryani is dry but tasty, so does not contain too much of oil. Surely it's for the calorie conscious. The amount is pretty good. Quite a meaty chunk of mutton piece it had. I found the kebab and the side dish fine as well. And all this for only Rs. 200, which is extremely pocket friendly.

Direction: On prince anwar shah road, take left just after crossing Hong Kong restaurant heading towards south city mall, opp of Sholoana Bangali. Once you walk for a minute, you will find a small park, which you need to walk across to find the restaurant.

Overall, it's a good eating joint and I'm looking forward to my next visit.

It wouldn't be fair to judge Hanglaatherium (or what my friends and I now abbreviate as Hanglaa) based on the one time I ate here (during an offer period) but I'll do it anyway. Two of my friends and I went to this cosy yet chic place, decorated in the staple red, on a hot weekday afternoon after much Zomato-surfing. We ordered three Combo Meals and one Boondi Raita. 

Now. Combo Meals included: Chicken/Mutton Biryani, Chicken Passinda, Chicken Reshmi Kebab (two pieces), Freshly Ground Coriander Chutney and a side of onions. 

The kebabs appeared a little stale and tough to chew at times but that is all there is to the list of criticisms. 

(1) The biryani was tasty. The accompanying chicken (or mutton, as was the choice) piece was large by any respectable standards AND succulent.
(2) Passinda was rich and thick laden with the goodness of shredded chicken.
(3) Boondi raita is exactly what you'll need for the "palate cleansing" part of things after an exquisite (and a tad bit oily) meal. It is Raita with Bondey as the name suggests, striking a perfect balance between the crunchy sweet Bondey and the salty Raita.

Combo meals were insanely modestly priced and the staff was very cordial.

Pathetic food.... There was nothing what was shown in the menu in zomato. Please do not go according to ratings here.... Pathetic place, huge mistake. Combo, chicken biriyani = Tollygunge metro biriyani is much better, kasha= the most disastrous one i have ever tasted, salad = where on earth does salad mean just onions n small negligible bits of carrots, chutney = green tasteless bit of God knows what. Never ever would i go back. Very close to my place, still hell NO!!!

It's in-between the lake gardens more, ie,lords more nd south city. U can reach by walking from both the sides, either lords or south city.
It's aside a small children park. If u r walking from south city mall. Then cross the road, there is a lane having hair expresso at the 1st floor, enter dat lane, u will see the playground, at the back of  which Hanglatherium is located. It's actually a house. The ground floor is made a restaurant.
Their best dish is the Chicken/Mutton biriyani combo! Previously it was awesome. But now the quality has fallen a bit. In d combo u will get biriyani, 2pieces chicken kawab, a shredded chicken dish. Perhaps chicken bharta. It was previously chicken chap which was delicious! Now dey hav changed, don't know why!! The biriyani meat is either chicken or Mutton according to ur combo. It's a complete package for one!  Even two people if u add a few roti.
Their signature dish is Mutton hanglabari!
It's awesome! U will get 6pieces of Mutton. Very delicious nd nly 200.
Their biriyani is also good. The quantity is good as well.
Previously there were cheap, tasty kawabs nd tandoori nd many more items, right now they r not available due to some reasons.
They charge 5% of service tax no vat. It's a big advantage. The environment is normal. Decoration is normal, fine. Animations nd frames in the walls

More of a take away than a dine in, the gariahat outlet is pretty small n non descript.. But the food speaks for itself. I used to hate low oil biriyani but hanglaatherium changed that for me..it can give even arsalan a run for their money. Yes, it's that good. The mutton hanglabari is to die for. Can't wait to visit the "bigger and better" outlet at prince Anwar shah!

Went there with my mom. They confirmed over phone that the restaurant is open as I read from latest reviews that there kitchen was under renovation... Ordered based on soem reviews pasinda, mutton hanglabari and lachxha paratha... The usp is less oil cooked preparation... My mom loved it
.. She generally doesn't prefer mutton, but even she liked the way the mutton hanglabari was prepared... Lamb chops and succulent meaty flavour... We craved for more and that was the dampener
. ordered the chicken kasa .. Was good... But on suggestions of the server ordered the mitha lachcha paratha... Stay away from that... We couldn't eat it.. Was very ill prepared... Anyways overall a good restaurant... It is actually a flat turned restaurant.. Cozy but not that great either... Food wise 4... Ambience etc 3

Had ordered food from this joint a while back. The biryani though pretty tasty was extremely oily. Too oily for my taste. Had also ordered a sweet naan which was not to my liking, but that's my personal choice. Not saying that it was bad, just not to my liking.

This place is rightly placed under 'brilliant biriyanis' section.
The outlet is located at the quiter lanes opposite to south city mall.
Ambience: nothing remarkable. Better to opt for take away or home delivery.
Food: I have opted for taken away and availed home delivery. 
Biriyanis are good,less oily with succulent meat. Mutton hanglabari is not upto my taste. Chicken pasanda and chicken kosha are good enough with less oil.
--------------------------------------------
We availed the special combo offer today.
1. We ordered 4 combos, making the total bill Rs.800.(90 rs. was delivery charge! And that was intimated over SMS! Not impressive enough)
2. The quality and quantity of the combos is not good enough. The chutney provided was not the freshest. The onion slices provided were blackish(evidently cut long back,I guess)
4. Biriyani tasted okayish. The tikka and side dishes were ok

Good price to quality ratio. 
Biriyanis/Pulaos are good. Side dish not special to my taste. 

One can try it out once.

Located near south city mall , (you'll definitely need your Google maps if u r visiting for the first time), this place was in my wishlist for a long time. The decor of the place was simple n neat. We ordered chicken biriyani n mutton hanglabaari which were excellent , less oily and way too much for a person in amount. So thumbs up for the food. But the most impressive part is the price. If you are looking for a place to give your friends a treat with minimum pinch to your pocket, this is one place you must visit.

I visited this place today with a lot of expectations nd hunger as well. Loved the cute little sitting arrangement though it was a little bit cramped up when another large group came in. Was a bit disappointed as soon as they told that due to kitchen renovation the menu was cut down to about half its actual size. But still, biryani was always there for people like us. Loved the biryani as it was very light, but the boondi raita was a disaster....we had to mix salt and pepper to it to make it atleast taste like something eatable. Still the biryani is a must try and waiting to taste the other things on the menu card.

A biriyani shop which can undoubtedly be the best in South Kolkata. 
The biriyani is absolutely perfect with the aroma and the flavour and the best part being the fact that it is comparatively less oily. 

A perfect biriyani that can be accompanied by side dishes like chicken bharta or chicken reshmi butter masala.

Serves the order real fast and the best part, apart from the food, being in the hands of such nice owners. 

Biriyani lovers residing in South Kolkata do not really have to rush to Park Circus now a days when Hanglaatherium is there.

I always had a great experience ordering food from here.. I am a total fan of their Mutton hanglabari but sometimes pieces are all bone :( but mostly have got good meat. Biryani is another highlight here. less oily yet very tasty. But the standout dish is the Chicken bharta goes very well with Parathas. This is not a proper restaurant so a take away is recommended :)

Hearing such rave reviews about this place , my friends and I made a visit to their outlet. We must say, since unknown to this locality it took us sometime to finally find it out and upon finding we saw that the place was really small with two tables and 8 chairs in total. We took the table far away from wash basin. The dine-in area was definitely disappointing. But then we came for food so we didn't judge much(but i deduct .5 from my rating due to this only). We ordered biriyani, chicken bharta, fish pasinda. Yes, the biriyani was really good and so was the other two dishes. I couldn't get enough of the bharta, it was lip-smacking. I have heard they have opened a few more outlets with better dine-in experience, haven‚Äôt been there so won‚Äôt comment. But if you could order home delivery or have it take away, then definitely do order from here. They serve tasty, quality food.

Ahh well...I have been wanting to go to this place for long and finaly i went there. Location wise it is a bit confusing. But the place is pretty attractive with simple decor and a warm welcome by the stuffs of the restro. The service is very nice nd coming to the price...it is very pocket friendly ideal for students... they maintain a good quality food. I took a north Infian combo platter which included mutton Biriyani, chicken chap, kebabs, raita and salad. The food tasted good. I would like to go there again. :)

I was looking for some good biryani..not the fully loaded biryanis (read-full of oil/spices)..Found this place through zomato..went through the reviews. I picked up the phone ..called them up ...they confirmed that it would be delivered in 45 mins...and true that..the food was delivered in just under 30 mins. And the food was just awesome ..not the typical dalda or whatever  it is ..that make your hands go sticky..had lunch with my aged grand parents..they found the food very good .overall i would
Recommend this place for anyone who loves mughlai cuisine

I got home delivery from this place once. The biryani is to die for. This time i went there for dine-in, and i was pleasantly surprised. The menu was small, smaller than the one present in zomato. But the food was yum. They have come up with this very innovative thing of biryani platter. I loved the concept. Its small quantity of biryani with 2 kababs, and a chicken dish. Other restaurants should really have this platter system too. Its so much easier for people who cannot eat a whole biryani.

Have a tight budget and you want some good 'pet bhar' ke khana. This is where you go. Lovely food absolutely.  
So coming to it, we took a mutton special biriyani and Its famous 'mutton hanglabari'.
The biriyani was tasteful, good flavors and two pieces of mutton. But what really is worth mentioning is that mutton side dish. That was out-of-the world. You take golbari mutton kosha, soften it up, a lil sweet, and butterry,  this is the best mutton dish I've ever tasted. 
Prices are very reasonable and enough quantity.

This has become my favorite biriyani chain in Kolkata. Mostly because it's healthier food compared to other joints. By healthy I mean less oily biriyani but the taste remains the same. I recommend this place to everyone. The favorites i have are the special mutton biriyani, chicken pasinda and the infamous mutton hanglabari. Very good food at very pocket friendly price. Also for starters had the chicken chatpata which as pretty neat and you guys can give a try. They also do deliveries on and around south kolkata. Overall 4/5.

Visited this eatery for lunch.It's truly a hidden treasure.Very cosy environment.quick & really friendly service.Had ordered chicken biriyani, mutton chat pata kabab, mutton do payaza, tandoori roti & burhani.. the biriyani was perfect for a hot day.. super light..not at all oily..tasted delicious.. the mutton dishes were totally on the money!!! Yum!
Wasn't happy with my glass of burhani though.. :( i love burhani but i didn't quite like it here...the curd wasn't cold...i don't know exactly what it was..whether it was corriander or mint...or whatever.. it just dominated the taste & ruined it for me ¬†:(¬†
Other than that no complain at all :) :)

The reviews on zomato made me go to hanglatherium.It's located just behind the Sangati Club. It has this reddish lights that lit up the entire place.I pretty much loved the ambience..Now coming to the food,
We ordered chicken and mutton biriyani and their famous mutton hanglabari.
Mutton hanglabari was seriously good but their biriyani was a bit too dry and the conscious effort to lessen the oil made them compromise with the taste.Their meat pieces could've been bigger . Their staffs were pretty interactive. I would like to taste something bit spicier the next time I go there and a little bit more moistness in the biriyani would seal the deal for them.

The biryani combo meal is a very good marketing idea that will satisfy majority of the customers. Most of the restaurants fail to bring out such concepts which forces the customers to order more than they can eat. ¬†
Mutton hanglabari is less on oil and good in taste that will suit all types of foodies.¬†
Carry on!!!1

Actually for me its difficult to rate this particular restaurant.
Let me share my experience and let the reader decide.
It was about 21:45 hrs when I called up this restaurant to ask for the location and the way to it as its extremely difficult to locate it without any guidance. A lady picked up the phone, told me the way and said its towards the end so if I tell her what I'm going to order. I went through the reviews and menu card on zomato and had decided to try biryani, so I said I may order the biryani combo. She said that biryani is available but kebab I not, so they won't be able to serve the combo. I replied by saying that I'd take biryani and shall decide about the side dish after reaching there.
When I enters the restaurant at 22:00 hrs, saw a few customers leaving, then I was the only customer there. While ordering biryani, the waiter said that biryani is not available. I said that I called up and have been told about availability of biryani. Then a lady came and said that they have kept biryani aside for me. Now, while ordering a side dish, I was told that no chicken side dish is available and in mutton only mutton hanglabari was available. I was pretty disappointed, but finally ordered that dish only.
The food came, biryani was not something extraordinary, but neither bad. The mutton hanglabari made me forget my disappointment. It was delicious. The meat was tender, 5 pieces served on the plate. A bit sweetish in taste and not very spicy. Even now while writing the review my mouth is watering remembering the taste of it. Then came the shock, I found a matchstick from the mutton dish. I looked around but could see none to report about it. In fact 
After serving the food no one appeared in that room, even water was not served after I finished the initial glass of it. 
After finishing the food I got up and went out of the room to ask whether they do offer finger bowl or wash basin. Then I was given a finger bowl. Next I had to request them for some more water. Then I said that the mutton hanglabari was excellent in taste but I found a matchstick in that. The lady who initially said that some biryani was kept aside for me then said to another lady 'what these people are doing! Alas!' After listening to my complaint. 
Then I was given the bill and I moved to the counter to make the payment through card. Then left the restaurant at 22:30 hrs.
I have given the time to indicate that it was not too late for a restaurant to serve dinner, offering such poor attention to the customers, again mentioned about the good taste of the food. Mentioned the matchstick story to indicate the carelessness. 
So said, its difficult for me to rate this restaurant, still have rated 3 as an average considering all the aspects.

I visited hangla after hearing about its biryani from many of my friends. It was in my wishlist for long and finally i came here today. 

Hangla is located behind sanghati club. Without google maps, finding it would have been difficult. The place was small but cozy. The interiors were painted red and had a seating capacity of max 15-20 people. 

After going through the menu card, we ordered for:
1. Chicken biryani- the first thing which i noticed was that the quantity of the biryani was quite less than what i had expected. Also, the price was less. But when i tasted it, i was blown away. It was not too oily yet tasted amaizing. The rice was flavourful and the chicken was tender abd juicy. Every biryani lover should come here atleast once. I would say that they are next to arsalan.

2. Tandoori roti- since lacha paratha was not available, we ordered tandoori roti. It was served hot and crispy.

3. Chicken bharta- This is the best bharta i ever had. The quantity was enough for two. The taste was lip-smacking. I and my friend were almost fighting to have more of this :p

I had a good lunch and will come back soon. The only drawback i faced here was that the service was too late. I was hungry when i went there and i had to satisfy my hunger by drinking water. But all my complaints vanished as soon as the food was served !!

Although I see a lot of updates and activities on their Facebook page ,but I never had the chance to visit lately. The last time I went there was a couple of years back when they barely had seating. I found all the people associated to hanglaatherium to be extremely passionate about what they do. I really enjoyed speaking to them about their venture and would love to go back soon. Loved their cheeni potota and chicken chaap. I wish them the best.

This place is a small homely place in lake gardens which I discovered through my mom. It boasted it's biryani and Mughlai dishes and definitely did not disappoint! We had the biryani combos and one regular fish combo. The biryani was freshly made and absolutely delicious and it came along with a chicken kosha, kebabs and salad. Every thing was very well cooked and the flavours were bang on spot. The food had a homely touch to it and was far from the commercial biryani joints that are found all over the city. This place holds on to its traditional style of cooking along with the touch of home. The quantity is more than sufficient for one person! The place is very clean and hygienic as well and family run thus has a certain charm to it. 
The staff and owners are very welcoming and one feels part of the family once there. 
I would recommend this place to everyone who enjoys a good hearty meal in a homley environment.

I was a bit skeptical since it did not have a brand name and was selling biriyani as a stand alone outlet. However, i was completely bowled over by the taste of biriyani. Excellent in both quality and price. Priced much below than many of it competitors, ¬†its a complete winner. The quantity served was also good. I would urge them to open a sit and dine restaurant too. Among the side dishes, I would recommend pasinda. Rest, everything is decent.

Heard about this place a lot from my friends and so finally had to pay a visit. This restaurant is located in a lane opposite to south city mall. We entered Hanglaatherium one afternoon to find it more or less deserted. The walls are painted bright red and decorated with framed posters from your favourite 'feluda' and uttam kumar movies,also they have caricatures and photos of retro cars. We were ravenously hungry and straightaway ordered a hanglaatherium special biriyani combo that consisted of chicken biriyani, chicken bharta, two pieces of kebabs and salad and also chicken do piyaza with butter naan. The food tasted perfect, not too rich or oily, neither any remarkable or unique, yet the kind that the foodie in you will never grow tired of. I was, however, disappointed to find that they had no desserts included in their menu..which I am hoping they make provision for the next time I come here. But the prices are really cheap, a meal for two came around to be Rs. 395 which is as good as it can get. To sum up, the perfect place for your 'hyangla' indulgences with your friends!!

This is may be my 2nd time at new location restaurant and 8th or 9th time here. Hangaltherium is my all time favourite because the quality they provide.Biriyani is  Less oily tastes very good. And Fish Banjara is also very very good as my father said. Quality of fish was very good. Earlier I tried pander chaap was very good. Today was my parent's marriage anniversary we celebrated here. Even lime soda was very good and very tasty. I also like cool and homely environment here.

A true hidden gem which you will be happy to "discover". This is what Zomato tells you. So when you wishlist it, you have a lot of hopes and expectations. Ya, its a gem of a place which makes very fine quality of biriyani, but as some of my friends told better than Arsalan. well.Nope. At Par.

Ambiance - Appetizing. Dominant red colours and warm lighting goes well with the Mughlai cuisine. Also the Satyajit Ray movie posters and the wall murals makes it a nice ambiance for dining.

Food - We ordered,
1. Mutton Biriyani - Nice mellow aroma, no over usgae of spice, long grains of rice, tender pieces of meat , well cooked. I definitely loved the biriyani.

2.Chicken Bharta - This is where the things went wrong. Never had this much sweet bharta before. Maybe it could have went with some tandoor rotis but it actually killed the flavour of the biriyani, and considering the waiter suggested tht it would be good.. this is a thumbs down, sorry to say.

3. Firni - I always believe that a mughlai dinner isnt quite complete without a mughlai dessert. The manager asked us to try the firni , so we took another leap of faith after the Bharta fiasco, but the firni kind of made up for the bharta. With a rich, creamy texture and a very subtle taste, with rose petal infusions and sliced almonds on top, I loved this dish as well.

Service - Apart from the wrong suggestion, it was all well. Waiters are polite, attentive. Even the manager was courteous enough to ask for feedback after the meal.¬†

Would surely take my family for a biriyani treat next time am home.

I've been having food from this outlet since forever. Their foods aren't really consistent, but I must admit, they taste good even at their worst. In my opinion, they're fairly economical too. Just this week, food for 4 cost us 820 bucks. It included Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Kadhai, Mutton Handi Masala and Laccha Parathas. If you live close by, have them bring the food to you and kick back for a leisurely night. Afterall, who doesn't want to have a filling dinner at night and still have money to go to work/college the next morning. :) 

Recently, I've had a chance to walk in there. The decor of the place is quite kitschy with all the vintage movie posters. Aside from the delicious food, another reason to go there is this.

We had a group feast over here last week. Although we faced some difficulty in finding the place, but it was worth the hassle. We ordered the Chicken Biriyani Combo for 17 people, which included the biriyani, Chickan Kebab (2 pieces) and a side dish. The biriyani was tasty, the kebab was fine, but the side dish could've been better! The decor was okay, with some classic movie posters placed on the walls. Overall, a nice and cost-effective place to eat. I would definitely suggest this place for its Biriyani.

This joint used to be gr8 sply before their location was changed. Now they are just losing the charm. My recent visit to the restaurant was very disappointing.  The biryani was very oily. The hunglatherium combo was like a very unsual combo with kosha totally out of place with no bread item included. I mean combo is designed such a way that you will end up ordering something else with it. Even veg hunglatherium combo that my friend ordered was uneatable. 
Earlier the management was also good and they use to listen to the customers opinion. But now with the brand name building they hv jst shut their ears.

My (food) venture in henglatherium started with mutton kosha. It was bit pricey for me at that time(as I was bankrupt due to my exceeding fondness for food) and it was the old outlet (opposite to the south city shopping mall). The quantity of the food and the price felt inversely proportional to each other. But again the quality/taste was truly outstanding. The meats were soft the curry was so delicious that it felt like homemade. 

Now here comes the last time I went there and the reason why I rated only 2.5. 

Last saturday I went to there new outlet, which is at lake gardens now, and ordered biryani and chicken handi. Just like the last time I waited for a while and got the food. This time the containers felt bigger, bulkier and heavier too. As I went home my mother almost jumped over the biryani and was really taken aback by the taste. Same thing happened with me. It was excellent. But there was one disappointment. Which is truly a bad experience for me I must say. The chicken had only 4 pieces in there but it was written 6 pieces in the menu. And it is still there in the menu. I don't know what was the reason but I didn't get what I was suppose to/ordered for.

Hanglaatherium is what I mean to be a foody's delight..Super Delicious food,pocket friendly prices,huge quantity and the most courteous and charming owners you will ever find in any restuarant..in short the perfect place to enjoy the best of biriyanis and accompaniments..A take-away essentially though they had few seats..whenever i visit my sister's house in lake gardens we will definitely order from here..they provide free home-delivery service at an efficient speed..Coming to the food:
Mutton Biriyani: I read somewhere in their outlet its written that they "cook biriyani with love",exactly what you feel after having it..fulfilling..I was told that they also won the prize last year for the Best Biriyani in the city based on some online polls..truly a perfect combo of Health and Taste..
Mutton Hanglabari: Some may find a similarity with Golbari Kosha Mangsho,but I would say they have rather re-innovated this dish..light on your diet..healthy and oil wont drip like the ones serves in Golbari..soft and tender,minimum fat,and a touch of sweetness actually made the dish even better..loved it..
Fish Banjara: Another of their signature dish..cooked to perfection..loved the quality of fish served..
Other Highly Recommended dishes are Chicken Achari Kebab,Chcken Bharta and Mutton Galouti Kebab which are cooked to perfection..
Only Big letdown was the Chicken Tawa Kebab..a bit chewy..also as it was pan-fired with capsicums and onions, a bit too oily..
Overall I would request the owners to start an outlet somewhere in North Kolkata or Salt Lake since it would save us from the travel and time to taste their delectable dishes..Highly recommended from my side..

Food:
We ordered Combo Mutton Biriyani. Quantity is good as per price. Taste of the food is really good. Chicken Kasha tastes really different and like it too. Mutton of the Biriyani is very soft.Rice is soft and fresh. Kabab is also good.

Ambience:
Space is very small but they decorated simple and nice. If there is no rush you can sit peacefully and have food. They are very prompt at service.Feel like home.

Read about it from zomato.... Thought lets give a try... Well it was an awesome thought.
The food is good especially the biriyani, less oil n on the dryer side. Mutton hanglabari is definitely a must try for all. The comfort , ambience, n location is great for a restaurant in the medium budget. The price is quite reasonable for the food they prepare.
Students should definitely visit this place.

This place was in my wish list since a while, finally managed to dine in there.  Thanks a ton Zomato, for letting me know about it. It is just behind Sangati Club, the lane opposite to Sholo Ana Bangali on Prince Anwar Shah road, takes you there. If you are too concerned about your health, at the same time die to have your favorite biriyani , this place is a must visit, since Hanglatherium serves you biriyani cooked in less oil. Though the famous mughlai dish there, isn't like those of Arsalan/Aminia ones, I liked the taste because it's different from the regular ones. Mutton Hanglabari (a side dish) is just outstanding. I don't prefer mutton, but  somehow I loved this. Chicken Kosha served with Hanglabari Special Biriyani Combo is so delicious, that too cooked with minimum oil. Most importantly, it fits into your budget. A cool place to hang out with friends or family.

After reading a lot of rave reviews of this place, I decided to finally check this out myself.

This restaurant is in the lane just opposite to '16 Ana Bangali' on Prince Anwarshah Rd. Car parking is available and the ambience is nice and homely. The staff are also courteous and friendly.

I went there with 4 of my friends and decided to order the Chicken Biryani Combo. The combo consists of Chicken Biryani (of course), one chicken side dish (chicken kasha or chicken pasanda), 2 pcs of kebab, pudina chutney and some onion as salad.

Coming to the Biryani, it's 'really' good. The quality of rice is good, less oily, light and delicious. We had recently tried a lot of places in search of some good biryani and after being disappointed with places like Arsalan (pk street), Aminia (Tollygunge), we were finally happy with the biryani we had at Hyanglatherium. Well done guys! 

Coming on to the side dishes, we had ordered the Chicken Pasanda and it was good, no extra oil, adequate amount for a single person and tasty as well. The kebabs too were very delicious. You might find that the amount of Biryani offered in the combo is a bit less than a standalone serving, but then for the price of Rs 200 you get the biryani along with the side dish and two kebabs, which seemed reasonable and when you have the combo, it will fill you up.

My only complaint with the place is the lack of adequate hygiene in the cooking process. Don't get me wrong here, the place, the tables, interiors everything is okay and even the plates on which the food was served were clean as well. But the parcel that we brought home to share the awesome food with my mom, had a strand of hair in this Chicken Pasanda and it was disappointing. This is the only reason why I am not rating this place a perfect 5. Please look into the hygiene a bit more please. Incidents like this is really upsetting for an otherwise great place and a foodie like me.

Overall, very happy with Hyanglatherium and would definitely visit again but I hope that the staff takes care of the hygiene a bit more. That's my only request as of now

Thanks

P. S - Attached is a picture of the Chicken Combo served :)

Well.. being a Sukumar Ray fan myself, there was no reason i can skip a restaurant named Hanglatherium!! Went there this Friday for lunch as my friend decided to give a joining treat.. And the first thing i want to mention about this place is the ambiance! the graffiti, film posters and the lights everything was just perfect to make the place an adda zone. the homely environment should be the USP of this place. not to forget about the staff and the manager who himself was cool enough to join in our adda. now coming to the food!!(of course that's why we went there at the first place..) we ordered a biriyani combo that contained chicken biriyani, chicken kebabs and another chicken preparation and we also ordered burhani and firni. biriyani was perfectly cooked and the potato rightly cooked and soft (thats what i like most about kolkata biriyani). In short it was brilliant. The kebab was surprisingly good, tasty and aptly done. It was clear that the chefs have taken great care while cooking and the love with which they cooked the food was clearly on display. 

In short, it was a pleasure going there. looking forward to visit again. 
tip: You can try it for sure. Its a safe bet. I guess you will not be disappointed.

being overwhelmed by various good remarks on this eating joint, i ordered food items from here (this Poila-baishak) to be delivered to my home -¬† mutton biryanis (which i heard to be famous here), with the some side dishes and starters . as for side dish i chose specialties of Hanglaatherium - mutton hangalabari (quite unique dish) & for starter - achariya murgh. 
¬†now the reception of this restaurant seemed very warm and though i called on 11th hour, they readily responded to my order (even if the day was one of the most demanding) and impressively enough, they reached my food right on time. 
now, the biryani was flavored, light and made of some exclusive rice quality. acharya murgh was equally delicious, but the mutton hangalabri (of which i was most excited) did not seem one of a kind. it was tasty but a bit high on sweet, the pieces were not tender enough and quantity too was not much. yet overall this eating joint seemed good ( basically for takeaway) and prompt service - i would want to try more next time.

Subho noboborsho! Bengali new year starts off today. And as always Hanglatherium lives upto its expectations. Flew solo today with a Hanglatherium biriyani combo. The quantity was just enough. JUST. For heavy eaters.....which I once was.....it may fall short by wee bit. But no doubt it makes up in taste. As always they did not compromise with the food quality just because it is one of the busiest days of the year.......which is one of the reasons why i keep going back to Hanglatherium like a Hyangla! :) And what tops it all is the behaviour and the cordiality of the owner. Makes you feel right at home. Cheers to Hanglatherium, hope the new year brings more prosperity and expansion as they are now a full fledged restaurant. Thumbs up for you guys.

I went to this restaurant with my girl.. Lately I have developed a habit of trying new places to eat.  This restaurant has an ambience which is simple yet very different from other restaurants and it has great interior works specially the walls are just great.  Now the food,  I ordered chicken kadhai, non veg kulcha and butter nan and I must say the food was great and it had a Bengali flavour to it. The place is also almost harmless to pockets since it has reasonable pricing and the staff is friendly too.

No it's not bad..its decent, but not great..
But if it comes to quantity, it's really good compared to the price..
Especially if you order a combo..you will be delighted to see how much you get in just 200 rupees..
I m sure you will finx this place enjoyable, with a good ambiance!!

The much awaited opportunity to visit the dine-in of Hanglaatherium happened on a sultry summer afternoon. Thanks to Googlemaps, locating the place was really easy : walk on the street opposite Roll Momo Roll and take the first left turn.

The ambiance was minimal, with the dining space divided into a couple of rooms having sober red walls, incandescent lights, red curtains, with many pictures and graphic frames here and there. A really comfortable place.

Coming to the food, the Special Chicken Biryani was light and full of flavor - one of the best biryani I've ever had. The quantity was enough for two, coupled with a chicken piece for each. 

A glass of fresh lime soda (with jaljeera) concluded the awesome summer lunch.
Service was quick and the staff were really cooperative.

Cheers to you, Team Hanglaa! :D

My friend this place and i thought to give it a try.Today tried out biriyani combo. They really taste awesome. Fantastic biriyani and chk kasa. kebab is also very tasty. Just a suggestion: For combo plz make the biriyani potato smaller. You can increase the quantity of rice. Rice is not sufficient for single person.

The name is very innovative taking it right from the pages of Sukumar Ray. Now about the food..its average. Nothing special about the biriyani or side dishes or kebabs. Home delivery is good, which is a major advantage if you want to dine in. One might try it if you are in a mood to have biriyani but just dont want to go out.

This review was long pending but I had to do it given the fact that I am so much in love with the food. The biriyanis are real good but the best dish from this joint is undoubtedly Mutton Hanglaabari. And the best part is that the food is ¬†very light and doesn't make you feel too full. I have been to the ¬†joint numerous times and ordered too. Would recommend everyone to try this out.

This joint had been in my wishlist for quite some time. But the previous location of the outlet was quite a setback for me as it was practically a take away. But since it has moved to a bigger and better place on the Anwar Shah Road ( in a bylane near the songhoti club) my wishes were being fulfilled. I finally made it about a week back and I was quite happy.¬†

Although it was around 5 in the evening, the place was entirely empty! But no problem for us. We ordered 2 chicken biriyan and a mutton masala to share. The biriyani was good but I had expected something better, since it has a big name going around. The masala ¬†was excellent though.¬†

The portions offered is good though not large. The prices are reasonable enough for any person. However, there was only 1 man who was serving( Dont know if others are there usually). The sitting area is medium sized and has a subtle decor. Will try to visit soon and try out more dishes, may I will get a better experience!

Took home delivery today, I was planning for a long time to try this place after all the talk surrounding it, and I was very much satisfied. Brilliant food, though I just tried the biryani yet I can recommend it to anyone. Prompt and on time delivery, extra charges for the extra distance barely matter, trust me. Quantities per plate were more than sufficient. Prices are ok for an impromptu order-out dinner. Will definitely try out the other items on offer sooner or later.

This is my second review (although I tried several times in between and almost regular visitor here). Wish I could add a new review rather than editing old one.
This time I tried Kali Mirch Kebab, Dahi kebab, Special Mutton Biryani, Mutton Hanglabari.

Kali Mirch Kebab : 7/5 - - - Just awesome.. Perfect combination of kali Mirch with juicy Chicken pieces. Just melt in mouth. Perfect with some hard drinks... Lol
Dahi Kebab : 5/5 - - - couldn't able to understand whether veg or nonveg.. But awesome in taste. Never heard or tried anything like this.
Biryani & Mutton Hanglabari : 5/5---- as usual perfect...

Note: they introduced few new kebabs... Will also try them for sure.

Best of luck

So...when the manager recommended me this outlet of their popular 'hanglaatherium' after i shared my awful dining experience on zomato in their gariahat outlet,i decided to hit this joint. Was in the area so thought of dropping in. It wasn't so difficult to locate this outlet since i have already been here once but unfortunately due to the long awaiting queue couldn't manage a seat for ourselves then so left. Fortunately today we didn't have to wait and got the seat immedietly since it was almost empty today. This outlet is really cosy and arrangements made very nicely for people to dine in comfortably here. We entered the place at around 8:30pm and only 2 or 3 tables were engaged other than that the restaurant was almost empty. On entering we saw red and red everywhere....starting from tables to chairs to walls everything was painted in red....the 'red' thing is always unique to hanglaatherium. They had 2 rooms. The interiors seemed a little undone to me....2 or 3 framed pictures hung on the walls in the room inside with some odd books on a shelf....a ceiling fan circulated the cool air from the air conditioner,though i think the room outside did not have any a.c. We picked our seats on the room inside and seated ourselves.
As i was very familiar to the popularity of the biriyani here,i recommended my mother to order 1 plate of that. There were 3 of us so we ended up ordering---- 1 chicken biriyani,8 tandoori rotis,2 plate chicken tikka masala,1 plate chicken reshmi masala and 1 green salad.
Order arrived really quick we didn't have to wait for long....the biriyani as usual was totally mind blowing and kept a lasting impression on my mother as myself...the chicken tikka masala and reshmi masala was beautifully done with very little amount of spices and cooked really well,was really loved by my father. The chicken pieces was very tender and soft. Though 1 complaint i do have...the diced chicken pieces were so small that it seemed like shredded pieces to me...they should provide bigger pieces because the price paid here is almost similar to places like aminia,arsalan but the pieces provided here are really very small. They should look into this matter because its the only complaint i have regarding this place.
The service is really prompt and accurate. Even the managers themselves came up to us to ask whether we are ok with everything or not over and over again. They were really hospitable and welcoming.
Highly recommended place. Thumbs up hanglaatherium and keep up the good work...looking forward to enjoy the bigger pieces of chicken next time i visit! Hope you will look into the matter soon...:-)

There was a saying once said to me by a person I once knew " We E-A-T to L-I-V-E BUT you L-I-V-E to EAT " the saying goes perfect for me as that was one the reason I chose to be a FOOD - Photographer (Though i am very Amerture One :P) .... So this was my first attempt to go on a Public forum with my PHOTOGRAPHS along with a small piece of Review of the Place.... 

You think about some of the most memorable meals you've ever had; the food will be good but it will often be about locating a mental memory and taste is inexorably linked to all the other senses and memory, so ultimately it is all about taste !!!!!!!!!!! HANGLAATHERIUM exactly does that for you even while righting this post I am sitting with the left overs of the last night which tastes even better than yesterday .......

There are two kinds of restaurants. One who concentrate only on the food as they do not have the liquid money to invest in decor and space the other who gets funding and starts their food joints with big bash. The decor and feel sometimes evaporates the quality of food.HANGLAATHERIUM belong to the first category and they do not hide it. Brightly painted red walls displayed pictures of The Beatles, The Joker and a famous quotation of Steve Jobs..and it also displayed a Zomato approved certificate.The most popular and drool-worthy dishes - special chicken/mutton Biriyani, Mutton Hangla Bari and Chicken Bharta. After tasting the dishes, I too can now confirm that this is probably the best biriyani joint in kolkata right now !!! I totally loved the sides as well. The mutton just melted in the mouth and the bharta had a distinct taste quite different from the ones served in 

other restaurants......

This place intrigues the H-A-N-G-L-A-A inside you. No doubt in that .... its a Must Visit place in my List in Days to come !!!!

Whenever I heard about potential Mughlai cuisine outlet with rave feedbacks my craving increases like anything.¬†Recently got a chance to visit 
Hanglaatherium to try some of my¬†favourite¬†Mughlai items.¬†

In starters I ordered Chicken Chatpata. There is no similarity between name and taste. There was no chatpata-ness present in the dish. Was simple chicken kebabs saute with capsicum and onion.
In main course went for Chicken Bharta,¬†Mutton Hanglaabari and¬†Chicken Biriyani. To start with biriyani the taste almost touched my heart by considering its less oily and¬†paradise¬†for¬†health¬†conscious¬†foodies. But on flip-side it was dry and the taste is not at par with Aminia, Arselan, Lazeez or Oudh. So if your are health conscious then have to do slight compromise with taste.
Mutton Hanglaabari is their only specialty which is a must try for all. This is fusion of Kosha Mangsho and Golbari Mangsho with less oil content. Goes just perfectly with laccha paratha or even biriyani. Though not being a boneless dish still meat content is very high which was soft as if will melt inside mouth.
Chicken Bharta is also another dish one can opt with biriyani. Again its less oily but somehow tastewise had to comprise due to this.

The ambiance with red lights was a let down for me as this strain my eyes. So only option left was take away. Lesser pocket pinch is also another factor for its popularity.

There‚Äôs nothing quite like sitting around with friends, having great conversations over a delicious meal. Food connects us. It brings families and friends together, and makes us happy. It can be our comfort and also our worst enemy. No matter how tumultuous your relationship with it is, however, food is a necessity. And for that reason it will continue to be a topic of conversation for generations to come.
Came to Hanglaatherium and had an awsome time with friends. Food is speechless, taste and ambience is good....
Don't know what else to say......

This particular place was there in my wish list for a couple of months now until i made a point to go there yesterday and to start with, THE EXPERIENCE WAS AWESOME.¬†
* ( it will be a long review as there is a story to tell :) )
Ambiance - A medium size eat house with its theme of red starting from the chairs and tables and a portion of the wall and even the giant wall paper was all red. Combined with some soothing lights and a few interesting frames was the first thing that attracted me as it was a homely feeling from the time i took my seat.
then came the staff to take the orders. I ordered the Hanglaatherium special Biriyani Combo that comes with a choice of motton or chicken, a couple of laccha parathas and the all awaited Mutton Hanglaa Bari.¬†
The time from ordering the food till the time it came, there was some one or the other confirming if we have ordered the food, if things were all right and all. So that was a genuine good gesture.¬†
Then came the food. We were two of us there and by the look it made me feel then and there that it is so so much. The quantity at that price was way too much. The biriyani combo came with a plate of chicken biriyani (as we ordered chicken), a side dish of chicken as well, a couple of chicken kebabs and pudina chatni and a bit of salad & then came my laccha paratha and mutton hanglaabari. The hanglaabari had around 6 to 7 pieces of mutton which is again at Rs205 ¬†a too much and the parathas were tasty as well. The taste of each of the item was unique and awesome and the chicken and the mutton were soft and well cooked. Though i felt salt was a bit less in the Mutton Hanglabari. Otherwise it was all so good.
Thank you for ¬†giving us a good experience.
* pics coming soon.

Pocket pinch -500 for two inclusive of tax

Conclusion- a good place to dine in. Highly Recommended !!!

See you again very soon.... :)

It has been 2 days to my wedding. We went to south city, did some happy shopping, and then were looking for some restaurant. I instantly remembered this one, but didnt know dat they have shifted to another place nearby. The landmark is sanghati club behind a park, in the ground floor of a colorless building. I wish they could have chosen a better place. But outside appearances wil not matter much once u r inside the red painted walls with posters from Ray's films. A cosy one, this has a comfortable seating. There was not much rush and only a waiter. We ordered for chicken chatpata, lacha paratha, tandoor roti, mutton hanglabari biriyani, mutton kasha. To my surprise, there was no over floating oil in these dishes. Taste was superb, the mutton was cooked perfectly. The legendary mughlai joints of kolkata also serve too oily dishes but hanglaatherium edges past surely over them. Pocket pinch was highly affordable. I would wish them success in future and would revisit again.

Recently Shifted(25th Dec 2014 probably) from previous place (Which was near to my hone :( ) They make some awesome Indian Dishes. Biriyani, Mutton Hanglabari, Chicken Bharta, Kebabs. The new place is bigger and better. A big wall painting in d shop is a thing to look for! At least while waiting for food I watched it top to bottom! A mix of "Where's Wally" and Debasish Deb style art looks awesome! Didn't dine in but looks a good place to do so. 500 for 2 is enough to have kebab, a main course and a side dish! Have a try u won't be disappointed!

If you are a Biryani lover and you also care your heath, I would say there is no other option than become Hangla for Hanglaatherium. Food is awsome, quantity is very good and price will also not cut your pocket.¬†I will surely mark them as my first choice and sure recommendation.

"All Big things come in small packages". This place is giving all the biriyani joints in Kolkata a run for their money. Operating out of a garage in Jodhpur Park the food is a revelation in comparison to their outlet. I would not refer this place for a dine-out but rather for a take away. The biriyani's and kebab's are very good - both quantitative and qualitative. Mutton hanglaberi is a must have. ¬†Taste of food is in general outstanding so they have sorted out the most important thing in the food business, but there is a lot to do in terms of ambience, service quality.

Heard a lot about this place. The decor is neat and colors are used in a very balanced way.
Very homely.
Biriyani is a must have, with the kebabs. Chicken reshmi kebab is good. Food quantity is decent for two people. Veg items are tasty too.
Dear management, some soothing music at the background would be an excellent addition.

We had ordered two portions of a Chicken Biriyani combo, which came along with 2 micro size chicken kebabs, chicken bharta, and salad. While they told me delivery would take half an hour, the delivery guy was at my doorstep only after a little more than an hour had passed since placing the order.
Then came the surprise when I opened the box, to find the quantity of contents. As I already said before, the kebabs were micro in size, and did not taste very good either. Infact it was over-barbequed, and hence a little burnt. Next, what they called salad, I only found to be scrapes of vegetables, or vegetable peelings, and that too came in a quantity which is far lesser than what is served with chops in local shops. The biriyani was okay, again not too high on quantity, and came along with a generous piece of chicken and potato. Would not say it tasted amazing, instead was very ordinary.
The chicken bharta was the only thing I liked in the entire combo, and it did taste very good.
However, I think this restaurant is a little overhyped on Zomato. The food was certainly not worth the money, as you get much better biriyani at a far cheaper price in several places.

Nice cosy interiors. Neatly decorated with smart posters and graffiti on walls. Seating capacity is about 30 to 35. Homely atmosphere and friendly staffs. Looks like the total business is run by an extended family and friends, including the serving persons. Seemed quite non-professional (in a good sense) in their approach. Though when I visited there was no rush, I doubt, if they can handle a packed house in the festive season, well. Their location is quite tricky for first timers. Easier to reach from lake gardens crossing.

Now about the food, I would say quite praiseworthy. We had ordered their famous mutton 'biryani', lachcha paratha, chicken kadai, raita. Biryani was very tasty indeed (second best according to me after shiraz) and very much digestable. The chicken kadai had a very distinct and pungent coriander smell (which I didnt like much) and was too dry to be a side dish for the parathas, but the chicken was nicely cooked. The parathas were very good, very less oil content, though nicely fried. Raita was okay. Overall the taste was good. Full marks for all the items being very light on stomach. The pricing is very affordable and a big plus point to make customers visit them repeatedly.

one of the overrated restaurant in Zomato as per my view. Went for the first time to take away their combo-biriyani pack. The taste of the biriyani was average and quantity was also fine enough;though the mutton piece was not well marinated. But along with that the chicken preparation ¬†was the disaster. As far as my knowledge the Chicken Kasha is a spicy gravy item but the one which has been given with the combo was like a chicken sweet dish. It was sweet and tasteless as hell. the kebab pieces given along with it also was not upto the mark and was hard and spiceless.
Don't really have an idea how people have rated this place so high.¬†
I would suggest you people to enhance the quality of the food to increase the sale and keep the rating high.

I had ordered twice. Very near my place. Ordered for home delivery...chicken biryani,chicken kosha,mutton hanglabari which is recommended by all. Biryani was tasty,quantity was good for the price. Mutton hanglabari was a bit sweet for my taste. But overall good biryani experience since there aren't many good biryani places nearby.

The new location is superb. Well decorated and keeping the theme red makes the place all the more appealing.
You need to hunt for the place from Lords Crossing, located just back of the sanghati club.¬†
Biriyani is less oily and less spicy one who prefers low calorie biriyani will love the place. Kababs are great. And the special biriyani combo is a stomach filling meal one can ever desire for.¬†
.Pocket Friendly
.Prompt Service
.Peaceful Ambience
.Quality Food

Good place to hit on mid month or end month days outings. Wont rob you much.

Recently, we had a family gathering after our marriage and ordered some delicacies from Hangla.

The food quality was amazing but the highlight for me was the Chicken Tandoori in the starters and Chicken Pasanda in the main course.

The chicken tandoori was juicy and had this natural burnt colour thus it was not only a treat to the eyes but yummy as well !!!

Had heard of Paneer Pasinda till date, thus dish intrigued me to try it out.

Well! It was a reciepe for a happy tummy. A Must try!

The chef was also happy sharing the preparation part of it which was highly appreciated.

We all had a great time with great food :)

Visited their new dining place few days back..clean & simple interiors...chatpata kabab was not available..thereby settled for hariyali & fish achari kabab which felt yum..though pricy as per qty served..Mutton biriyani was oil free to the extent..it felt drier to all of us..even qty was avg...Paratha was excellent... But they messed up mutton rogan Josh..which didn't taste as expected....Also not satisfied with the green salad which was served as if we are having at home....service was avg..

A plate of hot biriyani.. Its arousing aroma... & its wonderful colors make it more than a food item.. The word "DELICIOUS" will be too acute to describe the Biriyani out here. Though i had biriyani here many times but this time it was special. I celebrated Valentines Day and with someone who does not have chicken. So mutton biriyani it was and we ordered Fish Banjara.. ¬†The 1st time i tried Fish here and only thing i felt is its the best ever fish item i ever had.¬†

Mutton Biriyani : The aroma of the biriyani and the taste was the best. It was light and yet too tasty. The mutton absolutely well cooked. One of the best mutton Biriyani I ever had.¬†

Fish Banjara: I have has fish in many restaurants but this dish was amazing. The fish was well cooked, the gravy was fantastic. A must order for fish lovers.¬†

Quality: 5 star
Quantity : 5 star

A must visit for food lovers ¬†!!¬†

Hanglaatherium : Food that will make u Hangla (greedy) ¬†!!!

Into :- Heard a lot abt dis place so wanted to visit dis place. Hence visited the place on Vday

Location :- Bit difficult to locate for non-localites. Its located in the next lane beside hong kong resturant @lords. Walk down the lane u will see the sanhati club ground and the resturant is located in the backside lane of the ground.

Ambience:- nice set up.. dim lights. Redish tinge everywhere.. well set up for a grp dine.

Food :-
We ordered
1) Chicken Chatpata
2)Chicken biriyani
3) Chicken reshmi tikka masala

Chicken chatpata :- loved the dish.. tasty spicy and a tangy touch to it. Though loved a bit more no pieces of chicken in it.

Chicken biriyani:- it was good ,oil free and light. Though the chicken in biriyani was not upto the mark in one of the plates.

 Chicken reshmi tikka masala- gravy was thick and tasty. Chicken pieces were small in size but the dish was good.

Pocket pinch -550 for two inclusive tax

Conclusion- a good place to dine in  if ur low in pocket money  or a u hv a huge grp to dine together.

It's hidden location was the saviour for me on Saturday considering that it was Valentine's day. Situated near Lords Bakery crossing, it's a foodie's delight. They serve lip smacking kebabs and biriyanis just like that.Try out the "Achari Kebab" - the latest addition to their long list of delightful kebabs. Fish tandoori was also above par as was the traditional tikka kebab. Now coming to the man of the match - "Mutton biryani"  ???? this was the unanimously awarded the best dish by our group. Served hot with a smile ????. The mutton was cooked to perfection. Soft as butter. Same with the side dishes, chicken pasinda and do piyaza.Pasinda's taste was something I have never encountered till date. Simply AWESOME !! Must try. Now coming down to the bottom-line. It's more than pocket friendly.????

Located in the vicinity of South City, Hanglatherium is a good place for ¬†casual dining. This tiny place is neatly decorated. Bright red walls, proper lighting makes the ambiance vivid and very soothing. On a lazy Sunday noon, we went there. We had the Hanglatherium Combo meal..The combo ¬†had good amount of biriyani, Chicken Kosha and two piece Chicken tikka kebab.This combo meal  is actually a very well thought out and praiseworthy concept. ¬†All the preparation were light on spice and with right amount of oil/dalda ensured that the calorie quotient is in check. The service was quick. The price is surprisingly very reasonable. ¬†Overall it was a decent experience and will surely visit again.

First of all congratulations to team Hanglatherium for moving their anwar shah outlet to a bigger restaurant space.Keep up the great work of offering the best biriyani in town!!! I happen to take away once again today from their anwar shah outlet for a friends gathering. The special mutton biriyani was awesome...the lightest( without any trace of dalda) and the yummiest of all lucknowi/Kolkata biriyanis one can have..the masala kulchas were yummy and super soft,chicken reshmi butter masala was an example of perfect blend of spices with succulent chicken pieces immersed in a not so rich gravy, the fish achari tikka kebabs were good and I guess would have tasted better if I could have had them fresh hot in the restaurant...chicken pasanda was awesome...last but not the least..the phirni with a slight topping of cashews brought the perfect ending to our delightful lunch.Keep up the good work!!!

Okay!! So, it was my birthday this year, and I decided to brought Biriyani rather than going out with my family. So I thought what could be better than Hanglatherium to get the Biryani's. Honestly I have heard a lot, and I mean a lot about its Biryani but actually didn't get the opportunity to try until now, and yes, it turned out as per my expectations. I literally had this kind of lovely biryani after long.. ¬†generally me & my family are Not fond of greasy kind of a biryani with loads of oil sitting along the bottom of your container. We like to have our biryani dry, fluffy and flavorful, and that is what exactly I got in Hanglatherium. And the quantity, oh yes, that's huge as well, I fed 10 people with 8 packs (no there were no kids involved). It was pretty healthy proportion, and you don't feel heavy after you are finished with it, its just so lite that you hardly feel that you had biryani. I can say it is similar to what my Mom makes at home, in terms of dryness mainly. It is economical as well.¬†I wish to try out their other products, I think I will next time.¬†Oh! one more good thing, they now have a lovely restaurant as well, its pretty and appropriate for cozy parties. Can't wait to get to their restaurant.

After there 2outlets, now they have opened a new outlet in Lake Gardens. The place is cool both in terms of location being just walking distance away from south city mall (Behind Sanhati Club) as well the spacious look they have managed to pulled off with the decor done in red and the retro theme. They even have a Ramgarh Times edition framed in the wall featuring the legendary Gabbar and other trivia. Lovely. 
As for the food, well thank God that has not changed a bit. The classic Hanglaa treat of less oil and super duper taste is very much in vogue in all their offerings here as well. We visited last Sunday and ordered the classic mutton biriyani tampered with chicken pasinda. I was a little apprehensive of the last, so far I have only tried the mutton variant, but like a great sequel to a brilliant movie, they have pulled it off really well. It was a revelation in fact and I urge all to try it. Dry and oil free, masaladar, yet easy on the stomach, this is the dish to try this season. 
Long live Hanglaatherium, I am visiting them again. Brothers and Sisters, if you haven't been there, you are leading an unfulfilled life. 
By the way, did I mention they are easy on your pocket? My meal for two including a 600ml coke set me back by a princly 450 bucks!

Had to walk for around 15 minutes to locate this place since they shifted recently but I'm not complaining since it was worth the time we spent in there!! 
Its a small place with pretty interiors,  enough space to seat around 30 people. The food was delicious! The best part... very little oil had been used to make it. Good quality food at extremely affordable prices is something that people should look for in here.
The people managing the restaurant were extremely warm and service was also quite prompt. 
Good food, great service and an awesome ambience... Would definitely like to visit again!

I have had their biriyanis home delivered several times and it was quite good. So when last week I went their with a group of friends, I was somewhat disappointed. The biriyani was a bit dry, mutton kababs were not available. Beverage options lacked basic options like fresh lime soda. Also some of us wanted to have some desserts which was not available. The staff were very courteous and the owner herself came to us and enquired about the food. Overall, a good place to pack your food or get it home delivered, not a good option for dine out yet.

Price is quite reasonable when compared to the quantity they serve...3plates of biriyani and one plate of kebab costed us Rs 525 only...

This is my 2nd review of the place. Now it also has a place to dine in.
Ambience: Nice and cosy with warm, vibrant colours.
Food: The biriyani they serve is perhaps the best in town, keeping the price in mind. Kebabs are good. Laccha paratha is a clear winner. Their biriyani is something, everyone should try once.
On the other hand the green chatni can have a better zing, raita should be thicker and creamier in consistency.
This place is sure to put a big smile on your tummy and your wallet.
So I give it a huge thumbs up!!

We went to hanglatherium finally after getting the news that they have very recently upgraded the place to accommodate dining . now this is located in lake gardens. Had the must talked about biryani. The biryani is good because it fulfills the basics very appropriately. The hanglatherium biryani combo is a winner. But then u won't get the mutton hanglabari. Mutton hanglabari is kinda sweetish so those who r expecting a spicy endevour better be informed . but the recipe is good and all nd all a nice dish priced at 200 . overall I was pretty much satisfied and finally is happy to have a budget restaurant with good food.

Finally got a chance to check out the much awaited dine in from Hanglathrium at Lake Gardrns and came out with a handful of goodies that I was not expecting at all.

Here are some:-

Ambience-- spacious,colourful and interesting.Special mention the tapestry remind me of Mario Miranda.

Location-- equidistant from South City and Lords junction the place is extremely convenient to access.

Service:- I never felt that this guys are serving me for the first time..in spite of having a full house the boys had a consistent smiling eye on me.

Lastly the food..well I have been a avid follower of their food ever since their inception. I have experienced each of their dishes grow within my stomach (off course) but this time what amazed me is the variety and the zing they brought in to some of their offering. Lets say Kebab Platter which is like a well tuned bollywood movie with a right dose of all elements. Guys why don't you add some prawn to it (well I missed the item number badly :)). Fish Achari, another dish which I tested first time is also a masala flick, and in spite of not being a "fishy" I liked it and took one plate home.

¬†

All the best Hanglaathrium for you future..Serve us better and bigger in coming days. BTW do you guys have any plan to branch out somewhere near Garia and Jadavpur....??

Hanglaatherium is now a well known name in town for all the food lovers. They do not need any special certificate from me as already there are plenty of excellent comments around. Long back Radio Mirchi has announced Hanglaatherium the "Biriyani ka Badsha". It is not the mere award, but this young, enthusiastic and vibrant group's  real passion for food is the fact that has brought and kept them in the forefront. Award can attract people but if the quality of food is not good enough it can never hold back the customers. Hanglaatherium has done this job so brilliantly that not only they have increased the number of their loyal customers day by day but also they were kind of forced to open their dine-in outlet at Prince Anwar Shah Road.

Talking about the quality of food, they know the absolute magic of making their food so delicious yet not oily or spicy which will take a toll on your health. They offer a wide range of dishes. However, some of my top favourites are of course ‚ÄòThe Mutton Biriyani‚Äô with the heavenly fragrance of juicy and delicious mutton pieces, Mutton Hanglaabari, Mutton Galawati Kabab, and Chicken Achaari Kabab. To enjoy their various Kabab delicacies you may order their Special Kabab Platter.  You can also try the Sweet Laccha Paratha with Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala or Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala or simply Mutton Do Piyaza with Peas Polao or Butter Naan. 

The sitting space is not gigantic but what will impress you, is the coziness and apt d√©cor of the place. It will give you the comfort feel of sitting in your drawing room with friends and family. But above all, it‚Äôs worth mentioning their courtesy and marvelous service. The staff are so genuine in their attempts to make you feel their esteemed guest.

Keep up the good work Hanglaatherium. Wish you all the best !!

There are biriyanis and then there is Hanglatherium's Biriyani. All food lovers will agree that whenever one tucks into a Biriyani one is always unhappily reminded of the Dalda that is used, or the spices that lead to undesirable aftereffects. I had heard of their much touted "Light" biriyanis, and had recently visited their outlet ordering Mutton biriyani, Mutton Hanglabari, Fish Achari Kebab, and Chicken Tandoori. I must say that their Biriyani is not only bereft of any kind of unnecessary oil/ dalda or spices, but really sits "light" on the stomach. The mutton Hanglabari which the owners insisted was their signature dish was definitely mindblowing. One can combine it with not only with the Biriyani, but with a Laccha paratha or a Butter naan. The Chicken Tandoori was good but what actually prompted me to write this review was their Fish Achari Kebab. I have rarely tasted such a well prepared Fish Kebab. Hanglatherium , you are going to create history in the food map of Kolkata. Please keep up the great effort !!

Not too sure whether a review¬† of a 67 years old, not too foodie,¬† is granted by the management of Hanglaatherium. But knowing them, I think they would appreciate and that is the reason for me to get into this difficult medium and try to key-in my feelings about their food, ambience, courtesy and taste.
It was a pure delight for me visiting their new outlet at Lake Gardens. I have been seeing them from close quarters for the last 3 years since their inception. How dearly they wanted to build this place. And I could really see the "dream comes true" feeling from each one of them. The decor is simple but it has a touch of elegance. The red, black and ivory created a very sober ambience. 
Tasted my all time favorite mutton hanglaabari and peas pulao the other day. It was as good as my mother used to prepare. They insisted to have their biryani which was difficult to resist. But my stomach could not even allow me to have a second look seeing the huge quantity of their single serving. So I opted for a second visit with my grandson. And tasted the succulent kabab and Chicken Biryani. 
I was never a big fan of Biryani. But after Hanglaatherium's biryani, I definitely felt that I missed an essential delicacy in my younger days. Alas my childhood did not gave me the pleasure of having Hanglaatherium around. My grandson enjoyed the kababs and his favorite, Chicken Bharta accompanied by Laccha Paratha. Both of them tasted amazingly good. The taste, the aroma, the softness of meat, all together makes it a pleasurable experience for all ages. 
One thing which I should mention specifically and that is the courtesy extended by owners of Hanglaatherium. I don't think I have ever received such a warm welcome at any restaurants in Kolkata. Although the owners of Hanglaatherium has no relation to the Nawabs of Awadh, I am sure that the art of pure "Nawabiana" is successfully adopted by these young, enthusiastic group of foodies. I hope they will keep maintaining this personal touch and remain polite forever. 
All the best Hanglaatherium. I wish you all the best!

The food as usual was excellent. This is a review of the new seating arrangement that has been added. The spot is colour red. A sweet shad of red. The furniture is simple and yet blending in so well. Fire safety has been taken care of. Small yet comfortable. The wall is well done with various small pieces of art. The best one is the cartoon strip overlooking the counter. The staff was very helpful. The particular cartoon over the counter is the one that sticks in my mind. The ambience is peaceful. Really looking forward to going back!!

One of the most affordable places for a tummy full of goodies. This is one of the best biriyani junction in kolkata, very light and tasty. You should order the mutton biriyani and mutton hanglabari...its the best...

Hanglaatherium - A well recognised "brand" name now.¬†

=======

Intro:¬†

I had recently ordered for home delivery from here. Hanglaatherium had been performing consistently for a long time. However, i was sadly disappointed with the preparation of the dishes this time and also because none of my previous suggestions were looked upon even after being assured that suggestions would be worked upon.

=======

Food ordered:

1) Chicken Biriyani - The biryani rice was cooked fine. However, the problem was with the chicken and the potato. The potato was underdone and was quite hard to break. The chicken was not properly marinated because the biriyani spices had not seeped in properly. It seemed like chicken had been marinated just a while ago. Chicken was not even succulent like the previous few times. On a serious note, as Hanglaatherium has increased their prices, they should serve with that kind of "Perfection" also. I, as a customer, would be very willing to pay for my meal "provided" it is cooked perfectly. ¬†

2) Chicken Chaap - The chicken chaap had the same marination problem. The gravy of the chaap was impeccable though.¬†

=======

Summary:

Food quality 3.6/5

Food quantity 3.7/5

Taste 2.7/5¬†

Hygiene 3.7/5

Value for money 3.5/5

=======

Meal for two: 300-550 max

=======

Conclusion:

I have much high expectations from Hanglaatherium. Don't let me down. Quite disappointed. I hope to have a better experience next time. :|

=======

Note:1) The prices of Chicken Biriyani has increased to 125/- and Chaap to 100/-

2) Unbiased Review based on my eating experience.

3) Pictures coming soon.
=======
Recent Update: Went recently at their outlet. Go straight from Lord's More towards south city take the first left from Hong Kong keep going straight. Just behind the Park, you discover Hanglaatherium. Tried Special Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chaap here. The Mistakes have not yet been rectified. The Potato was still underdone. The chaap gravy did not taste the same. Overall, just satisfactory. No suggestions taken care of.

Had heard a lot about the place a lot and was waiting for my exams to end.
Its a bit hard to find for first timers even with the map, u have to go in the lane beside Leder Land opposite to SC mall, then take a left and then a right. I had to roam about for ten minutes trying to figure out from the map.
But then all is well , actually great once you reach. The service is super super fast . I had to wait for around 7 minutes for their chicken biriyani and the chicken pasanda. The chicken was simply out of the world and a must try . Being the biriyani addict that I am , I think its the best biriyani in town , no sticky dalda but not even too light , with the right smell and quite a good amount that they pack. They even give you spiced onions , tomatoes and capsicum with their kebabs which were soft and succulent.
They don't have much place to sit in this outlet with only two tables but the owners are very civil I must say. A good experience and a must eat in place.

This is one such place which is conveniently located serving extremely delicious dishes along with the best service by some of the most well behaved ever smiling group of staff. A must try out is the biriyani which is one of the best you can get in town. The mutton items available are so tender that their meat just falls of the bone, their signature item Mutton Hanglabari is¬†extremely tasty. I would recommend you to order your food a bit early because you might miss out on some dishes if you are late. This place is a pure treat.

The first day of 2015, and we decided to finally make that one stop that we have been meaning to make since the past year. We drove straight into the lane beside Leder Land opposite South City Mall, and once we saw the name of the restaurant looming up, we were pretty disappointed to learn that the same has moved to a different address. However, fret not. We called the number provided and were instantly provided with the directions to reach the newly-opened dine-in. And how glad I was that we decided to try and locate the dine-in instead of scooting off to a different place to eat.

We were greeted by a charming family, who runs the place. The ambiance is homely, and one can easily strike up a conversation with the owners. We wanted to order a take-away, and were advised to wait for 15 mins as Biryani was getting freshly made. Absolutely no problem whatsoever, especially with the aroma of the Biryani making us want it even more.

We ordered Special Chicken Biryanis with Eggs, Fish Biryani with Egg, Mutton Hanglaabari, Chicken Pasanda, Chicken Bharta and Fish Banjara. As we were waiting for the food to arrive, the waft of Biryani from the kitchen continued to entice us. While I had never been a huge Biryani fan, this time I could not wait to devour my share of it.¬†

The food was brought home for dinner, and let me say, all the dishes were hits. However, I wish I could have tasted the Biryani while it was just fresh out of the Dum. The mutton was soft, succulent and the taste was a wonderful mix of spices which I could not accurately lay my fingers on. Everyone had a delightful meal.

Looking forward to go back to Hanglaatherium, this time to have the piping hot Biryani straight from the plate and also to sample their speciality Sweet Lachha Paratha.

An excellent food joint for North Indian & Mughlai .

My family and I  had exceptionally good meals each time we ordered.

On the 29th of Dec 2014 I had organised my Hubby's Birthday celebration party with my family  and friends. My Aunt-in-law and Cousins had come down from USA and they wanted to have Kebabs and Murgh Mussallam . It's a  perfect place for family dining.We also had the Speciality of Hanglaatherium - Haanglabaari  a mutton preparation which too is a delicacy . Other than this we all enjoyed  masala kulchas and palak paneer .  The restaurant ambiance is very nice  with a  tiled decor, vibrant color/light effects and pictures . 

Look forward to visit this place again and again.

Thank You- Team Hanglaatherium for such a delightful cuisine'.

¬†Wishing all of you A Happy & Prosperous New Year 2015 Ahead!!!!!

An excellent joint for North Indian & Mughlai cuisine lovers. I have been coming here since their take away days and now, after a long wait...comes along the Dine-In!! The ambience is very nice and the staff really polite and jolly.
Coming to the heart of the matter, the food quality is simply fantastic. I am a self-proclaimed Biriyani fanatic and I must admit, finally a restaurant to have earned its place amongst stalwarts like Shirazj, India, Arsalan, Zeeshan & Aminia(pardon if I missed out any other biggies out there). The side dishes are a treat as well and one should definitely not limit themselves to any one particular item. However, having said that, I must confess that Mutton Hanglabaari is totally Off-The-Hook and you can, or rather SHOULD make this dish a staple whenever you visit this awesome joint.
Just one piece of advice(which I know that they're working upon ALREADY with stark results), please bring a consistency in the quality of food & NEVER EVER give in to any kind of cribbing or barriers which may compromise the same.
Thank you Team Haanglabaari for such a delightful experience every single time I visit.
\m/ On and wishing y'all A Happy & Prosperous New Year !!!!!
