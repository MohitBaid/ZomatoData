Weird shawarmas I tell you.. being from Hyderabad which has quite a few damn good Arabian restaurants, this place stood nowhere in the competition.. firstly the khabus was hard and tasted raw.. the filling wasn't tasty.. the sauce provided as side did not go well.. and who gives green chilli paste with shawarma anyway!!! They really need to work on making the shawarma more authentic..

Got delivered chicken shawarma wrap from this place. It was very tasty. Perfectly grilled chicken and right dose of mayyonaise... Wrap was very tasty! The amount of filling inside the wrap was quite good. One wrap could make an empty stomach full! Looking forward to try their other dishes.

Absolutely awful! I have never had a Shawarma so pathetic. Dry and stale chicken with that godforsaken dip. The whole point of the shavings of the chicken from the rotating spit is to have moist chicken which is full of flavours. They need to gear up and how.

The Chicken Shawarma Wrap was awful. It should not be called Shawarma. I ate something completely tasteless. Even Chicken Kathi Roll tastes 100 times much better.  The chicken had an unpleasant smell and most of it was only tomato and capsicum.  Go Lebanese food joint in Salt Lake offers far better than Shawarma than you guys. 

Total waste of money.

Only good thing about this place is it's a kiosk and has less wait time. Coming to what it serves. The bread seems to be a bit on thicker side, meat pieces are dry, contains more of vegetables than chicken. Furthermore it looks more like taco than shawarma. I have had shawarma in other parts of the country, but this disappointed me.

Bad. 70 bucks for French fries. Too bad and too pricey. It didn't taste that great as well. We had no other options that's why we had to eat there. Otherwise one can skip this place any day.

Had ordered for chicken shawarma wrap and shish tawook through swiggy...packing was good,taste wasnt that great...fillings of the wrap contained less chicken and more of vegetables,as for the shish tawook the chicken pieces were stiff and too spicy but not tasty.

Everything is going well for this joint because they have got their Shawarma on point! Other Shawarma-makers, please understand that the dip is not mayo, and it is never gonna be mayo!

I love it when the kiosk format works so well, because it only translates to great taste, less wait time, more flexibility and lower pocket pinch! I hope this one stays!

Alas! The dry, smelly stuff that was delivered to me today was far far away from Shawarma.

The meat was dry and stale! And where was the dressing! I got a drizzle of what tasted like cheap bottled southwest. Sad that you have failed to keep up to the standards set earlier and how!

We ordered grilled chicken shawarma wrap and the classic chicken shawarma wrap. The chicken pieces should have been more juicy and tender. It was a bit disappointing but the service was prompt.

I ordered for Chicken Shawarma Roll from this outlet and amazingly the delivery reached 20 minutes before the scheduled time. This was really impressive. The packaging was very hygienic and spill proof. The roll tasted yummy and the quality was good!! Would love to order again from here. Shawarmas are my favourite and Shawarma City has done great justice to my expectations!

shawarmas are just ordinary. The meats(chicken) are usually not properly grilled. The fillings used in the shawarma roll tasted more like a veg salad with few chicken pieces. The only thing eatable here are kababs. They are just ok and there is nothing more to write about em..

Avoid this place...
