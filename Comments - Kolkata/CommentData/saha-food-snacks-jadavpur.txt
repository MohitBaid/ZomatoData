This is a small outlet of my colony situated at the T-crossing of Pallisree. I have grown up drooling over the items available here. The morning luchi and aloor dum is worth drooling over and i can just give up anything fir it! Ghoogni is also served in the breakfast menu. The other snacks like rolls, chops and all kinds of fries taste delicious. The mangsher chop and fidh butter fry are worth mentioning. For main course you have polao, mangsho kosha (chicken and mutton) and fried rice,chilli chicken/paneer. These main courses are a must try! 
This small and cheap outlet is doing wonders.

This place's mangsher chop is stuff of the legends. I grew up on the snacks here, as did my dad. Weekly purchases include the egg chicken roll, mangsher chop, moghlai porota, chicken chowmein, chilli chicken and so on. This place also takes bulk orders for parties and even caters at special occasions.

This place is very close to where I stay. The snacks are average here and prices are reasonable. I don't like the ambience though. We mostly opt for takeaways.

It's my favourite place in my locality. Their morning luchi aloor dum and ghugni is simply awesome. On the other hand, the vegetable, fish and mutton chops are something that you would crave for. I also like their pulao and chilli chicken. The mughlai is awesome too. If you are ever at Bijoygarh, and craving for something simple yet good, try out here. It's great and definitely recommended. Happy Dining! :)
