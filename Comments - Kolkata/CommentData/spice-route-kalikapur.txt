Worst place ever i have visited. I had a coupon from little app which costs 499rs. It was 5course dinner along with dessert. While showing them the coupon code they promptly said that they dont have any service tied up with little. But they redeemed the voucher. I literally shouted on them that i wanted to have a conversation with their boss. One of the waiter says that he is the boss. And says i can choose any menu for 499rs. I stepped out of the restaurant without having any thing and launched a complaint in little app. Seriously disgusting behaviour.

Visited last week located at purbachal crossing . Food was good but they served in very less quantity.  I ordered soup and BBQ chicken which was good in taste but their quantity is extremely low a bit overpriced too . They should work in their quantity and little bit in quality .

Visit to this place happened just by chance. Apollo Pharmacy is situated in the same building and I had to go there, and I was hungry, and I just became impulsive and climbed up the stairs. 
It is a small outlet with modest decoration.  The staff, a young boy, immediately ushered me to a seat and handed the menu card. Apart from me, a few people were there having regular dinner, I realised most of them are outstation people staying here for work and this joint has become a heaven for them.
Why I don't know, but the boy insisted I take parcel instead of having food there. Although I was hungry, I agreed with him and placed the order of four chapattis and one Spice Route special tadka.
The parcel was ready within ten minutes.
We loved the tadka. It consisted of chicken and eggs and tasted delicious without being too hot.
Price is moderate, ample parking space, good staff. Worth another visit.

A new restaurant at some awkward place, cant be easily recognized cause it has a small entrance with less lighting condition. Got their for the first time. Interior was quite ok not that much impressive. Coming to the food quality it's same as other. They do have a lots of items in menu but some of them remains unavailable. Not that much hectic one. Overall its a moderate one. Will give a depth review after a few more visit.
