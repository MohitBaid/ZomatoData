It is one of those places where you end up when other restaurants on your priority are full on the given day. Having said that, its really not that bad.
Ambience ~ There is nothing much to say. It has a very simple outlook with the option of AC and Non AC seating.
Service ~ The staff were well behaved. The service was prompt. 3.5/5 for cleanliness.
Food ~ We had ordered egg fried rice, veg hakka noodles, hot garlic chicken, chilli chicken and veg manchurian. The taste of all the items were okay, not bad at all but nothing which makes it stand out.
Pocket pinch ~ Very reasonable.

This is a great place in many ways. Completely pocket friendly and affordable, great food, generous quantities and aesthetic ambiance. Good hygiene and decent service as well, so don't go by the negative comments here. It's a must try! :)

Practically nothing is good about this place.
No matter how innovative you try to be, the primary factor in any food joint remains the quality of the dishes. You don't necessarily have to include a lot of variety, but whatever you serve, must live up to the expectations.
The Drive Inn, unfortunately, fails to satisfy its customers' gastronomic drives big time!
The food quality is terrible. The soups can be jolly well renamed as a bowl of boiled ginger. The fried dishes reek of oil. Everything is perfectly and divinely BAD.
Coming to the ambience, they had tried to bring a balance between outdoor sitting and a little AC hall, but when there are flies everywhere, it hardly matters anyway. 
Service as far as my single visit could judge, was pretty fast since it was almost empty. The staff was courteous. 
The only profitable thing about the place is that it doesn't charge GST, but then again, who wants to eat unpalatable food even at a low cost!! ðŸ˜’

It is a nice place to spend long hours over a good meal.
Long hours because that is the time they take to serve your order.. And good meal because it is made fresh and tastes well.
I would recommend to go for snacks when the crowd is less and sun has set. Sit in the outdoors with friends and order tea and pakodas. It will be a good value for money.
Their pasta is also nice.

I visited here with one of my friends at about 3.30PM.
We were really greeted very well by the staff here. We sat in the outside area (there are fans available).
We ordered 2 dishes :
Baby Corn - Was really yum.
Chilli Garlic Noodles - Aaye haaye.. Kitna mast tha !!

The two dishes were really tasty and it was worth the price, actually Kam rupye mei kafi acha mila.

I don't know why this place has so much low rating. It is a good place to hangout with friends !

The service was horrible. I had gone with a friend, we had ordered the chilli garlic fried rice and crispy chilli babycorn. We waited for more than 40 minutes. When we decided to leave because we couldn't wait any longer, the staff didn't seem to care nor did they apologise. This kind of service is an immediate put off.

Located right beside the Middleton Chambers, and some 2mins walk from the sadan metro station (jeevandeep gate) 
The place is a nicely set area. With outdoor and indoor seating. Cleanliness isn't an issue either. Frankly I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone as such. The food wasn't at all up to the mark. 
We ordered both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items. 
To be honest, the veg/non-veg Manchow soup and chilli chicken (dry) were the best among the lot. It was tasty and we were just about satisfied by it. 
Besides, the Cantonese noodles were okayish but on the sweeter side (I don't know why they did so?) , butter garlic chicken fried rice could have been more enhanced with the flavours as said. Also, initially we ordered for Singapore rice noodles and veg manchurian, which werent available. 
So we set for schezwan noodles which was pathetic. There weren't any schezwan-like flavours in it, rather they tasted like boiled noodles tossed in indian spices. So bad! 
Now, Chilli paneer And crispy chilli babycorn. The former had a good taste but then I doubt the quality of paneer(cottage cheese) they used; was hard and rubbery. The latter, after all such disastrous dishes seemed edible. 

Please note that there was a shortage or staff as well. Because not only were they taking a lot of time in serving us but even on calling for some help we were attended after 10-15 mins. @

Drive Inn is a feel good place located in the heart of the city. The entry is good and leaves you with a pleasant feeling. There was only one man to serve us so I feel there's probably a shortage of staff. You have the option to sit indoors or outdoors. 
Coming to the food, we can categorise it into vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I'll start with the veg food, we ordered the manchow soup which was good. The noodles, chilli paneer and fried rice weren't good. There was no salt. We ordered Crispy Chilli Baby Corn which was okay. Coming the non-vegetarian food, we ordered Chilli chicken dry, butter chicken garlic fried rice, pan fried chicken noodles. The chilli chicken was legit tasty, the noodles were good, a little sweet but the fried rice wasn't good. 
However, the restaurant is dirt cheap considering the amount of food we ordered and our stomachs were full. I'll suggest them to work on their veg food.

Had ordered a Veg. Thali for lunch. It took them 45 minutes to get the food. Plates looked unwashed but we chose to ignore as we were famished. Realised there were spiders in the food soon after. Not one but 3. Add to that there were cobwebs in the papad section. Absolutely pathetic and mind-boggling. Left immediately after bashing the management.

I don't know why this place exist anymore. It use to be so beautiful once upon a time with a scenic, green and open ambience. But now it looks very deserted and is completely ignored by the management. Trust me it's a great date place because hardly any one is present here and without any one's notice, you can kiss your partner. 
However it's very affordable and it does justice to the food quality. After college, shopping or after a tedious day, you feel like drive in here and can sip not so prefect but a refreshing coffee :)

The worst restaurant I have ever been too. Hot and sour chicken soup is served with all the vegetables available in the kitchen. Order is taken for starters and for dinner and we are made to wait for over an hour and are finally told that chicken and egg is not available... All this on a day when not even 1/3rd tables are occupied. Wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. 
Doesn't deserve even the above mentioned rating!

Wouldn't be too harsh on this place.
On a low budget,with desire of satisfying your appetite after taking a stroll along Victoria and Maidan,this is probably where you dive in.
The pocket pinch is minimal and quanity of food served might just do justice to your hunger.
Don't go by the previous reviews.
Go and order some Chinese or some North Indian , they serve pretty decent dishes.
And yeah,the restaurant looked cool to me.

Ordered 2cokes ,a pasta and Indian pizza....
The gentleman taking the order was pretty sloppy and was reluctant in answering us how long it would take for the food to arrive at our table.....as 20 minutes had already passed away...and we were getting late as well....
1.Pasta - the pasta was undercooked as it was still chewy and rubbery.
2.The pizza was stinking to the core and awful to taste...the pizza dough seemed to be old....still feel like throwing up..
3.coke - we gt served fountain Coke without fizz and it ended up being watery to taste in..

I heard s lot about this place being good.but it was utter disappointment.The pizza was sheer disgust ..still gt billed for the pizza even after complaint ...manager refuses to in not charging for it....and to be honest I don't care about paying the money but I'm not here for free food but charging for the pizza was quite unethical and the chef can definitely try  and have a few bites or the whole thing and see for himself......

Disgraceful joint to visit again..

This place is one of my go to joints whenever I am around that area!

Very pocket friendly with a nice and calm ambience.

They serve a wide variety of cuisines, which is good in a way as it gives you alot of options, so you can try out something different every time you visit this place.

We ordered my favourite Chilli Paneer and Hakka chow. It was flavorful.

We also tried the Veg Special Thali from here which was equally good.

The quantity is sufficient and the quality of the food is amazing!! The staff is pretty generous and I would definitely love to keep visiting this place time and again.

Looking for a quick bite, this is certainly not the place. Although the service is little delayed,  but the food is worth the wait.  

The Thali is quite filling and loaded. 

The ambience or interior does not exist,  but a descent place to take a 1 hour break from your office with colleagues.  

In winters specially, you can use the sitting area outside under the sky rather, it's quite amusing.  Try it!!

Good food. The sitting arrangements are very beautiful. They have indoor as well as outdoor sitting.
Coming to the food, there is a large scope for improvement. The preparations were ok but lacked taste in a way. We ordered Dragon Chicken, Schezwan Noodle, Fried Rice, Chilly Chicken.
The Schezwan noodle disappointed me among these.
But overall, if they work a little bit more on the taste part, it will get a crowd they can't handle.

For the first time, I paid a visit here. It is a neat and clean place. There is sitting arrangement outside, complete with umbrellas and tasteful chairs and tables. There is a separate unit with AC , but I preferred the outside sitting arrangement. There are wall fans attached to the umbrella which the staff switched on as soon as I was seated.
The menu is simple-Chinese and Indian. Pocket friendly price. I asked for crispy chilly babycorn. It took them approximately 5 minutes to bring the dish. The food is excellent. Just the right amount of chilly and the right amount of crispiness. The staff was formal but attentive. Overall, a nice experience. I would have sat there and asked for something else, but the evening was setting in, and with it, mosquito. So I had to leave early.

Everything is poor starting from the service to the food. Only the Indian platter was worth something but if you get your food 45 mins after you order, you lose the appetite. The billing was 20 mins late too! Also, please try and groom your staff, teach them the manners they clearly lack. Not coming back here again.

Okay so drive inn has taken the franchise of mission cafe n really done all of us a huge favour! The original mission cafe which is in central avenue is a bit far to reach so the outlet here in russel street really makes me happy! The chola bhatura is the speciality of this place.. Hot bhaturas served with dry chana masala with slices of tomato n onion... Yummm.. It makes my mouth water! I simply love the chola bhatura here. The taste is exactly similar to the one in central avenue but the only one thing missing is the potato which they serve with the chana.. Wish they would soon add tht.. The place is reasonably priced.. Had ordered a shikanji along with this n it tasted good.. Didn't try the other items but they looked yummy like the Hakka noodles and the North Indian items.. Hope to go back someday to try the North Indian food.

I mean I absolutely am not sure why this particular joint has got such a poor rating. I have passed by this restro on my way back from college and I have intended to make a move. Since college is all about cheap little joints, have seamlessly avoided this. But finally made a move today. The restro looks amazing. It basically has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. We initially chose to sit outside but slowly shifted inside. Love the decor. You feel as if you are sipping coffee in your own garden.  It is basically vegetarian.  So we decided to do in for a family pizza. But pizza , tea and roti not available.  We decided on the chola bhatura. I believe it is the best ever chola bhatura that I have ever eaten in my life. So highly recommended.  Next was the chilli babycorn and chilli mushroom dry which were amazingly tasty. But definitely the quantity served was quite less according to what they charged. The bill was around 500 and of course it was an amazing experience with staffs who would readily speak to you. However their atm service is not readily available , so do carry cash and you will spend some amazing time over here. I thoroughly loved it. Mission cafe you just rock !!

Good place to hangout with friends. Gives u a lot of privacy. Doesn't even disturbs you to fill up your empty glasses of water.Recommended for people who are not hungry, as the food (Chinese) is not good to even taste them. However the mouth fresheners can taste much better than the food.

1.Ambience-okkay kinda with an open air seating arrangement
2.Reception-not upto the mark
3.Food-i have ordered a veg biriyani there and its inedible.. But the panner tikka masala was superb so kinda mixed feeling
4.Price-very cheap..
If you are a vegetarian then you can go and grab some food here...recommended for veggies..

1st the ambience : ok ok type ambience. It was almost empty with just one group of 3 guys. You have 2 option..either opt for open sky or a small cabin space on one side. Its a old place with old table chairs.. gud for timepass.
Over all rating for ambience 4 out of 10.

2nd the service : the service here is not at all good. In my experience I personally had to get up and call the waiter. I just found one waiter attending. Waiter did not even bother to refill the water glasses, not even once.
Over all service 1 out of 10.

Finally the food : food is neither good. I ordered garlic bread, schezwan rice nd a as you like it pizza(with cheese burst). Garlic breads were not at all fresh nd hot. Schezwan rice tasted jst like any normal dried rice. When clarified with the waiter they said they do not add hot schezwan sauce in schezwan rice. It was simple white in colour. Pizza was jst one thing which was Upto to some extent better then the rest. But again no much spices or pepper, jst a layer of toppings and cheese. Ya but one thing, a bit on the side of pocket friendly choice. Over all food experience 3 out of 10. Not at all recommended.

All in all not at all good and recommendable choice. That too not at all in and around park street with a bundle of choices. Needs a lot of improvement.

Drive inn is one of our favourite place for titbits during our early office days...This us an outdoor restaurant....and the entire area is under a tree....very interesting...at times after long office hrs or after huge sales pressure the place was relaxing.they only serve vegetation food...but taste wise more homely ....price wise pocket friendly

I've been to Drive Inn just once....pretty long ago and tried: a panner item, nachos and baby corn.
The food was okay-ish and found the service slow. I didn't quiet like the nachos but enjoyed the baby corn. The place was clean and very green (that rhymed ????)
Not sure if their menu has changed however the last time I went they served purely veg food.

I had veg biriyani and paneer kabab here. There decoration is really attractive in first look, they have wooden bench there and it is in open area. The quantity is good enough but somehow feel the biriyani can be better. Their staff are little lazy to take and place order.

I used to visit this small (then open air with some covering on top) restaurant on Middleton Road some years back. There were clusters of parasols (more like straw coverings) with a table underneath and a few chairs around. All good when it was dry and not too hot. I believe there is some air-conditioning now.

Their juices were decent, as was especially the vegetable au-gratin. I recall having and really enjoying that. I have had their pizza, and wasn't terribly impressed. Must pay a visit again and check things out.

Service was on the slower side.

It was my uncle who introduced my family to this non AC  restaurant( it however has an ac room now).I was a kid then and we always went there for their mixed cheese pizza and footlongs!I used to love the footlongs and though its still on the menu it dosent catch my fancy anymore. Drive inn is located in middleton street(beside middleton chambers) It has 3 sections now, a non ac seating which host a number of people, an ac room (small) and a banquet.The place serves north indian,chinese, and italian.Italian is a new addition to their menu.On my recent visit there, i ordered cheese balls which were surprisingly good.The surpreme spagetti wasnt great and i thought to myself maybe it isnt an italian place at all. 
Oh before i forget, i sometimes get the thali A Pcked, it  includes a nan(which tastes good),rice,paneer butter masala and dal makhni , and a salad and is very filling and tastes good.It is reasonable priced at 100 bucks!
This place used to be good,however it has lost its charm, the footlong dosent taste the same.
But if you do step here, i would recommend north indian. Chinese too is fine,just i feel indian here is better.

So I walked in here on a Sunday at 1 pm. I was seated n there were one more group of friends sitting. The menus were on the table. 

I was seated their for 10 minutes and no one came with water, let alone to ask about the order. 
Adding to it, The AC wasn't working in this nasty sultry weather!
After waiting for a while I overheard the ones sitting on the other seat that they're gonna take 1-2 hours minimum to get the food. One of them went out to ask something and came back annoyed. 

Figuring out something's wrong, I went out too to ask what's the scene. Turns out, the stewards didn't arrive yet and they'd take an hour, easily. I walked out. 

I guess, this speaks tons about the place. 
No waiters on Sunday, at 1 pm. Hah.

Park Street and its adjacent areas are quite famous for serving exquisite dishes. But this restaurant is hopeless.  Food quality is poor and ambiance is average.  They did not have Chinese dishes in afternoon but their menu was full of this item. Its a veg restaurant and they dont have mushrooms too. We compelled to order indian food, even one plate pulao was not sufficient for one people. Paneer was very average.  Service was horrible. its strictly not recommended.

This is again a park street food spot. And Drive Inn was just opposite my previous office building, but I was not quite a frequent visitor over here since I'm not a veg-lover. Still I had to visit it for a couple of time with my south-indian colleagues who were completely veggie, and Drive Inn was their favorite hangout. I experimented with some special pastas over there. Lasagne Florentine was my favorite. The thick crust of cheese and spinach on the upper side of it is deliciously mouth-watering.  Other baked pastas (eg: pure pasta delight, canneloni) are all fine. Among starters, crispy baby corns; spring roll; calzone are quite good. Their cream of mushroom soup is also tasty. Personally I felt their dish were bit less saltier than other restaurants, but my south-indian veggie friends found it perfectly salty. Among refreshment drinks, Blue Lagoon they serve is good. They also provide with lozenges at the end of meal. My overall rating would be 2.5 out of 5.

Caution: Never try their pan fried noodles with gravy. It's pathetic and tastes like insipid dishes served in nursing home to the patients.

Drive Inn, located just beside CA Institute, used to be one of my destinations wherein i could just drop by for an hour or something or could just meet someone over a cup of coffee. The place has been renovated year back. The place is spacious but seats are very ok. The staff is polite but not so well trained. Located just beside a busy road, there is a noise element in the open air portion of the restaurant. 

The Prices are very reasonable but quality of food is not so good. Sandwiches are decent with the veg footlong being the better one of the lot, paneer pineapple gratin is good. Chinese main course preparations are not upto the mark. Indian starters are ok but the main course vegetables are below average. They serve pizzas but i do not like it much. Coffee is not that great either.

Located at an amazing spot, the place disappoints. The food quality needs to improve.

I used to frequent Drive -Inn regularly once upon a time as my college was next door and it was affordable and pocket friendly. I used to drive past it on and off and decided one day to drop by for old times sake and check it out. Not that I was expecting fine dining or anything .... I was however quite disappointed to find that sadly it was just not up to the mark ! We ordered Macaroni Hotpot which was not available , cheese balls which also were not available and settled for the Cheese Toast and left because this took quite a while to serve and was just about OK. With the kind of location they have this place could be a gem with some effort by the management.

This has been my childhood place & after ages went back to it again. I used to love the aalo dum, Au gratin & mixed pulao & though of trying the same items today. Let me tell you they tasted just the same- very nice :)

Apart from this also ordered baked beans on toast & they serve it very well with green chillies & onions & chips on the side- A perfect combination. 

I am happy to be back & would like to go again whenever I travel back to Kolkata- Keep it up Drive Inn team.

We had booked the banquet hall for a friend's birthday party here.

The starters (babycorn and spring rolls), to begin with, were extremely oily. The soft drink was not cold. The main course, however, was surprisingly better - chola, daal makhani and paneer - were relished by all. The breads were good. However, the most loved item on the menu was the lasagna - but that too, comparatively. 

The staff was courteous. However, they must install a new deck system with an AUX port!! 

On the whole, the food experience was a little below satisfactory.

I have been there many times. Its located at Russel Street. Its located beside Doctor's chamber.

Food Quality is not so good and ambience is mediocre. Staffs are inattentive. 

I dislike the Nachos and Sandwiches. Only thing which i like is the MExican Pizza but still not much. 

I would rate 2.5 for DRIVE INN.

I have tried 2 times with my office team of 14 in Drive Inn and each and everybody is disappointed and unhappy with.

Only dish Russian salad is worth. Except this food quality is VERY "POOR".  

STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED.

Quite an unsatisfactory restaurant. Hopped to the place from my college to grab a bite. And they couldnt serve half the items on their menu. Things like burger & pizza werent available at peak lunch hour. Considering its a cafe sort of place located in a prime area, these could be their fast moving items if they'd serve!
