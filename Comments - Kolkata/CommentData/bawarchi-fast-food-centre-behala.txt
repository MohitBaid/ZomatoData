In my higher secondary school days, I was a regular at this place...standing among the very first string of customers, watching them prepare everything for the rush that was about to hit them and waiting for the egg-chicken roll to be handed to me for enjoying while I saunter back to my home after school time. The crisped up outer layer of the paratha was a delight to take a bite from in the anticipation of the ample amount of spicy chicken breast cubes tucked inside it.

The quality has deteriorated since. The chicken roll has lost its signature crispy outer layer and the chicken parted ways with much of its flavor. It was always the rolls that had a flair among all the dishes they offered. The biryani they served wasn't at par with what many other joints offered in their price range and the hunky pieces of side dish(chicekn chaap) that laid 'dead' from eve through night on a large pan in one corner was starkly unappetizing when contrasted with the freshly puffed up rumali rotis that was tossed and turned by a busy-as-bee person! It has been a long time since I tried their biryani and thus I can't tell about its quality now.

The chicken roll, despite failing to live up to the expectation, is still better than most places. This is a place you must try for the rolls and if you like it, take a moment and imagine the quality it was before, even if it's your first time trying it...you won't be able to refrain from imagining it when you see the crowd that stand on the roadside with determination to get their food, 'cause only a place with enviable background can summon such dedication even when its signature dish has taken a dip in terms of quality in recent times.

A local food joint around my locality....I have been a kind food grubber from the place...Since the very fast day and would say rolls are must try items...Though they ain't close to haji ya arsalan...When comes to biriyani but one of the best when comes to food joints across the city.

well i feel these local shops should be supported by us as well, cause many times a dish they prepare turns out to be the best available. try there biryani and you will relish it forever. rest items r not so upto the mark. quantity however is huge.

This has been my saviour during sudden evening fast food craving since my childhood.. bt never really thought it would be on zomato.. Rolls, momos, kababs, chowmein, fried rice, chilli chicken, chilli paneer and mughlai is all I had.. The Mughlai s not good.. The others are quite worth a try.. The biriyani as i find sells like hotcake, though I haven't tried being not so fond of biriyani.. The Rolls are crisp and large.. The chowmein fried rice are nicely fried and perfectly cooked.. a bit oily though.. Lastly Bubaida the owner is very decent, all customers are treated nicely that would make you want to visit again unlike some other food joints..

This is a small food joint located at silpara crossing...tried many of their items over the years and most of them are real good...their rolls are  great...the chicken roll is the best,  biryani, chaap , moglai and chicken fried rice is also worth mentioning...overall most of their items are good plus it does'nt pinch the pocket too much...

This has been a place for my quick bites in my locality. Whenever I am hungry I hop into Bawarchi for some Rolls or Moglai Paratha or chowmin at the max. Nothing special to talk about. Taste of these are good but nothing exceptional. Super pocket friendly. Biriyani is really pathetic. Its only a takeaway shop and is mostly not concerned about hygiene as its mostly dirty all over.

another typical fast food joint amongst the thousands across the city....food is good and inexpensive and being close to my house, we have ordered several times from there....you will get everything from momo's to fried rice and pakoras and rolls, quite  few options....pretty happy with their food....

This roll joint is Located at silpara. They offer mostly good rolls and chow mein. The biryani they offer is not up to the mark. But as a joint they maintain their quality of rolls, moghlai and  chowmein. I must say they offer the best roll at the silpara locality.

Situated at the Silpara crossing near tapoban club, this roll shop prepares rolls better than most of the roll centers in the locality. Also good is their Egg chowmein & chicken biriyani. Of course this is no fancy eating joint. But for the price & convenient location from my home i do prefer their food compared to the other shops.

I can simply walk to this place to get something for the evening snacks. Located at the corner of DH Road on the Silpara stoppage. Nothing left on the menu which I have not tried. 

What you can go for are, rolls, chowmin, fish fry & roomali roti and chicken tarka, moglai paratha

Trust me I have never had such a worthless biryani in my life earlier priced at 110 bucks. Chili chicken is awful. Kebab after having one piece you will simply say how on earth can this be so bad. 

You need to give special instruction to the cook with your taste specially when you are getting the chicken curry.

This is one of the the best roll centre of behala...I have tried all of their rolls...according to me mutton tikiya roll is the show stopper...There biriyani can also be tried... But noodles, fried rice & other side dishes are not up to the mark...I am giving the rating on rolls only

Honestly, you'll get the tastiest fast food here at the cheapest possible road price! I always buy egg rolls from here and of on a Sunday I'm really tired to set the pan on fire, a quick packet of biryani from the shop works as a good decision!

Quite a hot-spot for ever hungry Behalans (yes dats what we call ourselves) :p , this roadside delight is hard to miss..!! Situated right on the main road this sister branch of Bawarchi serves almost every thing Mughlai.. Tried their chicken roll, egg chicken roll & mutton roll..which I must say is too good!! Crispy on the outside yet tender in the inside!! Though I have heard of their biryani's good will but havn't tasted it yet..bt will do it soon... :D
