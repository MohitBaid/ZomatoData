great place with reasonable pricing...
liked the concept of 'a lot can happen over a milkshake' with probably the first milkshake outlet in the city with spacious seating arrangement

located right beside the new alipore army camp.
loved how they give full bottle shake and not just froth like a famous shakes brand in the city does
must try the pure nutella

By far, the best place for milkshakes in the vicinity...
the service is extremely fast and the staff is friendly and helpful....
the thing i like the most is that they dont use ice and fill the whole bottle with purely shake
