I've experienced this place for just once and that was enough.the staffs were very rude and corrupted. we went for normal egg chowmin parcel they behaved rudely and kept us outside standing for almost 1 hour and the worst part is they priced a normal plate(with normal quantity) of egg chowmin is 200.it was not written anywhere the staffs told so as it was late at night we ordered that but it was a big mistake and I assume that the staffs willingly  took extra money from us.

Probably the worst restaurant you can spend money on. Overpriced, low quality stuff. Add to that the rudest staff you will ever see in any restaurant. Apparently, the owner is a local don whose foreign liquor shop got closed down for selling spurious liquor. Locals say you can still get liquor inside the restaurant by paying extra to the staff.

Food quality is good but they take too much time to deliver food. Ambience is good but decoration is old. Location is good beside kona expressway area.

Went for lunch here. We ordered chicken lollipop for starters and biriyani and chicken lababdar as main course. The food was tasty and the quantity is also good. Price is reasonable, service is also polite and gentle. Will give higher points if a bit of renovation is done. Overall a homely and coZy place.

If Anyone is looking for a drink, they can go to this place. Foods are average. Service is good. But their interior design needs a change. Overall an average Â place for hangout.

Went there after a road trip. Ambiance is good. Food quality was also good. But that day alcohols were not available there and some of the items we asked from the menu were not available.

This review is based on my 2 visits to this place. Location is on the Kona Express Highway.
I went there with my family on a Sunday afternoon. The place does not show any resemblance to a proper restaurant from outside. Only a couple of tables were occupied in the ground 'family' floor.
That there was only a single waiter attending to all the 3 tables made me re-think about my decision to visit here.
But the food more than compensated my doubts. We ordered chicken lollipop as starters which was crispy from outside & juicy inside. For d mains, we chose veg pulao, chinese chopsuey, butter naan, paneer lababdar & shanghai chicken. Forget d non-veg, even d veg items were absolutely delicious. Paneer lababdar is a must have. The chopsuey presentation was nice. Quantity was galore & quality superb for such a remote food joint.
We ended our meal with cold drinks & ice cream. The pricing is very reasonably done.
We personally thanked the courteous waiter for such good food.
The few cons i noticed is that they need to work up on their hygiene & staff & i wish they shift from the outskirts more towards the city.
Overall, a nice place to have good food..!!

Disappointed.
We were looking to find one good restaurant that serves Chinese. One of my friends told me that we could get quality chinese cuisine in La Donna.
We ordered mixed fried rice, chilli chicken, garlic chicken and chicken manchurian.
Chicken dishes tasted quiet alike except for their names and price. Pieces of chickens were a bit stiff and the gravy tasted too sour.
Mixed fried rice tasted good but the quantity was very little.
Service was not up to the mark.
The neighboring restaurants like Zaika, Hang Sang etc can easily outdo La Donna.

Food ? tastes are not so good. I ordered chicken ? tandoori. The chicken ? was totally half roasted (or may be 1/4th). When I  told the manager he said it tastes like this. So, somehow I managed to think that they wanted to give me the pleasure of the taste of the real chicken ? blood.

After 2rounds to Zaika,  we decided it's time to go for a change....  La Donna is just opposite Zaika on the right hand side...  Loud nose in the name of songs  aren't our flavour, so we headed straight to the 2nd floor....  The ambiance like Zaika was clearly missing.....  The floors were dirty and the wash sinks even more....  We ordered 4budweiser magnum,  kebabs,  tandoori roti, masala kulcha and a chicken dish....  The kebabs were definitely better than Zaika's....  The food was also delicious to taste....  Leaving the dirty sink Nd floor, it was nice....  Would visit again.....

I had first visited the place about 3 years back and they used to aerbe a decent Chinese fare in a family environment. Some odds the dishes they served were quite delicious ans generous helpings/ portions, particularly the soups and chicken dishes. However, I am shocked to are them now. The dishes and cooking has deteriorated like hell and the portions have shrink with the Pervez shooting up. And the ambience and crowd has drastically changed for the worse and iyvis unfit for any family gathering any more. I guess thiamin Haas a direct link to the off shop they have opened. There ate very few family restaurants in Howrah and seeing one going rhetoric wrong way just disappoints.

la donna bar cum restaurant is the best bar cum restaurant near the kona expressway. The ambience,service,food of the restaurant is really good. The outside atmosphere of the restaurant is also good.
