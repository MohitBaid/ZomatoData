I had ordered their chicken meatballs. They are,singularly,the worst meatballs I've ever tasted. The sauce was good but the meatball was not. Also, I had ordered through Swiggy and they had a BOGO on this item. They delivered just one. This kind of dishonesty irritates me as well.

We ordered Phaad Thai (mixed) which had rice noodles stir fried in veggies, chicken, prawn and egg. The place is too overpriced I felt. The dish tasted good, and there were some nuts given on the side of the dish, which we  mixed with the noodles and it tasted just soooo different and new! But, the quantity was way too less. If you are a momo lover you can try out their momos definitely which has a reasonable price there!

Ordered twice from here through swiggy. First time everything was perfect. Second time there was a goof up with the order as well as the thukpa sent at the first go had a little too much salt in it and no paper napkins or spoons were provided. However the mistake was rectified by contacting via swiggy without much ado. The second time they sent the remaining items, the thukpa tasted great and paper napkin and plastic spoons were provided too. Coming to the food ratings of the items tried. Chicken cheese pan fried momo tasted good, nicely sauteed in sauce and had ample chicken and cheese and sprinkled with peanuts. The dish tasted good but was a little too oily. There was oil residue dripping in the foil. Chicken moburg was good with lots of mayonnaise  (not a mayonnaise fan personally). The Thukpa, ordered twice, both veg and chicken is great. Bbq chicken gai satay was awesome and meatball satay was good. Would have rated a 4.5 had not been for the order goof up and 1 salty thukpa. Prices are quiet reasonable. Would like to try their maincourse items and if they are as good as their thukpa and bbq chicken gai satay, or even better, will edit my ratings better.

Okay, so did you ever have Kingothai's food? No? Thank god you didn't. They're a small joint serving super duper expensive shitty food, according to them pad thai can't be accompanied with any sauce, FYI, pad thai is incomplete without fish sauce and crushed peanuts separately and also dried crab meat. But still they argued on it. Next up they are charging packing charges for no reason, that too they are not giving any container for which they are charging, still they argued on it. Paying 180 bucks for a streetside mediocre quality shitty tasting pad thai noodle is a waste IMO. Beware.

This is the first time I tried Thai food and I must admit it was delicious. Authentic Thai food is served at Kingothai and at reasonable rates. Full marks to the taste. Thai food is something that is light on stomach. It is lighter than Chinese food. Though it's a small eatery just opposite Lake Town Jaya Cinema but serves authentic food. Chicken Basil Rice, Chicken Green Curry Rice, Chicken Satay, a must try for all the food lovers.

Had visited this area recently due to some work. Lake town seems to have very little choice when it comes to catering to people's hunger during the afternoon.  All the restaurants were shut. After walking quite a lot, this eye catching little place caught out attention. I was craving for burgers real bad and upon seeing that on their menu, I wasted no time in ordering their chicken Thai burger and veg Thai burger. However, I was disappointed. The filings tasted fine but the buns were really dry. 

Then I decided to order one of their specialities whose name is unfortunately can't recall. It had jasmine rice, chicken and a poached egg on top. And ohmigod! IT WAS AMAZING. I am definitely gonna try out the rest of their Thai menu soon.

I can keep on saying about this wonderful joint that they have opened near my home.. I'm a big foodie thus have already tried Thai food from a lot of authentic places but this was something really good.. They have kept in mind about the quality food and as well as the price.. 
I already had their chicken pan fried momo and moburg before and that was amazing as well.. But this time their co-owner Kunal suggested Chicken Phad Thai Noodles and thank god that he suggested.. The flat noodles was perfectly cooked and the chicken was really soft and well cooked.. I would love to visit the joint more often and have already suggested it to max of my foodie friends.. ‚ù§
Now coming to the owners.. They are such amazing people and so friendly that they made me feel at home.. I went there alone and spent 1hour simply chatting with them coz they were so humble and courteous.. üòÅ
Anyway all the best for your future ventures guys! üòÑ

Lovely lovely food! After a really long time, a small startup holds lot of promise.. Amazingly pocket friendly (read no taxes!) and what taste! Do try the Thai herb noodles.. It comes with our very own gondhoraj lebu taste, and bit sweetish. Bbq chicken has a coconut and imli chatni twist, so the thai street food is really indigenous in taste. Their chicken meat balls is a very value for money tasty choice.. And the chicken cheese steamed momo will give its wow momo counterparts a run for their money! (literally)

I am really fond of Thai food and Kingothai serves amazing Thai food. I was very excited when this outlet had opened because it provides Thai food and it is open near my house.
I truly love the Veg Phaaaad Thai and Veg Thukpa. It was delicioussss.
Thankyou Kingothai in general and the team in particular.
Cheers! Keep us the good work!
