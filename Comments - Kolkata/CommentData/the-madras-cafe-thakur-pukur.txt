We ordered food from this place via a food delivery app. We ordered the very basic of items, masala dosa (INR 35) and sambhar vada (INR 30). 
The prices are very reasonable. The packaging was good, but the food taste wasn't. The potato filling of the masala dosa tasted just like boiled potatoes with minimal spices, there was no flavour. This was disappointing as most people who order a masala dosa, relish their potato filling.  Also, the sambhar provided was watery and without any flavour- no spices, no tempering, not even of tamarind. The taste of the sambhar actually reminded me of the dal that used to be served in railway meals back in the day. Thank God, that has improved! Now coming to the sambhar vada, 2 vadas (the kind that goes in dahi vada) came in each plate of it, but they were soaked in sambhar. The vadas had flavour of their own, thankfully, but as they were soaked in that horrid dal, they turned soggy by the time it was delivered. 
The rating is purely based on the packaging and the price point. If I were rating only based on flavour, it would have gone down further. I have also attached a couple of pics. For a south-Indian restaurant, it is essential to get your basics i.e. idli, dosa, vada and sambhar right. For us, 3 out of these did not work out.
