This restaurant is situated next to Dreamland nursing home and its one of the hidden gems of North Kolkata in Chinese food. Tried their Egg chicken Hakka noodles, chicken gravy noodles and chilli chicken dry. All the items were good both in quality and quantity.
The entrance of the restaurant may disappoint you. The ambience of the restaurant is not so good but it will not bother you. The ground has a small dining place whereas 1st floor is much bigger.
But the moral of the story is they serve a good quantity of delicious Chinese dishes at a very reasonable price. One should visit the place once.

I have been here for quiet a few number of times . This is a great place during festive seasons,otherwise I wouldn't recommend this place because their sale is pretty low except the festive seasons and hence the items are usually not fresh. Onnce I ordered mixed fried rice and sweet sour chicken and the chicken was hard and seemed to be one two days old. But the quantity of the food would compensate their quality. During durga Puja i visited again and this time they reduced the quantity. But the quality was much better.

Let me start reviewing this outlet by its unpleasant entrance. It is a very poor standard restaurant though menu price matches higher standard Chinese restaurant. They served us Hong Kong chicken with only one piece of chilly chicken in shredded form. Believe me it was only one standard chilly chicken type chicken piece they served us in this dish with the expense of 170 rupees. Even having street foods is far better than go to this place. Even I have complained about this poor quantity of food on spot but they did not even bother.

Do not plan to visit anytime near future. I do not really consider negative reviews my thing, but Sanghai, with the missing 'H' will disappoint your in more than one occasion. Anyways, my intention was to try out a new restaurant, low budget, and was not planning for fine dinning, nevertheless I wasn't prepared for Sanghai. Not much to cover, just bad food, bad service and bad ambience. 1.5 stars because the AC was working and clean utensils.

P.S. Try their manchow soup and you will be in for a surprise, but make sure you have tried manchow somewhere else before or else you won't know the difference.

A small eatery tucked in a narrow lane near Shyambazar 5 point crossing. Minimal decor, but have a comfortable seating arrangement with AC. Service is friendly and moderately fast.

We have tried Mixed gravy noodles, Mixed rice, Garlic chicken and Szechwan chicken. If you are not comparing with the old China Town restaurants, taste of food here is really good. The amount served is good too. Price is pocket friendly. A good place to hang around with friends and enjoy tasty but budget food.

A humble chinese joint which serves delicious chinese food! I have visited this restaurant for a couple of times, but have ordered home delivery for quite a few times, i would say they score perfectly in the noodles section and some of the chicken preparations are lip smacking. If you stay nearby shyambazar give them a call and they will home deliver your food. Its a saviour for sundays with cricket matches :)

A shabby restaurant mainly popular among the locals. My friend insisted me many times to have their food but I was not at all impressed visiting the restaurant. The entrance, the door doesn't really give a positive vibes nor the interior specially the 1st floor sitting arrangements. Since it was post 6 we were allowed to seat in the 2nd floor which was far spacious as well has a well equipped AC along with little fans over the tables. We ordered one mixed gravy chow mein and soon to your delight it was served by 10 mins. And then I realized why this place is so famous.. Its solely and undoubtedly the food and nothing else. The quantity was enough for 2 person and there were ample of chicken egg and prawn with the perfect combination of chow mein and gravy. We were so hungry and the food being so delicious that we ordered one more of the same dish and ate down the whole. The service is fine though nothing to brag about. I have deducted a little bit of point because when the food is so good they can really work and even have ample scope for hygiene, let alone the ambience. The last surprise came when they didn't change us any GST taxes although being an AC restaurant. Now that is something truly unexpected and we were happy to the fullest. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED for a good cheap wholesome Chinese meal if you are here somewhere in the lanes of North Kolkata. üòäüòäüòä

Sanghai belongs to one of the oldest and most pocket friendly Chinese joint north calcutta can offer you. I remember me and my friends checking into this place often during my high school and college days. A very ordinary one, with old interiors, okayish ambience this one is certainly not something you-have-in-your- wishlist places. The only thing worth mentioning is the food they offer at such low prices. Do try the Shangai special dry chilly chicken and Chicken 65.

This has one of its small branch or outlet (don't know what it is) Sanjivani Cabin, just at Fariapukur more (opposite to Aminia, Hatibagan)
Had moglai paratha and chowmein there...which were good ...
But the fried rice wasn't very satisfactory...

 And the main restaurant which is inside a lane beside Dreamland nursing home provides a satisfactory chinese food. Ordered chow and chicken, the chicken tasted brilliant but the chow lacked its essence  and spiciness since we ordered schezwan chow.

Visited this place after queuing on famous restaurants like Aminia and Arshalan in the area. The waiting time was just too long for us to wait out on a peak durga puja night. We were a group of eight and when we were hungry myself and a friend found this place quite decent and next table ready within 10mins of time. 

The place does not have a great ambiance like you will remember for a long time. It's more like a secret, hard to locate, cozy,

We ordered for all Chinese foods. Two portions of chicken rice. One with egg and one mixed. Both of them were satisfactory. 

Among the side dishes we opted for chicken Manchurian, chicken Szechwan. Both side dish came with eight pieces of chicken as promised.

One downfall was that they don't serve drinks even the soft ones. So on a useful note, buy cold drinks from outside . management have no issues with outside drinks.

We enjoyed thoroughly the entire dinner time.

Will visit again.

Located somewhere in Shyambazar have been in Sanghai several times. Hakka chowmein always lived up to the marked. Have tried #ChikenHakkaChowmein & it was good. Chilly chicken was good. However I'd recommend not to try any fish item here. I've tried #ChillyFish and it wasn't up to mark at all. Also have tried Hong Kong chicken yesterday, but it was not at all good. 
Lastly I'd recommend try basic Chinese items here and North Calcutta er ekta feel er sathe pabe kichu quality time.

my heartiest thankx to zomato for helping us to find some good small hidden restaurant in our city that are far better from some so called big famous joint ..this is undoubtedly one of those,no ambiance no decoration but clean decent joint with some good food .. located near dreamland nursing home opposite k.c.das in shyambazar, you have ask local person ,a little difficult to found.. anyway now come to the main part - FOOD,. me and my friend both were very hungry,we ordered chicken chowmein, chicken fried rice, manchurian chicken, sanghai chicken, one of each plate. every item tasted very good specially chowmein and dry sanghai, really good, perfectly tasted.. both quality and quantity was very satisfactory, we literally have to struggle to finish our meal..¬† food of this small hidden joint made me smile ,and it gets bigger when we pay just¬† around rs-550/-. for this "mohavoj". worth the money .. if u are in shyambazar area and want some good food rather than decoration ,try this place . at this price it is one of the best u could find .. looking forward to go back again.. happy eating :)

Serves quality and delicious chinese food at reasonable prices. it is the best chinese restaurant in and around shyambazar. The only disadvantage is i have never been able to finish one dish myself:-P .....the amount served in one dish is really huge:-)

Visited this place after queuing on famous restaurants like Aminia and Arshalan in the area. The waiting time was just too long for us to wait out on a peak durga puja night. We were a group of eight and when we were hungry myself and a friend found this place quite decent and next table ready within 10mins of time. 

The place does not have a great ambiance like you will remember for a long time. It's more like a secret, hard to locate, cozy,

We ordered for all Chinese foods. Two portions of chicken rice. One with egg and one mixed. Both of them were satisfactory. 

Among the side dishes we opted for chicken Manchurian, chicken Szechwan. Both side dish came with eight pieces of chicken as promised.

One downfall was that they don't serve drinks even the soft ones. So on a useful note, buy cold drinks from outside . management have no issues with outside drinks.

We enjoyed thoroughly the entire dinner time.

Will visit again.

Located somewhere in Shyambazar have been in Sanghai several times. Hakka chowmein always lived up to the marked. Have tried #ChikenHakkaChowmein & it was good. Chilly chicken was good. However I'd recommend not to try any fish item here. I've tried #ChillyFish and it wasn't up to mark at all. Also have tried Hong Kong chicken yesterday, but it was not at all good. 
Lastly I'd recommend try basic Chinese items here and North Calcutta er ekta feel er sathe pabe kichu quality time.

my heartiest thankx to zomato for helping us to find some good small hidden restaurant in our city that are far better from some so called big famous joint ..this is undoubtedly one of those,no ambiance no decoration but clean decent joint with some good food .. located near dreamland nursing home opposite k.c.das in shyambazar, you have ask local person ,a little difficult to found.. anyway now come to the main part - FOOD,. me and my friend both were very hungry,we ordered chicken chowmein, chicken fried rice, manchurian chicken, sanghai chicken, one of each plate. every item tasted very good specially chowmein and dry sanghai, really good, perfectly tasted.. both quality and quantity was very satisfactory, we literally have to struggle to finish our meal..¬† food of this small hidden joint made me smile ,and it gets bigger when we pay just¬† around rs-550/-. for this "mohavoj". worth the money .. if u are in shyambazar area and want some good food rather than decoration ,try this place . at this price it is one of the best u could find .. looking forward to go back again.. happy eating :)

It took some time to locate this little resto even with the help of HERE maps and gps but was definitely worth the try. Cradled in a cul-de-sac    beside Dreamland Nursing Home in Hatibagan, the restaurant is a must try for Chinese lovers. On my first visit I tried Mixed Gravy Chowmein and Dry Chilli Fish. Both the dishes were awesome and value for money. The ambience is very simple and there is no fear of long queues. The waiters are extremely well behaved and service is super fast. Looking forward to more delicious experiences

HIDDEN GEM : Located at a stone throw distance from Dreamland Nursing Home @ Shambazar this average sized joint serves one of the best chinese food i've had in North Kolkata. Me and few of my friends have been frequent @ this place whenever there is a treat party and we do prefer the mixed rice and dry chilli chicken which we love a lot. Serves you very good chinese at very reasonable rate. Highly recommended.

This is the best place to have chinese.. I personally go there often i get chance... though i stay far from the place..
Only prob wid this restaurant is that its too small in size & space.. also not on the main road, need to search a bit (nearby location : dreamland nursing home shyambazar).. or else the quality quantity is fair enough.. would get more happy as earlier if they lower or cut the prices of the foods..!!..

In one word they ensure customer satisfaction.. Take orders for home deliveries as well. Best for chinese dishes in and around Shyambazar.

I ordered a chicken noodle soup...which was okayish,though the portion was a bit small.
The crispy chicken here is a decent option.It was quite tasty. 
Wouldn't mind going back to this place for a bit of a chit chat session.

My college was located near shyambazar so i was a regular visitor of this place.
Location- hatibagan area, fariapukur beside dreamland nursing home ( in a small gully, from its outer appearance its does not seem to be a good restaurent)
Ambience- if you judge restaurents by their ambience, you should not come here. Its just clean and tidy with a.c and a t.v..
Behaviour- waiters are very friendly and attentive.
Serving time- you need to wait a bit for food to get served
Food- just awesome. From soups, to noodles to fried rice to side dishes, evry thing they serve tastes too good and are in ample quantity.
Price- cheap

When I was being introduced to the magical culinary world of Kolkata by my dad, he told me that some of the best Chinese foods of the city are been served by small family owned eateries or on road side stalls. As usual I did not believe him till one day my partner forcefully dragged me in this petite diner.
First of all if you don't know this place you will probably never be able to find it out. But I found the metro to be the most convenient way to reach(from south).
The restaurant is been set up in an old building on a dark alley(literally), lit up with 'christmas light' & a bright neon sign.
Once you enter the place you are bound to feel claustrophobic. There is zero open space & it is made even more cluttered by adding an upper level (yes,they provide a 1st floor for a Lil bit privacy). But the silver lining is that the entire place is air-conditioned.
Coming to the food, they serve only one type of cuisine (which is convenient because you should always be better in one than being good in many).
They give you an array of choices between rice,noodles,chicken & fish dishes.
But the real standout among the menu was their soups. While a variety of soups are been served ,their"Thai soup" deserves a special mention.
It was hearty, it was warm, it was healthy, packed with flavors  & everything a good soup needs to be. A bowl of this on a winter evening with your loved one is just the thing to have.
What I really liked about the place is that they serve everything 'farm-fresh'  & each sauce(or gravy as some may refer) was distinct & distinguishable from other.
They also serve a 'chef special' menu. The ching-chong rice(basically a mix of fried-rice & noodles) from that was really enjoyable.
Among the starters chicken lolypop & crispy chicken are the best one to have in my opinion.
The food I got was full of piquance, well balanced in terms of spice & low on oil. The portions were adequate & enough to feed two hungry souls.
The staffs or staff was cordial & provides almost a personal service to every 'guest'
One word of caution - they don't provide any finger bowl neither I found any basins, so you may want to sharpen your 'knife & fork' skills before visiting.
Final verdict - This is a place which mainly boast on flavors & not on fine dining. It mainly attracts local crowd, college students & local love birds. So if 'carrots crafted like a duck' is your taste, you need to avoide this place. This not the best Chinese you will have in the city but certainly one of the best in this price range.

heard of this place from a friend. its very near to my place. so atlast decided to go there for dinner one evening. what we found was a small shabby place. the place is okay, not that clean but not too dirty also. the waiters are attentive. it has two floors. the ground floor has just a few chairs and tables. so we went upstairs. the 1st floor is just a bit more spacious...just a bit more only. the waiter there informed that the place had been booked for a birthday party celebration from 9pm. it was 8.30pm already. so we ordered for just 3 dishes. 
a appetizer: chicken drumsticks. 
main course: their speciality dish ching-chong rice and a plate of lemon prawn.
the food was pretty good. chicken drumsticks was spicy and tasted too good. ching-chong rice is a mixture of mixed fried rice and mixed chowmein. the quantity was enough, infact more than enough for two of us. the lemon prawn (8 pieces) was also good. we were too full. prices are okay, quality is also good. so i will give a 3.5/5 for the food. but for the ambience, hygiene and maintainence its 2.5/5
I have also ordered for home delivery once.

i am a regular visitor of this restaurant.. this is my nest home :) . price is moderate, taste is good enough, but they delay in service. once the price used to be very low, like 60rupees chilly chicken, talking about almost 8yrs back. but now they have increase their price. very recently increased 20 rupees per plate. as off last month the total experience was really good. but with this increased price i must say that now they  cant justify the price. though not bad but not like as it was 2-5 years back.. but a must try restaurant at a average price.

DELISH BUT BASIC CHINESE FARE!
3 out of 5

Sanghai Pure Chinese Food is a popular food stop for many of the weary shoppers to the Shyambazar and Hatibagan area. The food joint offers pocket friendly food with overwhelming food portions. It is a commonplace restaurant; not the glamorous type like you will find in say Park Street. The furnishings and interiors are plain and ordinary. The chairs and tables are neatly arranged in this small establishment. Yet, one doesn't feel too cramped for comfort in their very small sitting area. The service is always the same; the servers are attentive to the needs of the customer and are very prompt at meeting their serving time with the least amount of time wasted. For this reason, the food served is always fresh and piping hot. 

As far as possible, they prepare pure Chinese food, but at other times their fare is comparable to the Indian Chinese fare served in some of the pati Tangra restaurants. Having said so, the food is delish and excellent in taste. Some notable and most sought after items are their soups and the meat dishes. Actually, a lot of the items mentioned in the menu are popular due to the low prices of the dishes and the generous quantity they serve rather than the quality of the food.

Yet, some dishes do need mentioning in this review simply for their immense power to tantalize our taste buds. Some of the tantalizing options served here include Chicken 65, garlic chicken, chilli prawn and Manchurian fish. These can be followed by noodle and fried rice staples like Sichuan mixed gravy or Hakka chow, Sichuan mixed fried rice and their very tangy American chopsuey.

Cost effective and fairly priced food items are offered by this very ordinary and old establishment. People leave with their food cravings satisfied with a cheap and wholesome meal from this very small and ordinary eatery.

I've been there with my friends lots of time during our visit to shyambazar / hatibagan. we opted for this place because of the quality they served earlier.but now a days q from the word quality is missing.
This place is not for so called ambiance lovers(as i'm not an ambiance freak).
Earlier both the quantity and quality is good but gradually its down. Quantity is still good but as i said earlier that quality is surely let you down.
Price more or less fine as compare to quantity they serve.
Staff behavior is not an issue as their are hardly 2 or 3 boys to serve.
Just because of the good old memories give this restaurant 2. 
Hope they w'll bring back those authenticity to their quality or at least justify the name of their restaurant.
