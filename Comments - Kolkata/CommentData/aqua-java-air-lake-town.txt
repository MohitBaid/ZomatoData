This amazing rooftop restaurant is nearby the fake big Ben of lake town..we spent a sunny winter afternoon there soaking up all the goodness of the amazing menu.
Crispy chilli paneer, taco with a twist,and some of the good'ol milkshakes we tried and not at all disappointed.
Surely visit this place again.

A vegetarian cafe located near Laketown clock tower, VIP crossing, I went here because it's rooftop! The ambience is pretty inside with bright lights and comfy sofas and chairs and spacious area with good music. The rooftop area was however not well lit and there was a party going on so we sat inside. The service is good, staffs are nice.
What we had
~classic cheese fondue- they lit a candle at the base of the cheese sauce container to keep it warm and the sauce tasted like white sauce in pasta. The bread croutons were perfect and soft. It was my wish to taste a cheese fondue somewhere and hence I ordered it but I found nothing very unique or impressive. Maybe that's how it tastes and so it's not for me!

~blueberry cheesecake- this was impressive. The cheesecake was set and cut perfectly, it tasted nice; the base layer, the cream cheese, the sauce and the berries-everything was yum but I found it a little hard but I guess I can ignore that given the other plus points! The cream cheese could have been a bit more flavourful too.

The prices are pretty reasonable. GST charged is 5% and 10% service charge is added.

For the items we had, it's good for a one time visit.

A nice place to hang out with friends and family. Brownie points goes to the location. The roof top setup of the cafe adds charm. The view from rooftop is incredible in the evening. The clock tower and the entire city life is visible up from there. It is a great option for vegetarians but being a non vegetarian, I am highly disappointed. The cafe could have offered us some non-vegetarian options as well. We ordered a pizza peri peri and a chocolate mud cake. Both tasted good. I had an exclusive coupon from BookMyShow which was valid for only 31st Dec and 1st Jan of buy one get one cappuccino. The staff denied to accept the coupon. In my opinion such tie-ups should not be done in the first place when you are not ready to accept that later on. Please take care of your customers convience and take appropriate action on it.

Been here 2-3 times,  the ambiance is great its divided in 2 portions -  indoor and outdoor both are great.  Staff is well dressed and great at the service.  Coming to the food the first time i loved the lasagna so went again for it but this time it wasn't that great. Coffee and mint mojito and also good.
But all the aqua java charge a 10% service fee on the bill amount (even though the government doesn't allow this).  Plus they are charging excess for water (Rs. 30 for approx half a liter - again against the government rules whish should be approx Rs. 10 for half a liter of mineral water).

Ambience: Vegetarian cafe located near the Big Ben at the Laketown area. It's an open air cafe which is situated at the roof top of a building. There are open air spaces as well as covered area in case of rains or other problems. There is a separate hookah room. The ambience and the view is simply breathtaking.

Food: The food served here is standard and pretty tasty. However, the absence of meat in the menu makes all the dishes bland. However, that's my personal opinion though. If u are a vegetarian, I guess, u can't expect any better food than this. The presentation of foods are also very apt and attractive.

Staffs: The staffs are well behaved and help u in every steps. Even they arranged me to charge my phone when I told them my battery is dead. Card payment is accepted. Parking is available.

Ambience- It was nice and tidy. As soon as we entered they started playing music. The only problem was that air conditioning was not working properly.

Food- My order was Green apple soda, Tandoori Aloo , veg Au gratin and Chocolate Truffle. Mocktail were refreshing. Tandoori aloo was below average however full marks for plating.Tandoori tasted no where near tandoor.  Gratin was decent. Chocolate truffle was way too sweet. What stand out is mocktail and everything else was average.

Staff- I guess they are best in business . As soon as I enter they gave us menu and a table top which happens to be there new offering. He always kept an eye on us and on our needs.

Verdict- Decent place average food quality. However you may opt for NH Sky lounge which has an edge over this place.

Centrally located near the clock tower in Laketown, this place is easily accessible.  They have both open air and closed air conditioned setting. Restaurant is on the 6th floor. Lift would take you up till the 5th floor and rest on foot. Food is good, view is very very good, staff is ok, music is louder than required. Visited this place twice both for dinner and not been disappointed. Their truffle shake is a must try. Good place for couples, friends and family outings.

If you want to chill out with your friends and family this is a cosy place with rooftop view and comfortable sofas...but if you are a foodie and want to visit this place...don't!!! Kitkat shake was too sweet, French fries were dull and a certain jalapeno cheese balls was just pathetic with 5 pieces! Food certainly not up to the mark!

1. The decor and ambience is the main attraction. Beautiful rooftop view. But could not access it for long due to rain. The interior is also nice with comfy sofa seats.

2. Food is pretty good. We ordered lasagna which was cheesy and the shakes are also nice.

3. Price is a bit on the higher side considering the small portions of food.

** Charged 150rs tax on 500 Rs bill. That's 30%. So beware of that.

4. Staff are okay. But the waiter was constantly serving us others' orders by mistake. Maybe he was having a bad day.

5.you can also smoke on the rooftop.

Overall this is a nice place to go for a romantic lunch/dinner.

The beverages are sub standard and their service has been pathetic, again thanks to their uncourteous staff. Moreover, going against the rule, they charge a service charge for such poor quality of food and services. Hate this place completely and never visiting again.

It is located on the top floor of the Udichi nursing home building near VIP Laketown bus stop. Unfortunately we didn't get seat in the open area. So we had to settle inside of the restaurant. Ambience was cozy, music little louder. We liked their coffee and pasta. Pasta were cheesy which we prefer. Staff were cordial. They take 10% service charge extra. When we asked about this they simply said they are charging it at every outlet as per order of their management.

I wish I could give this 0 rating. Because a place like this doesn't deserve to get even 1 rating.
The most pathetic place I have ever visited.
Firstly the food was very bad. I ordered for gratin. They don't even know how to make gratin. Cheese on it was pathetic and it only had peas full of it. Such a pathetic taste it was. We had a bill of 500. If someone is opening such a big cafe they should have change with them. We gave them a ₹2000 note and they didn't have change. We waited for 10 mins thinking that they are arranging for change. Then we asked again and they were like we don't have change. Not every person uses credit cards and paytm. They were like that you can come tomorrow and collect the 1500 change. How can we believe someone we don't even know. I remember the exact words they said "Ki humara pure din ka 1500 bhi ni hua toh change kahan se de". For obvious who would come to such a place. And then they had 1500 in their cash counter. After making us wait for 20-25 mins they gave us the money. Such an irresponsible and rude staff. I would really suggest people not to go here.

Its a veg cafe. Their plus point is the outdoor sitting arrangement. Quite good and nice place to hang out when its not raining! The whole size is quite small but they have managed to make it look good in every perspective which is truly appreciable. Can introduce more variations in their menu. Price is ok but towards the high end. Food quality is good. Staffs are helpful very much. What i actually didn't like is though they were having a display unit with their cakes but there was no option to choose as they were only having one or two cakes in it. They served the bill in a mug, tried to make something different but again failed, as it was served in a totally broken cup and one can easily notice the gum they used to repair that. My suggestion would be if you are actually not very much sure about the tools that u gonna show case in front of your customers then don't use that! A normal procedure of giving bill would be much appreciable than using a broken cup.

They has perfect set up & sitting arrangements for both inside & rooftop.. You can come with your family & kids too , they'll love it too.. Cmng back to the food.. We ordered passion fruit soda & strawberry soda.. passion fruit was something new and it's tastes sweet nd yum.. Then in starter we had babycorn.. it was good.. For the main course we ordered Fried rice , Paneer Manchurian though they don't have veg manchurian in their menu & that was very disappointing.. And lastly we had classical pasta in mixed sauce with veggies.. it tastes good nothing new in that & the mixed sauce was too thick.. Overall is was a good experience.. only service needs to be improve.. I'll love to visit this place again..

Located amidst the crossroads of Lake Town, this place overlooks the newly built Big Ben. The location cannot be more perfect for Lake Town people. These are such rare occassions when I come straight from South Kolkata to such distant place. Inspired by the newly formed trend of rooftop cafes, this place is beautifully designed at a rooftop giving a classic view of the scene outside. It has both inside sitting as well as outside seating option. We chose one closer to the outside view. Our satisfaction of coming to a nice looking place was shortlived when the food arrived. It was dissapointing. Perks to them that they served Jain food, but coming to the taste it was okayish. Crispy Chilli Babycorn was not crunchy. Jalapenos Cheese Balls was good. Pasta Ala Pesto was undercooked and had lack of salt which undermines the actual taste. Four CHeese Pizza was also dissatifying. Ultimately we ordered Chocolate Mud Cake to soothe our stomachs, and I would say our meal ended with a good taste. Green Apple Mocktail is a must order. Overall service and ambience is good. But needs huge improvement in the main factor i.e. food.

This is a cute little place which is a little easy to miss if you are searching for it on the road but from a little distance it can be seen on the terrace between lake town and bangur.. Its an open air cafe with a view of the vip road. The food here is all but non-veg.. Sorry folks only veg available here but that is cooked to absolute perfection.. Its a good place for a coffee and à quick snack.. The indoor is also nice especially during the cold season.. Its generally not crowded for a little veg gem hiding in plain sight.. The sandwiches here are wonderful. People headed for CCD, this is a break from that monotonous place..

Yesterday evening i visited this place with a good hope for a nice evening. Its hot and humid summer in kolkata but to my utter shock none of the ac's in the restaurant were working. To manage this issue they had a pedestal fan moving inside. Next comes food the gratin we ordered was really good Atleast the food didn't disappointed but the drink did. With mojito ice tea it was too sweet to engulf. Finally i dont recommend this place due to lack of maintenance of one fine property which we thought it would turn out to be.

One of the best places to chill with friends on a rooftop. It has a nice view of "Kolkata ka aapna Big Ben." 
PS- Don't go with the name of Aqua Java a think it will oviously have hookah, because it doesn't!

Went to this outelt of aqua java for an evening chat in the open air lounge section. The place though done nicely recently needs a lot of maintainance , the outdoor seats were dusty and specially the private couple area had dirty white curtains ,the indoor area was more appealing though. The food we had , a lasagna and a mud pie were quite good , i love the mud pies at aqua java . The mocktails , passion fruit and mojito failed to impress. An average experience overall. Staff needs to be more informative.

A good rooftop to hangout. It gives a pleasant view of the VIP road & definitely the clock tower ~ attraction of Lake town. Coming to the ambiance, yes both the internal & external areas are ecstatic. The decorations were charming in & out added with the music. We have ordered true blue, passion fruit, crispy chili corn & bruschetta. Food - Quality was good & quantity was sufficient. Staffs were helpful & trained. Service was quick. A lovely time spend with a dear friend. Would like to visit again.

We ordered two Moroccan mint teas, we found out later that the order was basically hot water with tea bags. The fries we ordered came ten minutes after our teas had turned cold from the blast of the fan. They lacked salt and the miniscule amount of dip was presented in a

Place is well decored but lacks basic hygiene. AC does not cool the place too well and so they have fan blowing air all over you.  80 bucks for dip tea and French fries (read unsalted) served in a bowl with dip that looks hastily assembled. Moreover, you get water only if you ask for it. Complete shocker!!!

A good place for hang out. The rooftop gives a beautiful view of the VIP road and lake town . Located close to the VIP Lake town more. This place is a great place to catch up with friends or have a romantic evening. They have a good decor and fortunately the day I had been there it had a pleasant breeze blowing so I had a great time. 

Coming to the food we ordered the chili wai wai and the crispy baby corn. The dishes had sufficient quantity and we're Happy with the taste too.

The iced tea could be better. 

Overall a good experience.

A great place to hangout in this locality but cant rate it more than 3. This is because staff is not well trained. They have ad on valentines sprcial menu but no one could explain it. The open space can only be used in winter. Moreover its not well maintained. Dirty...lights are good but ambience and seating not good. Menu is all torn due to rain. Service is slow. No hookah. 
#hazlenut coffee: lacked hazlenut flavour
#brownie java- was good. 

Overall just ok.

Okay, this place wasn't a good experience. The food was average. Pizza wasn't up to mark, only the kit kat shake was nice. We sat in the terrace portion of the cafe and all I could see was lizards crawling on the walls. There are several other terrace cafes in Calcutta but I have never seen lizards crawling there. If only the management could pay attention towards all these issues, it would make the cafe a better place to dig in.

Visited this place on 1st of this year. After a lazy afternoon me and my cousins thought of paying a visit to this place. Its located near Lake town and its a roof top cafe. I loved the ambience. Coming to the food, its a vegan cafe. We ordered Crispy chilli corn, Ala pasta, Tossed mashrooms, Paneer tikka sandwich , Sichuan baby corn, noodles, Shake (forgot which one)and chocolate mud cake. I must say the food is amazing here. I really liked each and every dish. Chocolate mud cake was my favourite and it can give foodgasm to anyone. Service was also quite good.

This Place is right at the crossing of lake town and vip road . Its a roof top restaurant where you can get a good view of the surrounding areas .   You can hang out with friends here or can even throw a small party . They have a separate room for small parties  . The service is a little slow I must add.  The food served is good and the portion size is also adequate . Pricing is a lil on the higher side .
 Would suggest people to try it out once if they are in this area .

In the last day of the year, when you forgot to book your paas for new year events...You seems pretty helpless. Needless to say that nobody wants to sit idle inside their house particularly last evening of the year. Hence we come out from our room and just went for a walk near lake town in between the lights for Christmas celebration's... We found this hang out place. This is in the 5th floor of a building and it's near to the bus stop. Few young people were there. They have open air sit-in arrangements along with a indoor one. The decor was nice and going easy with that location.you can see the clock tower from your couch. For new year they have a new menu and we opted snacks and apeitizer. The serve a coffee with mushrooms and a plate of masala nachos. Sincerely nacho preparation was not up to the mark but that coffee was a decent one. Moreover it is a perfect hangout place in the middle of the city.

This place has absolutely amazing view from the rooftop.. The only thing that could be a turn off is it only has veg dishes. But then again if someone for a change wants to try out veg along with a soothing atmosphere then this is the best place to try out! One plus point this place offers a special arrangement for couples, and I was lucky to experience this! :) They beautifully made a special arrangement as my boyfriend wanted to give me a surprise. They decorated the place with balloons, rose petals and candles which just made me awestruck!

Soothing ambience, right atmosphere, delicious food and good music sets your mood.
Good place to chill out with friends and is not too high in pockets.
Truffle shake is highly recommendable.

But everything was in vain when we saw service charge to be included in the bill and the moment we paid them by deducting the amount of service charge, the real identity gets into the picture. We all know the new resolution which is passed where the customers can pay the service charge at their own discretion but when we decided not to pay the amount of services charge (no matter how small the amount was) they forced us to pay. On further arguments, they agreed of knowing the new resolutions passed by the government but gave a futile reason of no upgradation of rules from their head office. We were told to have a talk in the head office. Having done that, initially we were told that we won't be waived off by the amount but seeing our adamant attitude they had to agree with us. Therefore, I would request everyone to see your bill amount properly before paying and take a stand for your decision.

Location: pretty close to lake town. The view of clock tower is beautiful. 
The food quality is pretty much the same across other aqua java outlets. Wai wai bhel and pasta is a must. Cheese fondue was great. 

I tried the chilli garlic fried rice, it was a bit dry but tasty. 
Dessert included chocolate mudpie, which was again very very dry. It could have been better. 
The best experience was a lightning fast service , which is very scarce these days.

However I wish they worked a little more on the quality of food like they have worked to make the ambience appealing. I wish they train their staff to be a little more decent and cooperating. I also wish they do not make their menu overpriced.

Cafes in our city has a monotony within its own variety. Either it has to be a theme based one or lacks privacy. One of the main reason obviously is "space". This cafe in that whole sense is a complete relief. An open air rooftop with moderately enlightened portions sometimes needed in our busy lifestyle. The right story could be unveiled with a cup of hot hazelnut mocha when you're seeing the whole neatly decorated Laketown area down through the long glass walls of the terrace. I'm a big fan of this place which offers me a good privacy even when I'm in a cafe, and with a near perfect proportion. Foodwise it serves only veg, I'm okay with it since I enjoy every bit of it here.

Located on the roof top just near to the clock tower gives this place an edge over other restaurants due to this ambience, location and atmosphere. But you cann't only rely on ambience when it comes to restaurants. The food quality was average, though the presentation was good. Service is very slow. The open air space can only be utilised during winters in kolkata, rest of the time it is useless due to kolkata's humid weather. The Mocktail were good. The only aqua java which doesn't serves hookah, i mean aqua java started and gained popularity due to hookah. S this place is attracting crowd cz in this area there are not many place to hangout.

Located in the fifth floor of a building in lake town,this place has beautiful ambience.The roof top seating arrangement is highly appreciated.There is a separate special section in the roof top which you have to register with Rs. 2500.The interior decorations is also amazing.Specially in the evening,the place is lit with beautiful lighting which stole our heart.

Coming to the food,we ordered crispy tossed mushroom which was well cooked and delicious.We took peri peri pizza which was pretty good too.

We ordered hazelnut mocha and kitkat shake.But to our disappointment,they did not have shakes at that time.So in replacement of kitkat shake,we took cafe irish cream but again they informed that they do not have the cream.We finally took a green apple soda which was average.This was very disappointing.The hazelnut mocha was amazing ❤

The service was good but it can be a bit better.

Overall it was a decent place and the experience can be a lot better if they can avail everything enlisted in their menu.One can definitely go there once in a week for the coffee and ambience alone.😊😊

Ambiance is obviously an important factor, but can this be the sole reason for visiting a cafe/restaurant?
Well, I say 'NO'!
Here's my experience - When I asked for drinking water, a bottle of mineral water arrived on my table. Since I didn't want a packaged drinking water at that point of time, I asked for regular drinking water. And the response was, " Madam, we do not have regular drinking water?"
Like really? Mind it guys, they do not have free drinking water...even if you want a sip, you will have to PAY for WATER. How pathetic is that?!

Visited the outlet on ashtami evening.Surprisingly it was not too crowded and we luckily got ourselves seats for 7.Its located on the 5th floor of a building with a separate place for open air and ac compartment. Although being a Veg cafe,it had a number of choices tp choose from.We had baby corn,pasta and fondue along with ice lemon and blue as drinks. All tge items were pretty decent although I had a particular liking for the baby corn which was cooked tp the right amount with it being crispy and the perfect amount of vegetables by it.
Overall liked it and plans to visit the outlet again.
Happy pujo and happy dining!!

Full marks for their ambience and decor but food is so so. Really really average or lower. Beverages are slightly better. Had ratatouile and veg augratin with two mocktails which i dnt remember. The chocolate fondue with fresh strawberries and on a burning plate was a great dish although. Savoured it.
One more complaint is there was this beatiful setup on the corner of the terrace but it was cordoned of as reserved. We were there for most part of the evening but no one was allowed there.

In spaghetti alio olio there was no flavour of alio(garlic) coz they have used the preserved garlic which was dipped in Venigar, then came the khow suey which was the worst thing I ever had, the mohito  had 7-8 big rings of ice because of which the quantity of the drink was less than half of the glass, and finally came the desert chocolate mud ...... Instead of crushed brownie it was the 10 Rs chocolate cake we usually get in local market which was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream n little bit of chocolate sauce which did not even wet the cheap cake...... Over all the experience was horrible, i would never visit and recommend it to anyone...... I would have given it minus ratings

amazing place! beautiful ambience! the view from the open space is really nice and well to go!! great place for couples to go on a romantic date as the view adds to the aroma. glass walls gives the beauty to the plce, curtains maintains the privacy.
 good for b'day parties, family time or just a hangout with friends. 
was again a special one. got the place decorated specially. and it was beautifully done. plus, food is also rally good which goes for every AJ outlet.

pasta and cheese fondue being a special mention. and the mojito!! :)

Full marks for their ambience and decor but food is so so. Really really average or lower. Beverages are slightly better. Had ratatouile and veg augratin with two mocktails which i dnt remember. The chocolate fondue with fresh strawberries and on a burning plate was a great dish although. Savoured it.
One more complaint is there was this beatiful setup on the corner of the terrace but it was cordoned of as reserved. We were there for most part of the evening but no one was allowed there.

An amazing place to visit, a perfect outing place with friends and family.The view from the top is wow. A place without alcohol and hookah.The food and peaceful atmosphere are very much compatible to each other. Been here once, ordered paneer tikka and potatoes on the pot and those were tasteful. A good place to visit :)

So finally I visited this place yesterday after a long wait....thanks to my Friend's Surprise Birthday Party. First time ever I experienced going to a café/lounge at 9AM in the morning.....well it was booked that way. So, we had the entire place to ourselves only which was actually great!!

The place is simply amazing!! It's got 3 separate seating areas - 2 indoors and 1 outdoor. The outdoor place is awesome. Situated on the 5th floor, it has got a beautiful city view. The great Clock Tower in Lake Town can be seen right away. There are comfortable couches and a couple of swings as well as other seating arrangements too. It's just perfect. The indoor areas are pretty nice as well. One of them being perfect for private booking if you are in a big group.

Coming to the food, well our order had been placed earlier (save the drinks) for the party of course as it was just 9 in the morning. We had tried a wide variety of delicacies which included;

Cappuccino
Kit Kat Shake
Espresso
Masala French Fries
Spiked Nachos
Cheese Garlic Bread
Cheese, Olives and Jalapeño Toast
The Traditional Ratatouille
Classical Pasta
Pizza Peri Peri

Each of the item was pretty good!! The Cheese, Olives and Jalapeño toast was exceptionally yummy and also the Nachos...the dips were too good!!

Overall, a really really nice place to hang out. I just loved it!!
PS: Planning my next Birthday Party over here!! 😊

The brand “Aqua Java” was the first of its kind café in city which brought about the shisha culture to its frontier and where it stands in the lives of teenagers in present times. The concept of a hookah parlour was put forward by them in early 2011 at one of their first outlets at Mani Square mall. From there and since then, the shisha culture caught the youth by storm and soon spread all over the city and Aqua Java reached all corners of Kolkata through a number of outlets. However, with the rise of this new culture, there was also a rise in the number of worthy competitive cafes of similar nature and sadly Aqua Java now is finding it difficult to cope with the competition.

In recent times, a lot of stylish franchises of the brand have up in various areas. These, although having the same brand name, are different in themes and the kind of service they provide. One such outlet is Aqua Java Air. It’s a pure vegetarian café and the most surprising part is that it doesn’t serve hookah. But then that’s the theme here, the place having a much fresher environment and a sense of calmness, as reflected in the name.

The café is located on the terrace of a resident building and is divided into three sections – indoor seating, open terrace and the private party room. The ambience is very nice with the cool breeze flowing through the entire place. Visiting just before the advent of evening will make it a great place for clicking pictures as the terrace area has a posh look and with Kolkata’s version of the Big Ben in the backdrop, your selfies are sure to be a knockout. The scenery around is also beautiful with no taller buildings in the vicinity to block the view.

In one word, the food overall was nothing more than average. The high expectations built up by the showcase and ambience of this place are just limited to those particular areas and do not extend into the culinary section.
On top of this, the prices are unusually high with regard to other similar cafes.

However the place digs a little hole in your pocket

Its a place where you can chill out , listen to some good music and have great food .. The food was amazing , barring the quantity , the quality was of the food was bang on !! Even the north Indian platter was good enough for people who prefer north Indian !! Great place to be .. Keep it up guys .. Strongly recommended :)

I would like to write a detailed review on this.
Long story short,my experience here was very bad.The ambience is good no doubt.
Let's come to the bad part.Why do we go to a cafe in Kolkata which doesn't offer hookah? Right,for the food which pretty much SUCKED.
I had the worst pasta eating experience of my life,it lacked in flavor and was half boiled.The waiters weren't the most courteous lot I've encountered either.I wanted to return and cancel my order however,the manager(who so ewhat appeared to be on a high horse) denied  us.We stayed there for a while and ordered a couple of other dishes which were subpar at best.We just didn't get the value for our money.I would never ever recommend anyone to pay a visit to this place.

Apart from the outdoor seating,,, the cafe also has a private dining room nd a few indoor dining options.... The cabana style seating is ideal for small groups nd from here,, one can get an unobstructed view of the clock tower which is a replica of the Big Ben.... The menu here is a good mix of Indian nd international cuisine with options such as the Greek Inspired Vegetable Salad, Mexican Jalapeno Buger, Masala Papad Cone ,Crispy Chilli Paneer  nd Baklava to name a few......

Nice place. But for that you should know that a place like this exists. Spent about 10 minutes just to know entrance. N atlast found, felt as if its on a terrace of a resident building! The way up is really un cool! But the place is good. "Air" part of it might be unused for most of the part of year! N thanks to the "small Ben", this place has some view!

Very conveniently located, this is one of the best places in town and also the locality Lake Town. Its such a fresh change than all the other cafes with the same concept, also since there is no Hookah here, its best for people who do not prefer Hookah and dont like going to those places. The view is absolutely spectacular from the rooftop, coming to food, everything served is mouthwatering, except that all the shakes are more or less of the same taste, need to get a bit innovative on that part. The service is good as well as the staff are courteous.

Absolutely worth a second visit.

To begin with, NO BEER!!!! I mean come on. The place is on a rooftop of a 5 storey building. The ambience is good. The music is party themed but no alcohol, not even just chilled beer. Its totally unfair. Moreover, its not a place for non vegetarian lovers at all. Its a pure vegetarian eatery. The quality of food is ok. We had gone there yesterday n had ordered jalapeño cheese balls, feta cheese cannelloni n fries with spice. Cheese balls lacked jalapeños n savouriness. The fries, I expected to b dry with sprinkles of dry spice on it to give it that spicy tinge. But to my awe they had turned it into a bowl full of fries curry with tomato sauce n coriander n what not. It was hell to my palette. Drinks were ok. We had ordered mango shake n the truffle shake. We also had ordered the Swiss Cheese Fondue, but trust me I've had a lot better. The place is slightly overpriced compared to the quality of food. The only good point of this place is the view as I can see the Kolkata Clock Tower clearly n can smoke as well. Staff was courteous n friendly n service was prompt.

Well what can I say my friends keep on taking me to Veg joints , this one was cool but the rooftop view and all , weird thing is no Hookah available which annoyed my buddies . Ambience is pretty impressive and the Decor is cool too.
Coming to the food we went for Lime Ice , Greek Inspired Vegetable Salad , Tandoori Paneer Tikka and a good looking Birthday Cake.
Overall a cool experience.

Nice place with a nice view. Great to hangout on a breezy evening. They have a closed and an open section. It seems like a great place for a private party. They also have games for the customers to play. All in all a cool place to visit.

To begin with, NO BEER!!!! I mean come on. The place is on a rooftop of a 5 storey building. The ambience is good. The music is party themed but no alcohol, not even just chilled beer. Its totally unfair. Moreover, its not a place for non vegetarian lovers at all. Its a pure vegetarian eatery. The quality of food is ok. We had gone there yesterday n had ordered jalapeño cheese balls, feta cheese cannelloni n fries with spice. Cheese balls lacked jalapeños n savouriness. The fries, I expected to b dry with sprinkles of dry spice on it to give it that spicy tinge. But to my awe they had turned it into a bowl full of fries curry with tomato sauce n coriander n what not. It was hell to my palette. Drinks were ok. We had ordered mango shake n the truffle shake. We also had ordered the Swiss Cheese Fondue, but trust me I've had a lot better. The place is slightly overpriced compared to the quality of food. The only good point of this place is the view as I can see the Kolkata Clock Tower clearly n can smoke as well. Staff was courteous n friendly n service was prompt.

When you are giving a green tick in the smoking area please make sure that hookah is available.. this place completely disappointed me
We specially went there for hookah. Yes the ambiance is very good but food quantity is very less. Few items were not even avAilable. Who the hell will have an idea that this is the only aqua java with no hookah even though it was mentioned in zomato. Overall disappointed

Sometime back I dropped in while returning from airport. Its a roof top hangout. Honestly the way to the upstairs /  roof gave repulsive feel. However, once you are there, you feel really nice. The ambience is good, food definitely is great. Staff tries all out to make you feel at home. 

Overall, my opinion is, its a decent place to spend time out there.

Its a nice and friendly place and quite laid back for hanging out with friends with tit bits like their options of pasta's,sandwiches,beverages etc....nice decor,the food quality is fine,but not a place for non veg lovers as its a veg outlet,a place for fresh air with the view of Big ben kolkata... But non smokers might face a problem if they sit in the open as you might get the smell of people smoking everywhere in the open place,which I personally felt,for which I could never sit outside in the open air...

All I can say about this new open air Aqua Java is "fabulous". Loved the ambience..the view of the busy VIP road and ofcourse the food. Though a bit spicy but what does one need in a chilly winter evening. Cant wait to go back again...

Ok i did visit the second time .But this time ot was a let down. Didnt enjoy their trademark wai wai at all. The chiili garlic noodle too was ok..and so was the mint mojito. Being on the expensive side...it wasnt worth the money. The quality had deteriorated. 

My 3rd visit was pretty good. We had the crunchie cold coffee which was surprisingly very good. The sczhewan baby corn was ok. It was a bit oily.

Visited this place about 2 months back.. We went late so it was about to close down.. But we got a table for ourselves and ordered.. The honey spiced cajun potato and truffle shake was yumm.. We ordered aqua java's famous yoda soda and a veg au gratin and funghi pizza.. All were equally good. Will definitely visit again for its ambience, paush look, good food and a good time pass!!

Probably one of the best hangouts , cozy interiors , great food and an amazing ambience , what else does one need ? You must try their coffees (especially the espresso) and the mushroom cheese toast . Well the only drawback would be , it being a vegetarian cafe , but its a good choice altogether !

With the Kolkata version of the Big Ben in the back drop, ambience is the reason to visit this place. Cannot think of any other roof top joint in this part of the city. The food quality is also good. Although must mention that this is not a place for main course - Infact they hardly serve any. The mocktails were good. Service was disappointing and the staff could have been more educated on the menu. This is one reason why I have gone for a slightly lower rating that what I would have done otherwise.

We had gone to this place with a lot of expectations but were let down badly. We faced bad hospitality, because the rules of reserved(payable) seats were not mentioned, so we were asked to move which was seen as an insult.  Also the quality of the food ordered was horrible,  leading to our complaint. However the complaint, was not entertained since they did not bother to do anything.

I guess restaurants or cafes on an open terrace always have an default ambiance factor which generally gets accentuated by the winter chills. So brownie points for that..!!

But that is pretty much it.. We did order a variety of stuff from vegetarian Mediterranean platter to lasagna and fondue.. But they were good attempts from an otherwise professional place. The shakes (we ordered three) were almost the same, not worth a lot of words. 

So go there for a coffee and a decent view of the big ben or the some what fast lifestyle of Kolkata and thats it !!

The set ups' good, but the location really kills it. Took me a while to locate it an park my car.
We ordered an handful of plates and drinks as we got really late reaching there.
Drinks :-
Hazel Nut Mocha
Hot Chocolate Italiano
Both were better than what CCD and Barista serves for much reasonable price. In short loved it!!!
Snacks :-
Veg au Gratin with Cheese Garlic bread (awesome and awesome)
Bruchetta (Nice to try)
And winter menu special veg grilled platter, (don't try this - a complete waste)
Thought of ordering one more but as we close to closing time, the waiters started making excuse of non availability - so had to bugger off!!!!!
Still a gr8 experience at the AIR!!! @openRoofTop

The place is jus near the laketown VIP crossing.if people know the service lane it is right on the road ...
It has a big visible board on the 5th floor. It is the most talked about place in the city as it is an open roof top place...
Most fascinating thing is u can see the mimic of the famous built BIG BEN right at the back ..
The best thing about the place is it's ambeaince..it has beautiful soothing environment as well as both open and a cosy interior for being comfortable..the place provides ample sitting area and we'll lit and the interior has a common java feel..
I ordered truffle shake as I am chocolate lover and for me it vl take ur taste buds to a different world..
White sause pasta and garlic bread were like others nothing very great..
So all in all yes u can have a visit as it gves u a good time pass and at the same time u can have a nice time to talk and sit..
To talk about the pocket thing it is similar to all the other java outlests and unlike others they don't have HUKKAH as the name says AJ AIR.. Let's COFEE....

'Aqua Java Air'- the name itself suggests its an open terrace cafe situated in lake town and overlooking one of the best views in kolkata- the newly made clock tower !! I hd visited this cafe on the New Year's Eve and was totally mesmerised by the beauty tht it serves ! Bng the new year's eve the cafe was beautifully decorated with blue tiny lights and thr was a live music gng on which totally added to the new year's celebration. The person singing was too good.. They have both the indoor and the outdoor seating arrangemnt and bng the perfct weather we opted to sit outdoors. The decor of the plc is v good and classy and the seating arrangemnts are also v comfortable. The beige sofas wid colourful cushions and mirror type hangings added a romantic touch! 
Coming to the food we opted for Devil Cheese Fondue and crispy chilli babycorn.. Devil Cheese fondue was dissapointing since neither the dip was properly made nor the breads were upto the mark.. Crispy chilli babycorn was also not that great. Cumng to the drinks we opted for crunchin java which was excellent, oreo shake as per my husband was grt.. A cappuchino which was also fine., we also opted for some iced tea which cud hv bn much better.. As far as food is concerned this plc needs to really buck up and improve the taste of the food that it offers.. Overall grt service and the ambience gts a thumbs up from me !

Situated in lake town and overlooking one of the best views in Kolkata - the newly made clock tower, this place is perfect for chilling with a gang of friends over board games. I had a wonderful time here catching up with some old school friends. 
The only tiny disappointment we faced here is that they don't serve any Sheesha/hookah,  we were quite surprised to hear that after reaching here. 
So the ambience is lovely, open air with comfy sofas, romantic set up with curtains and music(playlist could be better)! 
We settled to order a few coolers and shakes, with loaded fries. The Kitkat shake and chocolate shake were thick and yummy! 
The passion fruit ice tea was good too. I had blueberry cooler which was served in a jam jar, tasted refreshing and wonderful. 
The loaded fries were normal fries with a cheese sauce on the side! I expected the cheese to be drizzled all over, it would've been so much better. Nothing was "loaded" on the fries at all. 
Next we ordered, Cajun spice honey chilli potatoes which we all loved. Hot potato wedges tossed in a sweet spicy sauce. So so so good! 
What's good is they have a couple of board games, Jenga, Uno etc and they also run happy hours till 5pm. Bill came upto almost 750, which is fine. Reasonable enough!
Service is laid back, slightly slow, can be  better! Oh and the lift needs to work else you've gotta climb 5 floors. 
Must visit for random chilling plans over a game of uno with good food. 
Will go back here when I'm in Kolkata next time for sure.

I think aqua Java literally revived itself by initiating an open air project in Calcutta, which is quite scarce in the city. I went there very recently with a friend and I loved the ambiance. It's quaint with dim lights and has a very outdoorsy seating arrangement. The service is efficient and its a very good place in the locality to sit down and have a good conversation with someone. Also the view is very beautiful as it overlooks the newly built clock tower at lake town. We ordered for hot chocolate and a pesto pasta, both of them were good. I just hope they introduce the shisha soon.

I visited this place with my friend this winter and found the place to be a perfect chill-out spot with different sorts of board games to keep yourself amazed and have a quality time, specially if you are a couple or visit with your gang. One must mention is the place has got some view of the replica of Big Ben, that is one of the major attraction of this place. Food was decent but the ambiance and the view is sure to surpass the taste of the food. The service was really good, one thing I would really love to see in future is addition of non vegetarian dishes in the menu along with hookahs. Do give this place a shot and you are sure to love it!!

Aqua Java Air, I really liked their open area sitting arrangements. The view is rather enjoyable and you can see our own mini Ben from the roof. I visited here during the happy hours and the cafe was mostly empty. 
It only serves vegetarian food here and we ordered cutting chai and mushroom of the forest pizza. Food is awesome and the staffs are great too. Especially Debjani, she's awesome! 👍👌
Would love to visit again :)

Visited the place with a friend to spend a quaint winter afternoon.
Couldn't have decided a better place for the purpose.
The view was ethereal with the big ben jutting out mid air at some distance and the jostling crowd of laketown and the footbridge visible from the place.
The sitting was 'chill' and cozy.
They offer a varied collection of indoor games to spend leisure time that includes jenga, uno and chess. But, we were too busy clicking photographs of kolkata silhouette to care about them.
We ordered irish coffee which was warm and strong and the staffs were hospitable too.
To people planning to visit I recommend an afternoon visit to get thr best view of the city as well as to enjoy the happy hours ;) 
P. S.  Adding one of the pics that perhaps define the view best. Taken by my friend

It was on New Year's that we decided to visit this place situated on VIP-Lake Town crossing. Preferred sitting outdoors, where the ambience was quite amazing. Pretty lights, Big Ben in front, decent tables. 
Coming to food, we ordered :

Sichuan Chilli Babycorn - As the name suggests, it indeed turned out to be spicy which made it better and tastier.

Spiked Nachos - Another treat by AJ. Loved the dips.

Quattro Fromaggi Pizza - Tried this following a staff's recommendation. Turned out to be highly disappointing. Didn't even taste like any pizza. Not sure if it actually did contain 4 types of cheese. Became eatable only after dipping it in ketchup. Worst ending to a beautiful night. 

Coming to the staff, they didn't seem to be too cooperative. Given the new year fever, more cooperation was expected from their side. 
This place is a must-visit during evenings with friends. You would be needing extra cash in your wallets as they charge an extremely high tax rate on total billing amount.

This place stands out for its prime location and amazing ambience. They have an indoor seating arrangement and an outdoor one also and we preferred to sit outdoors. The decor of the place is very good and classy and the seating arrangements are also very comfortable.
        Now coming to the food, we tried a few things such as the veg stroganoff, schezwan baby corn, crispy mushrooms and a hot chocolate. I was abit disappointed with the hot chocolate and the baby corn but the mushrooms and the stroganoff stood out! 
                     The service was good but this place charges a service CHARGE of 10 % which is too high i suppose!. Being located at such a prime place, this place has great potential given its amazing ambience. This was our second visit to this place and we were quite happy with our experience over here!

Aqua Java Air,
As the name suggests it is an open terrace café, situated exactly at the (Jessore road & Vip) laketown crossing,one can easily find this place as there is a big board of "Air" on the roof. So keep looking for the "Air" on every roof 😝  we ordered Pizza mushroom of the forest & Cutting Chai, though I am not a veg lover, still I liked the pizza,it was crunchy & tasty,the waiters are all well behaved & very polite, there is a staff called "Debjani", she is the only female staff over there & she is equal to ten other staffs, she is sweet,polite,friendly & helpful..overall a great place & a great experience 💗

on the whole left the rooftop with a bad taste..will think twice before i recommend..

A perfect place for those who want to take someone on a date. Awesome ambience (all bcoz of its open space) , amazing food.
I had Crispy fried mushroom, Hot chocolate Italiano, Lasagna, Peach Ice Tea. Each and every item was equally tasty. 
I recommend this place for everyone.

Dear AJ Air, 

I belong to the RARE species that believes in Googling cooler ways to die instead of PUFFING AWAY TO GLORY. So a big heartfelt THANK YOU for coming up with an actual CAFE and NOT JUST ANOTHER HOOKAH JOINT. :D 

Moving on to the review, let me start with the ambiance. 
Picture this – A slightly chilly November evening, a stunning view of the clock tower, open space, warm cup of coffee in one hand, and laughing my guts out with two amazing friends at God knows what. Bole toh, fantastic ambiance.  

Reviewing the food; based on my order:

Crispy fried mushrooms - too freakin' spicy. 3/5.My bad - I should have asked them to go a little easy on the spice. 

Mexican Jalapeno Burger - Okay, so this sounds exotic - the very reason I ordered this. But tastes very ordinary. One spicy patty with a cheese slice in a bun. A lousy 2/5. 
 Traditional Ratatouille - It was good. But not the 'so-amazingly-good-that-I'll-order-it-again' kind. 3/5 

Note to Self – Either you didn’t order well or AJ Air needs to amp up their food in the TASTE department. 

Cafe Mocha - A perfect, sinful, decadent combination of coffee and chocolate. Need I say more?  

Javalicious - This is just REGULAR cold coffee. Don’t come to AJ Air to have it. Make one at home. :P
Moral of the story - If you are at AJ Air, do yourself a favour and try something different. 

Passion Fruit soda – It was okay.  I will try a different Yoda Soda next time. 

Blended Mint Mocha - The best of the lot that I tried. Do definitely go for it. If you don't like mint, then TRUST ME, you won't taste the mint. (And this is coming from the biggest MINT-AVERSE person in the world, i.e., ME.) 

And finally coming to the service -- it was SUPERB. If I absolutely HAD TO complain, I would say it was a wee bit slow. 
Special mention to the staff - they are polite, friendly and attentive; turned off the music for some time on my request and also escorted us to the elevator. They get brownie points for being so courteous. 

To sum up, AJ Air, among other things, is a great place for the activity that Bengal is famous for – ADDA! :D

Visited on 29th Nov at 6 pm around with my family which includes my 4 year sold son as well . My reviews would be in a kind of good point and bad point simultaneously. Good point is they can be easily located, bad point is parking area is a big mess.The overall decor is very warming but the staffs are not courteous enough to help the guests have their desired seats. We were waiting to sit in the open space but the careless staffs were making the other sit only and until we intervened. Finally got the seats with a small table with 6 chairs . No centre light or lamps on the table. Upon frequent insisting the waiters they cleaned the watery n messy table. Counselling needs to be done for the waiters that they are there to serve the customers. The age should keep one dedicated waiter for one table. Less organised, careless, unprofessional approach. We ordered 2 wait wai noodles, chilli cheese toast, corn kebAb, cafe mocha, cafe latte, one Oreo shake, one kitkat shake,one pizza, cheese fondue . The drinks was thumbs up and upto the mark but again the waters were not swift enough to provide plates, sugar , dips and seasoning. Either they are less informed or lost interest in serving a group of people. Pizza was a disaster . Overall food was good but service for sure needs to be improved .

Worst place to go....ambience good...but u can't enjoy ambience if food quality and service is pathetic... Pizza served was full of oil,and when complained about it..waiters least concerned.. Instead of replacing it they@ took it away Nd billed it. .. Pizza cost us just rs 200..and for this 200they spoiled their repo

Visited this place today .. The place is amazingly done the ambience and interiors are soothing and relaxing .. The food order took some time to come maybe cos the rush but the food tasted amazing. Had ordered the mixed sauce pasta with veggies , Greek special pizza which was really good loved the feta cheese on top .. We also had the Mediterranean platter a little expensive but tasted good different as its not available in other Aqua Java .. In drinks we had crunching Java which was a total bliss ... And soda based they were good too .. And a must try is the mud cake it's perfect for sweet tooth people . 

Overall loved the place perfect weather and a perfect place to visit in the north side.

I had been to this roof top restaurant and the food was awesome. Since I am a vegetarian I liked their Pizzas and Honey Chilli Kanju Patato plus their coffee. The ambience in the evening is too good specially in the back ground there is well lit clock tower, which makes one feel that you are in UK.  I am looking forward to spend some quality time with my family. Service was excellent too.

The food tastes really good specially the oreo mint shake, mojito in drinks and in food Mediterianen platter and panner tikka.. Its was really filling... It has good seating capacity ( private room, outer section which has Cabana was kept reserved don't no why , and inner section )   Loved the outer section as it was cool and pleasant.. And the staffs are very nice...
Would love to visit again.

This place is truly amazing .. Vsisited it for the first time and i was wowed with the ambience the food and the curtious staff. 

Me and my wife had tried the thai green curry which was just perfect with a little of the spice. We also had the scheguan chilli baby corn was ok it was crispy but spicy .. We also had the veg augratin it took a while for them to serve that but it was good tatsed nice but little cheesy. 
We wanted to sit in the cabana but it was packed and the place had waiting. 

But would defenitely recommend my friends and family and would visit again ... And esoecially in laketown having such an amazing place would not want to miss and was deseperately required. 

Rating for 5 is a must. !!! :)

Its a delight to see the view when you enter the space..The food is good and so is the service..but the biggest let down is the lack of sheesha..as it is calcutta does not have open air spaces and with a place like this and not serving hookah is a total crime..however i know that there are legal issues but just going for food to a cafe is no more a trend so unsure how many times would i visit the place though i loved it so much..

Food is also good..we tried tossed mushrooms,peri peri pizza and nachos..one must try their pizzas and mushrooms..overall a nice experience and it's certainly the best option for cafe-freaks in that area..
The addition of sheesha would be an icing on the cake..
Looking forward to some more chilled out evenings during the winters..

This place actually deserves a 4.5 star rating... But 0.5 is deducted as this is a veg joint and I am a hardcore non vegetarian. Otherwise, on my multiple visits, i was stunned by the outdoor sitting and the view from there and the ambience and interior of the AC indoor. The staffs are polite and helpful too...
There foods are so so...the masala french fries was very ordinary or below average. But the Cheese Garlic Toast was
nice. The Coffee or alike are top notch here...the Hazelnut Mocha is creamy and good to taste...the pleasing taste lingers for hours. So as for Cafe Irish Cream. Overall this is the coolest coffeeshop in this part of town.

Mind blowing ambience, yet a very average place. Went there with a friend and ordered - green apple soda, masala chai, honey chilli Cajun potatoes and Fungi pasta. The soda being okay, masala chai was too watery. The tea bag, sugar and milk were provided separately along with a just-warm cup of water, and one tea bag wasn't sufficient for a cup of water and milk. The food, on the other hand was really good. The potatoes were crisp on the outside, with the exact amount of sweetness. The pasta was rich, creamy and sufficient for two. Service needs to be improved though.

Been to this place a couple of times and in love with it. Love the fact that they've kept it as an old fashioned coffee shop sans hookah !! Perfect for a cup of coffee and conversation with yum food. Really liked the honey, Cajun potato wedges. Ambiance was perfect, we sat in the cabana .. Though there's a cover charge, it didn't pinch as we covered it and I liked the little privacy aspect it offers. Two thumbs up !!

The best thing to say about this place is ambience. A winter afternoon with your date , this is where u would love to be. The drinks and salads will surely add appetite to ur taste buds. What put me down was the lasagna , it would have been better if it contained some more layers . Overall its a nice place for a weekend hangout.

There's no doubt that the ambience is mesmerising but what didnot attracted me was the horrible preparation of food the pasta we ordered was completly tasteless, the babycorn was so spicy but the ice cream milkshake which my friend ordered was good......
The staff coeperation was very annoying ,secondly the tax is too high if people are going for their evening snacks......

Nice ambience. Sat in the open air, but the couches inside looked cozy too. Very courteous staff. And the rooftop gives a good view of Lake Town's Small Ben. The food is just 'okay', and I'm being generous. They should have a few more regular items. Loved the veggie cheese wrap though.. They have these little lamps right in the middle of the tables that add to the overall look..

Take the 1st left as soon as u enter lake town towards Bangur and it is located just a little ahead of the rollick ice-cream parlour. 
I was impressed with the decor outside but the indoor section isn't that great. They also have a cabana but u need to atleast make a minimum order for 1200 rs to sit in it. 
The view is great overlooking to the main lake town busy road and preferable to visit after 5 Cz only then you can enjoy the rooftop and cool breeze.  
Service is good though not too prompt. 
Food tastes goood. Presentation is nice and unique and prepared in adequate time. 
The whole plus point of the place is its rooftop setting. 
All in all almost like all aqua java's are. :)

The food was yumm !! I am now literally crazy about their Oreo shake. 
Must definitely try the honey kanju chili potatoes, Thai green curry and the Mediterranean palettes.. Must, is an understatement!

First time visited Aqua Java Air located in lake-Town near the clock tower (BIG BEN).
most importantly the view from air is outstanding as the there is no obstruction and the clock tower looks very nice from up there. Coming to the service and food point of view, the food is good tried peri-peri pizza and honey carjun potato bothe were very nice especially honey carjun potato very different, just that pizza took longer time.. tried the bevreges also truffle shake and green apple both were very refreshing... as it was sunday the service was little slow.

but overall had a very good experiance and looking forward to visit again with family.

Ambience is amazing. Situated just beside deco world of Lake town. Awesome view from the roof top of Aqua java air. Better to visit in the evening or night too. You can go on a date with your loved ones. Cabana is also there, as well as AC room with non AC room. But when I visited they said if you want the section of cabana you need to pay cover charge for that. But I wanted the cabana. So I paid for that. Now let's start the food journey, we had ordered potatoes in hot pot( not at all worth, only they gave two piece), paneer tikka( was not tasty), crispy mushroom, lasagne( stomach filling), devil cheese fondue, cheese garlic bread and in mocktails green apple soda,  blueberry soda, lemon iced tea, Virgin Mojito. Finally it's time for dessert chocolate mud cake( yummy). 
Highly recommended.
Will visit again soon.

i ordered 

loaded fries

honey chili cajun potatoes

bhutte ki kabab( uncommon to me)

greek special pizza

cantonese meal chocolate mud cake 

tiramisu

blue berry cheese cake

all the items are best of quality and taste 

they took a bit time to serve the pizza but when it came in font of me i forgot that it came late, the presentation and taste bound me to vote this cafe.

Newly opened in this area as a cafe. Went there yesterday with one of my friend. I pretty much liked the interiors. But extremely dissapointed with service. Had to wait for atleast 20 mints before getting anything what i ordered. Jalapeno cheese balls were dissapointing. I asked for a kitkat shake to which management replied that it wasn't available. And after a few moments i saw it getting served to a table next to me. Then i ordered for a cantonease meal which i got replaced as it was too salty at first place. Don't fet fooled by reading wifi available over here on zomato. I asked for wifi password to which they replied that is was not for customer. On asking again they eventually did give me the password but the wifi was not working.
Really dissapointed. I really doubt i would drop in here again. Aqua Java plush near CC1 is much much better than this one.

Very nice ambiance, very good food and great value for money. There are both open sitting and also very well Air conditioned area with a clear view of the beautiful Elizabeth Tower. Excellent service and attention by the courteous and energetic team. Brand new fine dining as well as casual eating restaurant. Overall a superb restaurant and the only one of this kind in Lake Town area. Wish you guys keep up this tempo to keep it to this shape all along in future.
Best Wishes to the team Aqua Java Air, Lake Town

-Table service was good. Silver service not so much.
-Food was neither delicious nor bland.
-Quantity of beverages was appreciable.

Cons:
-Their playlist was nothing like their interior. Ambience spoiler it was.
-Quantity of food is matter of concern.
-By pasta cuisine they mean pasta pieces and sauce. Veggies are charged separately.
-Extras like Ice cream scoops are pricey.
-Some of the tables were knee-high, one have to bend for every bite.

Was informed from the attending team, Ayan, that this is a seperate entity from the regular Aqua Java. Don't step in thinking it is a part of aqua java.
They look the same but want to behave differently.
They wont accept your Aqua Java prepaid card.
Nice ambiance..but unfortunate experience so far.

Finally this side of the town has got something to cheer about. Aqua Java AIR doesn't only provide us with amazing good but an outstanding view. One of the best ambiences I have come across . Great food quality and variety . Hospitality and service at its best . Friendly management and staff . All of these factors sum up and makes the place a must visit for all .
