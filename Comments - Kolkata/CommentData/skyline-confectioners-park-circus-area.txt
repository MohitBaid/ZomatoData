Delicious and tasty cakes ‚ô• comes at your doorstep if your house is located near to it.  And If we visit the place they too make live cakes and serves to us if we wait for a while.  Good place for birthday cakes.

Skyline Conifectioners has been around for quite sometime and has become a household name in my family. Their chocolate truffle cake and the mixed fruit cake is to die for. Every item here is vegetarian but even the ones who religiously swear by eggs in their cakes will be converted once they put a heavenly slice of the cake in their mouths. Their pastries and snacks are really affordable and pretty great!

If you ask them for delivery, the delivery person never brings a single penny with him.
I ordered for a black forest cake 1pound that costs 495. Who will keeps 495 change with them? I paid him500 ruppee note. But in return that person argued that he doesn't have 5 ruppee change. This is so weird. In every delivery they do like this n take the extra penny them as a "tip".

Every pastry lover's paradise - please give this place a visit. It has the most succulent and moist cakes, which were not only fresh but also very delicately made. I tasted black forest, skyline special and the blue berry pastry and the black forest was the best black forest pastry I have had till date. Surprisingly cheap and not at all tough to locate, though a bit hidden out.

First got to know about this confectionery when my company ordered a farewell cake from here, they are a regular in this regard. Tasted their truffle cake and was impressed to see the quality and taste we got at such a low price. So i ordered a fruitcake recently and  on request they substituted the pineapple with mango. So it was a kiwi, peach and mango fresh cream cake topped with cherries. Got to say, it would be hard to find such great quality cakes without much pocketpinching! Now it has become my go to place for all celebratory cakes.
Would have given 5 stars if the staff were a tad more courteous.

Not so easy to track but once you have been to this place, I am sure you wont forget it in a long time. The cakes are fresh and super soft and delicious. The biggest plus point for this place is that everything on offer is eggless.
 Probably the best fresh cream and fruit cake that I have tried, the sponge cake being the base was super soft which made the cake even more lip smacking. The Blueberry cheese cake was also excellent and I am sure to visit this place again for its fresh and super affordable stuff....
Cheers to team skyline for the delicious treats.

There is no shortage of elite bakeries in this city.
Kolkata in fact crawls with ample of sensational bakeries. Not all bakeries need to have a grand Brand name to have grand productions. Skyline follows the above genre. I have had most of my birthday cakes from this bakery. The double chocolate truffle cake is all things chocogasmic! I also ordered my sister's wedding cake from this bakery and they made a beautiful red double hearted cake for me.
It was worth the money.

Anywhere you see that light blue and yellow box with skyline written on that, be sure it contains a yummy cake inside.

Went to this place, the Park Circus one, after months of pending my visit. Quite a cozy and hygienic outlet with a simple yet tempting menu. Had onion pizza, red velvet pastry and the choco slice. The pastries were a bit hard and not fluffy but fresh so not a disappointment. The pizza was quite filling and tasty. Decent place for students and other light visitors.

This place is unique as the prices are pocket friendly and the taste is amazing. They are really good. I was a regular customer of their cakes for home delivery. 

But on visiting the shop I discovered there's a great variety of pastries , puddings and savouries. The pizzas are really good, the pizza wrap specially, the hotdog, mayonnaise roll and the breads are really good. I ordered a peach and kiwi cake for my parents anniversary last week. They did a marvelous job. My parents loved the cake. Thank you team Skyline. Will always keep coming back for more.

Do check their fruit pudding cup. Yummy it is. The chocolate boat is pure chocolate ganache with praline on the cookie boat. Do try it for sure.

Skyline sucks!! I took a one pound Dutch truffle for a family friends anniversary. When we cut the cake the cake was so so dry that it was falling apart. The layers were dry and had no flavour. Worst is that I called the owner this morning and he is obnoxious and rude. He asked me bring back the cake I gifted someone. And when I told him so he turned super rude and said I can do whatever I want. Please don't go to skyline. Oh! And then they blocked me on Facebook as I posted the truth about them

We had a mixed fruit cup and a chocolate boat, costing INR 40 and INR 30 respectively. The quality was really good, especially considering the low prices. Even though it was evening, the fruit cup tasted fresh. The chocolate boat too, had the right dash of sweet. Tucked away in a line behind Park Circus, this place is definitely a hidden gem.

Dear Skyline Confectioners, 

Please expand. Take your cakes and gate crash into a funds pitching session, or with a brave heart, collect a loan from a bank. Either ways, please scale your operations.

Because, you sit on a magic formula of making excellent cakes for less than 30 bucks, which is by far the best one can get for 30 bucks in Calcutta (and probably a lot of India),  and it's unfair if one has to walk through alleys of raw Chicken and Goat Slaughterhouses to find a cake shop tucked in the alleys opposite Quest Mall. 

Low-price bakery market is un-glamarous, and nearly monopolised by Mio-Amore -Monginis and in the same price range, Skyline's Products are way superior -and that too, by big margin. So if Mio Amore sits at INR 600 crore revenue, just imagine the whole market that is up for grabs ! 

Unlike Mio Amore, Skyline's cakes are not extra sweet, and don't have the oily after-taste usually associated with cheaper products. And I really didn't think it was possible to sell a wonderful white cream with a thick Greek Yoghurt-ish texture that Skyline serves at only 20 bucks. 

It's futile to compare Skyline with Cakes and Kokkie Jar (which is 20 bucks more expensive and hence mid-range) and much higher end dessert cafes with 100 plus bucks for a slice. 

In the end, do remember - Anything less than a double digit franchise isn't fair for Skyline's Mixed Fruit Tarts or Lemon Tarts.

The loation of this confectionary is very very odd and it's certainly not one of those places for which we normally make a plan to visit. I had heard the name a long time back and while passing through the area gave it a try. Had cheese pasta, chocolate boat and chocolate pyramid. Each of them were tasty and fresh. I would have loved to bring cheese pasta as takeaway but sadly there was none left. The only thing I felt was a letdown was there were too little options to choose from and almost more than half the racks were empty. I visited the place at about midday so there's no reason why it wouldn't be well stocked. The USP of this little confectionery is the dirt cheap price of the items available however I found it to be overrated.

Have been having skyline delicacies for a long time now. Their cakes is almost a  quintessential element when it comes to birthday  celebrations in our family. The chocolate cake is very good. That said, the other items are just average. We had ordered vegetable patties and hot dog. Both were OK, but not anything you can't find anywhere else.

Located opposite to Quest Mall, this is perhaps one of those least popular bakeries, which deserves better recognition and publicity. Their cakes are fresh and a couple of them tastes exceptional. Priced rightly at a mid-range, the products are quite affordable to the masses. Tried mixed fruit cake here, which was a complete delight. Must try for vegetarian people for the vegetarian snacks they offer.

I used to appreciate the pastries of Skyline till date... But today's experience with the brand was the worst experience i could ever had... had ordered a fancy birthday cake of 6 pounds which was chocolate truffle cake with a pink body... The person in the shop near Karaya Police station has suggested to go and order in the factory. In the factory the person has given me a quote and asked to whatsapp the design of the cake to Mr. Rehan (the owner of the shop).. I did the same and got a complete different quote from the owner!!! We confirmed the order and he then asked me to pay advance in the shop.. While we went to shop for paying advance the shopkeeper refused to take advance as he was not informed about our order to Mr. Rehan. He requested me to place a fresh order in the shop which we did and he said there is no requirement to pay advance. A day before the birthday I called the owner to know if the order has been confirmed (was tensed as the person refused to take advance and was not confident on their words as a lot of confusion already happened), the owner literally shouted to me over phone saying that how can we place an order again in the shop when he has already taken the order. We told him that the shop keeper was not aware of it and dint take the advance either. He then said that our cake will not taste good as we are bothering him too much!!!! I have never faced such unprofessional and rude behaviour from any shop in my life!!!!! Disappointing!!!!!! Will never recomend this shop to anybody in future!!!!!

I buy cakes from this outlet atleast once a week for my son and myself as we regularly visit this area for his extracurricular activities.

I have always been very careful about the food that I buy for my son. This is the reason I have chosen Skyline. The cakes are fresh enough for the consumption of my small child.

I have mostly stayed away from the cakes of most of the bakeries of Kolkata barring one or two high end ones. The mid range bakeries have miserably compromised on the quality to justify the price. But bakery is an art where you need to put the right ingredient at the right quantity, otherwise its a disaster. This is exactly where most of the bakeries go wrong.

Skyline has truly mastered the art of bakery. But surprisingly the price ranges from just Rs 25/-35/ per piece. It is a delight for cake lovers to have such an outlet in Kolkata. Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate tart, Mixed fruit cake are some of our favourites. This is also a pure veg outlet.

Skyline truly justifies its tagline that says 
" Know baking better"

Best cakes in kolkata. Period. I bought chocolate cake and its taste is unbeatable. No confectionery could even match up to them. Not just chocolate, I find almost all of their cakes yum.

I ordered Mixed fruit cake, the taste and the presentation of the cake was impressive and must be acknowledged. Don't go by its look, It's almost like a virtual outlet but it tastes good. A must place for Birthday Cakes.

They are simply the BEST. A faithful customer for over 2 years, I can totally vouch for their cakes and pastries. 

My hot favorite is their chocolate boat which is a great mood lifter infact its so amazing that it sells out pretty fast. 

If you haven't tried this place, you are definitely missing out on something.

I think that they have opened an outlet at Bhawanipur which will make it more convenient for us. Also hope they maintain their standard and keep the prices reasonable too.

It was my niece's bday n she demanded a Pink barbie doll cake. I have ordered a homebaker for the cake but at the last moment she cancelled the order . I was feeling lik nowhere like what to do ,where to go,how to face the little child.. I searched a few bakers from zomato n called them,requested them but all said its impossible to deliver d cake by evening. . then one of my friends told me about this gave me their no. I called them up n n ask whether they can n they said "yes we can deliver the cake by 5pm".. I was happy again worried if they ditched me again in the last moment. I again called up at around 4pm to confirm n they said it is ready n I can pick it up anytime. .

I went to take the delivery but was unable to locate it so again called them up.. they said to wait in front of Mainland China n within 10mins a boy came with the cake.. I was elated that finally I got the cake as demanded..

The cake was beautifully decorated with pin n white buttercream n inside it was double chocolate truffle.. yummy it was..

I loved their service. . Im going to bookmark it for all the next occasions. .

Second best* confectioner that I have visited in Kolkata. The highlight of my visit was the chocolate tart (large) which was of the quality of Le Patisserie (Taj Mumbai) and at just Rs 25!!! Also the nougat slice was decadent moist and the dark chocolate icing was fresh and tasty. The skyline special** also was amazing. All this at a very reasonable price and with the added benefit of being a pure veg. place for all the vegetarians out there makes it perfect!!!

Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to taste the savory food. Nevertheless the visit to Karaya Road was worth it.

*Disclaimer: I was on the hunt for the perfect chocolate cake for my granddad's 90 birthday for which I have tasted all the cake giants including Cakes (Gariahat), Kookie Jar (Loudoun Street), Just Baked, Balaram Mullick, Govindas(for veg cakes) etc and I finally ended up ordering it from here due to it's taste and price. The best I would like to admit was Balaram Mullick but for delivery reasons we had to use Skyline and were not disappointed.

After using skyline for so many years. I was very disappointed today when i ordered a large number of chocolate and mix fruit tart from them! I even sent someone to pick it up but upon opening the box all the tarts were jumbled or broke. and half were not suitable to be sent for gifting. Very disappointed with how my order was handled.

In a city where Kookie Jar and Cakes have the monopoly on pastries and Cakes, Skyline in Beckbagan gives the duo a run for their money. Located in a bustling area, it is easy to locate. an Entirely veg shop, I am yet to sample their savouries. Their mixed fruit cup and cake are my favourites and no where else will you get the fresh taste and that too at a very reasonable cost. ¬†Their Chocolate truffle cake is also amazing. Other delectable items are the chocolate tart, the mixed fruit tart, the chocolate mousse and chocolate pyramid

They say that the first impression is often the most important one and I must say I did not have a great first impression at this rather highly rated bakery located in Karaya road off Beckbagan.I was looking to order a fancy customised cake for my parents 25th anniversary and decided to see what this place could offer me.It was around 3.30-4 in the afternoon when my friend and I stepped inside this small shop to find the staff almost half asleep.When we asked about some catalogue or something,he provided us a shabby torn one and dozed off again! We decided we wont order from here then and there. 

Nonetheless we decided to sample the chocolate pyramid,mixed fruit tart and the pineapple slice.Although the chocolate pyramid did not seem too fresh,the other two were quite lovely and fresh.This coupled with the extremely reasonable rates makes this place quite popular.They also have a few veg savouries on offer.I wish the person showed a little more interest in his cutsomers.Otherwise quality wise this a decent value for money place.

The reason why i have rated it 3.5 is that the quality has gone down from what it used to be. I have been eating cakes from this place when they did not even have an outlet and operated only out of their factory near mainland china. 
I have always loved the fresh fruit cake and the truffle cake. But to my dismay, recently, they've somehow deteriorated the taste/quality. Yet its not bad, but I definitely miss the old charm!

And finally I did reach where I aleays wanted to go. Since the day my friends did not share the black forest cake from skyline with me. I had promised myself to rush in here to fianlly hog. And today was the day. I was hungry, visiting the quest mall, waiting for my bestie and my bro. Usually they do not come on time, so I gave them a call and asked for their location and they helped me with it.The road beside mithai, walk straight, leave the first right and then on reaching the 2nd right follow the lane opposite and there is karaya thana, and there is skyline. I went inside and saw everything was just kept in racks. What struck first was the mixed fruit boat. White cream cherry pineapple kiwi apricot. All in one. And the base was a tart. And amazing it was . I thoroughly loved it. Then saw the paneer focasia. It is damn tasty. Then ofcourse the blurberry cake slice attracted me towards it. And there I was eating it, feeling the berru pulps amidst the pastry base and it taste amazing. A must eat. Then ofcourse I was full. So packed a chocolate tart and the lemon tart. Chocolate tart was usually good. but the lemon tart was one of its kind. Amazingly good. And allnin just 115 rupees. Unbelievably less. Skyline I am definitely coming back.

I was introduced this place by a colleague whose introductory sentence was " this is better than cakes". Now I love Cakes. So I had to check it out. And well said. I being myself, ordered 5 different pastries to have a taste of all kinds they have. They were brilliant. Hence, no pictures are available :P. Skyline Special Pastry is the best according to me. Moist chocolate cake laden with dark chocolate layers and caramel crunchies will melt in your mouth and take your heart away. Their fresh creme mixed fruit and pineapple pastry are also very tasty. Their chocolate quality is very good, the icing on the cakes are also very good quality. And price is pocket friendly. I have heard accolades about their custom made cakes for birthdays/ engagements/ weddings / parties ... likely to try one out for myself on my sister's bday. Surely, won't be disappointed.

They earlier operated directly from their factory off Ahiripukur. They have recently opened an outlet on Karaya Road, diagonally opposite the Police station.

I had once ordered a cake, which was pretty good by eggless standards. Went once to their outlet to order a cake but my wife was not too thrilled by any on offer.

They served a range of pastries, savouries and cakes, take orders too. Most of the stuff is run of the mill. They are value for money, and for the price you pay, pretty decent. I believe they supply eggless cakes to make of the larger cakeshops across the city.

Worth a try!

Their pastries and cakes are to die for because of an amazing consistency of the cream , the chocolate based items are perfect to the T with no oily smell found in the chocolate cream based items of some other popular confectioneries, their prices are very standard as well. The only drawback possibly is that they do not stock non vegetarian savouries but their quality is top notch.

Celebrating your Kid's 1st birthday is always special. And whatever be your way of keeping the party fancy... everybody is just waiting to see "what's in the box?? How would the cake look like ?? " and when the curtains are raised... "SUUUUPPPERRR MAANNNN" is the only word being screamed aloud by the children...

Thank you SKYLINE for making it so special for us and its from bottom of my heart man.. The taste of truffle cake melts your heart.

Take my words, everyone said WOW !!!

All the best. SKYLINE will go places.

Skyline and I go way Back...Since the days they didnt have The On Shop at Park Circus market but the Workshop near MainlAnd China Gura Saday. I am particularly fond of their Mixed Fruit Cake which i have ordered innumerable times. I also as a hobby Run a small Party planning Joint and I always Order My Custom Made Cakes from there.¬†
Special Favourites:
1.Mixed fruit Cake: Perfectly moist less and sweet as per class cakes with assorted fruits perfectly complementing the fresh cream.
2. Orange Fresh Cream Cake: Delicate and Delightful.
3. Chocolate Double Truffle Cake with Butterscotch filling: One of a kind
No matter what design you want your cake to be they have the best hands for the job. I specially like there good english buttermilk cream cakes...a delight everytime

Skyline was one of the favorite places to pick up cakes. The store located near Karaya Police Station in Beckhbagan Area is a tiny Patisserie serving Eggless Cakes & Pastries. The Chocolate Truffle Cake & the Mix Fruit Pudding Cake are so delicious that  one would start craving more.  Apart from that they also sell Veg Pizzas, Sandwiches, Puffs & Rolls. I tried the Chocolate Pastry & it tasted very fresh and the quality of fresh cream used was outstanding. Lemon Tart crust was thin and tasted perfect/ Only problem is Parking & Traffic congestion is a problem during peak hours. 

I love whatever they sell & would recommend to be a must visit

Well, there are hidden eating places hroughout Kolkata, and this place, Skyline Confectioners is surely one of them. 
Contact details are present in attached pic. The most difficult pace is to locate this place , as there is no designated shop for them. It's a small cake factory inside a residential area in ground floor. 
However, they do provide all types of fancy cakes, and customised cakes.

We had ordered a 5 pound chocolate truffle cake, as body white, and pink drop. It costed 1400 bucks, and taste was awesome.
We took delivery on time on designated day, and it was sharp ready.

Location: Karaya Road. 

I have always opted for this confectionary whenever there are family functions or parties!
They are undoubtedly amongst the top confectioners in Kolkata. 
I have always opted for their home delivery and the time taken by them is quite standard. :) 
It's a strictly Vegetarian Bakery, that means all the pastries and cakes available here would be egg-less, but you would never be able to differentiate coz' of the fluffiness and lightness of the cakes they bake! 

Recommendations: Mixed Fruit Pudding Cake, Death by Chocolate, Chocolate Fudge Cake, Double Chocolate Truffle Cake. 

Quite a reasonably priced place and is a place highly recommended for the people who have a sweet tooth. :)

Well this place was in Ahiri Pukur road once and was very hard to find and at that point in time they were only into deliveries I guess they didn't have a proper outlet but they were popular even then it was generally "word of mouth" back then and they probably wanted to capitalize on that popularity so they opened a small outlet and luckily its just next to my place (yes i stay in Karaya road). Any comparisons to Kookie Jar or French Loaf would be unfair to them, they have their own fan following. Just to let everyone know all their cakes are egg less and this probably is one of the reasons why they get so many party orders apart from the fact that they are also very reasonably priced. I have tried most of their chocolate pastries and though I don't have a sweet tooth I have to admit they were really good, I am not quite sure but I guess the pastry range starts at 25 bucks and considering the quality and taste it's totally worth it and yes they also dish out pizza slices and their version of hot dogs all vegetarian though. So that's about it nothing much to add, before signing off on a scale of 1 - 5 i'll give this place a 4 for being such a "sweet" neighbor.

Located near Beckbagan, Skyline confectioners alongwith Just Desserts by Mrs Daswani have been supplying the cakes for almost all the parties in my family and have never disappointed !!

If one avoids judging a book by its cover then it wont be difficult to fall in love with this place. They make excellent cakes customised to your liking and designed to perfection at very very reasonable prices. One of the best cakes at one of the most competitive rates. I have not tried much of their pastries and puffs ready in the shop but a couple of them which i tried were good, nothing extraordinary. Cakes is their speciality and one just needs to show them a pic of what you want and they would create an exact replica of it though a first time customer might not be so confident in the beginning since they do not provide that classy ambiance!!! Going by the other reviews would love to try their savories , pastries some time soon !!

Visited this place after hearing a lot of good reviews from my relatives. The place is slightly difficult to find and its near beck bagan. Location is not that good. Coming to the food I tried a Black forest cup cake which i love along with that pineapple slice which is my brothers favorite and a veg patties. 
The patties was good better than monginis and it was crisp and gave a fresh taste.
Coming to the pastries both the items were nice but not as good as compared to kookie jar . They were not very soft and moist as they should have been.
Only suggestion would be to make the pastries slightly more soft, moist and I personally felt that sugar was a bit more which they could consider cutting down.

PROS: Excellent cakes, good prices
CONS: Lack of variety(no buttercreams,mousses cream cake,red velvets), location(not many people are familiar with karaya road)

But overall skyline  cakes are the showstoppers of any party, and there's no reason why it shouldnt be:)

Skyline was on my wishlist for quite some time, and finally I landed up here yesterday for some desserts. 

Located at a stones' throw away from the Karaya Police Station (in one of the by lanes close to Mithai) in the Park Circus area, it is a tiny patisserie  dishing out egg less cakes/pastries and veg tit bits like pizzas and sandwiches. 

I tried the Lemon Tart and the Chocolate Tart at first. Reasonably priced at Rs 20 and Rs 15 respectively both the items tasted very fresh and the quality of fresh cream used was outstanding. The crust was thin and tasted perfect. I liked the lemon tart better and asked for another one. I noticed that they have a variety of breads on offer. We also tried the Veg spring roll which was just average as I found the veg filling to be a bit dry. 
I liked the Blueberry slice and the Black forest on display, but that has to wait for another visit. 
Aggressive pricing coupled with fantastic quality and taste makes this standalone confectionery a clear winner. Only problem is that it is located at an off beat place and someone not acquainted with the area might have a problem locating it. Parking is also a big problem as the lanes are not too wide and traffic congestion is a problem during peak hours. 

Nevertheless, I loved the items that I tried and should be back for more !

I was craving for Skyline treats after hearing about it from a friend and the Zomato recommendations just made it all the more irresistible. 
My first visit left me pleasantly surprised, I never expected the bluberry slice to be so good, the tarts were perfect-a crust not too thick,crumbly and the lemon cream melts in the mouth, the strawberry boats served as crust-fresh fluffy whitecream-strawberry slices -: the perfect dessert. After tasting quite a lot of their offering I have reached the conclusion that their white cream is the best in whole of Kolkata,much ahead of cakes/kookie jar/french loaf et all.  The black forest cake seems to be the top pick for party orders,though I am eyeing the gateaux for my next party. Now the part that left me dissatisfied was the simple butterscotch pastry: the sponge cake was too dry, and the perfect blend of cream and nuts just wasn't there. Also, I feel the chocolate cakes are much better elsewhere.
In the midst of cakes and pastries you shouldnt overlook their breads and patties. The cheese mayonnaise is as delicious as it sounds and also the pasta in little tin foils (ask them to heat it up real well ) ,and the dinner rolls.
This place is definitely worth multiple visits, I so wish they would open up more branches!

One of those gems that have not got their due .... I was first introduced to their delicious cakes at a friends party and have enjoyed their stuff whenever I have sampled it. Theirs is a vegetarian bakery so all the products are egg-less but one could not tell such is their skill. Try the Double Chocolate Truffle,Black Forest or the Chocolate Fudge Cake .... all are very good. The Garlic Bread and Milk Bread are also very nice and I always pick up one for home if available. Their Chocolate Tart is delicious as is the Mixed Fruit Cup. If you have a sweet tooth this place is worth a try for sure.

Skyline Confectioners - Quality cakes at reasonable prices

It is located right diagonally opposite to Karaya police station.
To be more precise, just nearby to the famous "SIGARA"- Shop which first started selling Shishas/hookah's in the city of joy. 

It is a small bakery shop which sells pastries and cakes and even does a home delivery on Bulk order. Skyline confectioner's Fruit pudding cake is at par in competition with the cakes fruit pudding cake. As i love pudding cakes more than chocolates, i have tried it out here and believe me - ITS GREAT!! I don't think the pastries would be at par with the cakes but i will have to give it a try.

The amount of price they charge you and the quality of cake which they give you is totally justified. The staffs out here are also very polite. 

To sum it up in short,

Quantity of cake 4.5/5
Quality of cake 3.8/5
Service 3.8/5
Ambience 3/5
Place of Location 2.8/5
Pocket friendly 4.5/5

A few days back I was checking out confectioners in Zomato and this little gem popped up on my screen. The overall rating of 4.1, nice feedback from my fellow foodies and the overwhelming temptation to indulge in some calorific creaminess made us follow the map given here and land up in front of the shop in no time!
It‚Äôs located near the Park Circus market, take the lane next to Mithai and go straight until you see an eatery named ‚ÄúJaiswal Tasty Corner‚Äù. Skyline Confectioners is just two shops next to that.
During our 10 minutes stay inside Skyline, at least 8 customers came in together, and all in great hurry to pack their scrumptious goodies and leave. The rush was quite notable in a small place like that, and I think I even saw the man behind the counter being flustered for a moment (quite naturally!).
We got ourselves the Chocolate Tarts (Rs.15), Mix Fruit Cup (Rs.35), Blueberry Cheese Slice (Rs.35) and a Chilli Paneer Roll (Rs.30). 
The chocolate tarts were absolutely marvelous! The tart base was crisp and crumbly, the chocolate cream was a bit dark in flavour (which I LOVED!) with chocolate shavings on top and there was a certain crunchiness in it owing to the butterscotch chips (I assume), adding much to our delight. Then it was time for the mixed fruit cup which had slices of kiwi, mango and pineapple over the smooth white cream and the vanilla sponge cake base. It was a treat as well. I was a bit disappointed though with the blueberry cheese slice as the cream tasted more milky than cheesy. I noticed that they add nuts to their sponge cakes, which I really liked. Then again, the paneer roll was quite filling and delectable.
I'm yet to try out many of their items and wish to do that very soon. This surely was a nice find for a pocket friendly confectionery that please the taste buds as well. 
But, I‚Äôm definitely sad that I came to know about Skyline just before the last few months of college, which is so near to this place :(

Put in simple words, Skyline is really tough competition for the established brands such as Kookie Jar and French Loaf and the famous newcomers such as Manju Sethia. The cakes are delicious and aptly priced! I loved their Black Forest and strawberry cakes a hell lot, despite the amount of calories they carried! It was nothing less than divine!! I wish birthdays were a routine affair only to enjoy the delightful cakes of this underdog that's slowly going to break some real good legs!

I feel like jumping from the 10th floor of my building to dive into the pool of cakes, pastries and delicious snacks! You may be wondering, if I have gone crazy? And the answer is yes, I have gone crazy and anyone who loves confectioneries will go crazy when the person will have a confectionery store like Skyline Confectioners right at the opposite side of his or her home. Situated at 101/1A, Karaya Road, Kolkata-700019, Skyline Confectioners is a brand new snacks bar which has opened this July. 

Located right in front of our 12 storey building, Skyline Confectioners always gives me a welcome call whenever I look out from my balcony. If you have been to famous confectioneries stores like Kookie Jar, Cakes and The French Loaf, you can definitely realize that you can savor the yummy desserts and snacks giving a good punch to your pocket and if you want to cut down your budget, you need to compromise with the taste. But, step into Skyline Confectioners once and see how they fill your mouth with heavenly and yummy confectioneries, exactly similar to the above mentioned renowned stores but at reasonable rate. The minimum price starts from Rs. 10. So now you imagine.

Fully vegetarian snacks bar, Skyline Confectioners offers an array of mouth watering snacks and yummy cakes, desserts, pastries and cookies. On the inaugural day, I visited the store to buy pastries and as soon as I entered, they welcomed by offering me to taste any pastry or dessert of my choice before I place any order. That heartiest welcome just swayed me away. Moreover, they also gifted me a box of chocolates. This warm welcome and a wonderful way to bid good bye with a box of chocolates won the hearts of every customer who visited there. After its inaugural I bought different eateries on different occasions. This September, I celebrated my brother's and my father's birthday with birthday cakes ordered from this store. On my brother's birthday, I ordered Choco Fudge Cake and on my father's birthday, we ordered Black Forest Cake. Both were amazing to taste, so soft and so yummy that you feel like having more and more until the last bite disappears in your mouth. And I don't know whether you will believe or not, one pound cake costs only Rs. 260/-. 

Besides these two special occasions, I visit the store frequently for Pizzas, Patties, Choco Tarts, Pastries and Sandwiches. Each of the items is prepared with delectable and eye-soothing culinary art. Fully air conditioned with friendly staffs, the store is small without any seating arrangement.

Ordered a 2 pound blackforest cake from this confectionery.Not only is it reasonably priced,but there's no compromise when it comes to flavour.It was scrumptious and a slice of heaven!!! The several layers of chocolate cake with whipped cream,cherries and something which tasted like butterscotch candy between the layers of cherries and cream,the chocolate shavings...TEMPTING to the core..

Will definitely come back to try the tarts and mousse.

With their outlet located opposite Karaya Police Station, now Skyline has a face to the name. Their Fruit Gateaux is excellent. Chocolate-based goodies are worth trying, though the variety on display at their outlet does not look any different from other renowned confectioneries in the city.

Skyline DELIVERS and how!! Located in a small alley, it location belies the talent behind its doors. I ordered a cake shaped like a Burger for my son's 8th birthday and despite their apprehensions, the 4 tiered cake could well beat a genuine burger hollow in terms of the authenticity of its looks. They can duplicate any image to perfection and their truffle cakes are light and sinful unlike the heavy cream laden cakes dished out by other leading confectioners in town. For the first time, the adults were begging for seconds and thirds and what's more since Skyline genuinely deliver every pound they promise there was enough to go around.Their service is friendly and impeccable and their door to door delivery unmatched. We will all be back at Skyline soon hungry for more.

As I made my way back from office and was crossing this place, I made an impulsive decision to take home a bag of goodies. And what a wonderful treat I had. The cheese mozzarella bread was delicious and I feasted over it while he parceled my ten chocolate tarts which stands for the proverb "Good things come in small packages"!

Skyline Confectioners.. It is located in Karaya Road near Mainland China in Gurusaday Road. Undoubtedly one of the best confectioners in the city. Their cakes are absolutely sinful be it the fruit cakes or the chocolate based ones. They are SO soft that they melt in your mouth. I reccomend their Strawberry Pudding, Mixed Fruit Cake and Death By Chocolate Cake. The tarts are awesome too. They mainly deliver and offer take away. And they are pretty reasonable.. Cakes start at 260 rupees per pound. What more? They are 100% Vegetarian. For first timers, you can never tell they are eggless for the lightness of their cakes.. Brownie Points for that, quite literally ;) Awesomeness.
Four and a Half Stars from Me :D
