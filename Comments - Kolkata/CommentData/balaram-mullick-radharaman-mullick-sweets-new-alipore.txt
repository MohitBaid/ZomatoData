Tried their Baked Rosogolla, Chowmein Samosa & a Mango Dessert (In the Pics).
A complete 10/10 for their Baked Rosogolla and the chowmein samosa (filled with Veggies, big pieces of paneer & loads of noodles/chowmein). The chowmein samosa is a Must Try.
The Mango Dessert was amazing as well.

2/10 for the Behaviour of the staff of this particular outlet.

We Bengali‚Äôs have a special place in out heart for sweets and this one dish we want in our every occasion. In this holy occasion of¬† Janmashtami ( A holy festival when we celebrate the birth of lord Krishna) the famous sweet maker Balaram Mallik & Radharaman Mallik has brought some of their iconic sweets for the people of Kolkata. When it comes to good quality of sweets around Kolkata then they are truly a legend. Though the prices are little bit on the higher side but their quality and quantity will make that up for you.

This outlet at New Alipore near Kotak Mahindra Bank is not as big the other outlets, so the space is slightly cramped up. Also the variety of sweets is not as large, but it's enough to induce your sweet tooth. Latest innovation is the Green Chilly Roshogolla. Wonderful Radhaballavis available in the morning for breakfast. They accept Paytm.

Balaram Mallick is my favourite place to buy sweets. Their sweets are beyond comparison in both taste and texture. But still I would not recommend this branch,  simply because they don't keep all varieties and their stock is limited.

Being a bong sweet is one of my favorite thing,without having sweets it‚Äôs pretty much difficult for me to survive.in a day 2-3 sweets is must for me either in the evening snacks or after the dinner. when i was a child i used to eat sweets like having lots of chips at a time. not only outside sweets,i used to eat those homemade sweets too. for me it‚Äôs very difficult to say no whenever sweets served to me. some people told me that don‚Äôt eat sweets too much it will damage your health. but,who cares i eat like the way i used to eat. there was a time when sweet means traditional Bengali sweets like Rosogolla,Pantua,Sondesh but now there are varieties of sweets in every sweet shop. from baked rosogolla to pure cadbury sondesh is very much hard for me to say no. i went to several sweet shops and tried various types of sweets,but ‚ÄúBalaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick‚Äù this sweet joint is one in a million, from traditional sweets to side by side new generation sweets,every kind of sweets available here.right now they have six outlets in Kolkata.

Flanked by Gupta Brothers on one side and Bikaner Bhujiawala and Tewari Brothers on the other, the group had a great challenge on its hands when it put up this outlet. With the probable strategy of market skimming in the quality conscious, high income/ middle income group population in the neighboring areas, they have made great inroads with sheer quality and innovation. Fabulous sweets to say the least. Being a resident of New Alipore, I have stopped looking beyond them for sweets and snacks for any occasion. Three cheers!

Mouthwatering sweets on the holy occasion of Janmastami!

There is a reason why Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is a usual choice and top contender when it comes to crowning the undisputed king of Bengali Sweets. Striving hard through the legacy of some of the other well known names in this field, Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick has grown with time by building its own reputation and positive vibe in this field, by serving fine quality sweets and other savories since a long time now. For this particular brand, it is not only about the quality. It is about quantity as well. It is about perfection and finishing as well. For most of these sweets produced by this brand, you would see that the finishing touch is always being given a paramount importance. The price may be a bit high, but so is the quality and quantity. Afterall, if you need to treat your son-in-law on Jamaishosthi, or your relatives on your children‚Äôs wedding, or offer something to the Almighty God on eve of some special occasion, you should get the best products you can buy, staying within your financial capability.

Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick comes rightly in this domain. Their sweets aren‚Äôt much exorbitantly priced, but just stays short of the ceiling one can afford. Very recently, team #panchphoron was cordially invited to try some of their Janmastami Special Sweets. An auspicious, pious and holy occasion, which comes only once in an year, and is celebrated to mark the birthday of Lord Krishna, Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is striving hard to give to the devotees some of the liked sweets by Lord Krishna. In this hard paced life, making these sweets from the scratch is a hard-done job, and it is much convenient to get it done from a sweet shop to make your work easy. The sweet products available here will always fit your bill. Starting from Khirkadam, there was Balusahi, Narkel Naru, Sorer Naru, Taaler Malpoa, Chanar Malpoa, Taaler Khir, Taaler Bora, Chanar Payesh, Jumbo Gujia, Nanir Handy and Saalpata Swar!

Well ofcourse there are other varieties you could choose from, and you need not stick to the ones mentioned above. But then Palm or Taal happened to be a favorite of Lord Krishna, and most of the above said offerings happens to be made out of Palm to stick to the tradition. As known, this is a limited period festival, so if you want to offer the Lord some of his favorite sweets, and also try the same as ‚ÄòHoly Prasad‚Äô, run along today to one of the outlets of Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick, before the stock runs out.

Enjoy some special sweets on this special occasion of Janmashtami.
Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick, New Alipore has come up with some special sweetmeats for the auspicious festival of Krishna Janma Ashtami.
We were invited over for a special preview of the same.
The sweets tasted as great as they looked. The star attractions were the sweetmeats flavoured with palm pulp. The taal (palm) er malpowa, taal er kheer, taal er bora , sor, kheer er naru & narkel naru are too good to be missed.
I particularly liked the kheer & powa.
Apart from this palm flavoured ones, the regular kheerkadambe, balusai & of course baked rosogolla should be definitely tried.

The 1885 established sweet shop Balaram Mullick and Radharam Mullick, has made itself a remarkable name among the oldest and the best of the sweet shops of Kolkata. Known for the modernity of ideas and the class approach in sweet making, the Mullicks has come up with a wide range of ‚Äútaal‚Äù sweets and savouries and also various other traditional sweets to celebrate the birth of Lord Krishna, this Janmashtami.

Master confectioner BMRM fail to live up to their reputation at New Alipore. Why so? Due to the below reasons - 
Lack of variety
Staff quarreling vociferously in full view of customers (guys pls don't wash your dirty laundry in public!!!)
Lack of variety
Very dinghy set up
And did I say lack of variety

Pls do something about your variety of goods sold (the lack of rather). And I will be happy to revisit my review and adjust the rating accordingly. 

For some inspiration take a leaf out of Gupta Brothers - they are surely the king of sweets at Alipore / New Alipore.

With a big brand name this outlet at Alipur is carrying a huge legacy with it. Located near SBI just opposite to Tewari sweets this place is a decent place.

I have always loved their baked rosogolla and mihidana. Also they have a huge variety in sandesh was well. Summer special mango flavored makha sandesh is now the hot selling item here. Mango lovers should definitely try.

Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is a household name thanks to all the radio commercials they air. Even right now when I'm typing the name, the exact tone from the advertisement is ringing in my ears :D. However it's not only the advertising that has made them a popular outlet among the sweetmeat shops in Kolkata (& outside, in US even). It's one of the oldest sweet shops in Kolkata. Generally when we talk of heritage shops they are mostly located in north Kolkata. South Kolkata is considered much younger & surely lacks at least in the numbers of heritage eateries. Not in quality though. Balaram Mullick, Bhowanipur boasts of serving mouth wateringly delicious selection of sweets since 1885. In recent times they have opened branches all throughout Kolkata & even planning to expand overseas.
Recently group PanchPhoron was invited to their Alipore branch to try out some of the items from their summer special mango sweets. Me being a sweet lover immediately jumped at the opportunity.
The outlet is located bang opposite New Alipore SBI , near new alipore triangular park. The outlet is a bit small & doesn't have seating arrangement , however very few sweet shops actually has that anyway. There's a huge selection of sweets on display. To be honest, not only the regular chana based products, their chocolate/strawberry/orange flavoured fusion sweets are sure to grab your attention. Since we were there to taste the mango special items, we started as soon we could. The items I tried & liked are:

Mango Baked Rosogolla:
Baked rosogollas are by now a common dessert in most Bengali weddings. & This item being a speciality of Balaram Mullick, they never failed to impress. However adding Alphonso syrup to the already amazing sweet made it all the more grand & better. It's something that can't be expressed in word. It was almost like my love for rosogolla & mangoes was heard by God himself, culminating the two into this item for which one can die for.

Mango Talsash/ Jolbhora:
The regular jelly/gurer syrup filling of a Talsash has been replaced with mango syrup. The outer sandesh itself contains syrup too, however in much lesser proportion so as to not make the item overly mango-ish. The mango syrup hits you only after you've taken a bite, & the feel surely is heavenly.

Mango Truffle:
We've all had chocolate truffles, but this one was a revelation. White balls of sandesh with Chico chips on top don't look too mango-ish apart from the orangish stripes on the side. However once you bite into it, the semi-hard outer shell crumbles in to reveal the soft mushy mango sandesh inside which again is great tasting.

Fresh Mango juice:
This one was one pulpy drink! Served in marble glasses this pureed mango pulp was actually a bit too thick to finish in one go. I really had to take my time finishing it. The pulp was so thick, at times it couldn't be sucked with the straw even. Surely they can blend in a little milk to make this amazing tasty drink a bit more paleteable.

Mango Rajbhog:
What is better than a rosogolla. A bigger rosogolla fondly known as Rajbhog (word coined from bhog or meal fit for the raj or the royals). Now what's better than a soft juicy Rajbhog? A Rajbhog that has mango flavour in it. & It was exactly that. Giant rosogollas soaked in a mango infused sugar syrups. Delicious.

Mango Dahi:
Popularly known in Bengali as 'Aam doi' , nowadays this item is readily available in containers from mother dairy & other dairy farms. However the taste of fresh doi from a sweet shop is inimitable. Moreover while most places blend in the mango into the dahi, here extra mango syrup is added inside the dahi. Too good.

Mango Gelato:
This is not actually ice cream. Rather it's a thick creamy mango kheer or 'Aam kheer' with chunks of juicy ripe mangoes in it. The grainy texture of the kheer is superb, mango flavour adding a bit more flavour, & the topping of diced ripe mango, priceless.

Other mango items:
Apart from the above items which I tried & immensely liked, there are few more items they are preparing during these summer months. They are: mango lava, mango ghoti, mango jolosonkho, mango dry fruit flower etc.

Not only mangoes they even have items like anondo anarosh, patisapta & even chocolate bonbon. I tried the bonbon which was amazingly delicious chocolate sandesh.

Overall this fusion of mangoes with sandesh & rosogollas was quite a revelation. Me being always sceptical about fusion sweets, tried these with a bit of caution. However being a mango lover it was only until I bit into the first sweet I was offered. It was a great experience. Each & every item I tried confirmed their expertise in making them. Wish them the best in their future innovations & experiments.
Untill then
Happy Eating
Cheers!

Food Tasting session ‚Äì Summer-special Mango flavored sweets

When you are reviewing Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick Sweets, you know you are not writing about just another sweet shop with some run of the mill fare; though I have written about couple of outlets of Balaram Mullick in the past but this review will always be very special since here I was invited to their New Alipore outlet to taste the special Mango flavored sweets and savouries which were being launched as a summer-special fare. Their sweets spell magic that comprises of the constant factors of transformation and innovation. The sweets have their distinct characteristic and a soul that is pure, honest and necessarily sweet :) So even if you are not having a sweet tooth, it is definite that you can not ignore this brand and I believe that demands extreme expertise of the subject.

One of the best sweet shops of Kolkata is near to my house and I visit this place quiet often. The place is between Taratala to New Alipore. Just opposite to Tewari Brothers. The place is in the main road so it is quiet easy to locate. The varieties are of sweets are great but less than many other outlets. I love their Aam Doi, its their speciality. They have also started snacks like Dahi vada, pizza , lassi etc.
One thing which really impress me here is they always give fresh items. The staffs are fast in taking orders. I just want them to smile lil more looking at the customers because it gives a good vibe.
Always a go to place if you want to eat good quality sweet. The price is on the higher side but its worth it.
And for me it doesnt matter at all because Bengali and sweets have a great connection.

4/5 for this place.

One of my office colleague wanted to have baked rasogolla and I promised him to get the best available in Kolkata. This was definitely not the place I visit often but saw this place and I recalled that I have to get some baked rasogolla.

This place is bang opposite to the SBI in New alipore. A much mini version than the other Balaram Mallick's in Kolkata. Asked for the baked rasogolla which was readily available. Gave the 500 bucks note at the counter and the guy at the counter gave me a complete blank look, to me rather it was an irritating stare. I asked for the bill and the response was, this place does not require bill. I was forced to say, are you different in all the other places of Balaram? They give the bill then why on earth you cannot provide the same. Felt that the staff are literally indifferent at this place specially.¬†

For me still Baked rasogolla = Balaram but at least not from the New alipore.

They set up a 2 day stall at my office canteen which gave me an undesirable experience - not at all expected from BMRM.¬†
The experience on the 1st day was nice, but on the 2nd day was equally disturbing. On the 2nd day, I was over charged for all the items - a behavior not expected from a brand of this repute.

For the gurer jolbhora, I was charged Rs. 30 (Pic uploaded), which I had purchased for Rs. 20 on the very 1st day. Also, for the strawberry sandesh, I was charged Rs. 30, which I believe costs Rs 25 (Pic uploaded).

Since, I am a regular BMRM customer, I am aware of the rates of several items, if not all. As per my rough estimate, I had bought stuff worth Rs. 200 (approx). But, when I asked for how much I ought to pay, the accountant uttered some gibberish 
(intending to show that he was calculating) and asked me for Rs. 380. After much negotiation, he settled for Rs. 230 (which is still higher than the actual amount of stuff I had bought).¬†
I am also uploading a pic of the accountant who was deliberately over-charging me and hereby request the management to look into such matters and take corrective actions, which might seriously tarnish the rapport of a legacy!
Please ensure that such instances are never repeated in any of the BMRM outlets, so that customers can have full peace of mind while purchasing stuff.

I have visited 5 other BMRM outlets and my experiences have been nothing less than outstanding. Request the management to replicate the same culture in this branch also!

Coming to the food, their stuff is as usual very nice at decent prices! Variety and availability is also good. Wanted to rate this place 4 stars but have to rate significantly lower due to reasons mentioned above!

Though I have never stepped into their shop but I have tasted their sweets and snacks...personally did not like their mishti doi...tried chocolate sandesh,strawberry sandesh ,mango sandesh..they were a part of my brother's asirvad tatwa...the chocolate sandesh was sticky but it was better than the other two..it tasted fine ..the mango and strawberry sandesh seemed like I'm consuming fine clay...the snacks were really tasty (especially the chanachur)... My rating is just based on the chocolate sandesh..

Was personally here recently . The sweets are great , but had a horrible experience . While i was buying sweets , i was receiving an important phone call on my mobile , from outside kolkata and the voice was not audible . So i was speaking slight loudly . Immediately , the owner/manager , started behaving rudely and asked me to go out of the shop and speak . When i enquired from him , his reason of discomfiture , he became even more rude and said a few unpleasant words .¬†
One of the key to being a good store manager is public relations and behaviour of the staff with the customers . If not for the sweets , would never go back here ...shame

Okayy... Let me take a deep breathe first... Its my favourite sweet palace in the world.. Yup u r right.. Its a palace for sweets. It needs no introduction.. So lets jump straight into the thing.

Location -- the new alipur branch is infront of new alipur sbi.. If u r walking from gupta brothers to taratala.. U will have it to ur left.

Ambiance-- neat and clean. But the staffs are not courteous. They r a little rude. I mean i gave them a 100 rs note and they were soo irritated to give me a 60 rs change. Soo its a bit different from their other outlets where the staffs are very friendly.

Sweets -- there is nothing to say much. We all know balaram mullick and radharaman mullick serves excellent sweets.. Specially their chocolate sandesh. I first knew that they were so good from

The best in Kolkata and that's a big claim considering the city's hallowed history when it comes to sweet shops! But what clinches it for them is the unwavering dedication to quality while still innovating and presenting typically Bengali sweets in a whole new way. Baked doi, notun gurer souffle to name a few. Oh and on summers the gondhoraj lebu shondesh is a must! üòç

Went here today. I went for some official work though. And I was treated well by the owner. The glee point came when they gave me a sweet treat with their mango and choco sweets ! Delicious !

'
Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick' is my most favourite sweet shop all over in kolkata.I've visited their main outlet at Paddapukur road so many times.This is the new outlet of Balram's.It is located at Bankim Mukherjee Sarani near New Alipore state bank.My favourite is their outstanding 'Mango Curd'.After finishing Egg roll at Anamika Roll centre,I've came here for digest my food.They served best mango curd in kolkata.price is little expensive,but quality is excellent.

A Divine intervention...sweets that are beyond delicious. Folks in Kolkata are blessed to have a sweet shop like BMRM..everything on the menu is carefully crafted.... had Aam Sandesh, black current, strawberry, Abar khabo, kada pak, every doi possible n then some more. A legend and league of its own.
