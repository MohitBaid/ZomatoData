Been a huge fan of food trucks for several years and was awaiting the trend to pick up in kolkata as well but alas. This food truck however took my right back to those Thailand days where we used to have pretty food trucks serving delicious food and drinks as well. The concept is good, food was amazing especially for the price point. I had the burger combo  which was served with fries, blue lagoon and a dessert (some cake). Do check it out whenever in sector 5 area. This is located outside 10 downing street where we went after having food here. The review for that will come up soon.

Not up to the mark.. Expectations were much higher...  Had a mutton burger... Vegetables were not fresh.. The lettuce was just dying and the guy got it from somewhere... Patty was okay.. But very thin..

Reviewing any restaurant or food joint after a long time. Ordered Cheese and corn Cigar roll, Vegetable Pasta Mix Sauce and Cheese and Corn Sandwich 2hrs ago. The food was amazing, they gave extra cheese in a pouch which was for Cigar roll I guess. I paid 548rs in total which was a bit much I guess. The quantity of pasta was little less. 2sandwich was enough for 3people.

Ordered 2 grilled chicken burger combos through zomato some time ago. 
The delivery was very quick, so full marks on that. But coming to the food, the whole thing was clearly overpriced. The burger was tasty but was on the smaller side. The French fries were on the lesser side too. The blue lagoon cooler I chose was okay. And the marble cake was just a normal slice of cake, nothing extraordinary.
I won't say the food was bad, but 240+taxes+delivery for that combo is surely damn overpriced.

Well am a fan of food trucks but things didn't go with my order from this outlet. Ordered just a crispy chilli babycorn and got a complimentary walnut cake from zomato treats.

Baby corn became too soggy, and spice level so high that max I could eat was 2 bites, even my spice lover frnd found it hot, had to throw the parcel.
Coming to the walnut cake, it was stale, too hard and dry. On complaints was told that its made hard, but one can feel the difference between what's stale and what's hard.

this restaurant delivers food late night also.
So if late night hunger strikes you, just give a call and get your food within 60mins.

Went here for a lunch with a friend on a weekday!

Its not actually a restaurant but as the name suggests a truck where food is prepared and sold on the streets!

We ordered Veg fried rice and crispy chili baby corn ! The fried rice was decent but the baby corn was excellent !

Overall a decent road side food truck , with plenty of tasty food items at an affordable price!

If you are in Sector 5, looking for a economical lunch at a decent place, you can give TFT a try !

Their burgers taste even better at the Truck as they are served fresh hot. Also, their Chilli Garlic Noodles was simply superb! Great value for money!

Ordered online from zomato. I ordered chicken combo which consisted of Chicken Raja Burger , French fries, one cooler and 2 pcs of cake. It costed 240+ taxes.
Chicken Raja Burger : Was not at all Raja Burger bcoz its contents were of normal burger. Totally disappointed. Its taste was quite satisfactory.
French Fries : The potatoes were not finely fried.
Cooler : They give u a choice among 4-5 coolers . I selected berry berry strawberry shake. Tasted good but the sugar level was on a very high note.
Cake : This was the only product which didn't disappoint me.
The packaging was very good . Each and every product of the combo was packed separately . The quality of the packaging paper was also good.
The overall taste of this combo was 3/5
Packaging 4/5
Overall experience 3.5/5
Would I be ordering food here again ?
Definitely.

Thank You TFT

Being a related to F&B industry myself, I am a little critical about the food that I have. About a few months ago, I had gone to RDB to watch a movie which is when I thought I‚Äôd give this place a shot and I am glad I did. I had the Veg Exotic Wrap and I simply loved it. Now whenever I am in that area, I always go there to grab a bite.

Chanced upon this wonderful food truck parked somewhere in Sector V beside Rdb Cinemas. Good options of veg. Items in the menu. Their prices seemed decent. We ordered for chef special : Paneer crunch burger & exotic veg with mushroom wrap. I loved the latter more. The mushrooms tasted good and was fresh on the tongue. The Paneer crunch burger was nice. Also, on our order was Cheese Filo Rolls (another chef special) was a total showstealer for us. We look forward to visiting the food truck again. Maybe next time we get extended menu with more veg. Options. Found out that they also do home deliveries from their kitchen. Gonna order from them soon.

Recommended. One of those food trucks doing good in Calcutta.

I love the concept of food trucks. Delicious food at affordable rates as you watch the chef toss the fries or craft the burgers is an experience in itself. Honestly if I weren't working full time as an IT professional I would have definitely loved to have gone around the city selling food in my own food truck. 

For some time now, I have been wanting to try out some of the food trucks here in Kolkata. I was in luck as on Nabami night, finding no place to go and hungry to the point where we could gobble down anything we found this small food truck selling burgers and regular titbits near Sector 5. Being the mutton glutton that I am, I decided to order the Mutton Galouti burger. It was pretty late in the night and unfortunately the burger of my choice wasn't present. So I settled for a Grilled Chicken Burger and Mutton Galouti wrap. 

The Grilled Chicken burger was really average with the patty, lettuce and mayonnaise not sufficiently enhancing the flavour as expected. And to find something as simple as a burger average when you are tremendously hungry is note worthy. But then it was Nabami night and they could simply be having a bad day in the kitchen. The wrap was above average. I could definitely taste the richness of the mutton galouti inside (a specialty of Lucknow that usually comes in the form of kebabs made with minced mutton) though the combination in the form of a wrap is a bit too high flying in my opinion. The burger was priced at 150 bucks while the wrap was priced at around 130-140. A little too expensive for a food truck taking into consideration the fact that the food was nowhere near mind blowing. 

Seeing the rating here I would recommend you visit it on one of their less hectic days and if you find it good enough, maybe I can definitely try out the place again.

Sector 5 is now my go to destination for my hunger pangs.from budget outlets to star rated, street food to continental, from regular timings to late to very late deliveries, there is something for everyone here.
Last night, got my food from TFT delivered around 12 at night. They served before time n ohh, what a delicious combo meal it was. The cheese from the chicken burger raja was literally oozing out n was a perfect dip for the sides of fries. The buns were soft, the lettuce a tad wilted, the patty just rightly spiced, the fries were generously portioned with a crunch.i have never tried scotch eggs before so i am confused as to the flavor of it. This original version of our indianized dimer devil had a slightly sour taste although of a generous size. The combo has a slice of marble cake n cooler thrown in. The cake was delishh..like grandma's home baked cake with that fresh smell of vanilla n dense chocolate.i will surely order the full cake soon. I had the strawberry cooler which had a nice tang to it although packaging has to be better as some of it had spilled into the polypack it came in. The chilly chicken was interesting with toppings of mushroom n egg which were provided as add ons. I am looking for a dry version n hope the outlet adds that option soon. The dish was filling n had a nice light gravy without the overbearing oiliness or predominance of red chillies.
Overall, it was a satisfying and delightful experience and one am hoping to repeat again.

Now they're closed for online orders, and are claiming their delivery guy's off somewhere else so it'll take them a while to deliver the rest of it.Tempted to take the bike out and find them to get my money back.

I had always looked forward to sampling some of these since discovering this chain close to my workplace. My first order with them and by just their food quality they would have got a bit higher rating. However, very messy packing of the cooler which had quite a lot of the drink seep out into the polythin carry bag and the very 'kachha' bill that I received left a bad taste in my mouth. Now coming to the food, I had ordered Non Veg burger combos with fries and cooler. The burger with added egg and mushroom was pretty good and filling, much recommended. All in all the food quality is good but the packaging is very disappointing hence a word of caution for everyone trying to get the food home delivered. Maybe I will go there one day and add to this review.

The food was delivered almost an hour late because of an unforseen circumstance, but they were kind enough to remake the items due to the delay and I received them as complimentary.
The rolls had the appearance of homemade tortillas.
They arrived fresh and piping hot, accompanied with ketchup. With a filling of melted cheese and sweet corn rolled into crispy cigars, they were good enough but taste could have been improved.
The food truck scene is immensely popular in America and the concept is slowly gaining ground in Kolkata. For burgers, fast food, street food and the like TFT can be given a try.

A new concept in the city but let down by value (both quality and price). Ordered the Grilled Chicken Maharaja Burger Combo that comes with fries, a cooler and a slice of cake. Asked for extra cheese and egg. Ordered through Swiggy which delivered it hot within 20 odd minutes. The burger was packed in a shallow aluminium rectangular foil container - the stuff that's used to pack gravies. Therefore, it was semi-squashed. The bread was soft but the rest of it was very average. The patty seemed to be of minced chicken and not chunks of grilled chicken as you would expect by reading the description. The lettuce was old and not fresh and barely there. No tomatoes as you would expect in a burger. Could not find much cheese though had asked for extra cheese. The fries were overdone. Maybe re-fried and therefore were hard and tasted bitter. The only saving grace was the cooler which tasted nice and the marble cake slices that came in the combo. At Rs.330, KFC or McD's are better choices any day.

Sandwich is good. Chinese combo, sometimes they make it really good, other day it was too oily. Well, a mixed review you can try your luck, you never know, what good thing you may get!

I had always looked forward to sampling some of these since discovering this chain close to my workplace. My first order with them and by just their food quality they would have got a bit higher rating. However, very messy packing of the cooler which had quite a lot of the drink seep out into the polythin carry bag and the very 'kachha' bill that I received left a bad taste in my mouth. Now coming to the food, I had ordered Non Veg burger combos with fries and cooler. The burger with added egg and mushroom was pretty good and filling, much recommended. All in all the food quality is good but the packaging is very disappointing hence a word of caution for everyone trying to get the food home delivered. Maybe I will go there one day and add to this review.

Ordered, the delivery took 1:30 instead of 45 minutes as promised.
The "melt" burger was pathetic and randomly filled with paneer. No veggies. Overall a never again kinda experience.

They should learn to value their customers.Had ordered wrap and burger.They called me and confirmed that order would be delivered.I had to wait for 1.5 hours after making payments online.Then they cancelled the order and Zomato support executive called me to confirm they cannot deliver.If they cannot deliver they should not have accepted the order, why accept , make customer wait and then cancel the order.

I'm writing this review for TFT after 2 months of being there. The food truck is clean, there were only two people managing the truck but they were really efficient. We ordered the fish and chips and mutton galauti burger. Both were really good. The prices are pocket friendly and the food finger licking. What more do you need?

It was great to pass by this superb food truck. Didn't have much expectation but it came out really well. We had ordered fish n chips, chicken drumsticks, chicken cheese burger and I personally had ordered Italian cheesy wrap. The taste was great and lip smacking! It was a nice experience. It was good to see how they prepared the food right in front of our eyes with the cleanliness of the kitchen on wheels maintained! Would definitely visit this truck again to try out other dishes. Keep up the good work

The Burger was excellent. The patty and the sauce were not typical off the shelf variety. Adding some French fries will not hurt. 
The fish and chips were good. Out of the 3 I ordered, unfortunately mine was a bit too well fried. But the fillet was seasoned perfectly.
Great job TFT.
Can I make a request. 
Beer batter fish fry. 
Keep it up.

Good things come in small packages, and this food truck is the perfect example of that! Be in veg or non-veg, every item on their menu is good. I can rarely say this for very few restaurants even. Parked right beside 10 downing street sec-v, it's a lovely place for a quick snack.¬†
I had the Mutton Galouti Burger with Fries and a Butter Chicken Wrap! Both were very tasty, the burger patty made fresh everyday. The Fish n Chips is damn good too. Good quality of fish is used and the covering is light as well.

Loved it. 

It's located right Infront of 10 Downing Street. 
A colourful truck parked on the Main road with enthusiastic servers. 

We ordered Mutton Galouti Wrap and Fish and chips and Thandai.

The fish and chips was perfectly seasoned with ample amount of fries. Came with a tartar sauce, mustard and tomato sauce. 

The wrap was thin and little filling, but it was tasty and not oily at all. Tasted super fresh too. 

The Thandai was average, but wish it was colder. 

Recommend - Yes!

A fresh concept for the city, that food truck promises you reasonablly priced food with an experience to take back home-like the experience of being served from a truck.
Good trucks are a common site everywhere , but have gained momentum recently for the city.
Spotted the truck parked last month at the tastes of india exhibit and tried the mushroom burger. The burger was home made and had a good portion of mushroom.
Was quite filling and I enjoyed it.

Plan to try them out again soon. They are originally parked in sector v. 
Cheers.

The truck resides just a building next to my office and hence it's a top light lunch option on my list (since I'm not much of a rice-n-fish kind of Baangali). The wraps they prepare are yum.

There are food trucks and then there's That Food Truck. Located on a very busy street,  these guys manage the art of juggling traffic, dishing out good food and serving with a smile splendidly. 
Went there on my recent trip to Kolkata and was so blown away by this chic truck. 
Tried the fries; not overdone, just perfect. The hakka noodles were so nicely flavored and balanced. But for me, the veg melt burger with cheese was supreme. So much flavor and cheese packed between the fresh soft buns. Yum! And even though I was quite full, I couldn't resist trying the paneer wrap as well. It was great too. 
The service is quick and the staff is polite and courteous. 
Kolkata, you need to try this place if you haven't already. Highly recommended..!

I liked it so much that I ended up ordering the Paneer Crunch Burger with Fries.. The burger patty was very soft and it is undoubtedly the best Paneer Burger I have ever had.. The fries were also very crispy and the quantity served was pretty good.. I hope they keep up their service and also open a TFT near Kaikhali so that it's closer to my place.. :D

So, this was my very cautious tryst with a Food Truck, because I always thought you would get these really bready-airporty type food. NOT. TFT was an eye-opener, and man is the food addictive. Because, Hello? Eating out can be really expensive if you are as much of a snacker as me. I ordered a Veg Melt with Mushroom burger and coke (zero) first, I was blown with the flavour, I was expecting some standard tikki burger and was gladly surprised. So much so, that I ordered corn and cheese cigar rolls too after that. Full on bhukkad style, and was not disappointed.The prices are pocket-friendly, the food is tasty and they are damn clean with the food and all. I have started binge-snacking here pretty often. Much Recommended.

Repeat visit after nearly a year: An underwhelming experience. While the menu & offerings have improved, I can't say the same for the food (tried the veg melt burger this time). Cold bun, random patty, not a lot of flavour. The only point of interest was what I think was bbq sauce. Frankly, 90 bucks for that size and quality is a rip off.¬†

A menu typical for a food truck. I found the veggie mushroom good (despite the aloo domination) but fairly small in size. I am not sure they are doing justice to the price. The fries were a perfunctory addition.

Found that Truck infront of 10 Downing Street. A nicely painted cum decorated truck serving an awesome bunch of finger licking dishes at the most busiest part of Sector V. We had a chicken Wrapped Roll. The staffs are very friendly. Service time is very prompt. Surrounding by big brands THAT FOOD TRUCK has made his own positing by serving great food in pocket friendly prices. Total take away station. Sometimes you may find few chairs to settle down for few quick bites. Definitely recommend for the people working in that area of saltlake to enjoy Good Food.

This one is a fancy food truck for real, situated opposite rdb, salt lake, sector 5...they serve varieties of wraps, burgers and finger foods and it being a food truck, you can see stuff being cooked in there which is bound to amplify ur appetite as well as the expectations of your taste buds..i tried their cheesy italian chicken wrap and it was delicious...could'nt have asked for better,xcept that the chicken quantity could have been a bit more..the wrap is appreciable in size and girth and can satiate your hunger at any time of the day...prices you pay are just what is mentioned on their rate board..no taxes , nothing...overall, a must try for a quick bite...

The burger was awesome - fresh,soft,juicy inside,a chicken patty that satisfies ur taste buds. The French fries were little hard/overcooked. Overall very nice experience, would like to visit soon.

A nice truck to have in the neighbourhood for a change. This food truck serves some of the best burgers at a pocket friendly price. Their menu is simple and is displayed right in front of the van. The guys in the van know their craft. Over the last few weeks I have visited this place multiple times and loved their food always. Their burgers (grilled chicken, galawti mutton, paneer crunch) are absolutely wonderful and they come with fries. I loved their italian chicken wrap too. I am next waiting to dig into their scotch egg surprise and butter chicken wrap. An extra 0.5 for the clean cooking area. Overall a big thumbs up.

A very decent find in the most busiest part of salt lake has left us content and the urge to try more of their offerings in the future . Small snacks party is an everyday happening in the it sector . Whenever there is a birthday or some other occasion there is a demand of bringing finger fast food that is available in decent rates . Till now , this demand has been fulfilled by pizza and kfc options . But the problem with these options are that they are not innovative rather degrading in quality and are pretty badly priced . I feel that endeavours such as " That food truck "  can make us ignore those options and embrace the new age of finger food gleefully . We decided to give a try by sampling 2 of their items and it was a good experience .

¬∞ Location :- This is located close to 10 downing Street which is located just after the RDB cinemas in salt lake sector 5 .

------------------------
¬∞ Food :- We ordered the following :- 

1. Grilled chicken burger ( 4 / 5 ) :- A very decent burger at a very decent price . Served in a container with fries . The buns are of good quality and it has a thin but tasty patty with grilled onions and mayo . It is not that heavy , rather light and the taste is good on the tongue . So, at 99 rupees this is a good burger to count on.  

2. Scotch eggs ( 4 / 5 ) :-  Not exactly the real authentic version of the dish where a hard boiled egg is wrapped around sausage meat but still a good one or rather a better version of egg devil . Proper sized boiled eggs are used for this and the preparation is good with mayo spread over the item . At 50 rupees , 2 pieces are enough to satisfy your egg cravings . Very much recommended .

-----------------------

¬∞ Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- Okay so this is how it goes if you are looking for them to deliver items, it has to be a minimum order of 2000 rupees . If not you can always order from Swiggy . Since Swiggy was somehow not delivering at our location we decided to go ourselves and 4 burgers and 2 Scotch eggs was served withing 10 minutes. 

¬∞ Verdict :- It is a must try for finger food enthusiasts ,foodies and those seeking a small food party in their offices . We need more and better endeavours like these so that we can cut off  dependencies from overpriced franchises like the ones I have already mentioned in the review .

The concept of food truck is catching up quick in Kolkata. Most of the times these guys are stationed in Sector5, right outside 10 Downing Street. The person manning the counter is nice. The service time is decent. The prices are extremely reasonable hence the crowd, explains it all! Tried their chicken cutlet and chicken grilled burger. The quantity is good. Tastewise loved the burger more, the fries with the burger was crunchy n non oily.

Had the tandoori aloo wrap.. was not what I expected had too much potatoes and  had very less meat.
Even the employees had no gloves when making the food they are not even washing their hands

The concept of food truck is still new to Kolkata. But here today I just found my new love !! It's called Scotch Egg Surprise...!! *Muuaahhh*¬†A hard boiled egg enclosed with spiced mashed potato and covered with bread crumbs. Deep fried and served with some cheese & mayo sauce, it's simply awesome. Then came a Grilled Chicken burger. Freshly made chicken patty placed in a fresh & soft bun, dressed with some lettuce, caramelized onion rings, spicy mayo and some extra add-on cheese, this simple burger is really something to crave for. ¬†
This place is a great choice for some quick bite or a satisfying lunch.All the foods are freshly made and hygiene is not at all questionable. Prices are pocket friendly .¬†
Yes, seating is a concern but this trivial factor may be overlooked.

Hoping to ¬†visit again soon..!!

One of the best Burgers i have eaten in Kolkata. The patty is nice and soft unlike the recent trend following KFC, in which they try to make the patty crunchy, instead making it just taste bad. The ingredients are fresh. Bang for bucks! Hope it doesnt stop selling.

What a find this is! Parked right outside 10 downing Street near RDB , this was an impulsive stop for a bit to eat after a movie date with the husband. Might I start by saying I love food trucks and I can't get enough of them, and I wish there were more in sector v to tide over the high end or jhoop dilemma. What draws you to the truck is the fun colourful exterior and the big pop up flex menu. Everything is priced really well and perfect for a daily lunch err if you are not the Tupper ware kind. The scotch egg Is a must have. It's served with cheese sauce and the egg is done really well so it's soft but not runny. Also they have gone easy on the coverage which is a welcome break. Tried the mutton galauti burgers and it's the BOMB. Fresh burger buns and softest flavourful patty . Even if I were to judge it as a Kebab would have given it full marks. Met the man behind the menu as he was wrapping up for the day and was impressed with his passion for food on a budget. Will swiggy the Chinese meal to work sometime next week and hoping they can live up to the high standards they have set for themselves.

So while walking down the sector 5 road we came across this funky looking food truck and were really excited to grab on something! We tried the Veg Chinese Combo which had hakka chow and chillie paneer(one of our favourites) and we were delighted to taste it.. the food was steaming hot and delicious and the quantity for that @cost was really a worthy deal!

Food trucks are a fairly new concept in Kolkata and  That Food Truck is one among them. This pretty painted truck generally finds it's spot in front of the RDB Boulevard in sector 5. It offers quite a good variety of dishes. All the dishes are prepared in from of you and are steaming hot and fresh. On one side of the truck  there are few stools to sit and have your food as well. The truck is very clean and tidy.  Now we tried the fish and chips  which could compete with the fish and chips of any good fine dining restaurant. The fish was soft without any smell. It was crispy and crunchy on the outside as well. It was served with finger fires and tartar sauce. We also had the chicken wrap which was full of cheese and chicken. You can even pack your food up here so we decided to pack up a fried rice and chilli chicken platter. The dish was packed properly and it tasted very good. The food is authentic and is very affordable. This is surely recommended for everyone. :)

Location: Just opposite of RDB boulevard, sector 5.

The only form of street food available in the West is the food from food truck. The food truck business started slowly in this city a few months ago and Kolkata now boasts of more than 5 food trucks placed at different corners of the city!

So, today I decided to try out this particular food truck's food, which is quite popular with the office goers I sector 5.

First things first, I was very impressed with cleanliness and hygiene of this truck. Very organised and very neat and tidy. Full points for that!

Food ordered :

‚Ä¢ Mutton galouti burger : ‚Çπ120 will fetch you a burger and some fries.

The patty was a bit thin, but considering the price it was good enough. This burger was very delicious, I absolutely loved it. 

But, I didn't quite like the fries. 
Fries should be crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. The fires here were very heard due to overcooking.

‚Ä¢ Scotch egg : ‚Çπ45 bucks will get you one scotch egg cut into two parts. This item was flawed. I'll Tel you why:

Scotch eggs are supposed to have a mutton mince surrounding the egg. Here, potato mix replaces the mutton mince.
Secondly, the yolk should be runny. The yolk should ooze out once you cut into it. But here the egg was hard boiled and deep frying made the yolk firmer.

However, the taste was decent only.

Pocket pinch is low.

Well, the concept of food trucks is not new in Kolkata ‚Äì but still in it‚Äôs infant stage. Had already been to the ‚ÄúFoodie Roadie‚Äù food truck a few months back ‚Äì and today, visited the latest food truck vendor addition to Sector 5 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThat Food Truck‚Äù. They park themselves outside the 10 Downing Street restaurant nearby RDB Cinemas and can be easily located ‚Äì given the eye catching colours and huge size of the truck. Obviously, you can‚Äôt expect a hardcore ambience when it comes to food trucks ‚Äì a couple of stools were arranged beneath the trucks shed ‚Äì where customers can sit and have their meals (and also take shelter from monsoon ÔÅä). Food variety and availability is not bad either and they display the menu on a white board instead of a menu card. Since I was not too hungry I decided to opt for their Paneer Crunch Burger as a takeaway ‚Äì which is served with complimentary French fries and is priced at Rs. 75/-. The dish was prepared in some 10 minutes and neatly packed in aluminium foil container along with ketchup. Burger was fine ‚Äì not great though and I was expecting a greater sized burger. Patty was fine and sauce content good! However, the fries really impressed because they were crispy even after hours - a trait not so common in French fries (although oil content was high). 

Service is fine and prices are not high. Wish this place the very best of luck and great success in future.

Was tasty no doubt.  Seemed hygienic. Hope it stays this way . So can try more stuff here. People were eager for feedback. And prices are ok. So definitely in the "lets try more items" list .

Great concept but need upgrade your services
1) they have 1 litre of package water where as you can give 200ml and 500ml package water.
2) I had Tawa paneer Wrap which was good but for Kolkatian wrap and roll are same. So was not happy with the tortillas used bcoz we are happy with the thick and fresh tortillas rather than frozen ones...

The concept of food trucks are slowly evolving in Kolkata and we actually have quite a handful of them. Rdb is a place which is often visited by me and my friends and once I thought of trying something and it was not bad. I liked the galawati burger and the Dili butter chicken wrap. It's quite a nice place in sector 5 to quench your hunger. Happy Eating üòâ

This is the first time I tried out food from a good truck. I really like the concept of food trucks and I'm glad there are quite a few in Kolkata. This particular one is in sector 5 , right in the IT hub of the city. I had their galawati burger and the veg cheese filo. Both were good. The cheese filo had a sour and cheesy dressing over it and the burger was delicious. The mutton party in it was soft and tender and there was a generous serving of onions and mushrooms in it. Would very likely come back here.

Good response from office goers of sector V I must say..given its been month since they started this venture, 3 friends together and have plans of expanding soon. Kudos to them.

It is really a bliss for Kolkata that the concept of food truck is getting viral gradually, catering to the people on the move. And one such addition that is really worth appreciating is "That Food Truck" which is near RDB Boulevard at sector 5, Salt lake.
Honestly, the food is very tasty, and prepared fresh right in front of you and served hot. The service is fast and the service persons are really very courteous, helpful and happily smiling, which is sure to delight anyone.
People should be thankful to Mr. Aditya Jaiswal, for this blissful gift which is useful for a quick meal, and sudden hunger pangs.

That Food Truck.. This is a new concept that has been launched in Kolkata.. This is basically a Truck that has a kitchen and sells food on the go. ¬†Currently it is being parked in Saltlake sector 5 opposite RDB cinemas. It can be parked elsewhere too in case of parties or events. This is currently my favorite hangout cum food joint because of the proximity to my workplace. ¬†The USP of this truck is being able to sell tasty food , which is prepared under extreme hygiene conditions , at prices which no food joint can match.¬†

My recommendation to other foodies would be to taste the Galowti burger and the Biriyani. ¬† The burgers are better that any KFC or McDonald's burger. Must try for everyone. The wraps are a brand new concept which you wont find anywhere. And regarding the Biriyani , this is for the ones who are calorie conscious but want to eat tasty food.

Kudos to Aditya Jaiswal, the owner, for starting this new food revolution in our very own Kolkata.

After watching "The Chef", food trucks have always been eye-catching and seem like a great idea. This was on my list because of it's proximity to my workplace. We ordered a chicken cheesy Italian wrap and Grilled Chicken Burger. Both of them tasted good and were a little overpriced given their quantity. Their menu doesn't have a lot of variety. The rice menu wasn't available. It's a brilliant idea set on a great location.

That Food Truck (TFT) is a great place for having burgers. I just loved their burgers which were quite different and better than the ones sold in McDonalds or KFC. The burger patties are too good and just melts in your mouth like butter. TFT is placed at a very convenient location and the food truck itself is very beautifully designed. A very new & unique concept in Kolkata. TFT surely gives us a huge relief from the usual chinese, momo and roll serving food joints which was the only option for Kolkatans till now.

One could easily say that this is the only food truck in true sense. If you visit other ones in the city you would find the usual momos and Chinese. That Food Truck serves Burgers which are great. Must try Galouti Burger. Try the wraps it's delicious my favourite is the one with cheesy chicken. If you like eggs then must try the scotched egg it's just awesome. The surprise package is the Mutton Daunde Biryani hope I have spelled it write, it's just marvellous. It's not an usual Kolkata Biryani and it's too good. If u are a vegetarian don't worry they have enough options for you. All in all its Priced very well at a pocket pinch of Rs. 150 u can fill yourself with good food. Seeing the revolution of food trucks in the city. This food van stands out of the all. The menu is not usual like others. Great going. Hope to see some more of That Food Trucks parked in the central part of the city.

'That food truck' parks their van opposite to RDB Boulevard, Sector-5, Salt Lake. Situated at the IT Hub of Kolkata, the food truck gathers crowd during the evening mostly.

They make wraps, burgers currently. The choices are very less to select from the menu. I had ordered a burger, cheesy veg felo, and a chicken Mexican wrap. The burger was very delicious and cheesy, and it came with French fries. Just the way I like it. The felo too tasted good. The wrap was average. 

My recommendation would be to go for the burgers here. 

There is no such seating arrangements. Just one-two chairs. But who cares about it, when you are here to 'just fill your tummy'.
