Situated near to vivekanda road and bidhan sarani crossing,It's not exactly a cafe. It serves chinese and north indian delicacies though all items are not available most of the time.Air conditioned sitting arrangement is on the first floor which is basic.The glass facade through which one can enjoy the view of Vivekananda ancestral home and busy Bidhan sarani is worth mentioning.
Coming to the food. I tried their north Indian twice and got disappointed. CHICKEN CHAP was too much spicy, oily and salted. CHICKEN BIRIYANI was below average.
One of the staff is very polite and prompt in service. I wish I would get some better quality food served by him on my next visit.
Till then my rating is 2.5 for the below average quality food.

I had ordered a crispy chicken as a takeaway. But it was so badly charred and hard, less than half of the bits were edible. Cannot judge a restaurant on the basis of just one dish but it is a really simple recipe, they couldn't even get it right.

It is located in bidhan sarani,just opposite to swami Vivekananda's Ancestral house,the place is quite modern looking... It's clean and well decorated.. It has a glass panel in a side by which one can have a view of the road...ambience is nice. You can hangout with friends also. They don't much staffs though, the service is quite slow too and food quality is ok.I went there with my friend, we ordered chicken momo,hakka noodles. The quantity was well enough. The restaurant is pocket friendly too so a rating of 3.5

It's one of the latest restaurants on Vivekananda Road. The restaurant has a glass panel on one side which gives you a view of the Swami Vivekananda statue and his ancestral house. Overall it's a nice restaurant with not too high prices.
They give a lime soda free if you post a picture in the restaurant on Zomato which is nice. Do go and try the lime soda by posting a picture of yourself on Zomato. The staff here are nice and talk to you very politely. There is a takeaway counter below as well which offers almost everything on the menu in the restaurant.

This is a small eating joint on bidhan sarani just before Hedua Park. The sitting area is on the first floor. Moderately clean place having a takeaway and roll counter on the ground floor. Chinese and Indian items are on the menu card. I have tried their fish fry which comes two pieces per plate. The coating is a bit thick and tastes moderate. The fish is not bhetki. Also tried their chili fish which was too salty and spicy. The gravy chicken and egg noodles were OK in taste. However the chicken pan fried momo is good. Overall if you are in that area for shopping in hatibagan or near Hedua can give it a try.

This is not in Hatibagan but right opposite to Vivekanda Museum, close to Vivekanda Road Crossing.
Easy to locate, Clean n simple place, Average Staff service, When I went with my folks, the entire restaurant was empty.
Food:- Our order was
1. Chicken Biriyani which was average.
2. Chicken chap:- Good
3. Chicken & Mutton Kosha it was the most tasty dish of our order.
4. Tandoori Roti improperly cooked could smell n taste the raw maida,
5. Chicken & Mutton Rezela the worst I have ever had in any muglai restaurant, just waste of money.
6. Butter Nan: Was average n bit rubbery kind.
7. Laccha paratha : Deep fried, tasted good but was nothing close to laccha paratha.
8. Masala Thumbs up had a taste of dettol. May be the glass was washed in dettol for hygiene purpose.

The Mutton pieces were hard and needed a lot of strength to separate the fibres. Mutton fat had turned rubbery, guess not much people order mutton here.

Over all experience was just below average...

Ya I also forgot to mention there was. An ad which said if you upload a pic of your dish on zomato you get a free a fresh lime soda which not only did not have but said its an old offer not valid now. But they don't want to take it off their wall. Pic added below

It's not swanky or chic but it serves good food and at very good prices.The waiters are forthcoming.We were a group of eight ,who after a fierce round of pandal hopping on Chaturthi decided to order Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Lababdar.Both were good.But the Lababdar was worth mentioning.We also got served with chilled Thums Up in tall cone glasses which was really cool.Overall nice experience.

Royal Cafe is the latest added restaurant at Vivekananda Road area. Located just opposite of Swami Vivekananda's House, near the Vivekananda Road crossing makes it very easy to find!

It is completely a family restaurant. It Can easily hold upto 30 persons at a time. Well decorated, neat and clean,so no question left for hygiene level! Few posters regarding Zomato are there, which tells that, if you upload the pic of your dish, then you will get a lime soda for free!!!! Hahaha sweet, isn't it??

Service is fast enough, and the management is quiet good, well mannered and helpful also.

They offered large number of Indian, Chinese cuisine! Among all, I ordered Mixed Hakka Chow as a main course and Chicken Szechuan as a side dish as Chinese cuisines are my all time favorite!

Mixed Hakka Chow - Comes into a bowl! Tje quantity is enough for two persons! The noodles are bit oily in nature but well cooked!!! Not so veggies are there, but sufficient amount of small chicken, egg and shrimp are added into the Chowmin and all are well cooked, Overall 3.75 out of 5 from me!

Chicken Szechuan - I want to have some some hot n spicy chicken item as a sode dish, excluding Chilly Chicken. So they offered me to choose between Hot Garlic Chicken or Chicken Szechuan nd I choose the second one! 8 pieces Chicken are there. Chicken pieces are all well cooked, juicy from inside, tender but the size of orginal Chicken pieces are small in size. Thick layer of cornflower are there but overall taste good! The greavy was not so hot in nature but mid spicy nd I love it! Overall a good side dish you can try on!

As a conclusions I can say, if you want some good quality Chinese food, then you can visit this restaurant! All food are not so high in price, and they don't add Service tax and VAT, so it is quiet affordable too!! Visit this restaurant with your friends and family, and you will love it ....

One fine noon, as i was heading back from college, i decided to check this place out, located just at the junction of vivekananda road. As we all know, royal cafe though diff from Royal still hones our mind to a classic mughlai feel. So, i decided to go with my gut feeling and ordered a chicken biryani and a salad to complement it. And probably that was one of the worst if not the worst biryani i ever had or ever will. The chicken seemed stale and the rice and potato were undercooked. And there was no salt. It was like plain rice with a token of a chicken and potato. It was s***. And i would not suggest anyone to try this out as this might kill the enigma the smell of biryani has around it. It is a pain to the taste buds and i had to throw half the food away. The service was very average. Even the lemon served with the salad was rotten. Not recommended at all.

On 11th May evening I ordered for a chicken tandoori and a paneer butter masala for a home delivery. I found the chicken was stinking with rotting smell. When I called them to complain they agreed instantly and delivered a replacement. With utter shock the replaced product was equally rotten and completely unfit for consumption. Though the paneer was not rotten, it was horrible in taste. Would request all foodie friends to stay away from this joint.

On a sultry afternoon, mom and me were super hungry and super tired and walked into this random cafe for some lunch and rejuvenation! Honestly, had no expectations but whoaa! What just happened is as follows. We ordered for some basic food, a chicken sweet corn soup, some chicken kebabs, rotis and a paneer pasinda! Believe it or not, the food was pretty exotic! The soup was yumm, the kebabs tender and the rotis super soft! The paneer was a little let down but hey! Loved their hospitality! Over all a super thumbs up! You guys are going just the right way! Kudos! 
P.S - A note on the wall said if you upload a pic of their food, you can claim a free fresh lime! Hehe cute!

We visited in durgapuja. Their food was good. But they could not manage the durgapuja crowds. When there was a long queue in front of blossom there was only queue of 5-6 persons. But they made a haphazard situation.  The water supply was not there. They provided a bucket of water and mug in front of wash basin. One of the service man was behaving very roughly. He directly said to a customer ... "Eto bhir e asubidhe toh aschen keno?". Then all customers started shouting on them ..

Anyway then they bravely stated this is the branch of famous Royal Indian hotel borobazar. But this was not actually. 

We were not happy at all. But they provided a free mineral water bottle to all as a complementary. 

But I don't know how they serve other days.. You can try as their food was good.
