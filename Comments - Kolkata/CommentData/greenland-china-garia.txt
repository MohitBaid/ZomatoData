Good interior....the restaurant over looks the lake near Patuli. Good and prompt service...friendly staff. Food is good and tasty. The Thai Lamb is the best of the lot.

Lip smacking good food. Forgot the exact names what I ordered. I loved the preparations. Quantity is good. The proportions are enough for 2 people. Good chinese restaurant near locality. And above all pocket friendly.

Situated in an odd location...but the food is really good and the quantity is also very good. Ambience & decor...nothing great..a very simple one..but u will just love the taste. Though the name suggests chinese restaurant but its multicuisine..we ordered a mix up- tandoori chicken, mixed fried rice & lemon fish... All were great with big quantities...only let down was fresh lime soda..
