Had ordered a chocolate truffle cake on my daughters birthday. The owner got a cake made for us within an hour. The cake did not meet our expectations. There were choco chips in some part of the truffle cake but the crunch was missing.

We ordered a cake for our son's birthday. The owner was helpful and provided us pictures on whatsapp for selection of cake design. We asked for less sugar in cakes but still the cake was very sweet. The design was nice. For the charges we paid the cake was not worth and customer have better options in shops.

Had ordered a cake for Baby-shower for my wife, an extremely special occasion for us & COCO Hugs lived up to the expectations. I was spoil for choices by the no of designs given by them & the selected design was prepared inch-perfect. They regularly kept me updated reg the status of the cake & the final delivery took place absolutely at the right time. The cake was very yummy & my guests liked it a lot. Price of the cake was also competitive with respect to the other renowned makers.Overall a very nice experience.

My best wishes to COCO Hugs for a successful future & hope to avail your service again in future.

Thanks
