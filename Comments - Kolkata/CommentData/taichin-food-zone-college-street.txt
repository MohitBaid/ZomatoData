It is a very small road side eatery in college street area. Â Visited during college days. Place is perfect for quick bite. Serves chowmein, chilli chicken, rolls etc. Place is clean, foods are freshly made. Taste good, pecially the chowmein and chilli chicken, were my favourites. Prices are very reasonable.

This food joint is located near City college of Amherst street, which serves quickbites at a low price.

Zero ambience.

Quick service.

Tried Egg Chicken Roll, which was tasty with thin paratha but a bit oily.

Triasha Indian and Chinese is close to City college in Amherst Street. A small outlet serving Chinese and Rolls. I was attracted to their Fried Rice and Chicken combo offer of Rs.70 couldn't resit myself. The fried rice and chicken both were good in taste. Really liked it. Prices are also reasonable.

This is the 1st branch of Triasha located just near to the Amherst Street Police Station. 2nd branch is located at Boubazar. Its a small roadside food counter with some decent foods for daily hunger.

Location : This Triasha is located at Amherst Street near to Amherst Street Police Station or City college. (Correction of Zomato database this Triasha is located at Amherst Street not at College Street.)

Decoration : Triasha doesn't offer dining, just the take away food counter it is. If you prefer then you can sit on the benches in front of the restaurant to have your food.

Foods : Being a small food counter on road they have some simple but decent menu that can fill someone's daily hunger easily.

Chow : The noodles were very thick but very soft. Vegetables were used as per it was required to made it perfect. Big sliced onion & capsicum pieces can be easily seen. It was very spicy & oily but it tasted really good. It was not the kind of traditional Chinese chow mein but however it was, it felt really tasty. The sauces were of good quality too. Side dishes with this would be a pleasure to your mouth.

Fried Rice : Decent quality rice with decent quantity. Spices & small diced vegetables were mixed together really well. Little oily but felt really good. Chicken pieces were soft, mixed well & whole dish was cooked really well. Sauces are of good quality unlike other street food stalls. Overall fried rice over here tasted really good to me every time I ate from here.

Chicken Lollypop : Chicken Lollypops are crispy fried outside where chicken on the inside was well cooked & juicy. It also tasted great.

Rolls : They use very thin parathas to make rolls. Chicken & mutton kebabs are soft & well cooked, it also tasted great. But with the normal onions & lemon the rolls tasted very basic over here.

Pricing : All the dishes are well priced & almost same compared to nearby restaurants. The quality & price ratio makes the deal attractive.

Conclusion : You may think about other places being here but compromising the dining you can get better quality foods for sure. With good quality foods & value for money pricing, this is the best fast food counter I found in Amherst Street.
