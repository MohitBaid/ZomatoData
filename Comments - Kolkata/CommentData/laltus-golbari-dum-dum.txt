The price is reasonable and food is cholable. I ordered dry chilli chicken and mixed fried rice in my first order from this place online. The quantity would suffice for two. I frequently buy Biryani from the take-away counter. Good but not great. Their USP is their location near beautified Dhoba Pukur in Gorabazar and their lachha paratha rolls.

As the name suggests,Golbari is what I always consider to enioy mutton preparations.I ordered 2 plates of mutton kasha and one Golbari special mutton.It was really tasty and the pieces of mutton were also good.Apart from this we ordered kashmiri pulao and chilly fish,they also stood upto the mark.Overall if you want to enjoy some bong mutton and pulao dishes one can definitely try once.I hope it will never dissapoint you with either quality or quantity.

Laltu's roll. üòç

Tastiest roll centre in my locality.

Though I love laltu's golbari for their kosha mangsho and rumali rooti. Because minimum twice in a week, laltu saves my life. 

Yess.

What would I do without you Laltu's? ‚ù§

Well situated close to dum dum cantonment station..this so called restaurant seemed to me more of... a fast food center...than a restaurant... As far as the ambience is concerned.. its quit congested and suffocating and the management and staff r practically ignorant.. went there 1ce during the pujas just to check out the place. But was highly disappointed by the carefree behaviour of the staff they were even reluctant to turn on the AC as the the place was empty.... the food variety available here is quite limited..and the taste is ordinary.. mentioning them wil be simply waste of space... The only up side of the place is that they provide good quality egg & chicken rolls..the biriyani available here for take way is edible. & Usefull when u r busy to get to some proper restaurant for dinner....

Laltu's serves excellent, mouth-watering Biryani....in fact, best in the area...Their Indian and Chinese dishes are also quite good. Besides a meal at Laltu's is never heavy on your pocket. If they could arrange for some more space and train their staff a little, Laltu's could easily become a 'Fine Dining' place in the area. I enjoy their food, especially the Special Mutton Biryani, which is to die for.
Their South Indian session needs a bit of improvement in terms of taste and authenticity.

The advantages of having a subtle food joint in your area are many. It's okay to not have amazing food all the time. At times,just good food does suffice. And good food is the other name for Laltu's Golbari (in my area,ofcourse). We have always opted for take away options. Good biryani and rolls. They have some really good Kashmiri pulao. Just the right proportion of everything.
A nice place to have food from if you don't want to go far away.

The restaurant is pathetic.The food they serve is below standard and totally unhygienic.I ordered fro 6 plates of chicken biriyani , which they served and it was cold as if put in freezer. The people who serve in the restaurant are equally pathetic . When I complained to the owner Mr. Laltu about the quality of food and the immense time they take to serve the food , he threatened me to leave the restaurant stating that he was a localite and would beat me if I stayed there.¬†
I am surprised Zomanto still is in tie with this restaurant.

This place serves quality rolls..each and every variety of roll they have that i have had tasted better than the previous one. Good place for take away but not a very nice option for dine in. A very small area they have prepared as a restaurant and it takes them a hell lot of time to serve the orders in their restaurant section. Once we got so furious at their horrible service that we left with our orders packed and dropped the idea of having dinner there. Other than this their preparations are really delicious. Am giving a 3.5 only based on their roll centre but for the restaurant i would have given a 2. They really need to do over a few things but other than that a good place for a wholesome meal.

They delivered right on time and the food was hot...coming to the food, I found the biryani to be a little too greasy while a number of my guests loved it...they give a piece of boiled egg...something I love to have in my dish....the tikka masala was well made except the fact that it was a little tangy...overall a very good experience and a good try for people in this area....even the rolls they serve are very yum...

Laltu's Golbari is located just at the corner of the big pond (Dhopa pukur) in Dum Dum Cantonment amidst other small eateries. They are quite capable of preparing dishes including Indian, Moghlai, Chinese and Bengali cuisines.

As per the food goes they are at par across all the dishes. You can try biriyani and rolls from moghlai items, try the typical indian non-veg items with roti or nan and personally, I'm fond of their hot chicken momos with stock. They need to improvise their expertise on kebab which tends to stay raw inside.

They serve variety of rolls and indeed they taste awesome and the crowd outside their roll counter proves that. For lunch they provide home delivery of homely cooked Bengali food to the locals which is a good option for any small social gathering at home or if unfortunately your maid decided to take off from the kitchen. Over all a good place for good food without making wholes in your pockets.
