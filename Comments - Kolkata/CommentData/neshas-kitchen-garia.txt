The food here is good. Clean by all standards. Service is a bit slow and at any point of time you'll find this restaurant nearly empty - these don't take away the quality of food here. Highly recommended.

The food is ridiculous. Worst food i have eaten there. Any chicken side dish you order they will just give you chili chicken. Over priced. Road side food is better than here. I order two plate bar-b-q chicken. Asked to packed. Later I realize they have given only 1 plate. I will never be there again.

Prices are a bit too high. The taste of the dishes need a looot of improvement. The staffs were good.. but for a good restaurant the price and food quality as well as quantity matters a lot which all are missing here. Disappointed

It was Anand's previously...which was better. Sizzlers would not a good idea to try out here. Otherwise food is alright compare to price. Personally Chinese is better than the Indian.

I visited this place on a weekday afternoon. Besides the kitchen staff, there was just one more person attending tables, producing the bills and relaying the orders. We were also the only customers in the restaurant - I soon found out the reason why after tasting the food.

The restaurant has a good catchment area but fails to draw in crowds due to its average flavour of its foods and hardly any variety. 

Located right next to Palki, its a choice of where between two very average restaurants, with Palki being marginally better.

had placed an order of chicken biriyani,tandoori chicken biryani and mutton rezala! a list of points to make sure this place corrects their mistakes which we did not see in the past!
1. quantity of rice in chicken biryani was less.
2.mutton rezala had two small pieces.
3.they had increased price of food and so we had to pay 100 more than what the prices were before.
4.mutton rezala was a waste of money! priced @ â‚¹220 with only two small pieces!
5.food was just satisfactory!
6.they did not give us the new menu card with changed prices like they did before.
I am very very disappointed with the order today.please try to be better otherwise it will not be poss for us to order again!
