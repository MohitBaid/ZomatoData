Located on the 7th floor of the Park Prime Hotel near Minto Park on AJC Bose Road while going towards beckbagan. The lounge is currently renamed as 'Henrys' They both have an indoor and outdoor seating areas beside the pool with a nice cool dimmed light ambience and a disc floor too. The place is frightfully expensive. A cocktail like apple martini inclusive of tax will cost around 600 INR. Ordered crispy chilli fish on the side - the fish was not fresh. just tossed and over fired and then served.Â  Though the other restaurants of the hotel serves excellent food. Satisfied with their hospitality.

Renamed as Henry's, overlooks the swimming pool. Prices on the steeper side BUT the view makes up for it all. I wish it were only a sit-down-with-a-book place!

The swimming pool if kept clean, with the beautiful lights on would be a thing to behold. Full marks for the ambiance!

Possibly the worst place in Calcutta! Disgustingly dirty. Terrible service. Confused and untrained staff. 80 percent of the stuff on the menu is not available. Huge disappointment!!!

the place is quite ambient. and spacious. but the lack of a good food menu is a let down. the non alcoholics have literally no choice of drinks. the service is not up to the mark as well. the little food available is a treat to the buds though. the hookah is terrible. no choice of bases. no chilled pipes. just a regular street hookah which might seem vulgarly priced by some. on a whole, worth visiting for the sake of ambience. looking forward to a make over after the recent change in management.

We were a group of Four and wanted a nice place where we can enjoy the ipl Match cheering the home team . We were skeptical about the service and after seeing lots of negative reviews on Zomato. But we were looking for a quiet place and settled for Inferno Lounge Bar at last. 
We called beforehand to enquire the tables and were told getting a great place would not be a problem. We went around 7:30 pm and were warmly greeted and we settled into our seats. The menu did look expensive but the awesome interiors and the soothing music sure made us happy. We ordered a non alcoholic drink called Pussy Foot and a green apple mocktail (sorry forgot name). We had blackberry breezer (for myself) and we all had different flavors. We also ordered a large size chicken tandoori pizza and ny companions ordered scotch . 
About the service , we were quite satisfied with the service though the mocktail took really long to arrive. The waitor was quite polite and suggested us the dishes . We really liked the pizza suggested to us. It's true that the service is a bit slow but as we were there to watch the game we were quite ok with it. The rooftop pool was quite attractive and the view from the floor was amazing. 
All in all the weekend was well spent and we were quite happy to pay the bill of about 8k. If you want to spend some quiet and quality time with good view and nice ambiance then this place will surely amaze you.

We saw the reviews of this place on Zomato and then saw the reply given by the management and thought this seemingly nice place may have improved their services. To our utter dismay, last Saturday night turned out to be a disaster. The happy hour offer was not clear and the waiters were anything but helpful. Unthinkable delays in serving orders, unnecessarily loud music, a totally empty place, sky high prices, stale and not so good food, pathetic shots (the 'Cocain' shot seemed nothing but strawberry juice) is what we got at the cost of 6233 of bill for 3 persons. The main course items had to such exotic names that written in so small fonts that we could hardly figure anything out in that dimly lit lounge. Very disappointing!!!
Suggest you all to please avoid this place at any cost, unless you are heavy on your pockets and ready to experience some pathetic customer service. Just to give you an idea of how bad customer service they provide, please find below a few instances:
1. We ordered a starter Krispy Lamb and it was served almost after 40 mins of placing the order.
2. We asked the waiter that what flavors of hookah they have, the waiter in the 1st place could not understand the question, and once he understood whatever options he suggested they were barely audible due to the too loud music being played. Also they took more than 30mins to give the Hookah.
Moreover, menu displayed here is an old one. PLEASE PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE.

Iinferno Lounge bar- Visited with couple of my friends few months back. As one of my friends being the member had a discount coupon where we get three drinks free with two drinks, half price chargeable on the main course with one main course and one starter free with a starter. 

We were pretty mesmerised by the ambience of Iinferno. 
We had even ordered hookah out here which turned out to be good. 

Its more like a lounge bar for youngsters in Kolkata and is doing well. The aloo kebab and paneer tikka as the starters were mouthwatering too. 

The two pizzas which i tasted out here was excellent. However, as visited months ago forgot the name of the pizzas. However i was really disappointed with the prices they charge on coke and water. 
--------------
To briefly summarise in short, 

Food presentation 3/5
Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 4.5/5
Hospitality 3/5

Pricy affair? Yes, indeed expensive if you lack discount vouchers. Recommended to visit in happy hours.

Well...i saw the pics...quite impressive...read the reviews, quite scaring but still wanted to experience the place..called them up and they told me that a package for IMFL drinks, some starters and pizzas/pastas would be 2200 each for  people....tooo high considering the fact that there are other places in the city which would charge between 800-1300....sorry but again not the greatest of impression....and i wont be going there with that price tag....

This place impresses you at the first glance.... poolside, neon-lit lounge, rooftop....!!! But wait, that's all about it. First thing that strikes you is that the place is deserted. I went there on a Saturday evening, and there were not more than 12 people in there. Ohh, by the way, I was in a group of 8. So that brings the figure down to only 4 people apart from us on a Saturday eve!!! Such a waste of a cool place. 

Since we were concentrating more on the booze, we didn't care much about the food. However, of what I remember about the edibles, they weren't anything out of the world. In fact, the ham pizza, I recall, was pretty plane jane; and the pizza bread was pathetically crusty. Service was just about ok. It's a boring place, overall.
