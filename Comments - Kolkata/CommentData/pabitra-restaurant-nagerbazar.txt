This place is at a stone throw distace from my place.I used to have rolls and noodles over here after my tuition. I have tried pretty much everything available at this place. Chowmein is decent over here. The quantity is pretty good for the price. I am not very fond of the biriyanis they serve here. It is also pocket friendly but somehow i don't like the scent and taste of the biriyani.

It is pretty much near pabitra hotel which serves amazing Kosha Mangsho and Rotis. Would recommend this place to every roll loving person.

Being very close to my home , it is one of the most popular in our household specially for its mouthwatering fast food. It's basically a quick bite joint. Starting from rolls of various types like egg chicken or both combined to fish fry. All these are affordable at a very low price. Moreover the quality is good and also the quantity is very satisfying. So overall it is with visiting.

Well sometimes when my parents not in home. Had to buy food from this types of places. Well you cannot afford those restaurants all the time. Foods are tasty. Ambience is not good. But the service is really really fast.

The best in dumdum for 1. Mutton Kasha and 2. Tarka. if you only have taste in your mind. Rest its very famous with the people in n around nagerbazar shyamnagar. Delivery is a good option as seating place isnt top notch. So if you wana enjoy finger smacking mutton sitting at your home try this.

Today I tried mutton biriyani. The quality is very average. worst part is - the place is very congested and tiny. This is not an idle place for dinner or lunch. Don't goðŸ‘Ž. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž

Being only 2 km from this restora, I went ahead to order from this wonderland. To my astonishment, the quality of food which they served could easily beat the so called 1/2 star hotels in its viscinity. Amazing food!! Would definitely order many times.

A small yet big-for-a-roadside eatery... Quite popular for the locals (as my friend who stays there told) mainly for their rolls and fast foods... Pocket friendly... Service is okay... Ambience okay... But value for money spent.... Have tried their rolls only... Yet to try other stuffs....

This is one of my favorite street food centers near jessore road. I have tried only a few items there, one of which is the egg taarka, and that is really good. I sometime even travel 3 km from my house for that item. The chicken roll and chicken kasha I tried there was also very good. I didn't like the noodle though.
The dining accommodation is not good and it is best to take the home or have the home delivery if you live around.
A street restaurant with good taste and very reasonable price.

Its more of a snacks corner than a restaurant. Too clumsy a place where you will hardly get to stand , while your order is being prepared. I stopped going to this place for 2 reasons. First, I found rats scuttling in the kitchen floor where they prepare the rolls. I felt this to be quite unhygienic. Secondly, advent of Aminia which serves better food at same rates.

To put it in a sentence, the best street hotel ever. Egg Tarka with Fried chicken gravy and Kosha Mangsho- Awesome. 
The place is too small, but we take away all the time so that's not really a problem.. ! Fast and generous service and again, awesome food.

Just like any other fast food restaurant at the vicinity of your neighbourhood, Pabitra has also managed to keep its locality people quite content and satisfied with its food. Considering the fact that you have aminia within a stone's throw, which is ever so crowded, you might want to try the chicken biriyani from this place which is amazing.
I like their chowmein more so because they manage to give you a good amount with quality taste. 
Do try their moghlais as well if you're not quite sure what to have apart from a roll for a light snack.
P.S This is a fast food joint irrespective of the items they make(biriyani, tikka, kebabs) so font expect to come a sit here for dinner 'coz you'll be thoroughly dissapointed.
