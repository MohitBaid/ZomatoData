Feeling happy to be the first reviewer for this place. I got a very bad habit of checking places which i see on the way, so i checked it too and surprise surprise found this on Zomato with no reviews. That what brought devils horns on my head :-p
Located at Camac street on the Shakespeare sarani more. Its a very small road side fast food joint but seemed very popular at this place with the amount of local crowd. 
I was quite quick not to waste any more time thinking and ordered straight.

Egg Chowmein - Looked great on the plate. From the preparation to the mouth it was very good. Egg was sufficient in the noodles.

Veg Chow - Tried the variety in the noodles with veg also, it was same as the previous just the egg missing.

Veg Fried Rice - Seemed very good and it was well made on the other hand. Not to oily and the basics were perfect. Tasted indeed was of a street side fried rice, Thou would definitely be trying their mixed rice too in near future. 

Egg Roll - Nothing to be so descriptive about it, just an ordinary one but with good quality.

Somehow found few places near my office which i can trust regarding my lunch purpose. Prices are cheap and quite pocket friendly.. Smilessss

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.
