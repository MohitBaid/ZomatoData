While taking a stroll through Park Street one evening, a few days before Christmas, decided to grab three rolls from here-2 chicken rolls and a paneer roll. But to our disappointment, none of the rolls were upto the mark. The paranthas were too thick and oily. The chicken roll lacked the appropriate flavours. One can have much better rolls at roadside stalls which are not so famous and which are not even there on Zomato. Service was quick, although we would not have minded if we had to wait for another 5-10 minutes for better rolls. Prices are a bit higher than other places which is not really justified considering the quality of the food they serve.

One of the best and authentic rolls of Kolkata. Loved their chicken kati roll with crispy paratha
Egg roll is also must try if you are roll lover.

The location of this take away place is superb but it becomes uncomfortable when there are a substantial number of customers.Prices are high compared to the quality.

Went to this place yesterday. It's located on the same side of the road as Asiatic society. Me and a friend ordered chicken roll and another friend had paneer roll. The rolls are extremely oily and not even well cooked. I don't know if it's due to the huge crowd. At least they can take time and serve well. Chicken quantity wasn't adequate as well. Better quality rolls are available in jadavpur or gariahat at cheaper prices. I must say the place is extremely overhyped.

Mainly this is treated as a Take Away counter, located in Park Street. I have been eating these rolls from my college days.

The rolls are bit pricy but no question about their taste, starting from Chicken, Mutton or Veg Rolls

I've been a long time customer of this place and rarely did I feel disappointment. Generally I'd rate this place at a 3.5 at least but last Thursday was a different story. Took a Chicken one during relatively quiet hours and was served a decent bite. Meat seasoned properly, cooked properly and the paratha fried decently. But the massacre happened when we indulged again a bit later after some errands, in the evening. The rush hours aren't kind to quality and it's forgivable but what we were served deserves no consideration to be exact when we know the potential of the place. The Double Egg Chicken roll was soggy and dripping with oil and the meat was tough...as if in between this 3 hours, the place was changed drastically.

I'll keep visiting this place since I've had satisfactory experiences on almost all occasions but I'll make it paramount to myself to avoid visiting during rush hours.

Located beside the iconic Asiatic Society on Park Street Hot Kathi Rolls is one of the most popular roll centres in Kolkata . One will find people waiting for their turn to get rolls of their choice in front of the outlet throughout the day . Rolls are delicious & the service is prompt while the price is reasonable. Seating is unavailable but haven't seen anyone complaining about that .Good place to get a roll of your choice.

Hands down the best rolls in town. With light and flaky paratha, juicy succulent chicken chunks, crunchy onions and chatpata masala, their rolls are a delight. 
I was a regular at the joint during my college days and preferred it over the 'famed' Kusum Rolls any damn day.

This roadside stall is located near¬†the Asiatic Society and is one of the best places to have rolls when you are in Park Street.
The shop is basically a takeaway one, with no seating space available.

In their menu, they have different kinds of rolls both Veg and Non-Veg. Though the variety of non-veg rolls surpass the veg ones.¬†

The price is nominal, compared to the roll they serve.¬†

I had an Egg Chicken Roll, and nonetheless, it was fulfilling and tasty. The parantha outside was crunchy, the egg a bit gooey and the chicken filling was yummy.¬†

In short, if you are around Park Street, paying a visit to this stall will elate you.

The shop is nearby Asiatic society on the park street,super easy to locate.It is a takeaway shop without any seating available but they are excellent in their work and the rolls they provide are tasty and the shop is super pocket friendly.They provide best kathi roll at very low prices.
I had ordered a vegetable roll which was at the cost of ‚Çπ30 only,the shopkeeper is friendly they ask you what to put and what not.Kathi roll was super delicious absolutely no complains with a perfect crunchy paratha and a perfect combination of sauces and vegetable.
I just loved it!
Highly recommended.
Wish to be back again soon!

Situated at the Park st - Chowringhee crossing near the Apeejay building, Hot Kati Rolls are famous for its eponymous Kati Rolls. Be that may chicken roll, egg roll, or the supremely delicious egg-chicken roll, all the roll variants are mouth watering. At a very low pocket pinch, you can satiate your hunger with these amazing rolls.

There are no seating arrangements, but the quality of the rolls are enough to draw crowd round the clock. The speed with which the three people team work is also a sight to see.

So if you are in Park street area and want to try the signature bengali street food - rolls, look no more.

One of the best places in Kolkata to serve quality rolls. As it is quite near to the park street metro and my college I have been here countless number of times. It has a lot of customers and remains crowded almost every time I visit.
The service is good and prompt. As far as the food goes the rolls have never tasted better. The chicken and mutton rolls taste heavenly . The quantity is decent compared to the price.¬†
To conclude this place is a must visit for all roll lovers.

If you roam around Park Street, it is very easy to point out the Hot Kathi roll joint just on the main road very close to Asiatic Society. Rolls are truly good in this joint, i like the filling inside the roll which adds to the taste. ¬†I had both chicken and mutton roll in this joint. As far as taste is concerned, it is up to the mark. The price is on the higher side compared to other roadside joints, but considering the location and brand, it is normal.

Famous.. Very old roll joint I can say. Near Park Street Metro station.
Nothing to say about ambience 'cuz one need to stand and eat. In the evening time it usually remains overcrowded.
I tried their chicken roll, egg roll..though bit oily.. But tastes good.

This place is quite famous  for the mouth watering rolls in park street. Always remains crowded. Different types of rolls are available. Prompt service. Chicken rolls and mutton rolls are superb. No seating arrangement so just stand & eat or take away. Pocket friendly.

This is one of the most popular Roll centre in Kolkata. Egg chicken or Egg Mutton Roll is one of the signature dish available here. Although there are numerous joints on Park street for eating and drinking, some just cant go home without having one the famous rolls from Hot kathi. Nothing to write home about, but after getting sloshes, its one of the cheapest and tastiest options available to fill yourself up before getting home. No parking place available here, you have to stand in front of the shop to eat.

Hot Kati Rolls, everyone is aware of this place, this place is as famous as Flurys or Peter Cat. Though it is a small street food shop or roll corner. It serves as one of the legendary place as well. No such ambiance or decor only it's food speak of its journey so far. We tried Egg Rolls, Chicken Rolls, Paneer Rolls all were awesome. A little over spiced was the chicken roll but it was satisfactory to me as I am a spicy food lover, the parantha was soft and crisp at the edges and chicken was juicy and fresh... Service is slow as it is always crowded with common mass of Bengal. The college students, office employees, lovers, higher school students, even I have seen aged people standing among the crowd to get a bite of this heavenly Rolls. Reasonable prices, tasty, filling what else can one ask for while refuelling oneself on the go..

üòãüòãI'm The 255th Reviewer Of This Little Joint Hot Kathi Rolls. Today I Visited This Outlet For The 1st Time Hot Kati Roll. And I Asked The Chef What Rolls Are Available At This Time. I Ordered Chicken Roll It Was Not Available Then I Ordered Veg Roll It Was Not Available Either. Then The Chef Said Egg Roll Will Be Available I Said Okay I Said What Is The Price He Said Rs. 30/- I Said Okay. Believe Me Friends It Was Good And Delicious And Yes Indeed They Serve Hot Rolls At Hot Kati Roll. Located Opposite The Mobile Store And Airtel Showroom. Near Maidan Metro Station. Thank you Hot Kathi Rolls For Making My Day Terrific.üòÑüòÑ

The place is must visit whenever you visit park street.

Located at the starting of park street coming from Maidan metro. 

The parathas are very delicious and soft.  Starting from the egg to chicken and paneer. They serve amazing rolls which is worth it with reasonable price.

Well with only 2 veg options, tried the most basic the veg roll. It had potato filling, nice gravy, missed some salad and other vegetables. There was nothing that I can boost about, the roti base was okay but the tomato ketchup poured in over shadowed other taste.

Heard so much about this place, thought of trying their 'so-called-famous' Kathi rolls. Seriously, this place is just over-hyped. Went there with a couple of friends, none of us liked it!! Five of us were there, we ordered paneer, chicken, mutton , double egg and mutton kebab roll. Quantity wise it's so poor, they barely give chicken , paneer or mutton pieces. If you're lucky enough then maybe you'll get hardly 2-3 pieces. The only good thing is that they use lemon and a special masala instead of using tomato and chilli sauces. Oh yes, how can I forget to mention the pocket pinch. Believe me, if you're a student, then it's really costly for you.If you're really looking for authentic Kathi rolls, visit Nizam's. After all they are the pioneer in this field. 
None of us will ever visit this place again.

Great rolls! The rolls are big and the bread is just the right amount of crispy. Ordered an egg chicken roll from this place and found it to be pretty damn great. The only con here is that there is no seating space here. The stuffing is also good though it could be slightly more in quantity. Overall, would recommend for a quick bite and could be one of the best roll places I've tried in the city yet.

Due to starvation in the evening last night finally decided to have their delicious rolls. Heard a lot about them. So, we ordered 4 chicken rolls for time pass eat. Instead there was crowded they serve it within 10 minutes. Mesmerizing taste but they should focus on the size for which people are paying. Additionally the behavior of one of the staff found to be little bit rude. Otherwise it makes a good place for some sudden meal.

After hearing a lot about this roll center, I decided to try it. The look of it was completely different than what I had imagined a "famous roll centre" to be. Its a small takeaway shop type of outlet. I ordered a Double Chicken Roll and it took ages to make it even though I was the only customer present. The price seemed too much at first but the quantity justified the price. It was quite big. The taste was good. Chicken pieces were fresh. Its not something extraordinary or fantabulous..but still, okay! Though not sure what all that hype is about! Considering the size, one roll is enough to keep your stomach full.

This place is remarkable for being just a rectangle in the wall and having more clientele than all the popular old kati roll outlets in kolkata. However, after building up a formidable name in the kati roll field they provide inconsistent service. Sometimes the rolls are excellent, sometimes underdone. The mutton used for the mutton rolls is rubbery. A huge negative is the use of vanaspati oil and not ghee.

The Hot Kati was the GO- TO place for rolls and part of the Park street experience for both locals and tourists. At this very popular joint, one has to wait and salivate for quite sometime before the first bite. A fan for many years , I still stand patiently to bite into the juicy spicy single egg single chicken roll (made without the sauces.) If you are really hungry ask for the double egg, double chicken and you are sure to have a good fill. However at similar price points, many good joints now make a less greasy option and are willing to customise a bit which is ¬†missing at Hot Kati Roll.

had heard umpteen number of times about this place. on a solitary tuesday evening decided to give this place a go. my car trundled along moon cratered roads and egging the prodding traffic ahead.
the first thing to notice is it's a small stall maintained by an ever smiling owner who doesn't loose his cool even at the most irant and pestering customers. he's helped by at least two others in handing out the wrapped rolls, apart from the cook.

let me now come to the thing of interest - had ordered for a single egg single mutton roll. the mutton pieces were soft juicy and really inviting. if only they could have been tastier. the paratha was soft unlike its peers elsewhere. however, i found the roll heavily oil-laden. nevertheless, i consider the place a must visit...

This place has a win win location, given that it's a few feet away from gate number 3 of park Street metro . The roll shop is extremely popular, and remains crowded almost at all times . But in terms of taste , their chicken roll had a very thin parantha , that wasn't thick enough for some nice lachchha layers, and was chewy . The filling tasted average , and being located close to the one and only Kusum Rolls , comparisons are obvious! I would recommend walking ahead to the lane beside oly pub to grab one of the best kathi rolls available in Kolkata, instead of opting for this very average Roll Shop, though this roll shop too has  its own set of loyalists!

No visit to Park street is complete without having a roll from this shop.

Located just at the starting of Park street ( it you're coming from Maidan Metro side) , I've never seen this place without customers.

The parathas they make for the rills are so delicious, although dripping with oil. Be it egg, chicken, egg chicken, all variants are yummy and definitely coaxes a recommendation!

Probably the best rolls in Kolkata.
Try Egg chicken rolls.
Very crowded most of the time since their taste is too good.
They use dalda vanaspati
For frying the paratha.they open the packet in front of the customers.
Their food is hygienically served unlike other roll stalls.

A long wait finally ends today. Have been watching this Roll Shop for over a year but never stepped ahead to have a try but today was the chosen day by fate. Located very near to Park Street crossing opposite to Airtel Centre. Very famous and loved by people around the Park Street area and stays crowded all the time.¬†
Tried Chicken Roll and Egg Roll both the same day. ¬†Coming to the Rolls so the Paratha was soft but lil oily and big in size. Chicken used were good in shape and very fresh, the look of the fried chicken impressed me and the preparation was also satisfactory. Egg roll was also of the same quality so no errors on that.¬†
No complaints but i seriously missed the crunchiness of the paratha which i preferably look for.

Legendary roll corner in Kolkata. Located at park street area, hot Kathi roll is the perfect place for your quick bite. They serve various types of rolls and kebabs too. I have tried veg roll and chicken roll here which are really good on taste. Standing in the queue for your favorite mouth watering roll and watching the roll making process is a nice experience too. If you are new at Kolkata and try to explore the old food joints then this place will surely in your wish list.

Rolls and Park Street are two inseparable entity. Hot Kati Roll is just near the Asiatic Society, a prime location to attract you whenever you pass through this place. A nice, fast counter prepares Rolls customised to your need. Although quite good I found the Parantha a bit less crunchy and fatter. Rolls should not be heavy to your stomach. In this case, I will say Kusum Rolls a tad bit better. Nonetheless, you can have a try, it may taste better to your tastebuds. Enjoy Roll-a-costa!!

Nothing much that can be described about this place. Located in the heart of Park Street near the Asiatic Society, this place probably only sell rolls (or I dont know about their other items). The Chicken and Mutton rolls are pretty decent in the sizes as well as taste. However, they are a tad more oily to people who dont want to intake detrimental insoluble oils and fats as part of chunk food.
Overall, a pretty decent place for a quick snack bite. A statutory warning - this place remains crowded most of the times, so avoid a bite here when you are up for any meetings or visits ! :)

I find this place to be a bit too much hyped when compared to the other roll shops around it. The taste is fine, it is definitely not the best roll I have had, quality is good, and the pricing, I feel, is at a premium. But again, there are people who are loyalists of this place. So, yes! Give it a shot.

Before giving a visit to kusum rolls,we went to hot kathi rolls to try rolls. Basically for us today was Roll Day üòù. Nevertheless, this was almost near the main road of park street. We took egg roll. It was good but i felt the parathas of kusum roll a bit more good. The egg roll was crispy indeed but lacked the spicyness. On the whole it was good.

Hot Kati Roll.... This place has nostalgia written all over it.... Situated just beside one of my most favourite book stores.... Family Bookshop.... Hot kati roll is the Mecca of Roll lovers of the city.... Some say it has deteriorated and not upto the mark.... I say don't listen to the nay sayers... Hot kati roll rocks.... More for its quick service and great quality then anything else.... I remember as a little girl I would have a packet of books in one hand and a Mutton roll clutched in another as my dad or mom or dadabhai sometimes all of us made our way to the car in Russell Street..... How I love the very whiff of the kati kebabs being stir fried to submission and then tucked away inside a soft parantha.... A little lime and chilles if you wish... No sauce please.... And then it is transferred to you hand.... One bite... And you are transported to heaven.... Yummilicious

There is very little chance that if you have come to Kolkata for a visit and you want to try out some of the popular offerings here, that you haven't heard of this outlet or plan to miss out on this. A popular roll joint located in Park Street, just on your way from the Park Street crossing towards Moula Rouge, this is a favorite hot spot for all roll lovers and is flocked by hungry elephants all round the day!

If you want to know what they are famous for? Answer is simple! 'Rolls'! Try their Egg Roll or their Hot Chicken Kathi Rolls. Being one of the premiers in this business, they know how to dish out the exact sumptuous roll to rule the heart of the foodies! Crisp, hot and filling, you are bound to get flattered with just one bite of the roll.¬†

The parathas are huge, yet soft at the same time. The chicken pieces are soft and well prepared in the tandoor. The portion here is quite filling and just one of them should suffice to answer your gluttony! But hey, you are always free to order one more if you cannot resist your temptation! I won't blame you, because these people are that good!

We went for a chicken egg roll and every bite of it was good. And that's about it. It's nothing out of the world but it's surely good. A must try??

As a college student this used to be one of my favourite haunts for chicken rolls. Located super close to the metro station and the Park Hotel, this place whips up delicious and heavy Kathi Rolls . For as long as I can remember, it has always been crowded and why not, given that they sell Rolls- a Kolkata streetfood staple, and that too at such normal price, in an area like Park Street where most places tend to be a bit heavy on the pocket. Yes you have to wait for a while before you get served, yes there's no place to sit and enjoy the roll (because it's a stall) but none of that matters because the rolls rock!! :D

To the lovers of rolls, this place is fittingly a must at the heart of Calcutta's hangout place i.e. Park Street. No sitting place here, just order and take it within minutes.

Relished there yet another time on my current visit to the city. The quality has drastically dropped in past few years. Once upon a time I used to travel 8 kms one way to fetch rolls from this place. Last time I had the paneer seemed stiff. The chicken roll was pretty dry. Tried chicken egg roll which was good, somewhat close to the taste left in my mouth of some year back.

Standing and cash only. Roadside stall

I don't know how many times I have visited this place... If you are in Park street and  want good rolls and is on a budget this is the place you should visit...packed always from opening till closing you can't miss this place...

They serve mouthwatering rolls on base on lachcha parotha...their base is crispy and soft not rubbery...it is made just in front of you so you can customise your addons.....

Their egg roll, chicken roll is legendary...they also serve veg rolls though i have not tried them...I mostly eat their egg chicken roll....

The double egg double chicken roll is huge and fills your stomach completely...the pricing is also competitive as per quality an area...

This place is flocked by all people..from students to office goers to couples...

A must try if you have not yet ate there...

Hot Kathi rolls is located close to the junction of park street. Since it is very much popular for its rolls, I decided to give it a try. I ordered a chicken roll priced at 40 bucks. Though there was a huge crowd, they managed to give me the roll within 5mins. It was unexpected so an extra 0.5 for the service.

Coming to the roll, the found the paratha to be thin and soft. I generally prefer a little crispy paratha for rolls. Nevertheless, I gave a bite. The name 'hot' Kathi roll is justified as the chicken filling was too hot. The taste was good too though nothing extraordinary but the roll was enough to satisfy my hunger. Overall a pocket friendly affair

You see the roll getting made in front of your eyes, the crisp parantha, the succulent kebabs, the sauteed onion and capsicum rings, drops of lemon juice, slivers of green chilli, tomato and chilli sauce as optional accompaniments, all rolled together to perfection and handed over to you in a jiffy - pure bliss - no mather whether you are hungry or not - calcutta kathi rolls at its best. For health conscious people it might be a no-no because of the amount of oil and refined flour involved in the preparation but it is difficult to resist the temptation when you pass by this quaint joint

They are one of the famous roll makers at the heart of park street
 since ages.

We have had Rolls many a times here and it was good however the quality of dalda that is used in is a point of debate¬†

We ordered for chicken roll and veg roll,the paratha is crispy and the pieces of the chicken ¬†that are added to the paratha disappointed me as they were small in size and less in numbers 3-4 at max (actually have a huge expectation from LONG TIME FAMOUS JOINT) and the stuffing in the veg roll was also not that good as it used to be and the staffing was cold so it ruined the taste¬†

The normal time taken for the service is more than standard time and recently they are not that good and have a tough competitions from the other roll joint in the vicinity.

Now coming to the prices which is reasonable and the quality is ok types...

Located just at the beginning of park street, you can locate this joint by the crowd outside it. We ordered for a chicken roll and egg roll. I found the rolls average and different from the ones you would have tried in Delhi/NCR. The bread was literally dripped in oil. The chicken was just about ok. 
I guess the price of the rolls make them so popular.

Chicken chunks - pulled out straight from the sheeks! Juicy, succelent and mouth watering!! 
Salads - fresh!
And last bt nt the least their choice of sauces and spices - good but could have been a bit better...bt that doesn't compromise the taste so it isn't a problem!

To all those who swear by their "rolls" if u haven't tasted here yet, you have tasted nothing! And those like me...are already their fan! HKR I am coming soon.....!!!!!

This place is among the many little joints on the Park Street, serving kathi rolls but its the best among all of them. Its located at the entrance to Park Street (Jawaharlal Nehru Road side), besides Asiatic Society. Its serves all the regular types of rolls, from egg to chicken to mutton, egg-chicken, egg-mutton, double-chicken/mutton, double-egg-chicken/mutton etc. I have tried there chicken roll twice and it's absolutely finger licking delicious. Its always busy serving customers and I am sure anyone who has tried their rolls will vouch for them as being one of the best in all of Kolkata.

If one is in the Park Street area looking for a quick munch, give this place a try, it won't disappoint.

Rolls and wraps are so common in Kolkata, there's almost an eatery at every corner. Where Hot Kati Rolls (Yes, Kati, not Kathi) stands out is the size of the rolls. The price is slightly on the higher side as compared to other reputed roll shops, but the size of the rolls are significantly larger. The softness of the paratha is also to be considered! They are also not at all miserly with their fillings quantity. Only negative point will be the amount of oil - it's a little too much. All in all, money's worth. Would always come back to this place to satisfy my roll cravings.

Walking down the park street and want to have a roll, this is the only place which strikes first. I have been having rolls from this place for a number of times from the childhood I should say. There is no point in reviewing this place as this place has been the same for years I should say.

The Mutton roll, egg chicken, simple egg all of them are simply awesome. By the don't forget to tell the person in the counter, what amount of onion, chili and which sauce goes into the roll and simply enjoy the taste.

The best roll shop in Kolkata. My favourite is Egg Mutton without ketchup and extra lemon.
The tenderness inside and the crunchy bites outside is absolutely mouthwatering. No compromise on quality and quantity.
Hot Kathi Rolls is a phenomenon.

It is useless to review this gem !! But I am writing this just to put a word out again that this small place provides u with probably the best rolls in the city . We had 2 egg chicken rolls which cost 50 rupees per piece . A superb way to kick off the evening . The thing about the roll here is you have got to have it at least once no matter where you live in the city . The paratha is huge, soft and crispy . The chicken pieces are tender and the egg is just super tasty topping on the paratha .Its mouth watering stuff. The people are very polite and well behaved as in they will ask you whether you are good with the chillies and sauce . You have to try their rolls .A mighty must .

Where in other fast food shops in kolkata egg roll costs Rs 20-22... here it costs Rs 28.... They add dalda in place of oil.. which adds great taste to the roll... i wont say am delighted... but it tastes very good... looking forward to taste its other rolls...

One of those moments that make me feel warm inside and teary eyed is when I order the double mutton roll here.

It is beautiful, it is sublime, it is borderline orgasmic.

That moment when the soft insides of the parantha gently caress the mutton that is showered with the crisp onions, the devilishly hot chillies and then lovingly drizzled with lemon juice, is the moment that can make the strongest of men go weak in their knees.

If this review doesn't make you get off of your backsides and drive for a mutton roll at this joint, then you might as well be in a coma.

I rate it a 9/10 because they really need to drain some of that oil before rolling up that parantha.

This shop is Located near park street metro station, opposite of the mobile store outlet.
 This is a very crowded joint. Hence we had to wait for a long time to get our rolls.
Now coming to their dishes i must say that the rolls is very nice from the paratha to the chicken every thing is very good. The chicken is very soft. So is the paratha.
But their rolls are a little bit too oily. Also the amount of the rolls are also not that much. But keeping the taste in mind one must not have any problem with the amount.
Love to visit here again...

This take away Roll counter is located on the Park Street main road connector near to the Basking Robbins & probably it is one & only affordable food counter in whole Park Street area.  The place is small where a person is busy with the burner for fries, one is giving shape flour to parathas & other one is cashier. Another person is standing outside the shop & giving shape to paraths to actual roll. There is always a large number of local chilli & tomato sauces bottle kept, that they uses for making the roll & it also gives an idea that how much they sell. The menu card is holding near to the cashier & all are very affordable especially when you are in Park Street.
Coming to the food : From a roadside take away roll counter you can't expect so hygienic food. There parathas are very simple & light, not so thin not to thick, but large enough to make your roll taller. Chicken inside the roll is soft, well fried & spicy, however not so juicy. Roll feels good, tasted good, just like most of the other roll shops nearby to esplanade. Rolls are not to crispy fry but you will not regrade its taste.
Conclusion : If you are hungry, standing in Park Street & you don't want to harm your pocket then you don't have any other options left either. But trying them will definitely feel your hungry stomach good.

Ordered a chicken roll and well, it was just decent. Nothing extraordinary compared to the kind of reputation it has got. I found the Parantha a bit too oily and the stuffing not enough (at least not what you expect after paying 40).

Not a must-go-back place for me.

The famous street side roll centre located in the food street of kolkata competing with the big restaurants  and still taking a special place in peoples' heart and stomach. Easy to find and popular for kathi rolls. You just have to wait sometime if there is a queue 'cause they serve you hot and immediately made food.  They have giant rolls with big chunks of meat. The mutton roll here is to die for. I always feel satiated and full after having one of their rolls.

Just before the turn of Park Street is an area of strong gust of spicy scent and that is 'HOT' Kathi Roll. One of the tastiest roll shacks of Kolkata is this.
If you are a roll lover this shack can't go unnoticed by you. I came across this one fine hungry afternoon while getting back home after a laborious examination. The spicy scent magically pulled me towards it.
The menu list is quite long and you can choose the tastiest rolls at a price that is pocket friendly.
Highly recommended for street food lovers.

After club-bar hopping for quite a few hour when the body can't take it anymore,you are reminded that you haven't had food for quite a long time. The pockets are empty and you resort to the affordable option available. You head out for the rolls.
Quite a good outlet with mouth watering offerings.
Visit the place once in a while whenever I am in the area.

Tried out the renowned hot kathi rolls yesterday with my friends upon their suggestion. all of us opted for chicken rolls.

The service took time due to the large crowd. The rolls were served soon after & to be honest they were average specially the paratha dough which could so easily make or break a roll's taste. The paratha was very oily to say the least but the stuffings of chicken,onion & sauces were good.

I personally believe they are over-charging for what they are serving to their customers. So they must improve their rolls to maintain their fame & status!!

Heard a lot about their rolls, so one winter evening went to try that. But I am highly disappointed. I have ordered mutton roll. It was normal in taste and nothing special. But the main drawback --- inside it was something other than mutton. I do not know what was that, but definitely not mutton. So I won't go there anymore.

Firstly, the name of the shop is Kati and not kathi. A small outlet on the footpath when you enter Park street, you may skip the outlet but cant skip the people crowded near the shop and the aroma of fresh rolls being made.
Very popular and and hence you might just be late for the mutton rolls if visiting in the evening. Double egg, meat and everything one can desire for is here on offer.
Eat on the go or take it home, this place is just perfect for the roll loving people of this state for a quick grab.

most people labelled it as the best roll shop so i paid a visit but the rolls were not SO  good after all. abundance on onions and veggies in a chicken roll. The roll was tasty but not excellent.

It feels weird reviewing Hot Kati Roll. This is borderline legendary! Incredible kati rolls on Park Street. Options for both Vegetarians and non vegetarians. Caution: If you have a reservation about the touch of non veg food, you may want to stay away as they use the same "tawa" for everything. Tiny hole in the wall joint which is a must visit for all and sundry and visit the restaurant capital of Kolkata (Park Street). Also, do not think that you will have one roll and soon go to another restaurant for a meal. Its a meal by itself. Anyway, if you haven't been there already, hurry up and goo as soon as you can. Its a sin to not try it and you or any naysayers¬†will be struck down by the next "Bangla bandh"!

My ratings of 4.0 (0.5 extra for the nostalgia) 
Hot Kathi Rolls, situated near Asiatic Society,  Park Street, is a gastronomic landmark. I have my school days memory of the mid 1990s of this place. We used to visit this place quite often then. 
This place serves quick,  sumptuous and affordable Kathi rolls which is famously associated with Kolkata! That's the reason it is hot favourite amongst school students, college crowds, office goers and tourists alike. Even today,  one can have a heavy snack cum meal within 50-75 rupees. There are several varieties of both veg and non veg fillings to suit the individual taste buds. Just one thing that I like less about this place is that their rolls are quite oily. But on the contrary, less or zero oil rolls cannot be flaky and don't taste that good. So intake of extra calories can be compensated by work-outs! :)

This place is kind of over-hyped I feel. The rolls are priced about right, but the parathas are too oily for my liking. Also, the place is right on the footpath and always over crowded. I'd give it a miss if it were me, and rather walk 5 minutes down the street towards Kusum for a roll.

Location: A few meters from The Park Hotel.

HKR has been here for years and as the name suggests, has been serving mostly the office-goers and students with just about decent rolls on the go. Very near to the Park Street Metro Station, this place has a nice connectivity. Dropped by for a quick bite while returning back from work. It's pretty small with a vapid ambiance and no seating arrangements implying it to be of a Grab-n'-Go type.
The following was ordered from the range of rolls they had on offer:

- Paneer Roll
Well-marinated yet, slightly rubbery paneer cubes along with thinly sliced onion, ketchup, green Chilli sauce, dash of lime and salt n' pepper rolled in a flaky but, oily paratha.
Tasted just about average. The high oil content didn't quite suit my palate.

- Veg. Roll
Saut√©ed and spiced mashed potatoes with thinly sliced onion, ketchup, green chilli sauce, dash of lime and chopped coriander leaves rolled inside an oily and flaky paratha. Tasted decent. The oil content could be kept lower.

The service was quick and the staff was polite.
Prices were quite pocket friendly.

‚Ä¢ The hygiene levels could be improved.

Overall an average experience.

having been there in the core of Park Street crossing, this fast food joint is not hard to locate & one can get thin layered crispy parathas with variety of stuffing here. 
this is mainly a roll-center, where the hot rolls & the very quick service (despite high demand) are sure to impress - egg-chicken roll - soft & pleasing while egg-mutton roll - not so soft, but crispy & tasty & yes the kati kebab rolls - tended well-tasty but oily & very few pieces are put in (given to the price they take). rolls are large enough to be tummy full and one can drop in this place while strolling about the Park Street area in any evening.

Just opp the park street metro stations.
The best thing here is the roll.
The rolls r very tasty indeed but very very oily.
I used more than 5 to 6 tissue papers over the covering but yet my hands got filled wid the sipping oil. U will feel the taste of dalda nd too much oil more than the chicken pieces or Mutton kina in the rolls.
The kawabs here taste good but again oily

Hot Kathi Rolls is the Cheapest roll centre around the Park Street area. I did not have much chance to visit this joint because my classes in TIME are always on Sunday mornings. Luckily I visited Park Street on a weekday and had the chance to vist this shop. It was 2 pm and there were a crowd of customers in front of the shop. The shop is small and well maintained. There are stacks if dalda packets which are clearky visible from outside. I ordered one chicken roll. I could see the paratha frying in a sea of molten dalda, it l was a bliss for my eyes. I got the roll and the first bite took mevto heaven. The crispy paratha, the chicken inside, the onion, etc made the roll so yummy. I loved it. I am defintely going back again.

This place is featured within "Roll with it" section of zomato in kolkata.. but I am not that much satisfied with this place. I cant find it nothing extraordinary from any other local Roll shops in kolkata.
Food- I have tried egg roll and chicken roll here last weekend. You can see how the roll it being prepared. The counter where they were shaping tge dough was not hygienic. Now coming too food! Egg roll waa too much oily and they put too much chilli sauce in it thats why we can't finish the whole roll because it was too much sour in taste. Chicken roll was good. Chickens were big in size and was marinated well. I like the chicken roll. The size of the rolls are pretty big.
Price- In my opinion, prices are high in according to the quality. I know far better places which costs less than 40 for a chicken roll which equals tastes good too. I think as this is a crowded place so it is a little hipped!
Location- very close to Asiatic society. Always crowded.
So if hunger strucks you, then this place will beat your hunger but not among the best I woukd say!

The only roll shop which competes with the brilliant Kusum roll centre. My taste buds dance to the tunes of Hot Kati rolls and not Kusum, it is just about personal preference.Both make delectable rolls for a pocket friendly price. Fine in both quality and quantity. If you're near Park Street and not going to those fancy outlets with a wish to try something more traditional then do give it a roll at this Roll centre.¬†You won't be disappointed.

Undoubtedly the cheapest place to have mouth watering and hot rolls atleast in Park Street area! 
This place is hounded by students of nearby colleges, office goers as well as their ever loyal customers ( READ : me ) 
Their rolls are finger licking good! Perfectly deep fried crispy parathas filled with chunks of marinated spiced chicken with  generous amounts of freshly chopped onions and green chilli's this place is a MUST for all the roll lovers! Their double egg rolls are also any egg lover's delight, not exactly a "mutton" fan, it would be unfair to pass judgement upon their mutton rolls but I am sure they are nice too. Perfectly balanced spices, the flavours hits you instantly with your first bite leaving you wanting for more, I am obviously biased towards my chicken roll out here. I really feel less is more and hence I do not like too many things stuffed in my rolls for sure. Staff is ever efficient and works like super fast robots to serve hot and fresh rolls to each and everyone waiting in line, within a matter of few minutes! This place doesn't get chaotic, I haven't seen anyone right from the cashier to the person who delivers the rolls crack under pressure and behave rudely. This is definitely a delightful place for anyone who likes to grab a quick bite. Come here to experience comfort food and surprisingly you will find they are strangely non greasy!

Further is is one of the most economic decision while you are at Park street as even hearing about park street makes me hungry and droll. the chicken roll and the egg chicken rolls were just scrumptious! overall it does lack the glamour and glitz of a famous "park street" restaurant but it is great when you don't want to strip yourself of money yet enjoy great finger food !

Located very near to the Asiatic Society and opposite the Mobile Store, Hot Kathi Rolls is easy to locate. It is an old and famous roll centre at Park Street. It is basically a take away centre but the pace of the delivery is a bit slow but still better. I personally would not recommend having rolls standing there amidst the crowd and the kitchen heat; you can pack it.
    About the rolls, they taste nothing extraordinary... basically average. So I don't understand the hype. But at least it's hygienic.

D rolls available here r delicious n unique, especially d veg roll, egg chicken roll etc. A quick grab of a roll as you walk around park street, just near d park street crossing n Asiatic society,  wouldn't be so bad. Bt d rolls r highly spicy n very oily indeed.

I am simply in love with this joint. One of my friend explore this place with me when I was in college. You cant really pass this joint without having a roll and that's their speciality, even same thing happened with me. Simply awesuuuume taste but in the evening you might have to wait for a big bite, cos its too crowedyyy. Lastly it's very affordable and very yummy, those who don't like oily stuff'simply fogeet it. HUUUHHH.

It may be that the non-vegetarian rolls are good but the Veg Rolls don't even deserve a  try.!

This place needs no introduction. I still remember having rolls when i was in college. It is just a small counter where the rolls are served and you will hardly find anything else on the menu other than rolls.
The best thing about this place is that all the items are available and you can literally "customize" your order.

Would have rated this place 4.5, only if the waiting time was lesser.

A must try when you ate in or around Park Street. ????

It is truly one of the best roll shops of kolkata. Must try at least once.

Food: Quality is very good and quantity is just sufficient. They give a good number of options in their menu. The fillings are of very good quality. Other than rolls they have kebabs and parathas. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience: It isn't a restaurant but just a food counter. It is practically the first quality eatery you will come across after coming out of the Park Street Metro Station. You can get a roll from here and continue walking towards the Park Street area while feasting on this portable considerably filling and delicious grub. If you do not intend to visit any of the proper restaurants of this area and just want to casually roam around then this food joint will definitely be the right choice. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: They are extremely fast. You will hardly find a time when it's not high in demand. It always has a lot of customers clustered in front of it but that doesn't mean your food will take forever to arrive. However, during Christmas and New Year, expect an inhuman rush and do not rely solely on it for quenching your hunger. Behaviour of the staff is very good. I rate it 4/5.

Price: Very reasonable. Ranges from very cheap to very costly rolls depending on the type of roll. A double egg double mutton roll might cost you more than 100 bucks but that would alone be sufficient for lunch.

Overall i give it 4/5.

A regular customer of this roll corner for past 5 to 6 years and yet not found any other alternative of this fast food centre. Located very near to the junction of the Park Street crossing serves mouth watering rolls. 
The kebabs and the paratha of the rolls were very soft to chew and are perfectly cooked.
Being a regular customer I can comment that they are deteriorating their reputation by using low quality oils nowadays. And another suggestion... They could provide small seats or chairs in front of their outlet for people to sit and eat.

But this year I am totally disappointed at the rolls that a I have had there. The rolls were too oily and not well cooked, the reason still a mystery. The outlet that used to have such high standards, it's a disappointment to see that much degradation of quality.

To be very honest I LOVE Rolls. Kolkata is famous for kathi rolls. Friends of mine staying outside the city agree that Kolkata is the ultimate destination for rolls. Rolls are meant to be oily and greasy. You can‚Äôt expect them to be high on nutrition. I guess real foodies do away with the nutrition content of any food; they just devour any tasty food they get. This particular place serves good rolls but nothing extraordinary. The prices are bit on the higher side. Nonetheless, they make the rolls soft and don‚Äôt put the unwanted ‚Äòtomato‚Äô sauce. Thus, when you are low on budget I suggest this is a place to be.

This place is getting famous for Rolls,nothing too special but since it is one of the few Roll shops In Park Street, everyone goes crazy over this place, but this is my honest review

--Location--
This place is located just at the entrance of Park Street

--Ambience--
No place to din in, so to enjoy ur food gaze at the streets

--Quality--
As i said nothing to fancy, but as this is one of the few roll shops in Park Street people goes crazy.

--Quality--
Should be less oily

--Pricing--
Except for traditional egg roll, chicken roll, egg chicken roll, all the other items on the list are priced a bit higher

So in conclusion a simple roll shop, nothing fancy, a bit oily
If you have never been to this place dont worry i am sure if u are from Kolkata you had better Rolls..

This place is by default linked with the flavor and nostalgia of the old Park Street. If Park Street reminds you of Flury's, Trincas, Magnolia and Oxford Bookstore, you will understand how significant this place is. Whenever I visit Park Street with my friends, no matter how full we are, a visit to this place is a must. This is a tradition that has been going on for the last 10-15 years.
This place remains crowded and the people behind the counters often miss what you have ordered so stand there and poke them from time to time. The rolls are oily, but they do taste good. Sometimes great, but not heavenly. Not recommended for health freaks and salad eaters. There is a Baskin Robbins outlet near the Asiatic Society corner. Have you ever tried vanilla ice cream after rolls? Go on and thank me later!

I should confess. I am not a roll-eating person. I don't like oily, deep fried, heavy food and it has been ages I have tried a roll on the streets of Kolkata, except for one place in Gariahat, where they make rolls real light. But it was with a lot of friends and we ended up having rolls at this place on Park St.

My expectation was low, but the experience was worse. I had a mutton roll. The paratha outside was dripping with oil, the paper around it was wet with oil. The mutton inside was rubbery, it was low in seasoning and the worst part was the mutton had a bitter lemony taste. The problem with roll is, you can't do anything about it. You can't open the half eaten roll and add salt to it. I asked for a green chilli to cover the taste of lemon, but they didn't have a whole chilli and gave me chilli slices on a paper. It was supposed to be an evening snack, but it was so heavy that I had to skip dinner.

It was a terrible experience, having food that is so high on calorie, no food value whatsoever, which tasted so bad.

Currently it is one of the traditional roll corners in Kolkata, just at the starting of park street. i have tried all the non-veg rolls here. rolls are quite fine, but nothing extraordinary. I liked the mutton rolls most. the biggest con is they give too much oil in the rolls. also regarding crowd control they are not that level of efficient in it. so i think now a days crowd gather here just to continue the tradition...

Too much oil is what puts me off. Did till the chef to go easy on the oil but he refused to listen. 

It's a value for money deal with most of the rolls. Try the mutton roll.

Situated in a prime location like park street, if u nearby  and hungry  n looking for a quick bite this is the ideal place to make your stomach happy.  Every time you pass by you will find huge crowds in front of this place. 
        I have tried their chicken roll which i find really good. I went there with two of my friends and every one was really pleased. The service is fast and serve you according to your demand of chilly,sauces or lemon. The price is 5-10rs extra compared to other roll joints in Kolkata but in a place like Park Street this 5-10rs is not a big deal. Would love to come soon :)

This roll outlet is located close to park street metro, just beside closed peep inn restaurant. I had been regular to this place for years and I had never faced any problem with their chicken rolls. Their egg chicken roll & mutton egg rolls are my favourites. While they maintain a very good flavour but, I feel nowadays their rolls were slightly soggy and chewy also too oily. Nothing so special about the taste but quality of chicken / mutton they use was really good! They well marinate the chicken / mutton in spices and I am against mixing sauces with their rolls, as it spoils the real taste, lemon and pepper will be enough to maintain the awesome flavour. A must try if you love eating rolls.

situated at the prime location of such a area, park street 'hot kathi rolls' is the perfect place to have rolls when one is in park street and in a hurry ofcourse!!  :D  its a small eatery that only serves rolls. my all time favourite is chicken roll, the paratha they make for the roll is very tender, and the sheek chicken kabab is juicy and spicy. the smell is always great. have tried there mutton roll too which is again too good. while coming back from college and taking this park street route towards metro we always ended up in buying rolls from here and munching till we reach the metro station!  :P  someday even, being hungry, we used to take this path only to have rolls from this place!
if you still haven't tasted rolls from 'hot kathi' and like to have rolls, then try this roll centre once.

However after reading their reviews especially Poorna's , Rahul's and Samit's I decided I had to try it. I ordered up a Single Egg Single Chicken Roll and my mouth was watering while I waited because I loved the delicious smell. That is what draws people in I guess I am guilty of driving past so I missed out earlier :-( . Anyways the roll was very nice , served hot and like Rahul I am not fond of ketchup with my roll so had it without. The kebabs were soft and the paratha was just right. I will go back for more ..... want to try the Mutton Roll next :-P

What really sets this place(one of the many places which makes rolls) is the smell that wafts by every time one happens to pass by. Very strategically situated close to the Park Street - JL Nehru Rd crossing, in the Asiatic Society building.

Their rolls are usually pretty good, especially the chicken rolls. They have the usual variety of single / double chicken / mutton, with egg / double egg etc etc etc, with some vegetarian options and some kababs thrown in for good measure. What I like about them is that the parathas are not very thick, and thankfully not the lachha kinds.

Today, for some reason the usual smell was missing. The roll that was served,while not bad, did not taste like the usual ones. Not sure why. The chicken looked slightly different from what it normally does. Perhaps a change of shift or change of cooks?

Well worth a try, even though the prices have risen (from Rs 25 to Rs 35 for a chicken roll) in a very short time.

Hot Kathi Roll is something I literally spent three years of college eating from. On a recent visit, we decided to check this place out, and found out that it was the same - a huge crowd in front, but still each roll request was taken with utmost sincerity and delivered exactly as one wished it to be. We took our usual - chicken roll, mutton egg roll, and both of them came exactly as we wished for - in my case, with extra chillies and more lemon. It was hot, flaky paratha encasing soft bits of chicken in it. Perfect!

You're in the Park Street area and you don't want to burn a hole in your pocket. But you don't want to be seen as cheap, eating at a common roadside eatery. Then this place is the answer to all your problems. Head over to this tiny closet of a shop, a few houses from the Asiatic Society near the mouth of Park Street. Not only do they serve a variety of delicious rolls at average prices, but their Katthi roll is also among one of the few remaining culinary legends of Park Street. Over the decades, quality has gone on a steady decline but overall they still serve quality food. The Double Egg Chicken Roll is famed for its size as much as the Chicken Roll is known for its taste. 

The Katthi roll itself, is actually kabab chunks placed in a roll, the name being derived from the brown sticks or "Katthi"s the roasted kababs are hung in. The kababs have acquired such a name probably because they are juicy and succulent beyond belief. The mix of spices they use in the battering paste is a store secret, which unfolds only once it enters the mouth where it kicks up a veritable burst of flavour. I may sound over ecstactic but i swear that the item deserves such adulation.

There is bound to be a bit of waiting since there's always a crowd about. The unavailability of seats are a massive bummer. Also irritating is the constant jostling which takes place as the crowd surges on the pavement coming in collision with pedestrians. 

Chakraborty Tip : Beware of other establishments of the same name around that and other areas in town.

Their rolls are divine in taste. Try their double chicken single egg roll. You'll be spellbound with the taste of juicy morsels of spicy chicken which are wrapped in crispy layered paratha that's been coated with egg. I usually ask them to serve it without sauce. The extra bit of nimbu-squeeze and pepper just do the trick of adding tangy flavour to it. The kabab they serve has nice aroma, and the pieces of chicken they use in preparing kathi rolls are the same pieces they use in making kababs. They well marinate the chicken chunks in spices and cook these on good skewers. Eat their rolls during day-time if you want to avoid  standing in long queue, which is of course an unwanted mood-spoiler. Considering the standard of street food joints in Calcutta, my rating for this spot would be 3.5 out of 5.

hot kathi roll shop is my 2nd favourite roll corner in town,the 1st being iceberg at golpark.
inspite of the crowd in the evenings,i dont mind waiting for 10-15 mins. the chicken rolls at about rs 30 are simply amazing and filling.the number of chunks of chicken are soft and succlucent and well marinated with the mustard sauce.the paratha is crisp,but a bit oily. the joint often serves for a pocket friendly quick bite ,whenever i loytar around park street on my way back college.

I do not know how to rate this place. This was my second favourite roll corner, and their rolls were properly done with right amounts of everything. But the last time I tried it, the paratha was too oily and the chicken pieces were " contaminated " with unwanted ingredients. It did not feel good. But still, since out of all the times I have visited Hot Kathi Roll, most of the times I was really happy with their rolls, I give them a 4/5.

To cut a long story short, rolls in any form in Park Street = Hot Kathi Rolls. Period.

Chicken Egg Roll and Mutton Egg Roll were two of my favorites back in college days. I used to be a SPE (Some Place Else) regular and the rolls from Hot Kathi Rolls were the patent snack prior to getting in the pub. Rolls are soft,  succulent and the chicken/mutton pieces are so well prepared that they literally melt in your mouth. Ah!, the mere thought is giving me goosebumps sitting far away in Delhi. For the sauce fanatics, I would advice against mixing sauces with their rolls, as it kills the amazing taste. (Don't get me wrong here, am a sauce fanatic as well. So, there.) . Go out and grab a roll from there, I bet you won't be disappointed.

This roll outlet is located at the mouth of park street,the hub of foodies in Kolkata.This place is crowded almost at all times of the day,which is testimony to the fact that they serve good rolls.Apart from the quality,the quantity is also very good.The persons preparing the rolls try their best to customise your roll as much as possible in spite of the fact that it is always crowded.One has to wait about 10mins to get the food almost any time you visit.Like many other places,the prices have gone up of late.But for me if you are looking for a snack around park street this place is worth it.

this is definitely one of the best roll servers at park street and i m very much fond of their rolls. the quantity is good as you will find dices of chicken in your chicken roll. the good part is that they ask for and you can direct them to add sauce or extra nimbu or mirchi etc. the bad part is that always you have to stand in queue for 10-15 minutes to get a roll. my fav is egg roll ,double chicken roll and paneer roll.  suitably located on the road near the metro station of park street and it has made its own name in the world of kolkata street food and rolls.

Hot Kathi Rolls is a small roll corner located in Park Street, just on the opposite footpath of the metro station gate. If you are a by-passer you will really know how much goodwill the place has. The place is ever crowded during the afternoon period, just because people on a hungry afternoon would like to have some best and hygienic rolls in Park Street.

The rolls they make are big and quantity of the fillings inside is good considering the price. Chicken rolls have good amount of Chicken in it and Veg Rolls are also good looking at the quantity of veggies inside. Drawbacks, if any would be that they should make other small things such as Chicken Pakoda, Fried Chicken etc. which people can carry with them. Also they should keep some soft drinks with them so that customers can have something cold after a hot roll.

Talking of my experience, I used to have their rolls since I would by-pass this place while returning from my school during the days I did not use the bus service. I along with a my classmates would purchase rolls from here but would hardly stand and eat there because of the crowd. We either would cross the road, enter the metro station and finish our roll on the platform itself (I have never been stopped from entering the platform with rolls) or would take the roll home which would obviously make them cold to some extent. Not that I am in college I rarely get an opportunity to visit Park Street St. I really miss their rolls.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that Calcutta is divided into two halves - one that feels that Hot Kathi Rolls is better than Kusum Snacks Bar, while the other feels the opposite. Located almost at the mouth of Park Street, Hot Kathi Rolls is mobbed by people every day at all hours. The rolls it makes are decent, though, like most other food joints, they have been forced to raise prices and reduce quantities somewhat.

The crowds also make customization a problem, which takes away half the charm of eating a roll in Calcutta. It is rare that one gets to specify that a roll should not have sauce in it, or that an extra squeeze of lemon juice should be added. To be fair to the servers, though, they do follow your instructions as far as possible. The quality of the rolls and the great location make it a good place to stop by for a snack.
