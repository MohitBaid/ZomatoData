Originally known as Shondha to the locals, this sweet shop has been my go to place for certain family gatherings for years now. I particularly liked their nolen gurer kachagolla and roshomalai, ordered during my niece's naming ceremony. The nolen gurer roshogolla is also quite nice during the winter months. I will surely go back to this place for more.

Not a very good range of sweets available here, and also most of the sweets available are Sandesh(dry sweets). The cold drinks are not very cold. The quality of the sweets have declined exponentially over the years, me being a resident of this place. There are similar other sweet shops around that provide much better and fresh sweets in comparision. Not a very good choice, and not at all worth wasting money on their sweets(prices are exhorbitant)
