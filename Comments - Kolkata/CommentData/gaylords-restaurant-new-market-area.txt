So, I entered this hotel because it was close to the museum that I wanted to visit. I went in hoping for a quick lunch before exploring the museum. 

The looks and environment were exactly not what you'd expect in a normal dine out restaurant. The seating were mainly arranged for 4 or more guests per table. It was quiet with no background music or any sort of entertainment. The staff were friendly and polite although they lacked the professional standards of a well established restaurant. 
I had ordered an onion steak which didn't take much time but then there were slight adjustments that were called for in terms of its preparation. They forgot to ask me how I would like my steak cooked and therefore they served me a well done steak instead of a medium rare doneness as I would have preferred. The fries on the sides were good, the mixed vegetables however, had thier broccoli over sautéed which caused it to lose its color and crunch and resulted in a greasy and soggy mess. The sauce of the steak was too salty for my liking but the presentation of the whole dish wasn't too bad. It was adequate. Anyway, if any of you ever go and visit this place my suggestions are : It's not a place for a romantic dine out nor is it suitable for celebrating an eventful occasion. It's just another hotel cum restaurant where the restaurant just exists as a requirement for the hotel.

The food was good- tasty and ample. Very Few vegan options available.
The atmosphere was nice and relaxing, but not the romantic kind.
The service wasn't prompt and the staff appeared to be almost racist.

Gaylords ( quite a queer name though ) mainly serves Indian and continental food. We got to enjoy our lunch. It is a small place with relaxed ambience .
We started with ' cream of chicken ' soup and found it average, but had good stuffing.
Chicken Tikka kebab, they served 8 pieces which is good, was served fresh , succulent and tangy. It was just fantastic.
For main course , we had chicken butter masala , veg polao, masala kulcha and green salad.
Chicken butter masala was good, veg polao had a lot of veggies in it and was fantastic. Masala kulcha was above average.
At last, we had tutifrooti as dessert , which was enjoyable.
Service is bit slow but staffs were well behaved.
A reasonable place for satisfying your appetite.

We had a veg sizzler, (through a groupon voucher), which was average. The service timing appeared a bit long. The veg au gratin, was a little underdone, and the upper cheese layer was not very crusty.

The place hasn't changed itself much..so it quite catches my minds to find that old calcutta charm which I'm so fond of. Quite a relaxed atmosphere with slow service;one sit and chat with no one to disturb.

The a-la-carte isn't much extenive,but has quality stuff.It was the place where I always liked the Veg Biriyani and still do so.@

Away from the huss and buzz of park street a very calm and quite place to hang out with friends in sudder street. Food is good but takes too much time. Alcohol is reasonably priced though situated near park street and new market area. 15% discount was given on alcohol. Went with a friend in the evening and it was more or less empty. Service is ok. Ambience is decent. One can visit there with his date. Has vallet parking since its a hotel. Dynasty the Chinese resto in the 1st floor opens at 7 p.m but they serve u Chinese in Gaylords before that time. Would definitely visit once more to try their indian and conti menu. Next time I will upload the pictures too.

Gaylords restaurant is located on Sudder Street and serves mainly Indian and Continental food. Today we went there to enjoy our lunch. At a glance its feel like a quaint, small place but the ambiance is fairly relaxed. We started off with ‘Cream of Chicken’ soup and found it average, nothing extraordinary but good stuffing. Then we ordered ‘Chicken Tikka Kebab’ as starter. It served hot and chicken pieces they used were fresh. I was bit surprised to see eight pieces in a plate, normally all restaurant’s serves six pieces. Chicken Tikka Kebab was marinated in the right amount of spices before they are cooked. Soft-juicy chicken pieces were just melting in our mouth, just fantastic. I was planning to try another one but my friend reminds me that we have to go back to the office. We also noticed that service was bit slow, though the server was extremely polite. 

For main course we like to have pretty simple menu ‘Chicken Butter Masala’, ‘Veg Pulao’, ‘Masala Kulcha’ and ‘Green Salad’. Chicken Butter Masala had the flavour but it’s not perfect. Its taste ok but I have tasted better in many places. Veg pulao was quite interesting; we found it really had lots of vegetables in it. Masala Kulcha also tastes just above average. As we were in a hurry to come back office, we could not experiment much with dessert section. We had plain and simple ‘Pista’ ice cream. To me it’s an average low cost lunch.
