When you expand your restaurant you should make sure the service and food also expands in terms of quality and taste. But oh lord ACS is not what it was. The food is tasteless and the service is horrible. I strongly DO NOT recommend this restaurant to any living human on this planet!

It is just near to Loreto day school, Elliot road so it is not a restaurant. Though they have provided us with their seating arrangements but still we couldn't find that exact and proper ambiance which other restaurants have. But overall food was extremely delicious! We had our best Indochinese dishes here till yet! Quantity was quite sufficient and they all worth the budget. And if u want to enjoy ur food at your home then u can easily avail there takeaway facilities.

Have tried some of their dishes via Home delivery only and trust a foodie like me, they were brilliant... The packaging, the quantity for the price they charge is unbelievable... They make brilliant Drums of Heaven and Gravy Noodles... But the other dishes are not far behind... I have already tried their Mixed Rice, Ginger Capsicum Rice, Hong Kong Chicken, Crispy Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken Schezwan Fish and Manchurian Chicken and each of the dishes were pretty fulfilling... They tend to keep things a bit spicy so in case you don't prefer spicy food, make sure you let them know... Would definitely like to try some of the other dishes in the menu...

This has been an old favourite due to it's delicious Chinese. Love their chicken hot & sour soup. Mxed fried rice and all chicken side dishes are worth trying. The price is cheap and they also deliver to your home.

It's a small food joint. There are seating arrangements made. If you have a look at the place, it won't seem like a very hygienic place, but that's what a street side food joint is like. 
Some of their food items are good, whereas some are very disappointing. One should try their dry chilli chicken and crispy chili baby corn though.

I had to order from here one night, during the rush hour at SWIGGY, as I had no other preferable options left!!
I didnt take the risk of experimenting!! Oedered one monchow soup n steamed chicken momo!!
Both the items tasted below average.
The momo was not hot, lacked softness!! The soup also tasted weird!!
The only good thing about this place z the pocket pinch!!
But it ll better to go for street foods, rather choosing this one!!
9:6:17- One of my friends ordered veg wanton, American chopsuy n pan fried fish. I liked them except the wanton. We just couldnt eat it. One thing is clear they r terrible in making Tibetan dishes. U can try the Chinese dishes. What ever may be, I m increasing the rating from 2 to 3 for the Chinese items they delivered today.. üòÅ

ACS happened to be our only option to quick and inexpensive food in our school days. 
The taste and quality of the food is not soaring high but just moderate. They will make it right in front of you. Its a simple street food joint. 
What I loved about ACS was their momos. They were delicious and filling. 
You can have a full stomach for two in just 200 rupees.

This mainly thrives on home delivery from the nearby flats and the absence of nearby Chinese restaurants. The proximity to loreto school helps its business as well. The place is a street side shed but the food is surprisingly tasty and cheap. A good, filling meal can be had within Rs. 100.

"ACS Chinese Flavour", happens to be a street side stall on Elliot Road, which is pretty known in the locality for its fast food options.

Thought nothing very impressive, the food being pretty run of the mill like any ordinary street side stall, but as it is prepared hot & fresh right in front, so can be considered as an option to grab a bite, or to get some stuff packed, during sudden hunger pangs. 

Behaviour of the staffs are a bit turn down again, and waiting time too is pretty long.
A just okay/average place overall

Earlier when I used to go to ACS, the quality of the food was great. Though they used to take too much of time to prepare a small amount of food but still the quality of the food was great. But as the time is passing by the quality of the food is degrading day by day. But if you want to have fun with your friends and it doesn't matter for you guys to a quality food then you guys can opt this outlet. 

Its pocket friendly so if there is nothing to eat at your house then hop in to ACS.

Avoid their prawn dishes,its not good at all. I liked their Crispy Chilly Baby Corn.

ACS Chinese Flavour is more of a take away or home delivery joint than a sit and dine one. The food was good but of late it has deteriorated. The prices, although still low compared to other places, have risen considerably. The rise in prices would not have been such a bad thing had the quality remained constant. Thankfully though the only good thing about the joint has remained what it was. Crispy chicken honey. Shredded chicken stir fried to a crisp in an arrowroot batter. It starts off on the sweeter side but ends with a hot abd spicy flavour. This is the only thing worth having here. The rest are all average or below average.

ACS is a street side food stall, right beside the garbage. They do maintain their hygiene standards and are always busy at peak hours. Yes the prawns are not deveined and are of inferior quality, but  their chicken dishes are good. I specifically mention not to add  ajinamoto and they oblige. Must try the crispy chili chicken.

ACS chinese certainly does not burn a hole in your pocket, but the food use to be very good but recently it has degraded quiet considerably for what reasons best know. However these days i recoommend my friends and family members to stay away from ACS food why??? well most of the dish items have achinomoto ( slow poison) that make you addicted to their chinese, and achinomoto is bad for health. 

One must be careful in regards while ordering prawn dishes such as mixed chowmein or prawn chowmein or mixed fried rice or prawn fried rice because prawns if not cleaned properly in the sense all prawns have a black line round its side, these need to be removed, should the black line be found should be immediately removed. I am personally informing the other foodies this because that black line can cause a gastronomical disorder such as food poisioning, i have been a victum consuming their mixed chowmein once it really put me at bay!

Happens to be a very old place with chairs and tables set outdoors! Therefore do not visit this place for its ambiance! Their regular so called Chinese dishes are good enough! And since the prices are pretty low you cannot really complain!
 Try fried rice and noodles and normal chicken side orders to stay safe! I happen to like their Honey Chicken Dry!  Pack the food and take it home, it will save you the tedious job of sitting in the Kolkata heat! 
Voila`! You will have a Happy stomach and a Happy pocket! :)

The menu seems to be outdated. There is no Mughlai or Bengali dishes available. We have food from here quite regularly. There is only chinese dishes available. 2 years back the fried rice and chowmein both used to be quite good. Now-a-days the quality has drastically gone southwards.

The crispy chilly baby corn is pretty good. Stick to mixed/chicken fried rice with chilly/manchurian chicken here. For the price the place is OK.
