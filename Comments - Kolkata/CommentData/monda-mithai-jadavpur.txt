Located nearby Jadavpur Coffee House, had dropped in once while I was around. Nothing to boast about. Tried their Rosogolla and Laddoo. The quality was quite average and the taste wasn't anywhere excellent. Just a passing-by option if you happen to crave some sweets.

A very average place..i did like their radha ballavis at a point of time but then the quality of the sabji declined..i somehow did like their gurer roshogolla...and chitrakut to some extent
