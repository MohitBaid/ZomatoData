One of the most underrated continental places in Kolkata. Situated close to the much celebrated Peter Cat, One Step Up has less grandeur about it but is cheaper and the food is absolutely yum. For someone looking to have great food, this place has a lot of varieties to pick from.

After hearing a lot good things and positive responses,  we made our mind to visit one day. The place is best for the authentic continental cuisine. We ordered mango dreams,  Green goose,  Deviled crab which is a crab shell filled with full of cheese and mushroom and non veg kebab platter.  Food was yummm,  service was prompt and fast.

Horrible service. I have ordered for lamb lasagne.  It came without buns. Then ordered for buns which came after 15 mins. They took the lasagne back and brought back the  lasagne which looked was probably tasted.

I have gone there many times, and I mostly prefer their Chef's Special Chicken. It's a cheese stuffed chicken breast which is then wrapped in bacon, need i say more? It's just pure heaven. I have had their lamb lasagna once, and that was delicious. The ambience of this place is quite elegant and simple. Service is very good too. I would go there again and again.

It has become my favourite for Continental cuisine. The ambience is soothing and the food is great.  I am  in love with their use of cheese and flavour of different items. I tasted :
Devilled Crab - served in the shell itself this one tasted fine. 
Chicken Sicilliene - this is their speciality. It is extremely creamy and mouthwatering along with some boiled vegetables. 
Chicken Tetrazzini - it has the same chicken and cheese combination but here the chicken is shredded and it also has spaghetti in it. 
Chicken steak - decent in taste. 
The staff is attentive and poliete. Overall, I really liked this place. Shall visit often.

A place to try out authentic continental dishes. During the Christmas time last year we paid a viait to this outlet in Park Street. Firstly the ambience was good with a decorations of lights all around. Coming to the food, we tried Calamari(squid) for starters and in main course opted for Chef's special lamb, Chicken Ala kiev, chef's special chicken. All the dishes were pretty good and sufficient for one dish per head.

One of those places where the food is good,the booze is cheaper,the service is great and the queue is usually short. This is a place I usually go for a good time with friends without getting too much of a headache. I like the chicken warm salad and their Chef's Special Lamb. Their Moroccan chicken is a good dish as well. Their tandoori items are basic,nothing great but not bad either.

Located quite strategically adjacent to Flurys One Step Up is a wonderful place to visit if u love Continental dishes.We tried the Lamb Lasagne Lamb Bolognese Chicken Facon du Chef and Grilled Fish.All the dishes were marvellous.The Lamb Lasagne is stuffed in a generous helping of Cheese and is quite filling.Chicken Facon du Chef is an unique dish where the  Chicken is stuffed with Cheese and served in a  sauce full of Cheese Mushrooms and Spinach.....a must for Cheese lovers.The service is decent. Prices are quite reasonable.Ambience is nice.

We ordered Peas Pulao, Veg Pulao, Paneer Butter Masala, Mutton Saag and Bacardi. The bill was around 1500.

Ambience, food and service truly deserve a big thumbs up! We ordered cream chicken soup, Mexican chilli baby corn, Herby chicken fingers, chef's special chicken and chef's special lamb served with herb rice.    All dishes were lip smacking but I loved the chef's special chicken which was wrapped in bacon with a cheese filling served with veggies and mashed potatoes. Mexican chilli baby corn was very tasty and came in a pretty decent quantity. I absolutely did not like the Margarita I had as the mixing of the cocktail wasn't good enough. Nevertheless will keep going back to this place for the food they serve üëç.

Located in the heart of the central city of Kolkata.
Been there quite a few times. Each time pleased with their service and continental delicacies. Staffs and managers are courteous and service is prompt.
No lavish decor. The restaurant has two tiers and the upper tier gives a good view. Moderately priced.

FOOD-
Caesar Salad non veg- My all time favourite here.
Iceberg lettuce served with good potion of chicken, bacon and garlic bread croutons.

Chef's Special Chicken- Chicken breast wrapped in grilled bacon comes with tangy gherkin sauce, mash and veggies. This didn't aww me much though.

Chicken a la kiev- Just love there a la kiev. 
A must try. Appropriately done with butter loaded inside. Served on mashed potato bed with steamed veggies.

Continental at One Step Up, Park Street.
For Starters ordered Chicken Quesidella, Fish & French fries, a pint of beer(We ordered Carlsberg) goes along great with it!
For the main course ordered Chef's Special, Chicken Corden Blue, Tropicana & Tetrazinni. Although the ambience is not too great in here but the food is really excellent and priced accordingly, quite budget friendly to be honest. This one's a must try out restaurant at Park Street and definitely a thumbs up from me.

We ordered spaghetti aglio olio, mamma rossa (the pasta was not properly cooked and even the sauce was below average), murg malai kabab (highly recommended), chicken lasagne and cold coffee.

A nice restaurant having a bar on the ground floor. The place is quite cozy with beautiful lighting. The staff was very affable. The service was great as well. The menu was huge from which we had ordered a prawn cocktail which tasted average. The red sauce on top tasted much like ketchup. It had shredded lettuce at the bottom, but the prawns were nice but lacked a bit of flavor. The next dish we ordered was a grilled fish with lemon butter sauce. It was served with mashed potato and veggies. The fish was cooked to perfection and all together it tasted good. Overall, it is worth going for a lunch. I wouldn't mind going there again to try something esle! Happy eating!

One Step Up is located in Park Street. It's a dimly lit place and moderately decorated but pretty comfortable. We had ordered a soup, Herby chicken fingers, both of which were pretty good. For the main course we ordered Chicken stroganoff, Fish Florentine, chicken burger, chicken tikka and cheese naan out if which I personally had the chicken stroganoff. However, each of the dishes were pretty good and I particularly liked the Fish Florentine a lot. 
The place is probably a little heavy on the pocket but as far as its location is concerned, it is good enough.

The Ambience was just superb. Dim light and soothing music make this place awesome for dinning. Coming on the food, we order Spaghetti Carbonara that contains bacon,ham too. It was lip smacking and we ordered chicken quesadillas , though they served it after the main course. Quesadillas proved to be the champ. Overall experience is too good. Thumb's up!!

Yesterday we went there for brunch. They provide decent, good conti food but nothing out of the box. We ordered crumb fried prawn in starter which tasted like baked prawn. In main course we ordered grilled fish with garlic butter sauce. The garlic butter lacked right proportion of all flavours and grilled veggies where a bit mushy. For dessert they don't had much options and so we took caramel custard. A suggestion that apart from all icecream related desserts, they should add more options to satisfy sweet tooth of dessert lovers. In cocktail we had Long Island Iced Tea and Bailey's Irish Cream.

Nice nice place. Comfortable ambience, courteous staff, good place to have small lunch while being busy. Being a xavierian, you gotta know all the eating places near you, then this is definitely in the list. With pocket pinch just right, to have good food (real food not fast food).
This was the second time I visited, first time we went for aglio olio, chicken platter and a sunday. All of them- Delicious. 
This time we ordered chicken shashlik, thai red curry, brownie with icecream and chocolate souffle.
Chicken shashlik is üëç. Just go for it!!!
Thai red curry üö´ do not try, if you dont like coconut milk taste and like more spicy food. Not to my preference!!
Brownie, warm, yum with icecream but chocolate sauce was less!? No scarce. Still tasty.
Souffle üëå.

** Location = Park Street, very conveniently located.

**Brief = Recently paid a visit to this place with a Learned Friend after participating in a football tournament at the Parsee Club.

** Ambiance = The place had a pleasant decor with courteous servers. The ambiance is very peaceful and cosy.

** Things tried = We were hungry and straightaway ordered for Devilled Crab, Chello Kebab and Veg Au gratin!

The devilled crab was the star of the day, it was just perfectly presented and tasted just too good. The creamy delight with the chunks of crab meat is definitely worth a while. Their Chello Kebab was the usual one. My Learned friend tried the Vegetable Au Gratin and his response was all good, since I did not try that, hence it will not be fair to comment on that.¬†

** Purse Check = Our bill was around Rs.1200/- and would suggest that Rs.1000-1200/- would be good enough for 2 people.

**Overall = One step up was indeed a step up with their dishes and warm behavior with the customers, definitely recommended. Cheers!

I had gone to this place as a kid, and had absolutely loved it. So when I heard it has been renovated, I naturally wanted to visit again.

The ambience is classy and elegant, as expected from the old Park Street restaurants.

Service was a bit on the slower side, but the waiters were very courteous and helpful.

The star of the show was naturally the food. The place serves continental as well as Indian, and we went for the continental menu. We were a group of three pretty big eaters, and the first thing we noticed were the generous proportions. We had ordered the Warm Chicken Salad to start with, which was reasonably good. For the mains, we ordered a Lamb Lasagna, a Chicken Tropicana and the Chef's Special Lamb. Each of the dishes were delicious, and the lasagna was probably the best I've had in this price range. My personal favourite was the chef's special lamb, to describe which words don't suffice.

All in all, excellent food in quite generous proportions for relatively low prices. Will definitely visit again.

Had gone there on a quiet week day dinner. This place has my fondest memories ever since a child, the food we ordered were Crumb Fried Prawn this had a slightly sweet flavour, it was served with tartar sauce. Next was Mutton Seekh Kebab which was juicy and succulent. For main course we'd ordered a portion of Chicken Steak, a portion of Chicken Tetrazinni and Garlic Bread on the side. The steak was fine nothing extraordinary but the White sauce base of the Tetrazinni was extremely runny and watery. You've got a reputation for your continental fare, but right now if you don't step up your game people can find a whole lot of alternatives.

Devil's crab,chicken augratin,chef's special chicken,seafood chawdor soup,warm chicken salad,fish diana,fish n chips are some of the food items I can manage to remember. Out of all devils crab n fish n chips are worth a special mention. Chef's special chicken was my first experiment with beacon n I would never taste it again. I cant stand the smell,now I cant say if it was not well cooked or i couldnt stand the smell. The ground floor is good,while the top floor requires a warm interior n creativity.

This restaurant is conveniently located on the opposite side of Olypub and the Park. We had a little difficulty finding it because they were redoing their shop banner. Anyway, this place had plenty of seating arrangements and it even has seats upstairs, with a pleasant view of park street. We went in and secured our seats on the ground floor. After we received the menu, we were hunting for fried rice courses only to find that they don't serve their rice separately, unless its plain rice or herbed rice. The rice is served with some of the main courses of veg or non veg. Some courses contain spaghetti, some contain rice. So we ordered one chicken stroganoff and one chicken mexicana. The first course contained rice while the latter had spaghetti. Service was pretty fast and after receiving our dishes, we were shocked. Cause we didn't account for the fact that one dish would be enough for two. Still, we dug into our food. Both the stroganoff and the mexicana spaghetti were good. I'd prefer the chicken mexicana over the stroganoff though. Anyway, we tried and couldn't finish the stroganoff. Not to worry, you can pack the leftovers if you want to. I'd say its a good restaurant if you're looking for a good place to have a quick lunch without paying a big price. I'll visit it again soon and try out their burgers and pizzas.

Located near park Street flurys. Easy to find restaurant. A great place for continental meal.
I love the classy well decorated Interior. The ambiance was really soothing with the background music.
Now comes to the main part.
We ordered the chicken paprika and the chef's special lamb. Both dishes are really delicious. Lamb was very tender and well seasoned.. with the combination of veggies and the well prepared rice both the dishes were very much mouth watering.
Stuff behaviour was very gentle and courteous. There was always someone to answer all your queries..
I am going to visit this restaurant in near future and I am quite sure that it will take a place in my favourite restaurant list.
A must visit restaurant for those who like continental food...

First thing that I need to mention is..they follow a very weird fashion of booking. They don't list the names one after another, they will just remember you and will call you in that order.. which in turn caused lots of chaos in the restaurant. Scope of improvement.
We waited for one and a half hour to get a table.
Food in this place is quite good, and sufficient.
Though some of the Prawns‚Äã were little stinky.
Altogether the experience was satisfactory.

Visited this place on saptami night. It is situated bang opposite of the oasis restaurant. Got our table after waiting for 15 minutes. Overall ambience was pretty good. The staff was nice and service was prompt, even though the place was packed.
Coming to the food and drinks.
We had 2 cocktails a screwdriver and a virgin mohito.
The screwdriver was ok not the best. The virgin mohito was nice and refreshing. It was perfectly balanced and not too sweet.
Coming to the food, we ordered deviled crab, lamb lasagna and chicken tetrazzini.
I was most disappointed with the deviled crabs. They served 2 crabs, which was well decorated and served with mashed potatoes. But there was very little crab meat in the dish. Taste wise it was okish
The lamb lasagna was the star dish and it won our hearts. It had ample amounts of minced lamb and had the perfect balance of cheese and sauce. The quantity was enough to satisfy 2 hungry souls.
Finally the tetrazzini. It was also a perfectly cooked dish. Loads of shredded chicken with cheese. My friends loved this dish, but I personally felt the dish had a bit too much cheese. Overall a very nice place to spend a quality evening with your friends and also have some hearty continental dishes.

Searching for a place in Park Street to eat at a reasonable price is quite a challenge! Finally Zomato came to the rescue!

Being our first time here, the waiter happily helped us in choosing the dishes.
We ended up ordering Chicken Tropicana, Chicken Paprika , a Bailey Irish Cream and a Tutti Fruti!

The Chicken Tropicana was really delicious and was more than enough for two. It was quite filling too.

Chicken Paprika had diced chicken with rice and was a bit on the spicier side but tasted really good. The quantity was adequate for two.

Baileys Irish Cream was a first for me and was quite an experience! 

Finally we ended up ordering a Tutti Fruti which we shared amongst the four of us (Yes, we were that much cash strapped!) It contained quite a lot of fruits but the mixed fruit jam at the bottom was a tad disappointing considering how good the initial part was.

The service here was very good and prompt. Waiters were very well behaved and helpful.
The prices of both food items and drinks are pretty reasonable!

Looking forward to trying out other dishes in the near future.
Recommended for those who are into Continental cuisines or are cash strapped!

Situated in Park Street, One Step Up has always been one of the more popular casual dining joints in the vicinity. They've always had their fair share of regulars who keep coming back for some of their lip smacking delicacies.¬†
Given the Vegetarian diner that I am, I shall review some of the vegetarian dishes and the restaurant over all.
Ambiance: The very first impression that the eatery makes is of a warm cozy joint that one wants to come back to at the end of a day. The yellow lights and a soft music step up the tone 'One Step Up'. A caveat that follows this warmth, is that One Step Up is a spot for casual dining, and not for fine dining. As such you might find yourself at a loss of the 'feel' of a much refined dining joint when you enter the place, or seat yourself at either of the floors. However, when you sit on the first floor you might want to strategize and choose a spot where the Air Conditioner doesn't blow a constant stream of cool air all over you and your food, which might just make your entire experience uncomfortable.

Service: The staff is very courteous, and you might find yourself pretty comfortable once you're seated. ¬†The speed of the service is rather quick, so you might want to pace your order accordingly.¬†

Food: Usually being in a group of 3-4 our orders are limited. Some of the dishes that we tried on this particular occasion are Vegetable Florentine, Paneer Shashlik, Vegetable Paprika, Spinach and Cheese Cannelloni, and the Veg Kebab Platter.
The Veg Kebab Platter serves as a sumptuous array of well cooked and finely balanced flavours. They serve babycorns, potatoes, cottage cheese and the vegetable sheekh. The vegetable sheekh is very delicate in texture, and tastes really good. The other varieties are also good, but the sheekh stands out. The mint chutney served along does wonders in bringing out the Indian flavours.¬†
The Vegetable Paprika was hot, and tastes good. But it had a huge hit of pepper which turned out to be a blessing in disguise against the cold of the AirCon.
The Vegetable Florentine has a nice rich white sauce, and is served on a bed/layer of sauteed spinach. Vegetables (mostly seasonal) are cooked in the white sauce. The combination of spinach and white sauce is very hard to throw off balance, and is almost a classic. As such, there really isn't much of a target to miss.
Though on similar lines in terms of base ingredients, the tanginess of the tomato, and the cream cheese sauce elevate the Spinach and Cheese Cannelloni to a level beyond casual dining. The taste was perfectly balanced, and left us wanting for more.
The Paneer Shashlik was the clear winner of the entire lot. The spicy tomato sauce with the shashlik of paneer, and the garlic rice is just magnificent. The tomato salad brings in the freshness that the dish requires, thus taking it from an everyday dish to something you crave for.

All things said and done, OSU is a good restro for casual dining, and for having a merry time. The food is good and will fill you up with warmth making you crave for some more. It might not be as popular as all other establishments up in the street, but is definitely up there in terms of its F&B and service, though the ambiance does leave you a tad bit disappointed (especially when its full, and there's a lot of chitter-chatter all around).

I have absolutely no idea why people are rating it so highly. I had the worst experience of my life going here. Why would you go to one step up when you're in park street? The food, the wine, everything is overpriced. The waiters are too indulging and the ambience too doesn't need any special mention.

The place is conveniently located and is cozy. Perfect for a friendly catch up or a date.¬†The service is fast. The food is in reasonable quantity although the prices are slightly on the higher side. The starters are not so good but the main courses are really fulfilling.¬†I cannot get over the Chef's Special Chicken( picture 1), it's probably the best chicken in the city!¬†Recommended!
The other two pictures are Prawn Cocktail and Chicken Tetrazzini.

This is one of the lesser known restaurants on Park Street but trust me it is one of those hidden gems as we call them. This has to be one of my favorite places in that area. The Continental and Indian dishes are equally good. An absolute treat for your taste buds. Top two dishes for me would be Fish and Chips and Deviled Crab. Absolutely amazing. It's a must visit place.

The frantic search for a place to eat during the pujas, given the serpentine que everywhere ended here. Tried Chicken Mexicana, the spaghetti with chicken in mushroom sauce pretty good. 
What I loved was Chicken Tikka Quesadilla. The spicy chicken tikka with the bell peppers blended perfectly with the cheese. Tortillas were just perfect. The juicy stuffing with the tortilla is sure to leave a smile on your face. Chicken Lasagna was okay. The lasagna sheets were a bit too soft rather more on the soggy side. 
Overall a good experience.

Last day i went to this place with my mother..the decor is quite pleasant and the service was also good..what we ordered was
1.mixed grill - this preparation is a tasty one and if you are planning to go alone u may try this one..this is almost like a starter
2.hot chocolate brownie - in one word "yuuuuuummmmyy" .. must try
3.Chicken facon du chef - the quantity is double than shown below..it might prove to be difficult for one person to eat if you have already tasted the starter apart from that the sauce is wonderful
P.S.- a nice place to have lunch or dinner ,served with good quality food

A step towards good food...

A hectic lunch plan at Park Street landed us here and the choice didn't go wrong. Their forte is good food, in decent quantity and an attentive service. Our order included devilled crab that however had an overdose of cheese and mashed potato that made the crabmeat finding. The Chicken ala kiev is really tasty and similar to a Chicken Cordon Blieu dish without the spinach part. The Moroccan Chicken however sadly lacked authenticity with the presence of regular kebabs and a salad with mustard sauce dressing. 
But the place offers a wide range of continental and Italian cuisine that may serve an overall good taste on the palate.

Visited this restaurant a lot of time recently and undoubtedly it has become one of my favourite in the town. The place gives you - Good quantity of servings, amazing taste and most importantly it is fairly priced. Located at the very heart of Park Street it will charm you with its hospitality and content experience. Staffs are very courteous. If you really want to have a good time and food ... ditch the crowd/queues of peter cat n visit to this very restaurant. You won't be disappointed and I am sure you ll come back again.

Birthdays call for treats and treats call for good restaurants. And that's how we ended up at this joint. Its been a long time since our last visit but it just about feels right to add a review. Better late than never eh!
Location wise...well you cannot miss this place because it is located right next to the erstwhile Music World. The one thing common about every restaurant located in Park Street is the whole atmosphere inside....always bustling with a tinge of antelamo in the air.
The staff is extremely well mannered and very cooperative as they had made the following arrangement on our request without a second thought.
We sat upstairs initially but made our way down due to a very large and noisy group.

For starters(on some due insistence which ended up to be damn good) we had ordered Devilled Crab which was the highlight of that day. Rarely have i had such a beautiful mixture of potato, cheese and crab. So creamy, so yummy, so well done.....

For the mains we had ordered Moroccan Lamb(served with Herb Rice) & Chicken Mexicana(served with Spaghetti). What stood out for us was the tender and succulent lamb. The portions were quite good. The herb rice too was perfect.
With both the starter and the Moroccan Lamb a small quantity of saut√©ed veggies were served which added a nice touch to it.
The chicken was spicy and well cooked but maybe got sidelined due to the lamb. We were so full that a dessert was out of the question.
So do drop by!
And yes we plan to visit this place very soon!

It is just adjacent to Flurys in Park Street and easy to locate. We had gone there with some friends from USA and therefore was searching for a restaurant with served both Indian and Continental. We tried the chicken tetrazzini, chicken paprika and the Moroccan chicken. For dessert we had the souffle. The fish preparations were very nice. They used bhetki fish for all the preparations. The waiters were very courteous and the food didn't take long to prepare.

Nice but due to my mistakes of ordering chef special lamb suggested by my friend and after reading half of the preparation like slice grilled lamb with black pepper sauce. Thinking it as a western style grill lamb and nicely sliced serve with pepper sauce. I told the waiter to grill my lamb medium and he said ok. When I got my dish I was surprised to see the difference of the meal. It was saut√©ed lamb stew with black peppercorns serve with pilaf rice and vegetables. I seldom eat rice and it was my mistake as I didn't read the menu carefully. But when I asked the staff to please grilled my lamb medium he should tell me it is not actually a grill items. Well I did finish my meal and the food was good but my wishes for having a nice lamb steak was spoiled.
Overall no complaints since it was my mistake and hopefully the server be prepared to tell the customer how the food is cooked . 
I highly recommend this place and I will surely go there to eat anytime.

I will recommend fish Florentine to people who haven't tried it yet or are going there for the first time. U won't be disheartened

Overpriced. Overpriced. Overpriced. The quantity of the food is very less. Nothing so special about the menu too. A friend of mine ordered cranberry breezer and I'm sure they gave just cranberry juice instead. We had ordered prawn cocktail, chicken strips. The quantity of the prawns was disappointingly less. The chicken strips were fine, nothing great. After paying so much one does expect vale for it. Nevertheless, the ambience was good. Not a good experience overall.

Has been a couple of times that I have visited One Step Up, the first time being for a nice Christmas evening dinner. I love the clean/classy ambience. The ambience with the lighting and seating is just what you need for a dinner date and if you opt for a table near the glass wall overlooking Park Street, it's just perfect (atleast for a hopeless romantic like me!)

Coming to the real deal, I have just tried the Continental section of food here and man, has it ever disappointed me! No Sir! The Fish Florentine is my favourite. Oh no, it's the Devilled Crab. Or maybe the Prawn Cocktail. Fish and chips! I also love the Chef's Special Lamb. Melt in mouth.. totally. (Cravings while writing reviews be damned.. aargh!) I also remember trying steaks here I think but that's something I won't swear by (I know of better places for that). Try their Caramel Custard!

That's it. I don't think I want to continue with this review. It's hurting my stomach now. Thus, I would wrap up by saying that the service too is pretty prompt and I have had a super experience each time.

This is a great food joint at park street.

We had two mocktails and chicken lasagna.
The lasagna was fabulous but fortunately or unfortunately the cheese was pretty thick and we ended up being full by the time we completed it.
Then we asked to bring us the chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.
As desserts go, I liked the brownie of this place than most other restaurants.

Summing it all up
Good continental dishes and desserts
Expense is slightly on higher end
Classy d√©cor 
Decent and prompt service
Worth a visit.

One step up is one of those places in park street which has consistently kept up the quality of the food and service over the years.

This is yet another classic resturant in Park Street area. Easy to loacte as all other resturants of that area. The ambiance is aesthetically done and is soothing. The food is awesome. We ordered, among others, an exotic dish-prawn cocktail, which was heavenly delicious but the quantity is fairly less. The devil crab was yummy. Fish diana was yet another extraordinary dish. Service is fairly nice and quick. Alcohol rates are as applicable. Highly satisfied. Would drop by again soon and recommend friends and family.

Well, again based on what little i ordered.. and the rest.
Well the ambience was very cool.. we sat by the window on the first floor and it looked so nice and pretty..
The staff was very very good and well behaved, always someone was there to listen to our queries.
The only reason i didn't give 5 was because the chicken quesadilla could have been better, was missing some seasoning.
The chef's special lamb is to die for, just WOW.. i had never had such soft lamb. The baby corn, again, though boiled, can be seasoned a bit
The caramel custard üòçüòç
Will soon visit again.

This place is located at a prime location of parkstreet. Had high expectations from this place, had heard good reviews of North Indian of this place. When I went and was not in the mood for north Indian and ordered like in a cafe, the service is fast but the taste disappointed me.

Tried babycorn which was over fried. The panner kabab was good. But the pasta was horrible the worst I have ever had, just canned tomato puree in boiled pasta and nothing else. No seasonings and no vegetables, it was a joke in the name of pasta.

It takes ultimate perfection to deserve a 5 out of 5 rating.. and bingo.. one step up managed to do that and I think I am not being too kind to them..
I have little bit inclination towards authentic continental restaurants, I am being very honest about it.. but I am trying to become as much fair as possible in my review that follows....

I went today afternoon with my wife and the place was moderately crowded. The decor of the restaurant is pretty nice and the background music was pleasing to the ears.. we were allotted a 4-seater table. The chairs are nice and quite comfortable.
Let me now come to the part which is extremely important in hospitality industry. The service was prompt and non-interfering. When we convinced ourselves with certain interesting names from the widespread menu, the person, who was waiting to note the orders down, politely suggested to order fewer items as it would be too much for 2 people ... And now a days, we have restaurants who blindly note down orders without any suggestion .. that was a very nice touch from the service guy.. he also briefed on certain items we were confused about.. the serving was quick and plates were changed at regular intervals so we get proper taste of individual items ... I am personally very impressed with their service..
Now comes the best thing about today's dine out and that's the food itself.. we ordered Fish Diana, chicken sphagetti bolognaise, chef's special chicken and garlic bread.. each of the items was made to perfection and taste was yummmmm... A serious threat to the heritage continental restaurant of Kolkata, Mocambo.. 
My humble suggestion to all you foodies would be... Just rush to this place and spend an evening with your near and dear ones.. trust me, the food and the service would make your dine out really special ....

The food is middling-muddling and the service quick but the noise is godawful!  Detracts from the dining experience and gives the impression of being a fish market. Avoidable.

The place is at the heart of park Street, the ambiance is nice and the staff is good. The good tasted okayish, it's mostly for non veg ppl but it wasn't that disappointing just that veg options are less.

However, the service was a bit slow and the price too was on the higher side.

An average experience in all.

One step up is a restaurant with very sophisticated decor. The food served here is simply gorgeous. I remember having a pint of beer with some fish fingers and then wine with a lot of other delicacies. One step up won't disappoint you with their service or their presentation or the taste of the delicacy. However, their bathroom cleanliness did piss me off.

One Step Up is a mid-range restaurant with good, tasty food and a nice ambiance.¬†I have been here three times and all the times ¬†had a pleasant experience with the restaurant.¬†I mostly order the Italian dishes like Pastas or Lasagnas as they make them pretty good here. Pizzas not so much.¬†I have tried the Chicken Steak which is also good.¬†They serve alcohol, which I must say is on the expensive side (and also they didnt have happy Hours when I went)¬†But, if you are in Park Street and want to try good food with an average pinch in your pocket. This is your place to go. The servers were all behaved and good.¬†I would have rated it more but remembered that when I went during Christmas they miserably failed to manage the rush as we had to wait an hour for the food, but I guess that's just that particular day. The service on the other days I went were very quick.

Its extremely easy to miss restaurant owing to its proximity to the older better known restaurants on Park Street. One step up is probably one of the best continental restaurants in the country. Ive been visiting this place for close to 15 years now and trust me the food has remained as impeccable as it ever ( Though quantities have surely reduces ;) ) . Good service and food that will leave you groping for superlatives, this restaurant ideally deserves much more recognition than it enjoys currently. Although the entire menu is brilliant, my one standing favourite is the Fish florentine. what is remarkable is that the flavour hasn't changed at all in the last 15 years!!! ¬†I mean if I owned the restaurant , I would probably give you a money back guarantee on this dish. Go for it!!

Although the food was good but the proportion was not at par with the cost of the items... and the staffs were really rude I mean terrible... I don't think I will go back in there again...ÔøΩ and also there is little space as compared to the seating arrangements they have made ...the ambience is so so the only thing that keeps the restaurant running maybe its good quality of the food... the pictures are of the following dishes chicken Tropicana, grilled chicken, pea pulao, pasta arabiata and chicken stroganoff.

It's strange for the fact that this place is situated right at the centre of restaurants' paradise at park street, I failed to notice it. But, better late than never. Today, we went there and it was an amazing experience. One step up is a two storied restaurant and quite spacious. We got our table at the first floor. We were attended by a staff promptly. The staff was polite and soft spoken which is appreciated. We ordered three fresh lime soda, non veg platter and one Chicken facon du chef.
Non veg platter was quite good and the fish in it was very fresh and tasty. One think that captured our attention was the mushroom sauce which accompanied the platter. It was outstanding.
The best one is the chicken facon du chef. It had super tasty cheese stuffing. It was nicely plated with grilled veggies and a supremely tasty spinach-mushroom sauce. It is a strong dish from this place and very much recommend.
I shall definitely visit this place again soon.
~With @RajarshiPoddar & @SamayitaChakraborty

Next visit on 2017 Durgapuja Nabami:
Prompt service.
We had Chicken Facon du chef again.
Next we had Chicken tropicana which was a bit sweet to my taste.
Fish&Chips was good.
Virgin Mojito was awesome.

Another visit at One step up was on 9-12-17.
We again ordered fish and chips, chicken facon du chef.and virgin mojito.
This time we also ordered Chef's special chicken, one chicken starter with finger chips, chicken sicilliene, and chicken mexicana. All the prestige were delicious.
I think that this is my fourth time at One Step Up. This is a very good eatery.

Have been to One Step up a couple of times. I prefer Mocambo over them because of the sheer variety of continental dishes. However I find their Devilled crabs and Chicken Tetrazzini better in both taste and quantity. Their cheese stuffed chicken and facon du chef are very good ; mocambo doesn't serve them either. All in all its a good place for a lazy, self pleasing dining experience .

The service, location and ambiance of this place are superb! This place is well known for its Khao-sweys and its Florentine dishes. Both of these items are must haves in case you visit this place. Don't order Chinese here because there are better options for Chinese just opposite this place. Try their continental dishes and you'd be content!

There are restaurants, there are cafes, and then there are classics. This is a classic. We recently ordered dinner from here and while it took a while to reach us, the food was an absolute delight! We have dined at One Step Up for decades, but their food was equally enjoyable when we had it at home. Continental cuisine in Kolkata is known and loved for these unmatched outlets. Hats off!

Although there are no real complaints about the overpriced and undercooked food, I have a huge issue with the behaviour of the staff and management. They charged us 70 rupees per bottle for mineral water and when pointed out that it was illegal to do so in lieu of a recent order passed by the government, they kept arguing with us and didnt let us leave till we paid the amount. A waiter went ahead and said that he wont let me leave till I pay and kept asking "WHO WILL PAY?" When told that we were not supposed to pay such blatantly overcharged pries for water and shown the law on our mobiles, he said he wont mind holding me by my collar to accord the price. 

When you charge the amount you do for the food you serve, you are entitled to provide some services of which decency and transparancy tops the list. I, being a law student, am going to pursue the matter in the consumer court. Remember, its never about the money. Its about the attitude these restaurants have where they exploit you against the law and do so unabashedly.

Great staffs and environment readily lifts up the mood. The food we ordered were amazingly good. Though the couldn't serve us the cocktail we ordered because the didn't have gin in their stalk yet the substitute one did justice to it. Highly recommended.

Perhaps one of the best restaurants serving continental food in Park Street, One Step Up provides delicious food albeit at a rather expensive price.
The two storied restaurant with its minimalistic decor never failed to wow me on both the occasions I have been there.
This time, I opted for two dishes, a starter and a main.
I had Devilled Crabs for starter. They were deboned and were stuffed with cheese. Although it was rather heavy, it tasted delicious.
The Chicken Sicilienne was ordered as part of the main course. Chicken breast lathered in white sauce - Bliss!
The dishes came with a serving of mashed potatoes and boiled Vegetables. Though both of them are heavy and a strict no-no for the calorie conscious, they were amazing.
A perfect restaurant, saved for the price which can perhaps be lowered a bit.

Had done a booking via Dine Out App. The manager refused to entertain saying we don't have a tie up. Anyway offered us a table. It's a small outlet near Jet Airways ticketing office in Park Street.

I walked in here on a hot afternoon for a quick beer. It seemed empty when I walked in but got full in about 15 min. Me and my friends (tourists in Kolkata) ordered our drinks and sides. The starters were pretty good. One of my friends had ordered a main course as take away but the food was a little bland to our liking. The only thing that was a downside for us was the speed of service. It took quite a while for our food to come! But otherwise a decent place for a peaceful afternoon.

Service was a bit slow however they made up for their slow service with good food... The food made the wait worth it. 
Although they served quite fancy and elegantly plated Continental food the ambiance was quite mellow and 'cafe like' 

Good options for dishes that include fish and lamb as opposed to a menu where everything is 'chicken'. 
Overall a very nice experience.. Worth a visit.

Park Street can be pretty intimidating at times, since more often than not, I end up being spoilt for choices. However, when you cut down to your type of cuisine with the budget constraint in mind, you can narrow down to a few choices. It was one of my favorite senior's birthday, and a few of us decided to treat her on her special day. But being perceptually broken, we were looking for a comparatively cheap joint with decent food. And then we stumbled across this. And our experimental venture didn't turn out bad at all !

Located right beside Flurys, One Step Up churns out one of the best continental dishes in town at an affordable range. It's divided across two floors, and though the decor or seating aren't particularly impressive, the food definitely is.

Our order went as follows:
Starters:
1. Non Veg Caesar Salad: I was a little sceptical about how they would prepare this, but they exceeded my expectations! This was prepared brilliantly, and the dressing done just right.

2. Prawn Gambas: The prawns tasted pretty good, even though the accompanying salad weren't as delicious.

Main Course:
1. Lamb Lasagne: The 'safe' dish turned out to be the least favourite of the evening. I love Lasagne and am very particular about baking it right. The cheese on top tried to save the dish, but the Lamb wasn't done right.

2. Fish Florentine: Baked on a bed of spinach, I love this fish preparation. Even though I didn't like their idea of giving potato strips instead of mashed potatoes, the dish was good. 

3. Fish Steak: This was done in mushroom sauce, as steaks are supposed to be. The taste was average - not too bad, not too good.

4. Fish Diana: This was the star dish of the evening. I didn't expect it to turn out SO good! The fish was delicious to the core (literally) and the sauce on top was perfect. 

5. Chef's Special Chicken: This was another surprise. Stuffed with cheese and asparagus and wrapped with bacon, this was served with sour cream gherkin sauce, every bite oozed out joy!

6. Chef's Special Lamb: This was served with herbed rice and had slices of Lamb cooked in pepper sauce. This too tasted quite good.

We already had a Flurys cake to finish for dessert, and didn't have room for more. Also, we were in the mood for continental, and so I haven't sampled their Indian dishes. However, I was bowled over by the ones I tried!

I definitely RECOMMEND this place, if you're looking for good continental food and don't have the money (or attire) to enter the likes of Mocambo. This isn't one of the posh restaurants and that makes it even more welcoming. So next time you're in Park Street and you have a hunger pang, you know the place to rush to!

Located in park street opposite to the oxford bookstore just a few steps ahead of flurys as you walk towards The Park.
This place caught my attention when a friend of mine spoke highly of its devilled crabs. Being a die-hard seafood glutton i couldnt help myself going to that place that day itself.
The place has a very ordinary decor. It is 2 storied and the seating is spacious.
I ordered for:-
1.Devilled crabs- Believe me it was WORTH the effort..the cheese and the crab meat blends perfectly and it tastes delicious. They serve the crab in the shell but it has been partially deshelled for your convinience. The plating is good and makes the food much more palatable. Definitely up for a second serving
2. Chicken sicilliene- This is a very cheesy affair so all you "health freaks" and "diet conscious whimps" please stay atleast a kilometer away from this dish!!!
The chicken was tender and juicy. Though i didnt have a taste that lingers in ur taste buds and it has a strong flavour of cheese beacuse its like a cheese explosion in your mouth as u take a spoonful 
The only area which irked me was the amount of cheese used in making these dishes as cheese satiates you very early and you can't have much food moreover for the lactose intolerant guys out there beware!! This one's not for you!!
The service is quick, the waiters friendly. To sum up this a a decent place to go for dinner. And to all the seafood fanatics the DEVILLED CRABS are a MUST try!!

For main course we tried plenty of dishes.Chef's special lamb,slices of grilled lamb cooked in a peeper sauce and served in a herb rice,it's delightful.Chef's special chicken was also good.Fish Diana is one of the mouthwatering dish of them,it's tantalizing,we just loved it,sauce was excellent in ¬†it.Fish Florentine is also amazing.Fish steak is average is taste.

One Step for great Continental Stop

Easily to locate on park street. Clean and sofisticated decor. 
Chicken Tetrazinni was our order, and we were more than satisfied with well cooked spaghetti, with chicken chunks cooked in cream sauce. And its a baked dish, for which the crust makes a great texture to the creamy gooey pasta. Topped with potatoes and crunchy veggies . Good quantity for two people.
Service is fast and fuss free. Highly recommended..

I ordered the chicken Stroganoff one hectic night at the hospital that had left me hungry the whole day... And the food that was delivered was soulful... Perfectly packed and as I opened the pack the waft of the lovely chicken in white sauce , the buttery herb rice, sauted veggies tossed with pepper and parsley... It was yummilicious!!! I have never had the inclination to have a sit down dinner or lunch at one step up... But always wondered how good or bad their food was... Now I can safely bet on this restaurant on park Street which is incidentally my favourite street ( after college Street) in Calcutta! Shall make time for a sit down dinner very soon.. really looking forward! 
PS what was also remarkable though it is a tiny detail was how well the veggies especially the potatoes were prepped.. perfect..
 And it added the perfect degree of colour to the otherwise white dish!

Went there for lunch a few days back  with a friend. I thought to savour my taste bud with some fish steaks. Disgusting!!!!! Do they know the meaning of fish steaks??Don't try this out. I took one plate of pizza with bacon that was just ok. Ambiance was OK. Crowd was unfavourable. The staff could hardly speak In English.

The eatery has comfy ambience & courteous staff (not like the other restaurants in park street that have those sassy staff).
We decided to order Devilled Crab (which is a speciality). It was really tasty, as expected. The waiter recommended us to order Fish Diana. It was out of the world. Juicy bhekti fish stuffed with saucy prawns. Nothing but the best. Highly recommended.
Quantity of food is good. Quality is great. Yes its pricey, but little less than the others in the same locality.
They offer a wide variety of continental cuisine. So, must try.

Been here several times till date and this is a great place to hang out for continental food lovers, specially when you are in a hurry or you are running short of money. The thing I like the most about this place is I never ever have to wait! Most of the times I visited this place seeing a long hungry line in front of Mocambo and actually I never got disappointed much.¬†Talking about food the preparation deserves its place on top of the list is devilled crab. It is really awesome, amongst others i should mention chicken tetrazini, fish diana, lamb lasagna, grilled prawn, prawn newberg etc. Ambience is also quite nice and the view of park street from the glass window is really beautiful. The last thing I have to say about this place is when the bill comes after you eat a lot, it wont give you a heart attack! Surely gonna visit again.

The relatively low rating of of this place is either an Indictment of Zomato or its users. It's the best Continental in Calcutta  by virtue of having a better selection than Mocambo and very similar standard of fare.
Lamb lasagna my favourite but many other dishes come close.

Had a great lunch, worth every penny. 

Ambience - Good, neat. 

Food - Amazing Chicken Cordon Bleu - a must order. Fish and chips, absolutely delicious and crispy. 
Chicken Lasagne- Sauce and the dish by itself was really good. I felt it was the only thing that was quantity less. 

Drinks - Ordered Cosmopolitan and Mojito. 

Bill - 2200.

The Italian food is more preferable. 
Tried many items here and mostly all are hanging in the range ok to good. 
The consistency of food taste and quality is very inconsistent. 
Sometimes a food tastes good and sometimes absolutely not. 


Chicken fan du chef is a must try.

Went to one step up after a year. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Wonder if they have changed their chef or what. Their paprika was turned into a stupid Mexican rice, with the sauce seeking just stale and their most amazing stuffed mushroom starter- now horrible. What once used to be my go to place, now I will never go to. I feel bad for what they did to the vegetables and meat- they didn't a death like that. ONE STEP UP, GO BACK TO BEING GREAT. PLEASE. 
Also, horrible staff. Rude and pointless. They make the already horrible eating experience worse

All the food was authentic and treat for you taste buds.

Ambience is descent.It can be better.We got a table on ground floor.

The place is too small.Food wise it was too good.If they improve there ambience litle but it will be one of the main attraction of park street.

Though even now it have huge rush.

Over All it was pretty good. The ala keiv wasn't that great, it would pass as average, Except for that food was pretty tasty! Portions are standard as well. But boy did their cocktail suck. . Had a screw driver. Would go back there but would be selective while choosing dishes and the cocktails!

Have visited this place few times before and have some good experience as far service and quality of food is concerned.
But as far as my last visit on 28th December for lunch I was highly disappointed with their service. I really do not understand what happens to restaurant services during festive seasons. The starter was served before soup and main course before we even finished soup. They were in some hurry as a result we could not enjoy the food. It was mainly sitting on the table and getting cold. I would suggest people not to visit such places atleast during festive season when you plan to have a nice and relaxed meal with your family and friends.

We ordered ceaser Salad n herby chicken for starters
and in main course we ordered grilled fish, fish Florentine, grilled fish cilantro,chicken paparika, chicken tropicana, chicken mexicana n fish meuniere. The quantity was fine and the fish items were gud bt chicken mexicana was not that good. Service was bit slow that may be for a huge rush. But overall it was a good experience n ambience was nice..

Couldn't have had a worse experience than this! Went for lunch today here. Everyone came on my insistence and boy I regretted it. Terrible food. The LIIT was a sham. Coke mixed with vodka and some lemon juice. They don't use fresh ingredients and that was evident from both the fried calamari and the pepperoni pizza. Even the tobasco sauce on the table was old! The food tasted really bad.on telling the server he took the pizza away and didn't even bother to return with a new pizza or a good explanation! Terrible ordeal.

Recommended options for starters :

Prawn cocktail, Fish fingers, Herby chicken fingers

Some recommended main dishes :

Chicken a la Kiev, Chicken Tetrazinni, Fish Florentine, Prawn Meuniere, Prawn Newberg

A must visit for continental food lovers...

Price is very reasonable.Ambience is ok(lack of space) though the view from the 1st floor is good.

Serviece is bit slow.

However,if you are continental food lover,you should visit this place at least once.

Cincidering everything it's 3 out of 5 for me.

One Step Up. Had heard of this place quiet a few times but never thought of it to serve proper North Indian food. As we say, never judge a book by it's cover.

We had ordered for a Dum Aloo, Panner Butter Masala, Dal Makhani and a couple of Garlic Naans. No complains about any of these dishes. No complaint at all.

Plus very friendly staff and comfortable seating and ambience on the top.

Over all - A very clean experience with this one.

One step up is a restaurant to which my family and me have been going to for years altogether, They have two sections for seating, one on the ground floor and another on the mezzanine floor, I personally prefer the one on the mezzanine floor.

Coming to the food, I'll list down a few favourites of mine :

Chicken stroganoff - the chicken is perfectly cooked and the cheesy rice goes perfectly along with it 

Chicken shashlik - this has 12 pieces of chicken kebab and buttered rice, what else do you need? 

The restaurant is decently priced and doesn't punch the pocket. A good place to go overall

This is one of the most underrated eateries in the restaurant cluster of Park Street. It is a two storied, neat place, not over embellished with lights and decor.  But the food is totally admirable. 
Their pinacolada , Margarita are brilliant. If you are a meat lover, make sure you order their Chef's special Lamb and Chicken. Chicken steak is also worth mentioning. It is highly recommended you ask for the chef's special items here. 
And what can be better than visiting this place with a couple of your friends. ;) 
Happy dining!

The food is good. We had veg lasagna, spinach and cheese callounnie and veg platter. All the above items were delicious and mouth watering.

It's located just opposite to Park Street Bar-B-Q . It's was bookmarked for a few days . So we decided to visit this place as it was 'Her' birthday üòò..
The ambience, it was smart, sleek and exactly what it was needed to be but not more than that . 
The food, we ordered devil's crab , Chef's signature lamb and the mixed grilled platter. THE DEVIL'S CRAB was mind blowing. The blend of soft crab meat cheese and mushrooms were just perfect . and the quantity was very good. The lamb dish was perfectly cooked and the mixed grill platter was a great choice too . the quantity was huge . portion of the fish chicken and prawn were ample and juicy . to accompany our food we ordered a bottle of beer and a cocktail named 'mocking bird' . the stock of beer variants were not impressive and the taste of the cocktail were very average . which I found only drawback of this place.  Maybe next time I won't be disappointed for this.  
Apart from that , the hospitality and service were great . Maybe I will be there again just to taste that devil's crab once again.

This place is situated in the heart of parkstreet and is not difficult to spot.Have passed by it many times but didn't pay a visit.But yesterday me and my friend decided to give our joint birthday treat over here.We arrived at 2:15 and were shown to our seats.Since the top floor was full we had to take seats in the bottom floor.Coming to the d√©cor,the restaurant was dimly lighted with a yellow lamp hanging over every table.

Coming to the food for starters we ordered crispy chilli baby corn,fish finger and chicken tikka kebab.For drinks we ordered lime soda.The crispy chilli baby corn was tasty,had the right blend of spices,was crunchy enough and a little spicy.The fish finger had 8 pieces which were served with fries and the tartar sauce.The fish was quite good and cooked perfectly.The chicken tikka kebab had 6 pieces,coming to the kebab it was soft and succulent and melted in our mouth.Also we ordered Caesar salad (non veg),it had chicken,bacon,spinach,cabbage and small cheese balls and was served with a single bread.I just tasted some bacon from it and it was crispy and juicy.My friends did say that the salad was also delicious.

For main course we had chicken steak in mushroom sauce,chicken paprika,chef's special chicken,chef special's lamb and jumbo prawn Thermidor.Now the chicken steak was absolutely delicious.Served with egg poach,it was juicy and the sauce had a meaty flavour.Coming to the chicken paprika I was disappointed as the rice was a little spicy and the chicken sauted with mushrooms and capsicum tasted more like chilli chicken.The chef's special chicken had two medium pieces of chicken, some mashed potatoes and few veggies.I felt the it tasted same as the chicken steak.The chef's special lamb was also disappointing,the lamb tasted like mutton rogan josh and was spicy.Now coming to the jumbo prawn thermidor it was omelette and cheese mixed with the prawn served in its shell.I didn't taste it but my friend who did said it was tasty.

Overall I wasn't that much satisfied with the main course,it was okayish type but the starters were good.Overall the pocket pinch was (including the tax)4488 which I felt was ok considering the number of food items we had ordered.Hoping to pay a visit soon again.

One step up had been long into my list. today finally i managed to visit there. We ordered mainly based on which are frequently recommended by zomato reviewers. All the food are in ample amount and the restaurent is also well maintained although very average decorum. Staff are extremely well mannered. Now the food:
Starter:
1. Prawn cocktail (5/5)
2. Devilled crab (4/5)
Main course:
1. Chicken facon-du-chef (3/5): this one disappointed me a little as i expected extraordinary flavour from the corner of a chicken lover.
2. Grilled fish Cilantrine (4.5/5) wonderful taste.
In brief i enjoyed every moment in the restaurent and i do wiah to visit here again.

One of the most brightly lit eatery in Park Street, this place is famous for the typical continental dishes we eat at restaurants in this area. 

Cocktails / Mocktails are good. Prawn Gambas-Al-Ajillo tasted great. Quality of prawn was good. Among mains Chicken Paprika is our favourite here. Both the rice and the sauce tastes good. 

For dessert the caramel custard was ok. Could have been much better. The Chocolate Souffle was good.

Service is good and fast.

It was my first time here and I have to say I was quite surprised with how I loved the food. No doubt the location is the best ever. The staff is nice. But the food is unexpectedly very nice. The spice, the flavor, the quality and quantity is perfect. The price is pretty reasonable as well. I'm very happy with all the orders that were places and I would definitely visit again. I'm very happy with my experience here.

Some might miss this place, its located just opposite bar b q. Well it serves continental food, but is a bit bogged down from the stiff competetion from peter cat. The food is good, and tastes like standard continental food, nothing extraordinary but not bad at the same time. If u are not in a mood to stand in the que of peter cat or mocambo, and want a chilled out time with frnds along with booze, go to this place.

On the day of Muharram, I found myself plodding the desolate streets of Park Street with 3 of my friends. It had been ages since I had tasted the Chicken Tetrazzini, and boy, I was not disappointed. We had a tomato soup, a cream mushroom soup, lamb lasagna, chicken stroganoff and the non veg club sandwich. What stood out was the sweet and salt fresh lime soda (it was a dry day). Unlike most other resturants, they got the combination of sweet and salt, spot on. The only negative feedback I have is that the portions are too large. What I mean is, I would rather order 2 main courses for a variation in taste, than have an entire shepherd's pie by myself. Staff were friendly. Service was prompt. Sorry we didn't click any pictures of the food.

One Step Up adds to the list of brilliant continental food joints in the city. Went there on panchami for lunch. Its a beautifully decorated place located beside au bon pain.
First we ordered two cocktails - volcano amd pinacolada. Pinacolada was good to taste but volcano really had a volcanic experience in it. A single glass can make you go a little dizzy. Then came devilled crab which is a speciality of this restaurant. The way they serve it boosts your appetite. Then came tuna fish with garlic toast. It was okay, nothing special. Then we ordered moroccan chicken and chef special lamb.. Both are continental dishes that are served with rice and salads. Both the dishes were meticulously prepared. The amount they serve is also good and after all these we were full up to the brim. Lastly as a desert we ordered caramel custard. This is surely gonna create riots in your taste buds.
So allover this was a fantastic experience. Most importantly there was no puja special thing which I actually liked because puja special menus limit the options at the same time increasing the price.
Recommended for all whether a foodie or not.
P. S pocket pinch may be high bit it is at par with all other restaurants in the area.

Primely located at park Street opposite Bar B Q should call this restaurant a legendary one because of its signature continental dishes having a good taste at a decent price. I have been here many a times but reviewing for dinner we had during the puja this year. Almost all of park Street had a one hour waiting and we got place here instantly. They also have a section at the first floor and that's y the name I think. Ambience is OK lights are dim seating bit congested. Staffs are quick and courteous.
We ordered veg Florentine and Mexicana both bake dishes delicious. Coming to one step up one should order bakedish because it's their speciality.
Main course were totally Indian dal paneer bread veg pulao all tasty and well served. 
Quantity is good rates are average compared to the area and quality service is prompt.
We can have food here on a regular basis since its affordable especially when we are in park Street.

Okay! So Park Street now has one more addition to the list of continental food joints which surely gives a great experience. We had ordered devilled crab, tuna fish dip with toasted bread, chef's special lamb and moroccan chicken. For dessert we had caramel custard. Now coming to the dishes... each one was equally good to taste..the devilled crab was even better than that being served in other most famous restaurants. Moroccan chicken was dry but with an interesting flavour and then there was the lamb which was juicy and saucy to complement the chicken. Coming to drinks... we ordered two cocktails... pinacolada and volcano... pinacolada was awesome and volcano had really given the areal volcanic experience as they have printed on the menu cardüòú. The staffs were friendly. Ambience was really good. The price is okay... except for the tuna fish dip which seemed a little expensive.

Awesome food. Had Chicken Risotto, Chicken Stroganoff, Mexican Chicken, Fish Florentine and French Fries. Everything tasted fabulous. And surprisingly, the quantity was very high. Each dish was sufficient for 2 folks. Speedy preparation, polite and helping staff, nice location, nice decor. It's pricy, but absolutely worth it.

Finally here on Shoshti for lunch with my girl gang. We ordered crumb fried prawns and pepperoni pizza for starters. Loved the tartar sauce with the crumb fried prawns. It was delish. The pizza was ok.
We then ordered chicken mexicana, chicken siciliene and chicken tetrazzini for the main course! 
Loved all the 3 dishes. My love for white sauce n cheese was satisfied with the siciliene and tetrazzini. I must mention that the quantity was more than enough for one person. Something we usually don't find these days anymore.
For dessert we had the caramel custard which was the perfect end for our cheese overdose! 
Overall, loved it!

This place makes amazing devilled crab. The crab meat was so soft and creamy and it had mushrooms. It was served with mashed potato and veggies.
This dish is a must if you visit this restaurant.
The Thai red curry was tasty with a nice coconut and lemon grass flavour . The quantity was enough. But it was not spicy, Thai red curry is supposed to be spicy.
The chicken stroganoff was okay. The butter garlic rice served along with it was delicious.
They had increased the prices of the dishes during the Durga Puja time.

Have been to this place many times , but a review was pending, so here it is !

One Step Up has been very consistent with quality which is the most important factor for any restaurant. I have dined here numerous times and have never been disappointed. Normally when I order I go for safer choices like chicken steak or Imperial chicken, but today I decided to go for the Chef's special Lamb , which comes with rice , some veggies and succulent chunks of lamb meat. The dish was fabulous and was on par if not better with the lightly smoked lamb shanks which I had in Smoke House Deli.  

Also ordered were deviled Crab , Chef's Special Chicken and Chicken Khao Suey which was pretty good as well. 

All in all a good place with great food!

The food quality is awesome and I have no complaints regarding availability of good food items.. But I am giving a rating just based on the pathetic service and hospitality. We went as a group of 5 friends who were all males.  Everyone else was served liquor there and they took their order even after the stipulated last order time... But they denied serving us liquor even after repeated requests... This was very unfair on their part and this and this alone was enough reason for me not to visit the restaurant again.  They have a tendency of showing prejudice towards some customers for no valid reason at all.

I have heard of this place for a very long time but it is only today that I got a chance to visit. I had ordered fish fingers, chicken a la kiev and chef's lamb special. The waiter who took our order had a faint aura of smugness about him and hinted as if we did not understand our order,  but the boy who served us was very gentle. The fish fingers were not extraordinary  and neither was a lamb. Infact, the lamb was a bit too spicy for my taste and the rice served with the lamb was not that good for my taste. However, I was bowled over by the a la kiev. They seem to know what they were offering and the subtlety of the item could be seen in one of the photographs I have uploaded. Had they used unsalted butter and insted used the salt to marinate the chicken, things would have been much better.

Found one more joint serving tasty continental dishes... Easy to find as it occupies a prominent place in the famous Park Street area.
We ordered prawn cocktail, chicken tropicana and grilled fish in lemon butter sauce.... The prawn cocktail was really good... The chicken tropicana was perfectly spiced.. I should have had the grilled fish first followed by the chicken recipe as the former was less spicy and the lemon thing didn't work well for me after having the more spicy chicken despite the fact that it was cooked so well... So that was a mistake on my part.. Overall a nice experience. :)

My friend and I was casual touring around the city and we're searching for a decent place to dine at. Searching through Zomato we came up to this restaurant. The place has quite a nice ambience.

We ordered the much hyped Devilled Crab and fell in love as we had the first spoon of the cheesy crab meat! It is so good that I can easily just order that 3 times and enjoy both the crabs like Joey (from F. R. I. E. N. D. S.)
Then we went for a Lamb lasagna.. And it also was love at first spoon-full. Heavenly food. Recommended for foodies, recommended for continental lovers!

Edit on 20th October, 2016

Was back here to have more of that Devilled crab and I was blown over yet again...
The new dish that was ordered today was the Fish Florentine...

Fish? Good!
Spinach? Good!
Cheese? Goood!!
Fish florentine? Goooooooood!!!!

Try it out yourselves!

When you are in park street, you don't need to worry about the food. With new places opening up on a daily basis, one step up has gone unnoticed. The location couldn't have been simpler, this restaurant is pretty simple and well decorated.

Nothing much to talk about the d√©cor except it is pretty spacious. Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken lasagna and Moroccan chicken. The lasagna was huge and well cooked and served. The Moroccan chicken was brilliant in terms of size and taste. The staff is pretty weird and creepy. Nonetheless, you should visit this place at least once.

Park street is the hunting ground for those who love continental food. There are so many options in this area. This particular outlet, being younger, is rather less popular than the big ones. But my experience in this place was quite good.
Though the sitting arrangement is not good and the d√©cor is not so impressive, the overall ambience is nice mainly for the nice glass window and moderately bright lighting.
Let's talk about the food. GRILLED FISH WITH LEMON BUTTER SAUCE: Nicely grilled juicy fish fillets were served with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables. It was delicious. Just reducing the amount of potatoes and adding some more veggies could make it even better.
CHICKEN TETRAZINI having lots of mushrooms was superb.
DEVILLED CRAB was also good though I prefer it in Mocambo.
Over all a nice experience.
Recommended.

Continental is always a first favorite for a glutton as you get served with some jolly big platter to hog on, just as you get in One Step Up. Not very old in the food chain business, the bar cum restaurant seems promising enough in becoming a biggie. In cocktails we only had mocking bird which was marvellous. In mocktails fruit punch was simply amazing. We had to order three! In food, we had ordered chicken sushlick kebabs that comes with buttered rice and salad, grilled fish and chicken tropicana. The last in the list wasn't that great but grilled fish surely stole our hearts. Looking forward to more visits.

After a hectic day of errands I came here for a quick drink and snack. The place did not disappoint. Service was quick. The Fish pitika i ordered with my drink was tasty. A mid satisfactory rating because of the seating... I was given a table next to the stairs..waiters and managers scurrying up and down to bring food and settle bills. A bit of a mood spoiler. But overall decently priced for drinks and food. So I will recommend it for hanging out.

The risky slider and the chocolate mousse was indeed a sweet end to our lunch. The waiters were courteous and the service was quick.

I visited this place again today. The Green Goose was a very refreshing drink and its spicy. I liked it. The Warm Chicken Salad was filling. For mains had ordered Chicken Tetrazini and Fish Steak in tomato sauce. Both were delicious but we found the veggies a tad undercooked.
The Caramel Custard should have been softer.

We were a group of five meeting after quite sometime for a dinner get together. We tried to keep it simple...not much hip hop...staring with Mullgatwany soup, one each of chicken and fish fingers. The chicken fingers were more crispy and tastes better. Then we ordered for the main dishes ehich were a bit customised. One each of chef's spcl lamb, chicken paprika, moroccan chicken and chicken stroganoff of which the last one happens to be the least spicy. I do liked mine chicken paprika...tasted the moroccan chicken...which was not bad. Lastly we had three virgin mohito and one lime fresh soda. The cost of the table was approx Rs 3500 including taxes. You can atleast peep in once to give it a try...

Lovely food, spoilt by terrible service.

Park Street was the happy hunting ground of my school and college days. Great food and (although overrated) the old world charm made me come back over and over again to this mecca of Calcutta cuisine.

One Step Up is a conundrum for me, however. How does one enjoy their succulent Fish FIngers or beautifully Devilled Crabs, while being snapped at by extremely poor waiters?

But if your luck with your service is better than mine was, then please tuck into their scrumptious Chicken Stroganoff or the very appetising Chef's Special (Bacon wrapped) Chicken.

Haven't tried their drinks so can't comment. Story of what could have been, really.

They tasted fine though there still was room for improvement. The staff was courteous and nice and service was fast. Overall, a good option if you're in the Park Street area.

This place is in park street. We went there on Christmas so the place was packed with people. And the tables seemed too close to one another. We ordered a Pizza with pepperoni,a chicken tetrazinni  and chicken lasagne. All the three dishes were good. The pizza was on a hand made crust. The tetrazinni was cheesy. The lasagne was delicious! Overall the food was good and the service was prompt.

The dimly lit decor makes it cozy, where you don't become conscious . While eating this aspect is very important to me. The hospitality is good,in fact very good. Now the food is good, the cocktails are fresh, the Devils crab is a must try. Fish diana, lamb lasagne are awesome. The lasagne is far better than many other Italian restaurants in the town. The salad was not what I expected it to be. But may be its coz of my food habit.

Went to this place on a Sunday at around 8. Though the place had a few tables empty the management was still reluctant to give us a table as we were a big group. We ordered Stuffed Mushrooms, Spinach Cheese Pillows , Red sauce pasta , Pesto Pizza, Vegetable Risotto and Vegetable Tetrazzini. Out of all this we only liked the Spinach Cheese Pillows . The rest of the dishes were pretty much average and they tasted a bit bland. It seemed as if the Vegetable Tetrazzini and the Vegetable Risotto were made from the same sauce! Would definitely not recommend this place for continental food.

Located just beside the alley of Peter Cat, One Step Up proved to be a bit expensive for my liking. The food although the quality was superb was a tad overpriced. The restaurant boasts of a lovely playlist though building up a nice little ambience for a quiet lunch of Italian food. Give it a try once but definitely not twice.

This is one place which has never disappointed me much with food and service. Yesterday I stopped by for a quick bite and ordered for few beverage, paneer fingers, cheese chilly toast and two portions of caramel custard, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. In fact they immediately made a nice mocktail for my 7 year old which he absolutely loved. The final touch was that of caramel custard and we all loved it. In fact it was my son who pushed me to get the second plate! You are doing a great job guys and don't need me to endorse you! Just requesting you to maintain the standard and the service qualityüëå

Ordered Herby Chicken Fingers, Chicken Lasagne, Chicken Tetrazinni, Fish Florentine.
A satiating experience. Even though I absolutely detest the idea of fish and spinach together, Fish Florentine made me rethink about the combination.
The meat dishes were succulent. But the Lasagne, though tasted well, was bit overcooked.
Service is quite slow, needs improvement.

I have often wondered why, like Calcutta Chinese, there isn't a term called "Park Street Continental", because I have found most eateries around here serve a specific genre of continental - markedly with a lot of cheese, and quite different from what is served elsewhere in the city. And, in a blind food tasting, would even a seasoned Park Street addict make out the difference between the tettrizanis and prawn cocktails between the eateries here. Then again, all the places have a sweet brown sauce on the steak, with veggies boiled on the side without butter, and mashed potato without much cream or cheese.

Unlike Mocambo, One Step Up is not old decor wise and doesn't have the colonial feel to it. It is one of the most brightly lit places on Park Street, and I have quite liked the cocktails, in addition to the Park Street Continental Regular fare.

Another member of the Continental team lining Park Street , One Step Up is an interesting alternative if the queue at the big names is too long. Food is pretty much generic , similar to a Mocambo. I especially love the Chicken Stroganoff here as its prepared wonderfully and has a nice buttery feel to it. Kebabs are quite good. Good place to hang out with friends !

One of the best continental places I've been to. Food was amazing. Tetrazinni and fish Florentine especially. We screwed up a bit by ordering garlic bread and drinks which were not on the menu without asking for price, which is why our meal was a bit on the expensive side (for college goers on a budget). Other than that, pretty much worth what we spent

Tried this place on a Saturday evening. There are two floors & we decided to take the upper one as there is a good view of the Park Street Area. Sitting capacity is not huge but is OK. However, I felt that navigating through the tables & chairs is little difficult as everything looks bit cramped. We went for Beer, Fish Fingers & Chicken and Herb salad. The fish fingers were smelly. Don't know what fish they used. The salad was great though. The chicken cubes were cheese filled & the greens were tasty too. A second visit is required to taste more items & submit a second review on this joint.

Is the manager a retired warden? It seems so because I have not come across anyone as arrogant and rude as he is! The food was bland and tasteless. We had ordered a pizza which was not eatable (ate just one bite and left it) , Lasagna was salty, grilled fish had stale fish piece (we had to argue with the waiter to get it changed), chicken stronganoff was bland. After paying the bill we requested them to pack the left over lasagna. While waiting I over heard the manager saying "1st hand them the bill (packing charges had been levied seperately) and after they pay, then the package". Seems like the restaurant has customers who run off without paying the bill, well that dosent give you the right to treat every customer alike. Never ever going to step into one step up.

Food: Good quality and taste
Ambience: Nice and quiet
This is ideal for a quiet dinner. The waiters are friendly and courteous.
I have been here mutiple times. The waiting time is considerably low if compared to other restaurants on this street.
But after trying a few dishes (if u r not partial to tomato sauce like me), u feel they taste very similar.
But this is such a place that i shall go there again with the expectation of variety in spread and taste-hope i am not disappointed

Good food especially the continental part and also the chelo kebab. The decor is simple. Their upstairs closes at 3.30p.m but you can find a place downstairs.the mexican babycorn was tangy and tasty and the portions were enough to be distributed amongst three persons. The servers served well but without smile and rather the behaviour of one person was particularly grumpy as if to scold the guests. The prices are fine.

The first thing that I would like to say is that I simply LOVED the food, it was just the perfect blend of everything starting from the soup to the chicken Stroganoff to the virgin blue lagoon.. the chicken steak was a bit bland though but that can be completely ignored keeping in view the service, the menu and the food. As for the ambience it's definitely place to just sit chill and have a good meal.. interior isn't too fancy but as I said good for hangouts or get togethers... Would definitely recommend and come back..

The spaghetti was nicely prepared and chicken tropicana looked good to me and tasted well to my friendsüçóüçó but the lasagne was tad bit disappointing. The lasagne sheets were too much melted and it all tasted tangy..Not good...may be it wasn't a good lasagne day for me and the restaurant as well !

The first time I visited this place, it didn't interest me. Neither I liked the food nor the dark ambience. We were a group of friends and caught up here on platter of starters n drinks. Found it pricy and not so good in terms of taste. There on I avoided this restaurant many a times.

Buy just two days ago, went there for lunch with a colleague and ordered fish Diana and Devil crabs with some bread rolls and fresh lime. I must the food is awesome. Reasonable in price and very good portion. I am fond of the devil crabs of mocambo though which is an evergreen dish, but here also the taste was pretty good and well presented. Fish Diana is betki wrapped with prawns and cheese oozing out cooked in a tangy favoured sauce.
Awesome I must say. Can't comment on the dishes but after this lunch looking forward to try some more dishes at this place!
            

And as I had stated earlier, will be back to try out more - did visit again for dinner a couple of days back and the food remains same - DELICIOUS! And this time we tried - Chefs special Lamb & Fish meuniere! Lovely!

One step up is right on Park Street but still a bit tucked away. So you are there but still a bit away .It has a casual cafe like feel but serves you food that is seriously satisfying. For starters, Inspired by the all time favourite fish fingers, they have chicken fingers which is served with tartar sauce. You could pair them with your drinks as you wait for your main course The grilled fish with lemon butter sauce or garlic butter sauce served with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies is a must must try. That's the single dish I go to one step for. Perfectly grilled, juicy inside with the sauce in the right quantity hugging the fillet You can also ask for the sauce at the side to add to the fish if you want some extra lemon flavour. The lamb lasagne served while the warm cheese is still bubbling will give keep you craving more. The grilled chicken in mushroom sauce was nice but probably a little too understated for my palette.

LOCATION:

On the main park street stretch bang opposite Barbq Restaurant.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Age old place on park street with a legendary status only second to that of Barbq, Peter Cat and Mocambo. Spread over two floors, I didn't like the interiors at all. This is one of the reasons for the low rating. It gives you the look of a shabby cafe which has been run down and worn out over the years. I did not find the chairs very comfortable either. Don't go with too much hopes pinned to this aspect.

WINE & DINE:

I have dined here on two occasions. On one visit, I had their Maharaja Thali which had half a helping of Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, personal helping of Dal Makhani and Naan along with a salad. On the whole, all the items were good and I managed myself a satisfying meal. The Thali itself I think is a great concept as the helping in the above mentioned placed are quite big and not enough for one person to polish off. Hence, you end up wasting money and food.

On the second occasion, I tried their continental. I went for the Chicken Steak along with a Chicken Tetrazzini. I did not enjoy the Chicken Steak at all. Right from the Chicken being overcooked, to the bland sauce. It just lacked character. The Chicken Tetrazzini was also just about average. Becuase of the location and menu, you will probably end up drawing parallels with the Tetrazzini at Mocambo and that would result in a somewhat dissatisfying experience.¬†

I found the place to be a touch too expensive for what was on offer. We padi about 700/head without liquor which pinched.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The standard of the Continental food needs to go up. Also, they majorly need a face lift. At present the way it is and what it charges is not synchronized.¬†

VERDICT:

Its one of those "Jack of all trades places". It will be ok but not excellent.

If you don't, don't bother.

I for one love cheese and that is infact one of the main reasons why I love this eatery. The prices are pretty high. But the quantity is good as well.

If you dislike cheese, but read on , none the less, you could try the Chicken a la Kiev or Khowsuay.

Ambience was satisfying and the staff cordial.We went in a big group of 13 people and could not sit together, had to sit in 2 different tables.
For starter we had prawn cocktail and fish finger.Both of them were appetizing.
The rich and creamy seafood chowder soup was yummy.
In mains,chicken tetrazzini and fish diana were delightful, especially the fish diana.I usually prefer chicken to fish,but the fish diana was mouth watering.
The chicken lasagne and chicken risotto let us down.The lasagne mentions traditional chicken lasagne but i couldn't find any layer,it was full of cheese.And the risotto wasn't up to the mark either.
In dessert, we had risky rider,hot chocolate sundae and hot chocolate brownie.All of them were delicious. The risky rider had sponge cake with three different ice creams-vanilla,chocolate and strawberry with toppings of sauce and nuts.

Always check the parcel before collecting it....
Ordered a Veg Kabab Platter and Veg Paprika for takeaway. Was a fool not to check it. When opened the parcel at home was shocked to see some non veg items inside which later came to know was fish. Had asked the person at the counter to reconfirm the dishes. He had said it was in order. Later after speaking with them they agreed to send the parcel at my place. But again it took one hour to deliver the dish from Park Street to Mayfair Road, a distance of only about 2 kms. The horror never ended there. The food was cold and they forgot to give the salad with the platter and boiled vegetables with the Paprika. And as an icing on the cake a dish which was requested to be without mushrooms comes out to be filled with mushrooms and had to be thrown away. The excuse given was a new cook in the kitchen. Have been a loyal customer for around 10 years but now would think twice before visiting the place again.

The estranged cousin of the park street 'indian-continental' family which includes Peter Cat and Mocambo.¬†
I think most people only go here when the lines at the other two are too long. The food is forgettable.I felt an overall lack of seasoning and flavor in all the food. I ordered deviled crab to start with - crab meat was not at all fresh and there were bots of shell in it. The chicken paprika as the main was very bland.¬†
The portions are big but its not a good choice for dinner or lunch on park street.
The staff is very attentive and polite.

Located at Park Street, this place has garnered a lot of popularity mostly because of the location and it's widespread continental menu. The ambience however is pretty basic. The interior is nothing great either. The food is served hot and is more or less good in quantity while staff is well behaved and accommodative.  Not one of my favorite places, but certainly has an appeal to the masses.

We have visited this place a few times. The gap between visit 2 and 3 was approximately 5 months. Since then we haven't been to the place as the food quality has gone down by a lot. After that in the next few visits the quality has been a mixed bag. Sometimes its good and sometimes its not. The food quality here it seems is a gamble. Try your luck.

If something best describes One Step Up, its the fact that it is a not-so-popular restaurant surrounded by a host of other very popular ones and is thus likely to be missed out even by regular diners at Park Street. But trust me, this place is worth a try. The italian food is just too amazing. I've tried Au Gratin, Veg. Florentine, Pesto Pasta and Cheese Balls and have found each one of them to be delicious. The indian cuisine on offer though, I have to say is not very special and at that price there are some other very good options in the vicinity. Italian lovers are definitely going to give a thumbs up to this place.:)!

One of my favourite restaurants.¬†
Though the decor and ambience are very functional the good food makes up for it.
I have tried out all the continental preparations in fish over a period of time and found all of them to be very good.
However everytime I go there I just have to have the Devilled Crab. Wish there were more crab dishes.
The service staff are quite knowledgeable about the food and attentive, even when the place is full.
Tends to get a bit noisy due to the small space and tight sitting arrangement. However the food compensates.
Keep going back to it time and again to celebrate special occasions.

Located in Park Street, One Step Up is a great place for having continental food. It has two floors and is moderately big. The d√©cor is quite simple. I had ordered a Chicken Facon-Du-Chef and a Chicken Tettrazini. I loved the first one, and the Tettrazini was also well prepared. Ordered a Chocolate Sundae for dessert which was well made too. The service was also good.

Overall, great place which serves brilliant continental food. Pocket pinch is a little on the higher side.
Happy Eating.

Been here a couple of times and I must say I have a mixed feeling about this! This particular restaurant has indeed made a lot of name for itself for serving delicious continental food over the year. Situated in an area, where the continental food world is reigned by two majors, it is indeed of a tough challenge to establish one's dominance.

While the start was definitely good, the quality has now dripped down and as a result you can see numerous unhappy comments here in Zomato. All of my visits here were for takeaway so, I wouldn't comment much on their service. The restaurant is divided into two floors. The ambiance for the ground floor isn't much to speak about. Dimly lit, it is probably just perfect to have a sip of alcohol. Coming to the food portion, have tried Chef's Special Chicken, Carbonara, Tetrazinni, Fish Meuniere, Facon-du-Chef, Ala-Kiev, Florentine and Lasagna. First things first, the packing is probably one of the best in Kolkata. The food here was quite decent but nothing extraordinary. Tetrazinni was cheesy but Chef's Special and Facon-du-Chef were small in size and lacked sufficient cheese. Carbonara was way off course with their sauce and tasted like a ball of dump thrown together. What I liked here most was their fish. Flaky and fresh, the quantity was more than sufficient. The cheese content was just right and each one of the fish dishes I have tried here was beyond excellence.

The price portion here isn't something which can serve as an advantage over the other Continental giants. However, this is worth a try. You never know if it is your lucky day to receive just the perfectly made food!

I had heard a lot about this restaurant and hence decided to drop in one day with my girl friends for some good continental food.Sad to say I was disappointed.
For appetizers we had fish fingers and jumbo prawns..The prawns served were anything but jumbo,though the melange of flavours wasn't bad.For mains we ordered the seafood chowder soup,chicken lasagna,fish Diana,chicken risotto and chicken tetrazzini.The risotto was bland and absolutely tasteless.The lasagna and fish Diana were okayish.I wish they had used more fresh seafood in my soup so that the taste carried through.I had a hot chocolate brownie for dessert,it was pretty good but there was room for improvement.
All in all,a mixed experience.Being a seafood lover I wish they celebrated their seafood more on their plates and made it the central element.

Located in park street, its basically a continental cuisine place, the decor is very simple and is not done wid much thought, basic chairs and tables and notjing special to talk about
The food is good to be honest, but then a continental cuisine is more about cheese mayo and otjer items which add to the fat quotient
Tetrazini and stroganoff are good, altjough the grills can be improved upon

Service and staff is both good

Amidst all the glitz and glamour of park Street there lies a chain of restaurants which serve good food and entertain a hefty amount of customers daily . There is not a single dry day in terms footfall in park Street and everyday is a busy day . One step up is one of those park Street celebrities and they are known to provide good quality continental dishes to food enthusiasts for a long time now . We decided to stroll into the place one evening when the night was still young and your appetite was growing . The ambience us sober and the lights are perfect for a dinner conversation . If you are going with your partner then I will suggest you should go in a bit early around 8 PM . Because after that people tend to come in groups and it usually becomes a tad noisy . We ordered ; -

Starters : -

1. Chicken tandoori ( 4 / 5 )
2. Prawn cocktail ( 2.5 / 5 )

Main course : -

1. Chicken Facon-Du-Chef ( 4 / 5 )
2. Fish meuniere ( 5 / 5 )
 
Deserts : -
1. Tutty fruity ( 4 / 5 )

As you can clearly see from the above ratings that the prawn cocktail was a huge mistake . The dish was absolutely nothing , very small pieces of prawn drowned in cocktail sauce which had mayonese . For one time try it is not bad , but the dish costs around 240 rupees makes really no sense . It felt like a huge slap on our faces and we digested it because we were really in a good mood . Thankfully all the other dishes were the saving grace .The tandoori was tender and well grilled .

 The chicken facon du chef was delightful . It was slightly cheesy but not too much. The sauce was properly made witch spinach and mushrooms served with boiled veggies .

The dish of the evening was fish meuniere . Tender pieces of pan fried bhetki served in creamy sauce and mushrooms . You could not have enough of it . I must say that this dish is a must try for continental lovers . You could do away with the others but not this .

The desert was proper , no complains . The service was good but that's no surprise as they are generally quite courteous and professional here . Everyone should try at least once here at one step up .

This is my favourite haunt for continental food.   I have tried nearly everything on the menu. My favorites are the chicken tetrazzini and chefs special chicken. The main course dishes are pretty heavy and I struggle to finish one on my own. The spaghetti Bolognese and carbonara are pretty awesome as well .

The main thing which attracted us is the peaceful ambiance with some peppy music in the background.... We took Fish 'n' Chips & Chicken steak....!The food is awesome. The service is prompt and formal than peter cat which lies on the lane beside this sister restraunt....I recommend all of you to pay a visit. Would love to visit again.

Located in Park Street and it's easy to locate (that's definitely an add on ! )
The ambience is perfect. Calm and serene !

Food is good. I liked the prawn preparation, a lot !
Service is good. Staffs are courteous.

One thing that disappointed me is, Though they have seating arrangements upstairs, they don't let them avail that before 7:30. And that's not something pleasant to the ears. Right ?

Overall, it's good to have a try on continental here. :)

Minimal but nice d√©cor and friendly staff make this place a good option in the Park Street area. The food Is as good as the other continental options around, but is less expensive. A preparation called Fish Diana stood out.
The drinks were good and the price for the drinks is quite reasonable. 
Sitting is a little tight and you may spread the cheer to fifty people if you sneeze during¬†a busy hour.
I would go back to this place for sure.

I've been visiting Bar-b-q and Flavors of China for years and wanted to see how was their another sister restaurant which sits just across the street. And its specially is meat craving and continental and being a fan of continental, I had to try.
And as a pizza lover I had to try the pizzas first si I ordered Pizza pollo sausages (non-veg) and Pizza pesto (veg). Thin crust and perfect. But the amount of olive or whatever oil it was, was too much. It was literally dripping and that was a turn off. Cheese was just perfect in amount and taste but that oil stayed my hand from giving a higher rating.
UPDATE : 
Chicken stroganoff : 4/5 
Chicken steak in mushroom sauce : 3.5/5 
Chocolate souffle : 4/5 
Caramel custard : 3/5 (quantity is inequitable for the price)

This was the first time i visited this place. The ambience is great. The staffs extremely cooperative. I did not like the lights set over the tables as it was too low and my friend almost banged his head. We ordered warm chicken salad. It was a tasty but a bit heavy with slight extra oil. We ordered mojito and it was good. I liked the serving. In the main dish we had a burmese cuisine kow seuy. It was tasty and not that expensive.

This place has got a nice ambiance. The service and the quality of the food is really good. But,the quantity of the food is really low. I ordered one Chef's Special Lamb which costed me 315+tax. The quantity expected was the same as the sizzlers or chelow kabab of Peter Cat but it was a bit disappointing and I had to order another one.

ps-I might again go there and try other dishes as the foods are really tasty as I already stated above.

Visited the place with a group of friends for a dineout after a messy day.
The ambience is perfect to relax you (though I can't suggest the place for a date, as Kolkata have many other good places for couple diner). The service providers were really good and friendly. We had a great fun night.
Now coming to the food, we initially started with light drinks (yes, they serve alcohol). Then the following items:
1. Fish finger: Taste was really good. The dip provided along with it was really good. We even asked for an extra dip as it was so tasty.
2. Chicken Lasagna: Awwwww great delight to my taste buds. But initially they forgot that we placed a order for it.
3. Chicken Paprika: Very spicy, delicacy with a lot of veggies and rice.
4. Chicken Steak: Savour your tongue with soft chickens.
5. Chicken Mexicana: This dish in particular I did not like, may be it is not meant for me.
6. Devil's Crab: It tastes great. But I found more of cheesy mix than the crab itself.
7. Club Sandwich: Hasn't tasted it but bacon came with it was good but nothing extra ordinary.
Overall the experience was really good, would again visit the place some day soon.
(Note: We paid around 6500 bucks for all the fun described above ;) )

I visited One Step Up to celebrate my cousin's birthday. It is located beside Flury's and is very easy to spot. The decor was sophisticated with dim lights, and the staff was well mannered. Now coming to the food. We had ordered - 1) Non veg kebab platter : this was heaven on earth! No words to describe the taste. 2) Chicken Tetrazzini : yum, yet again. 3) Chicken Stroganoff : well presented and amazing to taste. However I wish they would increase their quantity a bit more. The pocket pinch was something around 2k. Amazing experience!

This review comes rather late, well almost 4 months after I dined there during the Pujas.
Well it was almost midnight, and me and my friend were struggling to walk with our weary feet when we decided that we should finally have our dinner. All the places at Park Street were closed, with the exception of One Step Up, and we happily stepped in.
Our meal started with the Mixed kebab platter, which was really good. The chicken pieces were moist and juicy with a brilliant marinade and so were the fish which crumbled at the touch of fork. The prawns were big and juicy.
We ordered for Spaghetti Bolognese and Spaghetti Carbonara for the mains, and even though the Bolognese was brilliant, the Carbonara wasn't all that good. I felt that they didn't get the Carbonara sauce right, which is meant to be made with egg yolks. I found the sauce too floury and white and with no hint of egg yolk. They definitely need to work on that Carbonara sauce.
The decor has been kept to a minimum and the service was prompt and attentive even at 12 am in the night.
This place serves decent, honest food at good prices.

If you crave continental, this place should be on your list. ¬†Comparatively reasonable than other joints that serve continental dishes, their fish items are mouth watering. I had the fish fingers and grilled fish in garlic butter sauce, the fish was so fresh and tender. My friend had tandoori chicken and I don't remember finding tandoori chicken so soft and juicy before, at any restaurant. Waiters are extremely courteous and service is really swift. I will definitely go back for the grilled fish and fish fingers.

Date of Visit : 15/10/2015

Location : Opposite to bar-b-q park street.

Cuisine : Continental¬†

Decor : Simple but elegant

Staff & Service : I was well greeted to escorted to my table. Staffs are well trained. Service was prompt.

Food Ordered : Veg Khowsuey & Fresh Lime Soda

Description : I was craving for Veg Khowsuey for a long time. It had an hour between 2 meeting of mine. So finally decided to visit this place as a friend of mine recommended this place for khowsuey. The dish was well presented. It had a large bowl of curry made of coconut milk having few exotic vegetables. It was served with fried onions, wai wai, lemons, corriander leaves etc. It was like heaven for me. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Quantity is good for one person.
Overall a must visit place. Will come again to try other items on menu.

Looking for a fun filling and stomach filling lazy weekend afternoon? You have to be at one step,up! Located right beside flurys on,park street, the outlet speaks of colours and is very cosy. Perfect to be at with a group of friends. Though there are certain problems regarding the menu which might confuse the person. The non vegetarian section is denoted by the colour green and vegetarian by red which almost made me order something completely wrong for my vegetarian friend. The must try here is the chicken A La Kieve and the paneer shaslik. The chicken has butter which overflows when cut into half and has the great strong garlic flavour that keeps lingering in the mouth for a long time. All food to be gulped down with a pjnt of beer to make ur day

A superb eat out place. Nice and cosy decor. We ordered assorted nonveg kebabs, fake manhattan, fruit punch, moroccan chicken and chicken tetrazini. The serving quantity of one dish is just enough for one person. The assorted kebab platter included a single type of 2 servings of fish,prawn,chicken and mutton kebab. The variety of flavours presented in the choice of kebabs makes it a "must-have". Chicken tetrazini is the fewl good dish with the cheese topping and sphagetti mushroom and plenty chicken baked in white sauce that leaves you feeling contented. Moroccan chicken was the surprise of the lot. Sweet smoky and a bit tangy rice with grilled chicken breasts and a light salad with pickled cucumbers is a perfect combo. The chicken was soft and tender and the rice perfectly cooked. However the drink wer another story. Tasted like just fruit juices put together. But then again we didn't go for the drinks, we went for the food and it was satisfying.

One Step Up serves Continental as well as Indian cuisine. Located in Park Street, it faces stiff competition from Peter Cat and Mocambo. However, it won't disappoint you. It is almost as good as the above mentioned Legendary restaurants.
We ordered Chicken Fingers, Chicken Paprika and Chicken Tetrazzini. Chicken fingers weren't very impressive. But Chicken Paprika and Tetrazzini were excellent. The Chicken Paprika had a lot of chicken cubes in red spicy sauce containing chilly flakes served with boiled vegetables and butter garlic rice. The chicken tetrazzini was chicken pasta in white sauce baked and served. Portions were generous and the service was good. The restaurant is highly recommended.

Had gone to this restaurant with high expectations but was slightly disappointed with the experience. The particular mocktails that we wanted was unavailable. I had Thai green curry which was served with steamed rice. The Thai green curry was ok.The steamed rice accompanying it was slightly under done.*not expected in a restaurant of this type*. My friend who had chicken tetrazzini said it was good. The place was full of diners but the service was non-existent....they just left the dishes on the table and didn't bother to come check after that.

The Ambience is top notch.Very soothing.
Now we ordered Devilled Crab and Chicken Tetrazinni.The food was mind blowing.I mean the crab tasted awesome and looked even better.The tetrazinni was amazing.Cheese Cheese and lots and lots of Cheese with generous chicken pieces and mushrooms.
The stewards have great knowledge about the food and explain things really nicdely and the  staff here was very courteous.

Had visited this small elegant restaurant¬†on a Saturday, and that too, during the Christmas holidays. No queue whatsoever. Service was prompt at the beginning¬†but we had to¬†wait for¬†our food and drinks at a latter stage as it started crowding up.

Food order included Butter naan, Lachha Paratha, ¬†Methi Paratha, Mutton Dopyaja, and Chicken Reshmi Masala. Everything was tender and delicious, specially the chicken.

Drinks included 6 pegs of BP(Large), and the¬†bill was around 4K, which is pretty decent.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant :)

Located just opposite to olypub.. the place serves continental and Indian cuisine,,
ambience is good...service is swift and prompt...
however NOT RECOMMENDED if YOU r dining in park street
if this place was located elsewhere...one could have given it a try..but if you r in park street there is absolutely no sense dining here..
the prices are high for absolutely no reason..
the food both quality and quantity wise is average
ordered 1)veg au gratin..the white creamy sauce was good but most of the ¬†veggies were raw..yes raw !
2)HERBY CHICKEN ¬†FINGER was very very average...

the place itself is very average ..not worth a try in PARK STREET..
if you are park street please visit other diners ..
the above 2.5 is for the good ambience..

Visited this place on Christmas evening for a quick bite with the girlfriend. Tried to experiment a bit. Placed a weird order- Chilli cheese bread, chicken kebab and margaritas. The bread was not as expected to be honest. The kebab was as the kebab should have been- delicious. Lastly, it was the first time I was having a margarita, and I loved it.¬†

The place is situated just opposite Oly Pub. Nice ambiance, no over-furnishing (a bit under tbh), prices a bit on the steeper side, but quite prompt service. Looking forward to visiting the place again for a better evaluation of things in the near future.

I like One Step Up. Been here a a couple of times, would like to visit more often. The food is real nice, their continental is right up there with Mocambo and Peter Cat. I like the Chicken Paprika, it's spicy and very well done. Apart from that, the Tetrazzini is excellent and the Chicken Ceciliana highly recommended. All items, including liquor is very reasonable priced.

The ambience is soothing and the lighting is very comforting. Waiters are soft spoken and polite. And the food is above par. Slow music adds to the effects.  Nice place if you want to ignore the city rush and have good continental food in peace.

Been there previously quite many times..but it has really detoriated...continental fare comes no where near mocambo...ambience nt worth mentioning..but the worst part is their service and customer behaviour..we were really frustrated in our last 3 visits and finally headed to some other joint in park street..zero customer satisfaction..i think it should be rated in negative..nt at all recommended...

I m a lover of their grilled prawns in lemon butter sauce, the chicken tetrazzini, prawn cocktail. Also the grilled fish sizzler . They keep the recipes authentic and the ingredients fresh . The taste is of supreme quality and uncompromised. Also the waiters trying to understand your taste and suggesting dishes accordingly is also appreciable. Only the seating arrangement I feel is not upto the mark ... Definitely a good find !!!!

I go here whenever I feel like hogging delicious continental food. Please do try their Moroccan Chicken and any of the Bhetki preparations. Also, the starters are pretty great like tuna on toast or Herby Chicken Fingers or the salads. Love the atmoshphere, the view of Park street and the comfort food that you get here.

A perfect hangout joint with drinks and amazing comfort food. And by comfort food, I mean cheeeeeese, lots of cheese. 

I am a regular to One Step Up and keep going with my friends. A lot of people haven't heard much about this place and it's a bit surprising to me considering how awesome the place is. 

The restaurant itself consists of 2 floors but both the floors are a bit on the smaller side. 

The Drinks menu is a pretty healthy one with lots of options to choose from. 

But the highlight of this place for me has to be the food. And when I said comfort food above, I wasn't kidding. The continental pasta and spaghetti dishes are just yum and very very filling. One dish itself is more than enough for one person. The taste of the dishes are spot on and exactly how pasta and spaghetti should always be done. And the Garlic Bread tastes amazing too. 

The Indian menu is good but nothing to rave about. But when I come to One Step Up, it's never the Indian side of the menu for me. It's only the Continental dishes one would die for. And they are worth enjoying every moment for. *dips self in cheese*

I came to this place for lunch with office teammates. We had initially booked the 1st floir of the restaurant as there were around 20 people. The management helped out in arranging a big table for us. The place was quite clean enough, the waiters were friendly, they did suggest some good options from the menu. So we had ordered around 15-16 different dishes and was lucky to bite in every plate. So over all food tasted pretty nice. Won't burn a whole in the pocket. My personal favorite us smoked fish in butter and pepper. It was yum. Do try it.

Located on the opposite foot of barbeque in Park Street, One Step Up was a great visit today.
We were a group of 8 and we ordered for the following:
1)Paneer Tikka: Scrumptious is the word, one of the best I have had #recommended
2) Crispy Chilli babycorn which was nice
3) Pizza paprika which was delicious, personally loved the thin crust!
4) Kali Dal which was a star dish, actually slow cooked lentils in buttery goodness! #recommended
5) Dum Aloo prepared in a tangy gravy #recommended
6) Paneer butter masala which was nice but could have been better.
7) For breads there was nan, masala kulcha, garlic nan.
8) For drinks we kept it simple with fresh lime sweet and a few beers.
9) For dessert there was brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce which was tasty.

The food was overall very good and the portions are good enough for 3 people per portion.

The service is a big plus! I am blown over by the warmth in the hospitality and the super prompt service. The staff is well versed and experienced and very friendly. An additional point for that.

As I call it " park street pricing" the place isn't cheap noe expensive, moderately priced.

We paid around 5k for our evening and it was totally worth it.

Will visit soon to sample the continental fare.
Cheers!

We went there only because there was a one hour waiting outside Peter Cat.
Ordered as per Zomato Reviews.
Baked Crab-good. But no comparison to Mocambo's devil crab
Bhetki Diana- Poor Mocambo ripoff
Caesar Salad: authentic. 
Pasta: average.
Overall, one step up seems like a poor cousin of Mocambo. Recommended only if Mocambo, Marco Polo and Peter Cat are full

One step up is located opposite to Bar-B-Q, just after the Flurys. One of the very good continental restaurant. They serve indian, continental, with various dishes. I loved the grilled chicken and cheese sandwich, Maybe the best I had till date. Coffee with ice cream, though a bit more sweet which I like personally. The chello kabab is average, Peter cat being just beside, they can't give a competition to this dish, though worth mentioning. Burger and sandwich are really good. Chicken ala kiev, chicken stroganoff are good. Service and ambience is nice. Overall a good experience.

I've heard about OSU and decided to step in yesterday while walking down the Middleton row.

The ambience was just fine. The Ac wasn't working properly, the dinings are not so well finished. Lights are okay and staffs are less friendly.

Coming to the back,
I wanted to taste the chicken stroganoff and tetrazzini , 
Since I've tasted them already at strastruck I wanted to taste something different.

The staff suggested me chef's special chicken which was awkwardly named that I forgot.
I checked the menu here to find it out and I saw only two pictures that is hazy totally.
*disappointed *

Coming to the food-

‚Ä¢ The chef's special chicken was filled with paneer and wrapped in cheese cream and spinach, served with saut√©ed veggies, corn , mushroom and potato.
I thought it will taste good but it was a disaster to be precise.
It was all plane , no taste , no salt.
I added spices to it from the table still it was keeping no charm to my tongue.

‚Ä¢ The beer was high chilled. I asked them to get one of room temperature. They said they don't have, thus we've to wait few minutes and open the bottle.
*very much disappointed *

‚Ä¢ That chicken ruined my mood so I ordered hot chocolate brownie with icecream . 
The brownie was so hard to cut ,but thankfully it was nice to eat so i finally chilled myself.

I wish they look after it.

Located beside the iconic Flurry's is one of my favourite places in park Street. This place is not that big, but the food they make is amazing. The place is dimly lit with well mannered staff.
The devil crab is to die for, with crab meat mushrooms and mashed potato used as stuffing, makes you want more. The fish munier is lip-smacking with bhetki fried and cooked in lemongrass and mushroom sauce, and the Chef's special chicken is mind-blowing. It's buffalo cheese wrapped in chicken breast and the latter wrapped with bacon and cooked in a barbeque sauce. This is heavens.
Recommendations: Chicken tetrazzini, Facon du chef, Devil's crab, fish munier, chef's special chicken

One of the best dining experiences I've ever had in my life! I took my wife there for a make up meal after a big fight, and she forgot all about our fight at the end of the meal :).

We started off with the Seafood Chowder soup, which was very good, The soup was warm and creamy, and it had chunks of fish, lobster and crab. I had chowder while I was abroad, and this chowder can stand up to any of them.

For the main course, my wife had Chicken Ala Kiev, which was superb. The chicken was soft and tender and was swimming in melted butter. The whole thing was mounted on a bed of mashed potatoes and veggies. It tasted so good with beer, that I snacked off quite a bit from my wife's plate.

For myself, I had bacon wrapped grilled chicken. There were 2 big chicken breasts, wrapped in bacon with slices of cheese thrown in between, all cooked in a delectable mushroom gravy. The bacon was thick and fat, and the chicken breasts soft and tender, and the melted cheese oozed out as I cut through each of them. Both of these dishes were lip-smacking good, although I would put the Chicken Ala Kiev slightly ahead.

Last but not the least, we had Chocolate Brownies with ice-cream, which were sinfully good.

We both walked out of the restaurant, our stomachs filled with good food and hearts filled with joy, content and happy, and didn't have a fight a month after that. :)

So before i start i need to mention this is a review of my experience 7 years ago when probably the place would have just started.

Every sunday afternoon me and my room mate would have our brunch here. I still remember their chicken stroganoff and mushroom dishes. Me and a friend who was vegetarian would order a dish each and would die finishing it.

Loved the sunlight lit clean ambience as against dark , dingy places in Kolkata. And as far as my memory goes i loved all the dishes i tried.

Onee step up does stand out to be one of the best restaurants in the posh park street area, considering the fact that it is located in close proximity to Peter cat and mocambo, the 2 giants ruling the food business over there. The ambiance is pretty normal, service is okayish, but the food is fantastic.The warm chicken salad and the devilled crab were mouth watering. All of these at a good price. all in all a good experience, 4/5 for me.

Location: Park street. Very easily accessible.
Ambience: Nothing great, simple and good.
Service: The person waiting our table was very efficienct!
Food: Chicken Tetrazinni is simetging you MUST try when you visit this place. Chicken paprika, too, was delicious. Vegetable Stroganoff was a disappointment. And we had ordered another chicken main course which had been cooked in coconut oil. Since our tastebuds are not used to that oil, we could not eat that dish.
So do ask the waiters beforehand about the oil being used!

One of the cheaper options in Park Street, this place serves both Continental and North Indian food. I have ordered only from their Continental section every time I have been there, and the food is quite delicious. It has a simple decor and you can almost always get a table here without waiting.

One Step Up makes an awesome Chicken Tetrazzini. Full of mushrooms and chicken, it is cheesy and comforting. I also like their Veg Paprika and Veg Lasagne. The former consists of rice and diced vegetables in a brown sauce, while the latter will fulfil your cheese cravings. I did not like their Prawn Cocktail. It was too ketchup-e for me. Their Creme Caramel, though not excellent, is decent enough.

With the vegetarian continental dishes priced at around Rs. 270 and the non-vegetarian options around Rs. 300, it wont pinch your pocket much, considering the fact that you are dining at Park Street. A single main course is filling enough for a single person, so you can easily share dishes to get to taste a larger variety.

Went there this Wednesday evening for a quick snack and I fell in love with the interior at once. They made all the corners so cozy with the perfect lighting ambience. I remember appreciating the setting to my friend for quite sometime.
They have a varied menu of which we chose a club sandwich with beacon. The sandwich was really moist inside and dry and butter grilled outside. We loved it for the quality and quantity. 
Next we ordered for a chocolate digitise souffle. We were really excited to have freshly made hot dessert, but to my disappointment, they served us a chocolate mousse that too cold right from the freezer. It was not even a meringue, the way it was made was quite understandable. I really don't know the reason why these retros keep on fooling people writing Italian names and thinking people won't understand and writing a high piece tag beside. There may be almost 80 percent crowd who just come to your shop for the location and good taste food, but please try to be authentic with what you serve and what you call it. The rest 20% are not fools.
Other than that everything else was pretty satisfactory.

We came across this hidden gem of Park Street accidentally. The big ones refused us a quick entry, being a weekend afternoon, every restaurant was crowded and we were really hungry. And then we hit upon this place. We discovered that they serve you with excellent continental dishes. We had Devilled Crab and Checken Lasagna, both were simply superb. The fish fingers were just okay. Staffs were very helpful and we also had a chance to sit on their first floor window-side table, the table with the best view. Price was moderate, nothing exceptional. Loved it!!

We thought trying something other than the usual so we went there.
The ambience is nothing wow but fine.
We ordered gratin & stroganoff.
Somehow I found the quality of food to be average but stroganoff was good to taste so one more point for the same.
Since we had some occasion back home so I had to keep space in stomach & hey light lunch here was not a bad idea though.

I have been to One Step Up twice before. They serve very good north Indian and continental which I have tried. The seating and decor is more like a cafe and sometimes may seem a tad noisy. This time when we want, we ordered for chilli baby corn which was pretty good. In main course we ordered for Paneer Shaslik ( some rice preparation with paneer) but it was not very good. There was too much ketchup in it. But I will say its a good place otherwise.

A cozy place offering park street continental. Yes what I meant if the choice lies between fried fish, bake, grill. The food is good but a little overwhelming,  don't really appreciate if a cheese sauce over does the fish itself. The fish, seafood and meat are very fresh. It's a good option if u have had enough of mocambo and peter cat.  Prices are fine for a park street restaurant.  Recommended if you like indulging in cheese n butter. Special recommendation for fish dishes.

The Chef's Special Chicken was heavenly with cheese coming out from the chicken. The Chicken Paprika was equally good and was more than satisfying. I would love to visit again and try out the other specials dishes.

It was last year when I was invited by a colleague and his client for a treat at Peter Cat. I was immediately interested as I love their Prawn cocktail. But it was a Saturday evening, and so we three did not have any place there. We turned to this outlet for help. I was a bit disappointed that I could not taste prawn cocktail which I had set my heart upon.  
It was a small but cosy joint. I took an immediate liking to this place. The staff were courteous and guided us to a comfortable corner from where we could see the busy life not very down below.
When I opened the menu card, I saw the item prawn cocktail there and ordered them. It was not less delicious than the one I had at Peter Cat. I loved it, and my wish was fulfilled. Other food that we had was chicken tetrazzini, Moroccan chicken and caramel pudding. I loved tetrazzini. Moroccan chicken I don't remember being anything extraordinary. I loved caramel pudding. 
It was a pity that my companions did not savour the food as I did as they were not accustomed to continental food. They just went there since it could accommodate them. As you know, if the company is not good, you won't be able to enjoy any matter. So next time I plan to go there alone/with a company of my taste and enjoy.

A modern diner serving Continental, doesnt offer Beef , which is plain Sad. Had their Chef Special Chicken, which was beautifully made.. With a thick cheesy layer inside the Chicken breast. The saut√©d veggies were perfectly boiled and served warm. Never have I ever given much attention to these veggies but this was worth mentioning. I am a big fan of their Ala kiev which I had had a few years ago, I strongly recommend anyone looking for a moderately priced conti meal visit this place. Try the Ala Kiev or the Fish Mauriene or however that dish is spelt. :p

The neatly done decor with decent ambiance will please you instantly. Good food with many unique dishes, but not so wide spread on offering, this pure continental outlet goes deep on pocket when compared to the cuisines offered.
their chicken paprikana, chicken facon du - chefy, chicken mexicana are certainly worth trying.

A small diner on Park street with limited seating across the ground and first floors. Bright airy place that aims to serve continental cuisine (whatever that means). Limited options for vegetarians but otherwise not a bad place to visit for a casual lunch. Not great service though.

We'd been to One Step Up mid week for a quick early dinner and catching up with friends. Those on the ordered list were Chicken Ala Kiev, Chicken Tetrazzini, Moroccan Chicken and Caramel Pudding.
Chicken Ala Kiev was beautifully done. The moment when the melted butter oozes out of the Kiev shell, it's an ecstatic time to behold the expressions on others' faces!! The mashed potato somehow seemed better than the chicken itself.
Moroccan Chicken was an average tasting dish. Given the rich description on the menu about an exotic mix of spices, I felt the spices to be missing both in quantity and flavour.
Chicken Tetrazzini was a burst of cheese overload and an absolute delight for the cheese lovers!
Caramel pudding was average, just plain old caramel pudding which I felt could've been made more tasty with caramel itself.
However, the saddest part was that we were forced to pay the bill even before we were ready for it.
I don't think I'd like to go back to such a place where the staff simply want to keep filling in tables by driving out prior diners.

One step up located right on Park street Opposite Mc Donald's. Recently its been renovated. Nice place to go on a weekend with family n friends. If you have to choose one out of many restaurants in Parkstreet, then One step up could be in ur list. Very Good food, average servicing standards, not too many options in the Menu.

Ambience is good but a little congested. Well located in the heart of the city - park street. Service - warm and friendly 
Food - above average but not great 
We ordered chicken tetrazinni, imperial chicken and chicken stroganoff all of which were good but missed a wow element in terms of chicken juiciness, texture and flavour.

The restaurant is a step up in terms of delicious Italian and Mexican food in the city.
My favourite being the Spinach and Corn cannellonis, the Kebab platter is a palatable delight!!
Its not very grand but cozy and not too much noise. A decent meal at a quiet restaurant with your date. The North indian could be better, but its worth the prices.

An old favourite - turns more delicious with every visit! I have had the continental nosh in some of the best names in the city, but for some uncanny reason One Step Up does magic time and again - I think it's the perfectly cooked flesh mysteriously fused with everything delish :-) If you are an ambience crazy person, you'll perhaps expect more furnish but if your hungry stomach craves chips and chocolate and cheese and chicken, this is it for you! Go stuff yourself ;-)

Rode here at parkstreet for petercat but ended up at one step up. Not a bad choice I would say. The fish fingers were almost like a meal in itself instead of being a starter. Didn't like the white sauce though. Ended the dinner in a good note..the chefs special with chicken breast was awesome. It is indeed a good value for money..the ambience is comfortable. Not over the top. Just right for me.

Definitely not the best place to try continental in park street, there are far better option nearby. Went there one afternoon with high expectations after reading all the reviews in zomato but was disappointed. Started off with the "devilled crab" which was good, but I have had better. For main we had the "chicken falcondu chef" and "chef's special chicken". The falcon du chef was underseasoned and tasted bland after a while. The chef's special was better, but didn't have any wow factor. The portions however were huge and the service surprisingly quick..we were infact served the main even before we could finish off with the starter! For desserts had the chocolate truffle, which again was nothing to write home about. 
Overall, a disappointing experience. :(

Disappointing experience both in terms of food as well service. You place an order, after which no one asks how's the food or if I need something else. When I said there are too much peeled skin of vegetables in the food. The person kept saying that's how chicken Thai green curry is cooked. Taste was ok, but it was embarrassing to keep taking pieces of peeled veggies from mouth in a dining table. Spragetti bolognase was like boiled noodles and minced meat. Extremely dissapointing.

I have been to this place thrice. But the recent visit was for my friend's birthday treat.
Location- easy to find! its located on the foot of flurys and 2/3 restaurant ahead of it. One might miss it..so look up and keep walking :D

Ambiance- Very casual. The staff are courteous but the delivery is slow.They have some great collections of wine. Wine lovers will definitely love this place.

Food- We have previously ordered, Chicken Sashlik ( Butter rice,tomato,capsicum,ad chicken kebab) This time we tried there Chicken steak. It was Awesome! The chicken was cooked well, The barbecued sauce tasted delicious,it was served with mushroom and a poached egg and some potato. A filling dish.

Price- Not that high! though a pint of beer costed way too much that it normally should. 1000 for two.

Pros- The ambiance, the variety in their menu and rare collection of wines.
cons-The servers should take the initiative to help the foodies understand what tastes good and not just describe it in one line under the name in the menu card.

One Step Up is a nice change in Park Street, in the land of Chinese and Indian food. This restaurant serves Continental and how!¬†
I love the casual-yet-sophisticated ambiance inside. The decor is very smoothly done, gives you a very cozy feeling.¬†
We went on a day when there was some crowd because of the weekend rush and so the service wasn't the best. I am assuming things get better on other days.
Coming to the food, One Step Up operates strictly on the principle of good food. That is their only publicity.¬†
We tried the Chicken steak, a sumptuous meal for one. We also opted for the Chef's Special Chicken and Chicken Facon du Chef. I especially loved the last one, it had a very creamy texture.¬†

I am definitely going back there again!

Chicken Paprika was not only tasty but had a certain bit of zing to it. The chicken pieces were not only adequately cooked but the prep up with the vegetables only gave it a more savory taste. Spicy as it was enlisted yet easy on the first timers taste buds. We also tried out Chicken Tetrazzini. Of all of its characteristics, white sauce in which the pasta was dipped I'm was simply yummy. Plus, the ambiance is a bit quirky and that too in a good way. The interrogation lamp only makes the meetings all the more personal in appearance.

When you are thinking of visiting a new place in park street and not the regulars and thinking where to bet your money on, look no further beyond one step up. Quality food without any eyebrow-rasing price and chilled out ambiance will surely have your lunch/dinner rocking! Try there grilled chicken or their devilled crab or their chicken a-la-kiev and you won't be dissapointed. I also order their grilled fish for its sheer quantity and quality of fish served. I have also tasted and their Herby chicken fingers and pasta and I would gladly recommend to you guys as well. It's a place which falls above the genre of 'safe bet'. Try out.

Visited this place only yesterday.  The resto is quite spacious, the decor minimalistic and sophisticated. Ordered Chicken Salad with Herbs and Spaghetti Oglio Alio.  The chicken salad was rather delectable and filling with succulent, delicious chicken strips and an assortment of fresh veggies in a refreshing dressing.  The spaghetti could've been better, they could have definitely been more generous with the portion. Service is prompt and nice.  However, the place could do with some music.   Looking forward to visiting this place more and trying out the other dishes on the menu.

" Things often may not live upto your high expectations."
I have been reading the reviews of this place for weeks now. Such good reviews and high ratings made me more eager to try it out. Today was the day.
I have to compliment on their quick,clean and professional service. Staffs are extremely warm and welcoming.
But i got nothing to praise after that. The place is dull. Please light it up. Add some spice . comparing to all the restros nearby you have got to get on the track.
Food we ordered- herby chicken fingers, chicken tetrazzini and Chicken falcon du chef.
Herby chicken came in good 9 pieces chicken fingers with french fries . i really liked their sauce..
Chicken terazzini was excellent quantity wise but average tastewise. Nothing extraordinary. I have had better.
Chicken falcon du chef was something new. I enjoyed it, But after sometime it felt blunt to the tastebuds.
Considering all the reviews that i have seen , maybe today was not the day. Will try again some other time maybe.
Thankyou for the warm welcome and goodbye gatekeeper. We like you the best! :)

Very bad food and even worse service.. Had ordered fish which was rubbery and tasteless.. Then ordered khao suey.. The noodles portion was minuscule as compared to the gravy portion and when the management was asked they started fighting to justify their stand... What's even worse is that the dish wasn't even close to being complete in the ingredients.. It lacked so many of the accompaniments and when mentioned to the management they said they don't serve all that.. Why keep a dish on the menu when you don't know how it's made?

In search of European food I landed here at one step up with one of my foodie friend, it was a plan to visit Mocambo but other suggested by zomato gave the option of this restaurant.
The Ambience at first look was not that great but it was well maintained and clean.
Visited here for lunch and  ordered traditional ceaser salad, chicken mexicana and lamb lasagna and some beverages.
Food at first glance looked good and colour, texture, aroma, flavor everything was at their place. 
Lamb lasagna was excellent, it was mouth melting and bolognese was the hero of the entire meal and the lasagna sheet was also well cooked.
Chicken in mexicana was slightly over done.
Ceaser dressing was low on salt but it was how it should be. 
What made the difference was their experienced service staff....excellent service.
I would definitely come back for the food its a place to hang out with friends and its open when all the other restaurants in park Street area are shut after lunch.
If anyone looking for good food then this is the place..!!!!!!!

Now this review was long overdue.
It was chaturthi, last year, we'd shopped for the better part of the day and ravenously hungry, I decided to step in here, lured by the fact that the crowd was much lesser than the others in its area.
It was dimly lit, slightly smoky, and very cosy. And they had rice lights around the glass panels. And they were playing Beatles. It looked like I'd stepped in a scene from Anjan Dutt's movies depicting Park Street. It was just the ambience one could lose themselves on a drink.
The stewards were cordial, well behaved, and they gave excellent suggestions. Dad went for a Chivas Royale, while i chose Absolut as my poison. Immediately spiced cheeselings with the drinks were put on the table as we ordered the food as the steward suggested-a fish paprika for me, and Prawn Butter Masala for him.
It didn't take them more than 12 minutes to put the food on the table....good job there! The waiters were discreet, yet polite. Keeping an eye to whatever we may need, they let us be. Wasting no time, I dug in.
The fish paprika was brilliant, a homey, mildly spicy brown sauce over custard tender fish and perfectly al dente vegetables. It also had a portion of herbed rice, the perfect accoutrement, and I was content.
The prawn butter masala was good, but didn't quite match up to my paprika--the prawn was just a bit overcooked, the sauce a tad too buttery. But it was good, I say.
I didn't want to leave without having a tutti frutti...something I loved l since......i don't remember. Here it was just the standard, but generous, so much that I'd to share because I was too full. Our bill came to a modest 1.2k, affordable enough for two people absolutely bursting at the seams.
I love you, One Step Up, if only for the fish paprika.
P.S. I really would agree with reviews here complaining that the restaurant doesn't feel like one outside. It really doesn't. For years, I passed by it to other eateries and thought this to be a book shop or furniture store. Big downer there!

This was my second visit to this place, which has by now become famous for its affordable continental fare. We decided to drop by here for lunch before catching a movie. For starters, we ordered Traditional Caesar Salad which was quite fresh and well done, and had the perfect amount for three people. We were eager to try out their house special cocktails, so we ordered Mai Tai and Volcano, both rum based drinks. In addition, we ordered Virgin Blue Mojito.¬†
For main course, we took three dishes. 1. Chicken Tetrazzinni which is complete with cheesy goodness, though a bit on the heavy side. 2. Fish Diana, another delicious preparation which is cooked in their own special sauce. 3. Fish Meuniere, the one I liked the most was basically crispy fried fish fillet with cheese. I loved the baked potatoes which they gave as accompaniments with the last two dishes.
The waiters are very friendly and helpful. And the ambience is good. But I think they should try making the seating arrangements a bit more comfortable by adding more sofas.

Four of us went there on a Saturday evening and started our food journey with seafood chowder soup,then came deviled crab and herby chicken fingers which were followed by chef's special lamb,lamb lasagna,chicken tetrazzini and chicken ala kiev. 
All of the dishes were lip-smackingly great and I thoroughly loved them all. However, the drinks were not upto the mark. 
Will recommend this place to anyone in search of great continental food.

Coming to main course, chef's special chicken facon du chef is definitely worth trying... Chicken Tetrazzini also is good

Visited this place on a Saturday afternoon. It was relatively empty for weekends. But then ¬†the tables did ultimately fill up as time lapsed. I played safe and ordered the Chicken Stroganoff. It was quite good. The portion enough for two moderately hungry soul. Can't wait to try the other chicken and fish on their menu!
The staff were good although a but over eager. I felt they rushed us a bit, appearing within minutes of being seated to take the order without giving us time to have even gone halfway through the menu, serving the food without asking first whether we preferred to help ourselves and bringing us the bill without even asking for it. I genuinely hope this doesn't happen again because overall the place is good.¬†

I had read in previous reviews that this place is quite frequently overlooked in the area. I can vouch for it. I have walked past it several times without realising it was an eatery. The management could hang a banner or some board jutting out of the wall.

Went to the place last night with a few friends, first thing that I noticed is that it doesn't seem as fancy as many park street joints (not so great first impression). We started with mexican chilly baby corn which was good. Next appetizer paneer fingers, way too salty, 4 of us managed to finish half of it :/ Main course chicken dishes were fine, mexican chicken and another was cheesy spaghetti based. The portions are reasonably sized so no problem there. Good thing about the place is that prices are not too heavy on the pocket, guess they saved up on d√©cor and hence the low prices :P we ordered a few drinks as well. ¬†Major regret is getting too full on other dishes and not ordering the¬†Devilled Crabs. That's a recommended dish at this place and i am not sure¬†i will be going back soon. Overall a very average experience. Go there if u want value for money, food is nice if the chef doesn't¬†accidentally¬†or purposely add extra salt to it :D

Hot piping amazing continental food!
Ordered Chicken stroganoff and chicken paprika. Stroganoff had this creamy white sauce, with chicken, served along with saut√©ed veggies and potatoes and buttered garlic rice. Chicken paprika was wonderful, with mushroom and chicken in a brown tangy gravy, served with rice. The food was served hot, the quantity was really good. The price is okay, conpareitively, as park Street is a costly area. The service was good, and the staff was warm and friendly.

I once visited this place long back and really liked the food. A decent humble placed tucked away amidst the park street chaos. The decor is simple and subtle. The staff is polite and the service is fast. Their continental is worth a shot. Recently i visited One step up again and tried the Chicken Tettrazini and Fish n Chips. Tettrazini was delightful! It had the perfect blend of taste. But fish n chips was a disaster. The fish didn't seem very fresh and the taste was bleak! But I would still love to go back and try the other dishes because other than this one blunder everything else that I've tried here was delicious! I'm rating One Step Up 3.5 with a hope that my next visit would be as delightful as my first.

Visited the place with a few friends from college and we felt a little out of place here. It's a place frequented by more families  (as I observed during my visit) as compared to youngsters, and hence has an ambience according to that. The service was really good. We had the chef's special chicken, which was chicken stuffed with cheese and was amazing. I also tried chicken a la kiev for the first time. I absolutely loved it. The surface was crisp with the meat inside being very soft and perfectly cooked. My friends felt that kolkata has better a la kievs to offer but I loved this one too. The Green Thai curry was tasty too with the perfect balance of coconut and spice.

Quantity wise, the food here may be lacking, however the quality makes up for this one unfortunate drawback (sort of). If asked whether I would ever visit again, I would probably say no because despite not being a big eater, I would need to order 2 portions of an item to be completely full. That effectively doubles the cost per person you would see here on this site, which makes the restaurant a lot more expensive than it should be.

Lined up with other famous continental stops in the food street of calcutta (kolkata) i.e. park street , this restaurant never fails to satisfy my cravings. Some of the dishes one must try out when visiting this place are chicken casalinga , chicken a la kiev and fish items. Their wine collection is also amusing.

Wah! Bas wah! A group of madness enters this place, orders varied choices from menu scaling from strictly veg food, salad, fish ferry fry, red and green Thai cuisines, each of us adamant to try distinct cocktails. Boy, this place left us all satisfied. I repeat, all of us. That's a rare thing to achieve. Hospitality is professional, humble as well as intelligent as the waiters know the ingredients in the dish. Good job indeed.

This is a nice and cozy place in park street. I've been there quite a long back but their continental dishes are top notch. I vividly remember of trying their chicken stroganoff for the first time in my life and the taste was so good that I became a lifelong fan of that dish. It's high time to give another visit to this place.

My friend suggested me this place and thus I first went there during puja. It was lunch time but the place was not that crowded. We went upstairs, took a seat and ordered chicken stroganoff. It was very average. It was puja and I thought I ordered the wrong dish and gave this place another chance recently, but my experience with the food remained same. The food is very average.üòüüòü

This is a little gem for continental foods tucked right beside silver grill in Park Street..Though this place may not be highly rated as Mocambo but it has earned a name for itself by serving quite delicious and authentic continental spread..Coming to the ambiance this place is quite brightly and clolourfully decorated,spread over 2 floors,I would suggest try to get a seat in the upper floor beside the glass window overlooking Park Street..The service is quite prompt and efficient..COming to the food though this place is known for its continental delicacies it actually serves quite a delectable Indian menu as well..Last time we tried Fish Ajwaini Tikka and it was quite delicious..Also Devil Crab taste unique and makes up a quite fulfilling starter..Coming to the mains though their non-veg mains are a bit highly priced ranging from 350/- to 500/- but the portions served are enough for twin sharing..I loved Fish n Chips,Fish Meuniere and Chicken Seciliana served here..Coming to desert this should not be given a miss..Their Chocolate Souffle is undoubtedly quite craftily prepared and almost as good as one you carve for..Overall recommended for a quick,casual meal with friends..Try their cocktails as well..

I have been there only once and One Step up came across to me as a very nice place with good food and a cosy feel. The best thing about One step up is that most of their dishes are platters which are like a whole meal for one person.

We ordered Steamed Rice, Thai Red curry, chicken Tropicana, chicken steak, noodles with chicken (I forgot what the name of the dish was) and tutti fruity for dessert. The Chicken Tropicana, a prawn stuffed chicken dish in a tomato gravy stole the show, while the Thai Red Curry was full of thai spices, tender chicken pieces in a lovely coconut grave. and actually too much for one person to finish. The chicken steak was good too, only the tutti fruity could have been better with a little more syrups and nuts.

The food at One Step Up tastes good, ambiance is average but I would still say its one of the better restaurants of Park Street who actually serve good food and don‚Äôt run just on the basis of their past reputation.

The inside isn't bad, especially if you get a seat by the window on the first floor, overlooking Park Street. The food, was, however bad. It might be because we ordered the wrong things. We ordered Thai. Khow Suey and some other chicken in ¬†red sauce thai curry that tasted horrible. The curry tasted drab, there was a cheesy smell that did not go with the rest of it, and we couldn't wait for the meal to get over.¬†This was the only time I had visited the place and I don't intend on doing so again.

FIRSTLY, IF YOU LOOKING FOR GOOD FOOD AND SERVICE THEN NEVER EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.THEY ARE THE BIGGEST CHEATERS AMONG THE PARK STREET RESTAURANT ESPECIALLY IF YOU ORDER TAKE AWAY.THEY WILL NEVER GIVE THE SIDE DISHES AND THE ACCOMPANIMENTS TO THE MAIN COURSES (WHICH HAPPENED WITH ME NOT ONCE BUT TWICE).THE THIRD AND FOURTH PAGES OF THE MENU HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED BY ZOMATOES,WHICH I WOULD REQUEST THEM TO PROVIDE, THEN I CAN BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT MY REVIEW BECAUSE MOST OF THE ITEMS I ORDERED WERE FROM THE NON VEGETARIAN SECTION.I HAD ORDERED THROUGH A FRIEND WHO HAD GONE TO EAT THERE AND WHEN I RECEIVED THE FOOD I WAS ASTONISHED ...HALF THE ITEMS WERE MISSING.MY FRIEND HAD NOT EVEN CHECKED THINKING SUCH A REPUTED RESTAURANT WOULD NEVER DO THIS.MOREOVER , WHEN I CALLED THE RESTAURANT, THEY WERE VERY INSOLENT AND RUDE.

This is definitely one of those rare places that would see a lot more of me in the coming times.Had been there recently and boy! was it an experience.I did try their chicken tetrazzini which was very good but was sunk in oodles of cheese, which is kind of good but not when you have it without a side-dish.So, a portion of garlic bread is definitely recommended to go with it.But the dish that I can't stop raving about is one of their signature specials, the facon du chef, which was everything a perfect dish ought to be.The chicken was juicy, succulent and very well-cooked.And along with the herby taste of the sauce spread on top, it was a delight to the taste-buds.Do try it.On some other note, although the prices are on the steeper side, the quantity and flavor of the dishes more than make up for your money's worth.A must visit for every zomatian foodie.Go experience some moments of foodgasmic pleasure!

One Step Up is a cool and casual place to have some good beer and great food, served quick!

Well, it is on Park Street so it has to live up to 'a good restaurant' standards so it does! Before I left the city of Joy, I went there with a bunch of friends and had some beer along with some finger foods. I tried Herby Chicken Wings and Stuffed Grilled Mushrooms - both were well cooked and tasted great! Chicken wings are perfect for those who prefer their beer strong, grilled mushrooms too are quite balanced!

I'd love to visit the place again when I am in Kolkata to try other good things they've on the menu!

The interior is not very fancy but it's good..we ordered chicken tetrazinni,fish meuniere and cheese garlic bread...the fish was cooked to perfection...the sauce tasted great...tetrazinni was good as well...
the prices are less than other restaurants in park street...and the food is great as well...so if u are planin to try continental do give this place a try...

Its a two storeyed building. I went with my friend and were asked to sit in the ground floor. We just went for drinks and ordered one chicken tropicana. This dish had two chicken breast pieces stuffed with prawn and mushroom. It was delicious and well cooked. The staff are well behaved. The only problem was they were a bit slow and lighting could be improved. Would like to visit again as the menu had interesting dishes. Chicken tropicana is a must try!

We have been planning on going here for a while now. So when we were trying to find somewhere we didnt go in the Park street area, this place sprung to mind. Ambiance here is quite pleasant. Coming to food, we ordered a plate of Herby Chicken, Chicken facon du chef and Chef's special lamb. Herby chicken had hunky pieces of chicken but I didn't quite like the batter. It was served with a heap of french fries which had perfect crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Chicken facon du chef was two pieces of cheese-filled chicken breast , in a white cheese sauce with spinach and mushrooms. This dish was quite good with cheesy and gooey awesomeness smothered all over. The Chefs special Lamb was also good for the taste buds. The lamb pieces were very juicy and tender. The herb rice served with this was also complementing the lamb very well.
Pricing was a wee bit on the higher side, but it was worth it.

I came to know about this place from zomato itself, and seriously this is a place which can't be ignored. The Risotto is awesome and the stuffed grilled mushroom is also lovely. If I compare it with Mocambo, this is the place which deserves more attention with more varieties of dishes and lesser price. 

The only negative thing about this place is the sitting arrangement which is not as par. 
Overall if you love Italian, please do try One Step Up, you won't regret.

Their continental dishes r amazingly great and loaded with cheeseeeeeeeeeeeee!! And the portions r huge enough to satisfy the appetite of a giant too. They also serve some Indian foods but they are ok, better than a lot of places but not better than their continental dishes for sure.

We started of with the kababs, they were very bad, we had the throw them. Then came the main course. We tried the fish steak, grilled fish and chicken wrapped in bacon. These were pretty good. The food was served in good quantities and prices are reasonable. We didn't like the ambiance much, the place is too small and everything looks very orange. All in all, a nice experience if I ignore the kababs.

It's right next to flurys in park Street. If I remember correctly the name comes from the fact.. When they started they were in the first floor... Then within a short time they took over the ground floor.. Or started the ground floor part.... 

The food is delicious and one of the better continental food places in park Street... The prawn cocktail is good ( though I prefer the peter cat one) .. The grilled belli and the crab is brilliant.... 
Red meat lovers would love the roast lamb. 
The pan grilled or other wise is decent but nothing spectacular.
One thing great about the place is that the quality of the raw materials is top notch... The fish, meat, pawns are fresh and very juicy.
Give it a shot.

One of my favourite restaurants in town for Continental cuisine. 3 of my must-haves here are Chicken tetrazinni, Chicken a la kiev and Chicken stroganoff. The chicken melts in your mouth. Been here with friends, family, and dates :) One step up is equivalent to nostalgia+ awesome food+ great hospitality. The ambience bit could improve though. I found the place a bit stuffy, and over-crowded at times. The menu is a bit over-priced. However, the food makes up for all other shortcomings.

Whenever I think of continental food I only think of one step up! One step up is actually one step up when it comes to continental dishes as compared to the other places in Calcutta. Okay my review might sound cheesy! But I absolutely love their baked pasta dishes, oozing with cheese! Located in Park Street, the Decor hasn't changed in the past ten years. The staff is attentive and the service is quick and efficient. The menu is varied ranging from indian to continental! Be it the devilled crab or the chicken ala Kiev or the veg risotto or even the Indian non veg platter maharaja Ki pasand - this place has something or the other for everyone with different taste buds! Only their dessert section is rather disappointing! 
Can't wait for my next visit!

Recently visited this place and totally loved it. Located at Park Street, this restaurant is usually not crowded but serves amazingly yummy food that you should must try. If you love continental food then this place has to be a must visit place in your list.

Coming to the ambience, it is not great but good enough. The glass panel windows at the front end lets in a lot of natural light which gives this place a happy feeling.

The waiters were very friendly and well versed with the menu. They helped us in deciding our dishes.

Now food, it is undoubtedly yummy. We ordered for Chicken Tetrazzini, Spaghetti Carbonara and Chicken Mexicana. All three of them met our expectations. Spaghetti Carbonara is a must try for all cheese and beef lovers! Dishes had a good and satisfying quantity. Prices are a little cheaper than Mocambo or other popular eatery at Park Street.

This place surely serves one of the best continental food in the city. Surely going back to this place.

Since calcutta is behind as compared to the other metros on the number of restaurants serving authentic continental cuisine, I would rather talk more about the good stuff here. A neat eating place which serves decent conti, one step up can easily accomodate you even on a weekend dinner wherin it's contemporaries are finding hard to tackle it's customers! No not because it serves bad food. Quantity is an issue for sure and it keeps varying every now and then. They serve lovely cheesy Stroganoff, Lasagna and Tetrazzini. Service is prompt and folks are sweet. I wish the ambience could be a tad better than plain jane!!!

Ok so i would not like to go all technical about this place...but in bullets...

ambiance - nothing great,or ostentatious ...the white subtle interiors are not great,but just fine...the seating could have been more comfortable...music is of good taste

service - not really interactive, which is the case with most Kolkata places (excet Chilli's) ... but cordial and not slothish 

food - so there may be other older 'legendary' names in Kolkata when it comes to continental food and this place has been an underdog...but lemme tell u...quantity (which they have reduced over the years) and taste wise...this place is exceptionally nice...the tetrazzini is one of my favorites to which i compare other places with as a benchmark...oozy cheesy chicken mushroom goodness...stroganoff and Chef;s special...although the lasagna did not seem right... value for money...worth ur time !

Nice place, ground floor's little cramped though. As the name suggests, the level up is better. The bar's nicely stocked, decent prices, no hidden shocks in the bill. We had cream of chicken soup (decent, but you can get better), chicken stroganoff (good) and the chef's recommendation chicken. The last item was really unique, with soft boneless chicken stuffed with cheese and wrapped in roasted bacon. The sauce was nice, but the mashed potatoes could have had some butter and salt. Overall a good experience with decent crisp service.

Add up to the above, experience on 22Aug2015. Clean crisp airy well lighted ambience (first floor). Service as usual was impeccable, attentive but not intrusive. Had cream of chicken soup (ok), fish and chips (excellent) and chicken tetrazinni, which was basically chicken pasta in white sauce. Service is fast and liquor collection is good. Prices are slightly on the higher side (‚Çπ1650 for the above plus 2beers) but food and service worth it.

Went here one evening after work making a sudden plan .. It was not too crowded and the ambience was great . Specially the decors had a geometric touch in it, in a good way.¬† The continental menu was full of variety of items , most of which were unknown to me. A friend suggested me to try 'Fish Florentine' , and I am happy I tried. A very tasty fish item with palak and cheese. 
The location is also perfect , just in the heart of food hub in the city.. Visit this place.. It surely is one step up its competetors .. :D

Although it has been here for a while, it is only recently I've begun to be more appreciative of the fare offered here..
On the four occasions I've been here..the following have stood out the most :
1. Herby Chicken Fingers : The most succulent pieces of chicken, dipped in a thin batter with herbs and deep-fried, so perfectly that when you bite into a piece, you can feel the juice exploding in your mouth. It comes with the perfect tangy dip which only serves to heighten the taste.
2. Fish Diana : Just have it. I want you to be surprised here as to what it is. But just have it. You won't regret it if you love seafood.
3. Chef's Special Chicken : This is an all-time favourite choice and you can never go wrong with chicken breasts, stuffed with cheese, cooked to perfection and served with gravy, mashed and herb-sauteed baby potatoes and boiled vegetables.
4. Chicken Paprika : On bed of rice, tossed with basil and butter, comes diced chicken in a paprika sauce, which isn't overwhelmingly hot or such and served with baby-potatoes and boiled veggies. Wholesome good, filling food.

located alongside flury's and magnolia, this continental eatery is average with good food. we ordered vegetable florentine, chicken tropicana and chicken paprika. okayish tastes. the decor and music can do with an upgrade. also the food can do with some unexpected twists and make it more exciting.

Good food, good location, but the zing was missing! The crispy chilli babycorn seemed double fried, the cannelloni and tetrazzini were way more cheesy than is required and the low walls and ambiance didn't seem fit enough for a restaurant at Park Street! The food and the hospitality were decent, but nothing that would draw me back to One Step Up again - possibly, wouldn't cross my mind unless all other options nearby were crossed off. A definite one-timer at least, they can improve their food by not just making it tasty but also zingy, something that can draw crowds back. Maybe, free wifi or nice ambient music or even a charging point would do the trick of people spending more time at the restaurant. Cheers!

The best restaurant I have ever been to! Splendid food! Thinking of Ala Kiev...damn I can't control myself. I would recommend the people reading this to order it! It is a must! This place...is blissful.
I remember when I went with my family for dinner there and I prepared myself by, literally starving since lunch. So you can imagine how awesome the place is! :D

Located opposite to bbq at park street. The more attractive the outside of the restaurant the inside the story is totally different. Though I was promised a good continental experience but sadly it didn't turn out that way. The food was bland. Service was very satisfactory though. The quantity was pathetic sometimes not even enough for one person. Overall summing it the place need to buck up if they want to give competition to mocambo.

The other day I visited one step up with my sister for lunch ! It is located in the heart of city "park street" ! It is opposite to bar b q! This restaurant holds its speciality in continental cuisine ! 
We started with the cream of mushroom soup which looked healthy and tasty! It also had chunks of mushroom in it and that's why I liked it more! Then we proceeded with Herby fried chicken strips for starters. They served it with fries and a hot chilly sauce! This dish really pissed both of us! It was very bad... it looked like those 10rs pakodas on pur plate!?!! 
However, we ordered chicken stroganoff for main course ! This dish again turned out to be Completely opposite to what we expected! First the dish didn't look quite appealing! The right way to serve is with the rice separately and veggies too! But no! They were all mixed together! It was like a mess! We just tasted and asked them to pack up the rest! This was probably the worst conti experience I have had till now! 
The service is quite good out here! But food not up to the mark! The ambience is average with two floors! Crowd is pretty much okay! Price reasonable! But the main concern which is food is dam horrible! 
I have made that my first and last visit to this restaurant and I'm obviously not going to recommend my friends to try at this place ! 
It was sheer disappointment !

We could only make a short starter-stop here while visiting from Bangalore

But it is a wonderful simple continental place with excellent food, and a very polite service crew. In all my experience, this is the nicest staff I have come across
We loved the fish Diana, fish stuffed with fresh prawns in a white mushroom sauce, as well as the chicken fau du something everyone was talking about.

While I am all for a place that let's the food speak for itself, this place could do with a little ambience upgrade, which would put it in the same league as Mocambo. Something Euro preferably

Good continental food. Portions are small(sometimes inadequate for a single person). Price is ok. most of the non veg dishes are priced at 295rs.¬†Lasagne was the best among what we had. ¬†It was made of minced lamb in tomatoe gravy, very sharp flavours. chicken facon-du-chef was a bit milder and creamy. chicken ala keiv was okayish. chicken mexicana was good. chicken paparika and maharani ka thali wERE worthless. I ll definitly come here again for the lasagne and chicken facon-du-chef . ¬†:)¬†the place can use a rennovation for creating a better ambience which is lacking in here.

Probably one of the most underrated places in Park Street, one step up serves up great continental food. The prices are reasonable and you can choose any dish from the continental main course list and not be disappointed, especially if you're a cheese lover.

The chef's special (chicken wrapped in bacon in a mushroomy creamy sauce) and the tetrazzini ¬†(i'm probably getting the spelling wrong) are two dishes you can never go wrong with.
The staff dont rush you and are polite. overall, a really nice place to go for a relaxed lunch!

Whenever you think continental, think One Step Up. In my opinion, this place is better than Mocambo when it comes to continental delicacies. Its really unfortunate that i have visited this place only once though i hang out at Park Street quite often. Nothing much to say about the ambience and decor which are quite good, but the food is sumptous and the prices are quite reasonable. Chicken ceciliana, fish diana, chicken facon-du-chef deserve special mention among many of the lip smacking dishes they serve. Visit this place for some fine continental food.

I was taken to this restaurant by my partner. It was his farewell dinner, so we wanted a quiet place with good food, ofcourse! Back then I had no idea what this place serves. Now whenever i want some 'GOOD' continental food, i head to one step up. Honestly i havn't tried much of their dishes because i'm in love with their Chicken Facon du Chef. So the innumerable times that I went there, I ordered this particular dish. Its so so so cheesy. I think they put atleast 3 kinds of cheese in the dish. Its basically chicken stuffed with cheese. The portion is big. Its accompanied with sauteed veggies. The gooey gravy-curry thing has spinach and cheese in abundance. A MUST TRY! I have tasted their cream of chicken broth soup (i don't remember the exact name) and also the lamb lasagna. The soup is okayish. The lasagna is too salty for my taste. Couldn't finish it. Price is a bit on the steeper side. The seating arrangement is divided in two levels. Both are good. Waiters are a bit rude at times and at times they are friendly. Maybe moody. LOL! Should visit for one fine dining experience. Cheerie!

I went there with my friends for dinner. We found a table easily but had to wait long enough for the waiter to turn up. We went there because it serves alcohol along with food. We didn't have much food there as their service was really poor.¬†

I would suggest if you don't find any other vacant place in park street, you can visit here.

The menu is quite varied, but priced a bit on the steep side. Portions are huge- enough to be shared by two people (at least). Tried the continental fare. Prawn cocktail was a treat, as it is not readily available on most menus in the city. The mains were delicious, though very rich and all the cheese made it heavy. The lobster thermidore was particularly well-cooked. Staff are very courteous and efficient. A good dining experience overall.

It's a nice little pub, or should I say cafe? I think it is one of the few places which offer both alcoholic beverages and coffee/tea, under the same roof. I had their cold coffee, which was very good. Ambience is also nice. I won't say it's a must visit in Kolkata, but it's a good place to while away a few hours with friends.

Seating ¬†- 2/5 pretty uncomfortable
Service - 3.5/5 Just average nothing great or too bad
Food - We had continental (3 of us ) while the other 3 (including me ) had Indian.¬†
Continental Food -
Friends thought it was good not great ( i don't like continental food so didn't like it when i tasted ) - based on friends' review - 3/5
Indian Food - ¬†¬†
1.5/5 (Really Bland , starters to main course all was below average not worth reviewing in any detail , highly disappointing ).
Continental food is the only good thing there . Wouldn't suggest anyone to go there to have Indian Food.
P.S. Virgin Pinacolada was good .

This restaurant "One Step Up" gets its name from internal construction of the restaurant (The restaurant is divided into two sections : The upper and the lower section respectively. The upper section is connected to the lower section by a flight of stairs and so hence the name). It is very easy to locate the restaurant as it is located in the centre of Park Street. The restaurant has opted for a very cafe style look and feel, with minimal furniture and more space. The decor showcases a "no fuss" display. Music played here consists of slow paced melodious English classics and goes very well with the look and feel of the place. It is a multi cuisine restaurant. The food is good, but not mind blowing. The cutlery and crockery used has been kept simple. The staff is quite friendly, helpful and affectionate. The pricing is not appropriate. All in all the restaurant is a very nice place to visit if you a person who likes to laze around and relish his/her food and beverage and like to soak in the atmosphere.

The sitting arrangements are in two levels, ground floor and first floor. The tables were more or less arranged in a way that there are more tables than the capacity, still it was very comfortable while dining. However, the services were a bit bad. We had to call out at least twice so that someone would come to attend us. The food was really really good, just that I ordered the Chef's speciality chicken in which bacon is also there(as written in the menu), but I did not get any taste of the bacon. Otherwise , the food was really good.

The thing about this place is - you would miss it very easily within the hustle and bustle of park street. A very quiet place with simple decor from both outside and inside, so understated that it is overlooked. However if you want good continental at a quiet place with few friends and catchup, you got it right. Tasteful food overall with special mention of chicken tetrazzini, chicken paprika, devilled crab. "OSU" is an underdog and is happy about it. A place with its own dedicated customer base, try it out and you would like its simplicity and the delectable dishes.

Nice place to hang out with friends or may be some special friend over some continental food. Devilled crab and Chicken papricana were very good. Herby chicken fingers and Fish steak were the runners up one can say.Spaghetti a la bolognaise, Lamb lasaigna and Chef's special chicken were good to start off the main course but too much cheese could saturate your satiety centre early if you aren't much of a cheese-person..

This restaurant is located beside "Magnolia" and just opposite "Bar-b-q" in park street. The sitting arrangement is dispersed into two layers, both on ground floor and first floor. The decor is impressive enough without adding up any kind of fuss. The ambience is quite chique as well. They mostly serve both continental and north Indian cuisines. I have been to this outlet a lot of times and specially their "Mexican" offerings are among their best and really worth cherishing, other offerings worth mentioning over here are their "chicken tettrazinni"( perfect balance and blend of the ingredients and the quantity of chicken arw more than sufficient). The service of the waiters are efficient and smooth. The pricings are reasonable enough for a restaurant offering such versatile cuisines. I completely loved their "Mexican" dishes, especially their signature baked potatoes, beans, carrots and beans served with their dishes has a distinctive taste itself which is a treat for your palette. This restaurant can easily compete with any major luxurious hotels anytime as far as their continental offerings are concerned. If you dine out in this area and wanna try out some place new and versatile then this joint is really worth paying a visit.

This place, I've been a couple of times the last one being the last Saturday. Located just opposite to oasis n beside magnolia it is a nice place to try continental food items. I've never tried their Indian though. Nothing much look wise, simple, charming, me n my friends got a place upstairs. We were three persons n we ordered an Herby chicken fingers n 2 devilled crab as starters along with our respective drinks. The chicken fingers are nice, tender, juicy pieces of chicken marinated n fried in a thin coat of some herbs, just perfect. The devilled crab, their signature dish as some of my friends suggested was nice, handsome looking 2 pieces of shell broken crabs pasted with a thick layer of cheese n other artery clogging dairy products (donno their name) served on a  layer of mashed potatoes with some herbs n unwanted veggies :) . It tastes tender, it melts in ur mouth as it is mostly cheese mixed with delicate flesh of the crab n the best thing u can just scoop n eat it without problem. If u dont like much cheese avoid this dish, my friends hated it. Then we ordered 2plates of chicken paprika one served with spaghetti n another with rice n one chicken alakiev. The paprika is perhaps the only spicy recipe in the continental section. Prepared in hot brown sauce,with lots of tender meaty pieces of meat n unwanted veggies (I am a meatlover!!!)   n lil bit of spaghetti or rice whichever u want, is awesome. Spicy, tangy, hot n wholesome. The alakiev is on the other hand is a fried cone shaped, stuffed with ample chicken n other things n laden in molten (horror, for me, love for others) butter. My friend seemed to hate it. But that's wat he ordered.  At the end I was satisfied with the food, though not friends, well they didn't know anything about their orders.
PS. cost us 3k. I felt OK. Without drinks for 2ppl who loves to eat n can 'eat' will cost about 1200.

Guys look up its just 1 Step up and you are there. I went there last year during Durga puja. Nicely decorated with lights. Nice soothing ambience. A place for mouth watering continental. What made me smile was the presence of Blue Lagoon. Nicely made. To some, it might seem little costly, however, I felt it was worth paying as it was really filling and it is continental well cooked.

If you are a wo/man of choice then please try out a good date or a beautiful dinner here. But remember you and your partner should have good taste for continental food.

The name to me is like 'One Step Up and you are in heaven'.

Having no plans in our mind, S and I decided to check out this place one fine afternoon.

We were ushered in immediately after we reached this joint.

The ambience is very basic ¬†and the waiters courteous. Nothing to write home about.

Our orders were simple as we did not want to burst ourselves with food that afternoon.

: Prawn Cocktail
: Chicken Tetrazzini
¬†
The food reached the table in about 8 minutes.
God, i despised the prawn cocktail. It was a much raved starters but for me it was just cold and creamy ans tasted like ketchup. Oh and the cold prawns inside! ¬†We finished this off with great difficulty.

The tetrazzini however, saved the day.¬†
Its served in a huge portion which is good enough for two people.¬†
Rich, creamy chicken and pasta and yes mushrooms. Pretty good along with grilled veggies. But honestly, Mocambo does this better!

However, the bill was moderate at INR 621/- and I was happy with my lunch, well if I could exclude the prawn cocktail for that matter!

Might visit again!
Cheers :)

Visited this once oft-visited restaurant after ages... more importantly for my birthday in October, 2014. I see not much have changed. The interiors are the same, so is the service.

Srated with Fresh Lime Soda. These were so-so. Nothing exceptional, not much to complain about. I always feel they should increase the quantity served.

We ordered a small variety of food. Started with the Chicken Tetrazzini, primarily for my daughter. She loved it and sure it was very well made. Nice, rich, cheesy , and well baked. It of course had lots of chicken and veggies. What more can one want :-) Then came a stir fried mushroom item (forget the name) that was supposed to be sauteed in butter but just seemed boiled! very disappointing. The quantity was awful too. We tried the Kabab platter. This one was passable, but not much to write home. Went well with our food. To end the main course we tried the Fried Fish and Chips. This seriously could have been better. I particularly did not like the crust. I cannot perhaps describe what was wrong with it, but I have had far better fried fish in much lesser places.

Dessert was old school. A large serving of Tutti Frutti each. Since I had mentioned to the steward that they should not use strawberry sauce instead of jelly, they made sure it was indeed jelly. Well made, but what kind of put me off was that they used canned fruit. Oh come on.... you can get fresh fruit. Going by the taste, I am quite sure I recognised it as being from Del Monte!

The food was served surprisingly fast, while the dessert was the contrary. And in spite of the nitty-gritties, we did have a good dinner.

Read lot of rave reviews abt the place.. n hence landed up to have a taste myself. My impression...

Ambience... Nuthng to boast abt. Ordinary seating. No music. Toooooo much noise by chattering guests...no respect for other guests. Seating for a single...on a sat eve.. took about 10 mins.

Drinks... ordered a Budweiser pint. Served in a cocktail glass. When asked.. the waiter said he was too busy!!

Service... Prompt. Order served within 5-7 mins.

Main course... Ordered chicken tetrazzini. Good...bt nthng awesome. I hv had better.

(I dnt kno if my review is gtng biased due to this hell of a noise arnd me... just not enjoying my meal).. so the rating is after giving the benefit of doubt.

Its a bit difficult to Locate amidst the busy Park Street crowd, however, it seems someone or the other in Park Street has visited this place , so a guidance is reassured .. I went with my friend on a hot Saturday afternoon to spend some quality time, Food wasn't priority that day, Ambience was ...and in One Step Up, You get that, no dwindling couples ...only decent crowd and basically food lovers, we ordered Chicken ala Kiev and a side dish ... I must confess, it was after a long time i enjoyed the lunch without being intruded frequently by waiters or rambling noise in other tables, the food was excellent and fresh lime soda was good too, the presentation of the food was good and it definitely lives up to expectations, you can actually sit and enjoy food.

I went their as a lot of my friend said great things about it. Without trying to make sense of menu I asked the waiter to suggest me their best things while I chose one by myself. He suggested me three items and I went ahead with it in full confidence. To my disappointment everything was a disaster, all bland and unimpressive. You can blame me for choosing to have Fried Fish n Chips there, but all the other three items were suggested by a restaurant representative!! What a waste of my time! I don't give a damn how the ambiance is if the core of a restaurant, the food is so disappointing.

Walked in here one fine day to explore park street beyond Peter Cat, Mocambo, Bar B Q and alike.. Well, to start off, the service is courteous, the food is good, the ambience is a miss. We ordered a fish, a chicken, and a vegetable main course dish. All were decent, no complains. But I guess to become a favourite in a place like Park Street you gotta be best in all ways.. And especially your ambience. It has to be inviting.

Nice place to visit. Nothing so special about the place...but food is very good. Drinks are cheap. The service is also very good. If you are going to park street for an evening out..this place can be a good option. One negative thing..too small sitting space. Otherwise loved it. Had a great evening out here.

I had a great time there with my friends.. Nice menu of continental delicacies delighted me. The fish preparations were specially good as also was the lamb lasagna.. the service was decent as per park street standards.. another recommendation would be the Green Thai curry.

Well it was 2012 when I visited one step up wid two friends of friends. it was the initiation years when I was trying on continental and was beginning to fall in love with in. An absolutely great restro where continental food is redefined by its taste. Prawn gamba ajilo was the starter till I remember since I loved prawns and one of my friend literally forced me into taking the caeser salad a s I hated salads. But this salad and prawn was heavenly. Rejuvenating my taste buds to a whole new level. Tried a chicken item. Hopefully it was the chef special chicken. I particularly remember the taste still. The sauce was so different and tasty that this is may be the best that I have eaten. There was chicken facon du chef. Which was good. But the fish diana I felt was over baked. Mocambo does it better. I want to get back here as soon as possible as I hear they have introduced the burmese dishes like burmese fricasse, khow suey. I am rushing soon.

Very simple and soothing ambiance, it was 1st time I went to a pure continental restaurant and to be frank I wasnt disappointed. Two items we had - chef's special chicken and grilled fish cilentro both were tasty and wholesome specialy the 2nd one (one must try that ). Music that they played were instrumentals of the old songs (i was humming almost all d songs ); it really helps to create good mood.

In a rainy afternoon we took shelter in this place. Dont get distracted by the address , its just opposite BBQ on Park Street. Excited by the reviews, we entered here. The decor is simple and cozy. We ordered for Traditional Ceaser Salad, Chicken Facon-du-chef and Chef's special chicken along with sweet lime soda. Traditional Ceaser Salad tastes nice in empty stomach ,its enough for two. Chicken Facon-du-chef was a cheesy experience while Chef's special chicken was filled with butter dipped in delicious gravy. Though the pocket pinch was a bit high but not higher than the other restaurants in Park Street. Really would love to come back here.

Went to the place on 14/8/14. We had ordered Chicken Tetrazzini and Chicken Cesiliana.
The ambience of Park Street restaurants is always good. And we were greeted well too. Now onto the food part.Tetrazinni had good taste but could have been baked a little more. The baked red colour of cheese was not there. Rather it was goldenish yellow.And the worst part. From inside popped out a hair. Too annoyed by this, i showed it to the manager wile the waiter was busy trying to remove the hair and serve me that very same half eaten plate. The manager ordered him to bring a fresh one.Cesiliana had a good taste too. But the chicken seemed to be overcooked.¬†Too disappointing overall.

Finally i got the chance to visit this restaurant. I went to shopping with my bestie and planned to have our lunch here. As soon as we started from esplanade towards park street, it started raining heavily. We boarded a taxi and reached park street and then took a walk. Interior is very simple with glass doors and windows. Abstract paintings are everywhere hanging from the wall. We ordered traditional caesar salad non veg as starter and chef's special chicken and chicken facon du chef for main course and fresh lime sodas. I loved the main course. It tasted awesome. Though i didnt like starter that much. But i must say the main course is great. Service is good. Ambience is nice. One visit is recommended.

But the food stills d show.. the salads are excellent.. so are the Fish fingers and mexican chili babycorn in starters...Among the main dishes.. that deserve special mention are-- Chicken stroganoff, Chicken Facon Du Chef, Chicken Mexicana, Fish n Chips and Grilled Fish .. The burgers and sandwiches are also good.. The mocktails are also good and nicely done.. Service is also quite good.. If you like Continental cuisine.. one should visit this place!!

Feeling low?? Head to One Step Up and order the Chicken Tetrazini. Feel your sorrows dissolve in cheesy goodness and let your mind marvel at what the meaty chicken and mushroom can do to your mood. It's that good.
The ambience helps too. Bright colors, yellow, orange really zings up the experiance. The staff is attentive and warm.
The menu us dominated by cheese sauce based preparations and I ain't complainin'. It's what comfort spells to me. C-H-E-E-S-E.
The items to try are the fish finger, chicken facon-du-chef, chef's special chicken, spaghetti carbonara, grilled fish cilantro, prawn muniere and fish Diana. I have not tried their sandwiches or the indian gravy dishes so cant comment.
If you are in park street and if your are craving cheesy goodness, then One Step Up is your destination.

This is one of the typical park street restaurants.  It has a modern outfit, not much ambiance or decor but it is comfortable enough. Has two floors. 
The food is top quality and delicious indeed. The devilled crabs they make are even better than mocambo. They dnt serve beef though, which is a bit disappointing. I had prawn muniere, best prawn dish I ever had.
Also tried the grilled prawns, just yumm, but they served some spinach and under boiled potatoes which didn't at all go with it. The beverages are nice.  
Another dish I thad was chicken mexicana, you should avoid dat !
All in all it's a pretty good place to spend some quality time. Make sure you have enough to spend though !

The restaurant boasts of a wonderful location at the ''Las Vegas'' of Kolkata-The Park Street area.Apart from its location,this restaurant also has picturesque interiors.The seating space is quite spacious but the toilet size should be accentuated to take in multiple people.Furthermore,the service staff should be alert as to serve those who have ordered first.It so happened that we ordered for babycorn first but those who arrived after us were served before. usus. ¬†usus.uyusThis ¬†We were a bit angry on thisusthe 25th of december,2014 but¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Although the  restaurant does not have a long menu for starters for veggies but still i gorged on mexican babycorn and penne and both were lip-smackig .The babycorn was crisp true to its name and was good in quantity and the penne had the taste of a sizzler.It was red hot and spicy too.For spice-loving tongues,this red suce pasta is a must try.The service is slow but the food is luscious.The service becomes fast during the peak festive seasons of Christmas,etc.If you are someone who like to experiment with food,you can go for the burmese rice.The vegetables with skin-coloured gravy is ¬†quite soothing to the taste buds.It is very good except for the fact that it should not have potatoes and it doesn't go in line with the gravy and vegetables it had.Otherwise,it is a very good dish to taste.
The rating i would like to give it are as follows:
Food-4/5
Service-5/5
Ambience-4/5
Value for money-4/5

Yesterday (07/26/2014) me and my room-mate went to this restaurant for lunch. We wanted to try one chicken and one fish dish, one with red and one with white sauce. For chicken we ordered Chicken Tetrazinni, which is a chicken dish in white sauce. For the fish item we took the waiter‚Äôs advice and he suggested Fish Diana, which is a fish dish cooked in red sauce. Let me tell you that this restaurant serves one of the best Continental foods in Kolkata. The food was just yummy. They serve huge quantity of food compared to the price they charge. We started with the Fish Diana. It was a bhetki fillet stuffed with medium sized prawn and capsicum. Cooked in red sauce. The sauce was just so creamy and very very tasty. I think the basic components of the sauce was tomato and loads cream and cheese. One plate had 2 fillets , sauce and few boiled veggies. For people like us one fillet is enough for the meal. After this we started with the chicken tetrazzini though we were already very very full. This is I feel a continental version of the  gravy chowmein with chicken and few boiled veggies. The white mushroom sauce was just too good. After cooking this dish the chef must have added shredded cheese on top and have baked it. Because the dish had a light crust on the top which was its usp. Overall a very nice restaurant and I would definitely love to go back again and again.

The current prices are as follows:

Chicken Tetrazinni ‚Äì 275

Fish Diana ‚Äì 300

Sweet Lime Soda (sweet) ‚Äì 80 (we ordered 2)

Total Bill ‚Äì 980.

I have been here on multiple occasions and loved it every single time. The Cream of Mushroom Soup is my favourite. In main course, try their classic Chefs Special Chicken, the quality and quantity of this dish is incredible. The Fish and Chips too is worth a try. In vegetarian the Lasagne is nice but if you are not that fond of cheese or baked dishes then I would suggest you go for the Vegetable Mexicana. Te spaghetti along with all the veggies and the salsa, packs a punch.

Its an awesome place. Love the ambience. And the food is truly continental and not like the so called restaurants which present continental dishes in Indian way. Specially the grilled fish, ceasar salad, lasagna are world class. Would love to visit again. But the prices are a bit too much but the tase very well compensates for it.


definitely 4.5/5 for me

Amazing place! This place is perfect for people craving continental dishes without spending a whole lot of money. The dishes are simple yet mouthwatering. The really good ones to try out are chicken facon du chef, prawn newberg, prawn munnierre, fish florentine and oh yes! Their chicken stroganoff!! One of the best stroganoff's in town for sure. The fish Diana is also really good for people who like a tangy tomato based gravy...not too sour and not too tangy, a perfect blend of tomato pur√©e with a slight creamy cheesy base to thicken the gravy a bit. Marvellous dish! Best part is the quantity of food they give for the amount of money charged. Definitely one my top 10 continental restaurants!

Went there with a friend and it was a nice experience. But the upstairs section was closed that day so it could have been a better experience.

We had shrimp cocktail for starters and it was decent enough and moreover it looked appetizing.  For drinks I had pina-colada and my friend ordered lime soda. The main course included Chef's Special Chicken and and Lasagna ala Bolognaise.

The Chef's Special Chicken was accompanied by mashed potatoes and saute vegetables. The chicken breast was soft, wrapped in crispy bacon and filled with ample amount of cheese. The mashed potato was the best i ever tasted. The portion was enough for one person so we asked them to make it one by two because Lasagna was next.

The Lamb Lasagna was cheesy and the spaghetti was of fine quality. The portion of lasagna was also good enough and due to this we were not able to squeeze in any desert. Let's keep that for next time then.

Went with my mom for my fill of continue food. We ordered the chicken steak and fish Florentine. The steak was just about OK; the  chicken was fabulous and tasty just that had expected a better veg selection on the sides. Most steaks come with better accompaniments. Something for the folks to do better. The fish Florentine came in a big pie dish with amazingly fresh fish and was very nicely done quite a huge portion; totally satisfied.

I was there with a friend on my birthday. The gatekeeper welcomed us and found a table for us to seat. The ambience was not something extraordinary, it was just plain and simple. The outlook of the place is not that heavy, it allows you to solely concentrate on the food. It would have been an average restaurant if it was not located in Park Street. The waiter came up to us with two menu cards - one for the meal and another was for drinks. Oh yes ! They also have a small bar just opposite to the entrance. Since I am not that much into drinking, I am not getting into that. 
After looking at the menu we decided on ordering Chicken Paprika and Moroccan Chicken. 

According to their menu description, Chicken Paprika - Dices of chicken, capsicum, onion and mushroom cooked in a tangy brown sauce served with garlic rice. Whereas, Moroccan chicken - Breast of chicken marinated with Moroccan spices and cooked in charcoal and served with tomato rice. 

Both of them were delicious, but I liked Moroccan chicken more. The chicken breasts cooked on charcoal gives it a different taste. Anything cooked on charcoal is always more tasty than anything cooked on gas. In both the dishes, the quantity of rice served was a bit less. But if you are looking for a place which provides good food, then this is the place where you should be. The less quantity won't hurt you much. One step up has got a 'fresh' appeal which other restaurants of Park Street lack. What I mean to say is that it is not that sophisticated as the other restaurants of Park Street.  

The service is below par. They are done attending you once the food is served. 

Summary: 
Food quality and taste: 4.5/5
Food presentation: 4.5/5
Ambience: 3/5
Service: 2.5/5
Value for money: 4.5/5
 
One step up is worth a visit and I can bet the food won't disappoint you, the service might. 
I would love to visit One Step Up again. 
Keep Eating. Keep Feeding. Cheers !

We went there a few days back for a lunch while exploring the streets of Park Street, and i had a real nice experience here. Once you step in, you will be welcomed by a chic decor, very compact, very comfy. The waiters are well mannered, well trained and good to see that they are proficient in English, Hindi and Bengali..so no one should have any problem to communicate. We didnt had much time in hand so inspite of thinking of ordering Prawn Cocktails as a starter, we had to hold the horses and we ordered the main course straightaway. The 1st item was Chicken Tropicana (here i must mention that the menu card is self explanatory and one should not have any major problems in knowing what is in what) which was a pan fried chicken breast, very well cooked and stuffed with mashed prawns,mushrooms and sauted in a tangy sauce which adds a very nice zing to it and is quite wholesome. The next dish was Chef's special Lamb which was a another lovely preparation with a handsome amount of lamb in a sauce alongside rice and boiled vegetables..very much continental and tasted superbly. But i felt that the rice quantity was a bit less in comparison with the lamb. Next we ordered caramel custard which was very soft, almost melt in the mouth with a savoury caramel topping which gave it a subtle sweetness which was neither too strong nor too mild and had a perfect balance.  The price was quite reasonable and no way too expensive and with such good food and nice ambiance it is bound to be every continental lovers fav spot. 

P.S. they also serve indian cuisine but havnt tried any of that..maybe next time :)

Generally overlooked due to its quaint location and flanked by other heavyweights around it, this is a nice cozy restaurant amidst the hustle-bustle of Park Street.. The staff is really good..The food spread is awesome.. Though the place is a bit cramped due to space issues and trying to fit in too many tables, it is a good place one should try.. The continental spread is awesome.. the rest is fine.. perfect for families and friends both, this restaurant is a must-visit if you wanna try continental..

Two days prior to the Kolkata elections, my visit to Park Street to quench my booze craving taught me that alcohol remains strictly unavailable during this time due to some General Election rule. Not in a mood to waver from our weekend spirits, our group of 3 decided to visit a place none of us has ever been to... and we stumbled upon One Step Up.

It was almost empty as booze was not getting served. So we ordered 1 Fish Diana, 1 Chicken Paprika and 1 Chef's Special Lamb. No qualms with the taste of these 3 dishes, especially the Fish Diana. Two humongous fish fillets with prawns, mushrooms and cheese stuffing is a dream come true for any seafood lover. The Chicken Paprika was also delicious and one huge bowl of it was hard for a single person to finish. I completely adore a well-cooked lamb dish and Chef's Special Lamb was no exception either. However, the quantity of the rice was too low. That, for me, was the only downside of the entire meal.

I don't know whether this is a regular phenomenon in One Step Up or not (as I've not gone through any previous review), but the service was disappointing that night. We had to ask for our napkins, tissue papers and water. And this is seriously not something I like to experience in a well-known Park Street restaurant. If I have to revisit this place, it'll only be for the awesome food it offers... and nothing else.

P.S. - Sorry for the "not-so-good" quality of the pics...

I walked into One Step Up on a lazy Sunday afternoon. What excited me about the place was its relaxed decor and ambience. With everything about Park Street being so extravagant and formal, it was refreshing to walk into a restaurant where you could spend a quiet afternoon. The staff at this place is extraordinary, to say the least. They are extremely warm and hospitable. I tried their Vegetarian Tetrazini and Caramel custard and my friend tried the Lamb Lasagne. 
The tetrazini was very well prepared and the flavour of the charred cheese lingered in my mouth the rest of the day! The white sauce, the vegetables and the fresh veggies they serve on the side are all extremely flavoursome. They serve it pipig hot, making it all the more delectable. My friend loved her lamb lasagne as well.
The caramel custard was served to us almost as soon as we placed the order. The custard was very light and mildly flavoured. The flavour of the caramel was just right. 
The drinks are a tad expensive here, but the staff is so friendly, you almost don't mind the pinch in the pocket.
One Step Up is definitely one of the most underrated restaurants in Park Street. With people always swarming to Peter Cat and Mocambo and Tung Fong and The Park, One Step Up remains one of the lesser known haunts of the place. So next time you're in Park Street, do yourself a favour and  walk into One Step Up =)

Park Street is mostly about Peter Cat, Oly Pub, Mocambo, BBQ... Wanted to try something different. One Step Up is an amazing restaurant with an amazing set of oriental delicacies. We had Devilled Crab for starters, which was melted in my mouth completely.. It is THE most amazing crab starter i have ever had! Then we moved on to grilled fish in butter sauce, which is a soft and light buttery flavored non spicy dish. Then I wanted to try something spicy, so ordered an amazing lamb dish of the chef's choice custom made for us. Amazing rich flavors, absolutely opposite to the flavors we had for starters and maincourse. and finally, completed our meal with a dessert- Hot Chocolate Truffle. It is not something which was absolutely out of the world. I have had better truffles, of lesser price considering the same quantity. 
Cost for 2 in my case- 2350 (with alcohol).

One Step Up - Really a step up? My review will speak on it. :) 
===========================================================================================
Intro:

I had been to park street today with one of my friend to enjoy the food here. I had been hearing about the food of one step up since a long time and hence, paid a visit. As i went inside this place, the guard let us in respectfully and i took a seat thereon. The ambience was just dimly shaded Colour's. It was nothing extraordinary. Very simple and plain with two or three paintings hung on the wall. Well, that is impressive for some of the people but i was quite laid back with the ambience. They have a small bar right in front of the entrance gate. They have another above section on the top from where they prepare and get the food below. Nevertheless, i continued looking at the menu and had planned to place my order.
===========================================================================================
Food Ordered: ( Main course)

1) Red Thai curry chicken with rice - The rice was a lot less in quantity. On the contrary, the chicken chunks were ample in the red thai curry. It was tasting more like Khow Suey as it had loads of Coconut Milk. The guy told me it will be spicy but it was sweet. I was kind of surprised as the person is saying something else and the guy is cooking something else. Nevertheless, on telling them to make it spicy, it was still sweet. I am sure my palate was fine. :|

2) Paneer Shashlik - Paneer Shashlik was marinated and was flooded on top with the gravy was served with salad and rice. I tasted paneer and it was fine. 

Our bill came to 650 approximate. 
===========================================================================================
Meal for two: 1000-1500 max
===========================================================================================
Summary: 

Food presentation 4/5
Food quality 4.5/5
Food quantity 4.5/5 ( Rice a little more and gravy a little less = perfect combination)
Taste 4/5
Hygiene 4/5
Ambience 3/5
Hospitality 3.5/5

My friends and I first went to this place when we could not longer stand in the unbearable line outside Peter Cat and Mocambo to get a taste of good Continental cuisine, but we were pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food. Since then, we have been going to One Step up frequently...The place is cozy and I like the fact that there is alot of natural light coming through the window and that we dont have to sit in a darkened room. The prices are decent and you get your food's worth.
Some of the dishes on the menu which I love:
The fish and chips is really good here with the fish being fresh and crisp. The tarter sauce which accompanies it is tasty
Chicken Tropicana - chicken stuffed with prawn and cooked in tomato sauce - One word - WOW! the burst of flavours is awesome and if you are tired of having the same bland dish time after time, this dish is a welcome change
Chicken Tetrazini -  A timeless classic and OSU does it justice
Spagetti Carbonara, Chicken A La Kiev are also classics and will not be disappointed if ordered.

I recently went out for a lunch with my college friends to this place. It has a really simple and nice decor. I loved the menu they have, there's a lot of variety and newer stuff one can easily try out. Prices are moderate.
Things to have at One Step Up: Prawn Cocktail- its absolutely delicious and you must try it to know what I'm tal
king about.
Chicken Caesar Salad- for all the health conscious people and salad lovers, 
this is a really good and wholesome dish. Chicken tetrazinni is also very cheesy and yummy. All of the pastas that they serve are very good too, so don't worry about what to order when it comes to the pastas. For desserts, the chocolate mousse and the caramel custard is heaven.

Check it out if you like continental food.

The food prepared is a class above others especially mocambo.
I would choose one step up anyday over mocambo.
However this place is a bit of pocket pincher.
Would love to try it out again

I believe it is an underrrated place when it comes to other restaurants in park street!! I have been here alot of times but it never fails to suprise me with its amazing continental delicacies!! 
Decor is pretty simple yet elegant, but I find it a bit noisy on d weekends!!
Now coming to d food, you should never miss out on the 'devilled crab'...you should also try the chef's special chicken(chicken stuffed with cheese and bacon).....its heavenly!! Grilled fish is yummy too.....
And if you like cocktails.....go for d bloody mary!! ;)
Overall,its sumptuous  meal.....with cocktails!!
I never tried indian cuisine there coz there are better places in Kolkata for d same,but they create some good meaty stuff!!
P.S. Avoid d weekends as its too noisy!!

Cheers!!

Yesterday I was out with my friends and ended up in Park street and One step up came  to us as a good option for a chilled out evening. A very casual place with not much of decor. like the ground floor set up but since it was a weekend it was almost full so we settled down for upstairs but within few minutes the place was full n noisy so definitely it was not a place to chilled out. what I liked about this place is that service very prompt n quick and the food was tasty I love the warm chicken salad it was good to taste, so was the chicken fingers. what I felt is this place should be avoided during weekends as its lil extra full and place is not that big overall okay .

Can't believe I never been to this place till today...Just out of the world. No showoff, Their food does  all the trick for them. Went there for a friends birthday and decided on this gem suddenly.. Ordered Chef's Special chicken - so tender, nicely done. The sauce with Herby Chicken Fingers is just mindblowing and I am sure that is homemade or "restaurant made" in this case. Chicken Tetrazzini was another lipsmacking dish which was very absolutely gorgeous and reminded me of some home made baked spaghetti with chicken in a small bistro abroad. Grilled Bhetki in garlic butter sauce was equally nice, only would have loved lil more flavour in the mashed potato. They just couldn't nail the Long Island Iced Tea that well, still good enough to give us a high. :) Overall, good food, well mannered staffs and above all, a no showoff good eatery in Kolkata whose baked sphagetti even can even beat our recently opened posh Cafe Mezzuna's few Pasta dishes..Can't wait to go back. Best Wishes and Keep up the good work :)

I am a regular here...and have tried everything that s  been recommended by the Maitre D' ..HEART the tetrazini, the carbonara(ask for penne instead of spaghetti). love their garlic bread...and a personal favorite is the Ceaser salad, Facon du chef, the ragu lamb lasange is just brilliant. You must go to the place..if you are in the mood for a casual laid back dinner with friends and are willing to  try some very good continental food. OH!! the alcohol is not exorbitantly priced !!so thats definitely the icing on the cake!

One Step Up is a great place for a chilled out meal that is of excellent quality and affordable pricing.  I believe this is owned by the same management that owns Bar b Que. Its serves up excellent Continental and Indian food and I wholeheartedly recommend this place to all my fellow foodies. The decor is bright , cheerful and modern and it has a nice vibe to it. Service is pretty good and so is the food.
Start out with the Prawn Cocktail and Deviled Crab both of which are super. If your in the mood for soup give the Mulligatawny or Cream of Tomato a shot ... both are really well - made or try the Chicken Khow-suey my favorite soup here but beware its huge , a meal in itself so only order as a starter if there are 3-4 people to share it. 
The main course variety is excellent for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians and I would recommend the  Fish Meuniere ( perfectly prepared ) , Chicken Tetrazinni ( awesome ) , Chicken A La Keiv , Jumbo Prawn Thermidor. 
If you prefer something more like a snack try the various sandwiches or the lamb or fish burger.
One Step Up also offers  up a fairly wide spread and excellent Indian section I have really enjoyed the Prawn Butter Masala , Kali Dal , Paneer Butter Masala , Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Cheese or Garlic Naan.
End your meal on a sweet note with Caramel Custard or the Ice-creams on offer.

Been to One Step Up a couple of weeks back and really enjoyed my meal there. The service has always been wonderful and the ambience pleasing but the quality of food which I thought had dipped a little bit in between is back to being fantastic. The prawn cocktail is super and one of the better ones in Kolkata so those of you who like your prawn cocktail must should give it a try. The Devilled Crab was also superb and actually better than the one they serve at Mocambo. For our main course we ordered a Chicken Khow Suey which was excellent , a Grilled Fish in Garlic Butter Sauce which is an old favourite , the Chicken Tetrazzini which was excellent and a Bull's Eye Burger(Lamb) which was surprisingly good. As you can imagine we had no room for dessert !!

----- 19 Oct, 2012 -----

I like One Step Up .... bright and casual and perfect for when your in the mood for good food with out being in a very formal ambiance .... The Khow Swey is fantastic and for those of you who have not tried it please do so ..... especially with the cooler weather around the corner , in the mains  Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce , the Chicken A la Kiev and the Chicken Siciliane are really good. At one point they used to make a decent chicken burger but last time I had it I did not enjoy it at all hope they go back to the earlier recipe for it soon.

We ordered the chef's special lamb,lasagne,chicken tetrazinni and the chicken steak and fresh lime sodas.
Firstly,the sodas were served almost instantly but mine was a bit bitter.Then came the food.Absolutely lip smacking,mouth watering stuff.The steak broth and the lamb broth were to die for.The lasagne was enough for 2 starved horses.The tetrazinni was a bit bland as compared to the others but good nonetheless.
Pros:
Good value for money
Helpful staff
Importantly,delicious food
Cons:
The ambience could have been better.The furniture looks somewhat cheap.

When your office is at Park street, it is hard to miss out on gorging at all the eateries. And, One Step Up is certainly one place not to miss out on. It is one of the best place around that serves decent continental, one that is not completely bland and tingles the taste buds somewhat. I have visited the place on many occasions and am absolutely in love with their food, the ambiance, the service and the friendly waiters. Let me begin my saying that the Chicken and Herb Salad they serve here is to die for. it is light, well seasoned and has amazing and distinct flavours. When I went the last time, I tried their Fish Meuniere, Fish Florentine and Spaghetti Carbonara, 

Besides the food, the experience of looking out on Park Street from afar, from the safety of being seated behind the glass, is another experience to savor in your visit. 

One more point for the waiters- they suggest and make recommendations that are good to take note of and make the meal really enjoyable experience.

A must visit if you are in the mood to savour some great continental food. This restaurant comes with a very quiet and serene ambience. I love their cream mushroom soup!!! The steaks are also equally tasty and authentic.  There's this baked crab item which is served in crab shells along with mushrooms is ambrosia! !! The very thought of the dish is mouth watering. Ultimate destination for some Yummmmyyy food.

Another brilliant outlet that i have forgotten to review. One step up came into being during out late school years and in the years our taste buds were developing . 

They are always talked about for their continental food but their Indian food and tandoori is quite good too in fact some people swear by it . They make a brilliant dal makahni and the majaraja meal is a brilliant choice with chicken tikka masala and dal and naans . If not top five their daal is definitely in the 10 ten daals of the city. 

the also make one of the best chicken tetrazzini versions i have eaten . Over all they do a great job with cheesy and buttery dishes ( grin!!). 

Only suggestion is that they just have nothing low calorie on their menu . A few health dishes and some fresh flavors would add a more completeness to the menu . I have no complaints about their regular menu . It takes courage to step into a market which is saturated by legends like Mocambo and Peter Cat and make a name for itself and they did it . Kudos !

Every time i visit Park Street I end up in the other restaurants. So on a Chritsmas noon we found seat in this restaurant. And the experience was totally positive. We wanted to try the Devilled crab but it was not available sadly. So we went for Prawn Cocktail which was good. And Herby Chicken fingers with beer. Now this had a smashing flavor. We also tried their Roast Chicken,  Tetrazinni and all of them were perfectly made. Definitely a wonderful place for continental lunch/dinner.

Although I had heard a great deal abt One Step Up, this was the first time I decided to dine here. My sister and I reached before 8 and was glad to be seated promptly, even though it was on a weekend. 

We ordered for a Chef's Special Chicken first. With a piece each of succulent chicken stuffed with bacon and cheese, with mashed potatoes and veggies and a delish sauce, it was oozing awesomeness! We ordered for Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce next. The Fish was soft, fresh and most importantly, didnt have a smell to it (sth i always fear whenever i order fish at a new place).

I had also ordered for a Long Island Iced Tea, which I didnt quite like. Have had much better elsewhere.

The tables are close together and the ambience is nothing special, but if you want to have a good meal with prompt service and a reasonable pocket-pinch (of Rs.1400 with drinks) its a good place to lunch/dine.

Will definitely visit again! Soon! :)

During my three month visit to Kolkata I, with my wife must have visited this place about seven to eight times. We simply loved it.

In particular we kept coming back for the Vegetarian Burger which is the best I've had. Its also pretty healthy which was another reason for the continued visits. We also tried other things on the menu and everything was good to excellent. Mostly, we ordered sandwiches and Italian dishes. Definitely a good place to visit when you to go to Kolkata.

In park street this is one restaurant where you will always find a place.. But the food is good too.. They give you good portions n the taste is delectable. Must try the garlic bread there
Only thing is they are short of desserts

I've tried loads of dishes here. The prawn thermidor is worth trying.

I went there last during christmas eve, and as expected got a place within 5 minutes.

We ordered--
Prawn Cocktail-- Was indeed nice and yummy
Chicken Sashlik- Was one of the best I've had. Highly recommended
Some stuffed chicken in fish- the sauce was yummy and the dish wholesome
Chocolate mousse-- Slightly bitter, hence you can finish it and tastes good
Caramel custard- Perfect

Highly recommended, and pocket friendly too

I like this eatery because of its menu and menu alone. It serves a host of Italian soake dishes served in a perfect manner. Of the many times I have been there, I have tried Thai Chicken with rice, Falcon du Chef, Chicken a la Kiev and Crispy Chicken Burger. I enjoy the food every time. However, I do not like the ambience at all. I find it to be more sites to be a bad than a fine dining restaurant. 

Worst of all was the treatment that was meted out to a guest by the steward. The gentleman was standing between tables waiting his turn and the stars was very rude in his manner of asking him step aside.

One step up serves one of the best continental in the city. The ambiance is simple and the food is great there. Also the dessert section is something I really love. Been there quite a few times and every time we enjoyed conversation over really good food. However, last time we had our lunch at another place and hopped into One step up just to have the yummy dessert. With fresh fruits and beautiful presentation it again made us falling for it. A must visit place in Park Street for sure.

One step up has always been one of my favourites ever since I discovered it .The food served here is simply amazing and the ambience is great too. However, there always has been this order issue which I faced thrice already! We ordered for 4 items, they ended up  bringing just 3 of them saying that the 4th one wasn't taken down by them and that gets really annoying.Even if we ordered it again,it would take ages to arrive at our table so we would have to end up cancelling the order.
 Otherwise,it's a really nice and cozy place, especially  if you love continental food  then you should definitely try eating here(I never tried the Indian section though ,so won‚Äôt comment on that) . I have been very satisfied with most of the dishes I‚Äôve tried , my personal favourites being- the Fish Florentine, Chicken ala kiev, Chef‚Äôs Special Chicken and the chicken tentrazinni.I think the lamb lasagna is also worth recommending. I didn‚Äôt like the French fries they served probably coz they are made from the frozen packets and the Chicken mexicana was a little too hot and spicy. Didn't like it much!

Was a little disappointed with the dessert section too,because it had nothing new or different to offer and out of those few options,some were not even available.
But overall it‚Äôs a nice place serving really yummy food !So,do try it!

One of the best continental food I ever had in the city. Just located near Flurys, this is a great place to have lunch if you are an Italian food lover. The prawn cocktail is simply superb, and the ideal appetiser. Moreover, the lemon butter sauce with the grilled fish was the perfect combination of tangy and spicy. The service was topnotch but the dessert section had nothing new to offer

Another visit to One step up.This time decided to try some of the items I had not tried here in my many past visits.They included.The Devilled crab.I had somehow never had Devilled crab here in the past and after having it for the first time i was made to wonder why I did not order in the past.It was excellent.It was cheesy and the crab was perfectly cooked.The herbed crispy chicken was nice and crispy.The tangy spicy dip went really well with it.The prawn cocktail was decent nothing extra ordinary.The Lamb Lasagne this time around was a bit of a disappointment.It was rather under baked.The fish items once agian impressed.The Fish Diana and the Fish Florentine are absolute must haves here.I have tried them on about three to four separate occasions and each time I have been impressed.And regarding desserts as i had mentioned before the options are rather limited and this is one of the few drawbacks of this place.Overall if you are looking for good continental food this is surely worth recommending.

This is my 2nd review for One Step Up after my 3rd visit to this place and my 2nd in very quick time.Being very impressed at my last visit I recommended this place to my college gang,most of whom,like me,like continental food.We selected this place for lunch during our Durga pujo outing this year.It proved to be a great choice.It lived up to my recommendation and impressed us all.

It was around 3pm on the Panchami afternoon when we arrived.We were a group of six and we were lucky enough to get a table without waiting.This was the first time I was seated in a table upstairs.The ambience n decor is much the same as it is in the ground floor.It is simple and nothing special.The tables are a bit too close to each other.But these are minor issues which one would easily forget after tasting the food.

Coming to the food,we ordered a Chef's special chicken,Chicken Facon du chef,Chicken tropicana,Lamb lasagne,Chicken mexicana and a green thai chicken curry.All the items were once again excellent.
The Chef's special chicken,which is one of my favourites here is  two breasts of chicken wrapped with bacon and stuffed with cheese and served in a perfectly made sauce.
The Chicken facon du chef was again two breasts of chicken stuffed with cheese and served in a creamy cheesy white sauce with spinach and mushrooms.It was an absolute treat and the best item of the day for me.
The Chicken Tropicana was nice and tangy as it should be with an unmistakably wonderful tinge of alcohol about it.
The Lamb Lasagne was also cheesey and meaty and baked to perfection.
The chicken Mexicana was a little atypical and a little spicy but we all kind of liked it nonetheless.
Lastly the green Thai chicken curry.I am not a great fan of Thai food and I was against the idea of ordering this item with the vast array of other continental items to choose from.But a friend wanted to have it and we ordered it at least for the sake of variety and my friend's wish.The friend who ordered it found it really nice and was satisfied.I found it okay,a bit too bland.But the fragrance was good though.
And though we didnt have fish items here this time,I cant help but mention that the fish items here are excellent.The fish diana and fish florentine are worth recommending.

The quantity of all the items were quite good.They had increased the prices by about ten to twenty may be for the pujas or may be permanently.That remains to be seen.But still the prices are slightly lower than the other restaurants renowned for continental food which is an added bonus.The service was also quite fast and the staff were nice and courteous.

The one negative about this place as I had mentioned in my last review too is that the options in the desserts section is a bit on the lesser side.Even we had wanted a banana split but it was not available.They said only caramel custard and tuty fruity were available.We were quite full with the main course and so we decided to skip the desserts.But there are times and there are people who would really want to have desserts.So this is one area where there is room for improvement.

But overall we were really satisfied with our food here.One step up ranks high in the list of my favourite restaurants.The quality of food here is well and truly ONE STEP UP...!!! :)


----- 07 Oct, 2013 -----

This is one of my favourite restaurants for Continental food in Kolkata.I have been to this place a couple of times and on both occasions I was really satisfied.
The place is located very conveniently beside the iconic Flurys at park street,the hub of foodies in Kolkata.The restaurant has two sections,one in the ground floor and one upstairs.I have been to the ground floor section only.
The food: The place offers a variety of cuisines but it is renowned for its continental food and rightly so.Among the items I have had here,chef's special chicken,fish diana,chicken tetrazini,grilled fish are all worth mentioning.The chefs special chicken is a breast of chicken stuffed with melted cheese and wrapped with bacon and served in a tasty sauce.It is an absolute delight.Fish items here are an absolute must.The quality of the fish served is excellent.Fish diana and grilled fish are my personal favourites and is surely worth recommending.I absolute loved the fish diana which was fish fillet stuffed with prawns n mushrooms cooked to perfection in an irresistibly tasty sauce.The chicken tetrazini here is extremely cheesy and tasty.If you are looking for something a little spicy you may try chicken mexicana.The quantity of the food is also very good.All the items are quite filling.The prices are also reasonable and slightly lesser than other renowned continental restaurants.Overall the food is excellent and there is nothing much to complain about.The one area where there can be some improvement regarding the food is the desserts.The options in the desserts section is slightly limited and the quality slightly lags behind the quality of the food.
The ambience: The ambience is one area where the place can improve.There is nothing special about the ambience and decor.But for me its not that important because the quality of the food and the service well and truly makes up for it.The space inside is on the lesser side.The tables are a bit too close to each other giving a cramped feeling.But the place is not as crowded as some other restaurants in park street.You will not have to wait much to get a seat.The staff are very helpful and courteous.The service is also quite swift.
All in all this is a place which is surely worth recommending and even more so if you like continental food.

One Step Up is one such place in Calcutta, where food gets the only preference ,unlike other attributes of a restaurant. Like me, it would be a perfect place for you , if your a food-a-holic. It is quite good for a evening date too :D As result, i have been to this place on number of occasions. Latest being few days ago, when we,few old friends had planned to meet up for a lunch, nearly after a year. 

The ambiance & decor is definitely not appealing, but has that "cafe look" inside. Anyway , ambiance should not be your priority if your planning to come here.

Food is basically continental with few Indian cuisines too. But i would always suggest to try out the best continental stuffs served here. Be it Chicken tetrazini, Chef's special chicken, Chicken a-la-Kiev or Spaghetti Carbonara. Food is served just the way it should be (you will definitely  drool over it :D) . The most important thing about this place is the price is reasonable considering its location and the lovely quality of food it serves. So value for money is pretty high here. It also does serve beverages which is again quite reasonably priced. So a thumbs up for both food and drinks here.

This place also provides efficient and prompt service which adds up to it's benefit. Serving food to your table does not take abnormal time . So this place is by far the best for meet up and hangouts with friends. 

So i would like to conclude by rating it in four  sections, based on its priority (top to bottom) and finally overall rating : 

1. Food  : 5/5 
2.Ambiance : 3/5
3. Service : 4/5
4. VFM : 4/5

Overall : 4/5

One step up used to be my favourite hunt for continental food. Until two days back. I visited them after a ling time, maybe a year. The food was fine.. not bad. The service shocked me. Waiters were rude, indifferent and disgusting to say the least. They lacked courtesy and offered no apologies for their mistakes. They sometimes walked past us, without bothering to attend to us, while we were calling out to them. I have never rated a place so bad..despite having good food. The staff just killed our mood. I feel so sad about rating a place so close to my heart this way. Sorry..u guys suck..learn some manners first!

Pros
Good service
Good location
Good food, which the chef may consider making small changes to (like olive oil instead of butter) for you
Good cooking
Value for money

Cons
I really disliked the french fries, they were made from frozen ones, perhaps they need to pick a better brand

One step up offers lovely continental food, and may end up being my favoured spot for continental fare in Park Street ahead of Mocambo or Moulin Rouge.
Prawn Meuniere: The sauce was rich creamy,the mushrooms perfectly cooked and it went great with the rice.
Chef's special Chicken: Chicken stuffed with cheese,wrapped with bacon,grilled and served with sauce,boiled veggies and mashed potatoes..how much better can it get?The only drawback would be the positively sour tasting canned asparagus.
Chicken Tetrazini: Quite good,though a bit more cheese and baking would have maded it perfect.
For desserts we had the Hot Chocolate Truffle: It is not what the name suggests- you get a slice of warm sponge cake,vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce,but the combination is pretty tasty.
The behavior of the staff and the overall hospitality left us satisfied;though the place could do with a bit of re-doing of the decor and spruce up the ambience a bit.

A decent place for continental food. (I never tried their Indian section so can't comment on them). They haven't fully 'Indianized' their continental dishes and that is something I appreciate. The quality of the food can vary a lot though.  I found their Devilled crab simply mind blowing,  one of the best dishes that I ever tasted in Kolkata (definitely better than the one available at Mocambo). The Fish and Chips was quite good too. But the Lasagna ala Bolognaise was just horrible. The chef simply has no clue as to how to prepare the dish. (I lived in Bologna, Italy and have some idea about the original). 

The service is good. Ambiance OK. Overall I would recommend this place as you are likely to find many more dishes that you like than those that you don't.

One of better continental restaurants in the city. The food is delicious, quantities huge and not too hard on the pocket. 
The sea food chowder soup, and the cream soup are to die for. The chicken terazzini, doused in an unbelievable amount of cheese and cream, is never easy to finish. My favorite in this place is the chicken Paprika. The other dishes that one can try are the chef's special chicken, the Pollo alla parmigiana can cilantro, the chicken stroganoff. My advice: better stick to the continental portion of the menu.
Over all a very good place for a great meal and some adda with a couple of friends.

Was very much eager to visit this very talked about place for continental delicacies...And finally one afternoon had paid a visit with one of my very close friend...From our entrance we were greeted as if we were some delegates...Thus the appreciation starts..The waiters were very much courteous...What I had liked was the knowledge that the manager had....He too was quite polite and helped us with our requirements...
I had ordered Chef's Special Chicken and she ordered Chicken Paprika...Both were delicious and quantity was quite good...I personally had loved my dish...It was chicken in great amounts wrapped in bacon served with a dark creamy sauce.....It was very fresh and when I had cut the wrapped chicken a cheesy delight had flown which was just the icing...
Chicken Paprika was rice served with chunks of chicken which was bit spicy...What I had disliked was the price which they had charged for cold drinks...It was exorbitantly priced....But still I had loved the experience at this place...Food thumbs up...

Finally visited this very much talked about place today. And food was definitely as per the expectations set by various reviews and people who have been there before. Tried out chicken tetrazini, mexican chicken and grilled fish....apart from their mexican chicken..the other two were total knockouts in terms of taste...filling and simply yummy! Overall rating would have been more if ambience would have been taken care of...place had a cramped feeling and seating could be more comfortable. Finally my search for an excellent continental cuisine which is light on the pocket, ends here! Looking forward for the next visit...

Another of my favourite places to eat out in the Park Street area, they do a decent job with their food, considering the variety of cuisines they offer. The continental items are the best here. The only drawback, the place seems cramped due to their seating arrangements. The service is good though. My personal favourites are their Mulligatawny Soup, the Stroganoff & the Tetrazzini.

I have been dining out in the Park Street area for about 10 years now, with friends, family and recently colleagues. Been to almost all the famous restaurants in and around Park Street excepting One Step Up. Have heard mixed reviews about this place from my friends and wanted to try this out. So finally after seeing the generally positive reviews on Zomato, I finally tried One step up a couple of weeks ago. 

The ambiance: Located right beside the iconic Flurys, the restaurant has two floors. I and my friend were seated on the ground floor. Upon entering I noticed that the ambiance is too noisy and the tables feel a bit cramped. The interiors are nothing great to write about. It was decent. Very soon, I was asked by the floor manager if I wish to shift to another table. I happily said yes and we shifted to a bigger table. 

The food: I was in the mood to have continental. So we ordered 1 Fish and Chips, 1 Fish Florentine and 1 Mango blossom.
The Mango blossom was served within few minutes and tasted just okay. Nothing special. It took around 15-20 minutes for the Fish n Chips to arrive. Two slabs of fish fry, few french fries along with tartar sauce. I must say the quality of the fish was very good (bhetki). I loved it so much that I finished it off within few minutes. The tartar sauce served with it was also very authentic and better than my expectations. I just wish they serve 3 fillets instead of 2 :D 

Next up was fish florentine. Again top quality fish. Absolutely no avenue to complain. I feel this is one of the best Fish Florentine which is served in the park street area atleast and is definitely way better than Mocambo. The sauce was thick and dense which I liked the most. However they could have done with a bit less of spinach. I feel it was over used. However on the whole, my taste buds simply adored this dish and would definitely go back to try it out again.

The service was prompt and courteous. Really dont have anything to add here. 

Final Verdict: Definitely recommended from my end. I would go back soon to try the other continental items on the menu. The pricing is Park Street standard. All the three items mentioned above along with a Beer was billed at Rs1003 (inclusive of taxes). Would love if they increase the quantity a bit. The only thing I did not like about this place is the ground floor is too noisy during lunch hours (at least it was when I went on a Saturday afternoon). Have not been to the 1st floor, so cannot comment. 
I simply loved the fish preparations and and would definitely be back soon :)

we tasted chicken paprika and liked it with the rice served with it.but one thing which will take me back there is their CHICKEN TETRAZINI. it was heavenly,a must try for cheese lovers! the quantity was apt for two. Adding to that we loved CHICKEN FACON DU CHEF , CHEFS SPECIAL CHCKEN, CHICKEN MEXICANA and BAKED FISH . Loved every bit of everything.

Loads of restaurants in Calcutta advertise themselves as 'authentic' for their cuisines that aren't really. This one however was really close.

The menu items all sounded good and it was tough to decide. My Cannelloni with spinach and cheese was heavenly and only with a heavy heart could I share a little with my friend. It was worth the 15 minute wait to be seated, that.  Only question is, when I go next time (very soon), should I try something new or try what I loved the first time.

Went to One Step Up yesterday with friends. Have been here before also.  One place in Park Street which serves pretty nice continental food yet you will surely not wait for hours for a place. 
We ordered prawn cocktail and chicken fingers for starters. Chicken fingers was fine but prawn cocktail had most probably a bit more tomato base than required. Along with it, ordered Long Island Iced Tea which had been my previous favourite here. Earlier this wasn't in the drinks menu but they did make it on request and it was wonderful. This time didn't like that much as it was more diluted. 
Moving to main course, we ordered grilled fish, prawn neumberg and khow suey. 
Grilled fish is a speciality here and it was just perfect. The fish and its sauce was properly cooked and tasted awesome. Same goes for prawn nuemberg with curry and rice, was delightfully lipsmacking. 
If you want to taste something off beat, try out khiw suey a burmese dish, magnificently garnished separately with a large bowl of noodles in gravy. This also tasted nice. 
So sunday night well spent and well fed here.  Will surely recommend all for nice course of continental food.

I had been wanting to try this place out for a while now and I did get my chance on a Saturday afternoon. We tried the Veg Cream Soup with the Spaghetti Aglio Olio. My wife loved the food and so did I. I helped my food down with a couple of beers. The place has a bar of it's own and they seem to have quite a selection of hard liquor. The food menu was quite extensive as well. They had both Continental and Indian choice. Service was good and the although the decor was minimal, it suited to ambiance just fine. Finally for the price, for the location, and quality of food, the price was just right. Will definitely make another visit soon.

One Step Up can be called a modern-day restaurant in the heritage of park street. The food is not like the typical Calcutta Food that you generally have and the place has some specialties in store which is not available elsewhere. That is what I had learnt about the place before entering.

The dish we ordered was chicken tetrazinni and it was the first time that I was about to have it without having an iota of its whereabouts. We also ordered a funky named cocktail, "Volcano". The dish came pretty late and it was only after two three reminders that the waiter served the food. But given to the nice ambiance of the restaurant, and some really nice people who come here to eat, this waiting time did not bother us much. The dish was really tasty. Not for the ones who are conscious of their fat intake, this dish is built in molten cheese. The boneless chicken chunks cooked in a thick gravy of mushroom white sauce were absolute delight and quiet a mouthful. The drink on the other hand was quiet ordinary and had to be forcefully gulped down.

The waiters are well behaved and speak good English. They could even explain from where Tetrazinni originated and how was it cooked.
I look forward to visit this place again and try out one more of their odd sounding dishes.
Adios.!

This is probably one of the most under rated restaurants in Park Street.  Great taste and value for money considering the location, availability and hence the high rating.  Definitely not for the fine dining people, but good hangout with friends and family who are looking for good food and decent service. 
My favorite is the paprika (both veg and chicken) and the tetrazinni, Other continental dishes tried have never disappointed me. 
The one thing that definitely needs a change is the starter menu.

One Step Up is probably my favourite restaurant in Park Street. A reason behind that might be I had never had to wait outside on a queue to get inside this hotel. There was a time I used to go there 3 times in a month or maybe even more.

The sitting arrangement is distributed between two floors. Although the sitting arrangement is cramped, I like the citrus colored interiors and the bright neon colored chairs.It gives a very youthful vibrant feel to the place

The service is ever smiling and very courteous.

The food is the highlight of this restaurant.They serve both Indian and Continental but I have only had the Continental from here. From the starters I highly recommend the Chicken and Herb Salad, the Herby Chicken Fingers. But I think the best amongst the starters is the Fish Finger. The fish is always fresh.For the main course my favourite are again the fish items, Grilled Fish in garlic lemon butter sauce, Fish meinuiere and the Grilled Fish Cilantro. I have found the fish to be always fresh and hence it makes all the dishes taste so much better. Among the chicken items, the Chicken Mexicana which they serve with this amazing garlic sphagetti and the Chicken Tropicana are quite delicious. I am also quite fond of the garlic bread here. They also make a mean vodkatini, which is quite hard hitting. But the prices actually does not hit your pocket hard at all. It is very reasonable for the quantity and quality of food they serve.

One thing though, I seriously wish they would stop serving mashed potatoes out of a can. It sometimes destroys an otherwise delicious dish. They could just roast some potatoes instead. It is easier and would be much more appreciated.I have to deduct one point for that.

I really like this place.. The food (specially the veg paprika) is amaaazing.. 
The ambience can be a 100 times better.. The service is nice too.
We ordered garlic cheese toast.. Which didn't live upto our expectations.. It was just too cheesy..and the bread didn't have the flavor of garlic. 
However I'm absolutely in love with the veg paprika and I never fail to have that whenever  I visit. 
So there goes an absolutely biased rating for that paprika itself!
A little renovation of the place and it'd get a perfect 5!!

One Step Up is a good restaurant on Park Street that serves a number of Continental and Indian dishes. The ambience is good, though one wishes they didn't have orange chairs and plasticky-looking tables, given that they project themselves as a high-end sit-down restaurant.
 
Most of the food ordered here over several visits has been quite good. Apart from Mocambo, this restaurant is the only one on Park Street that serves good Continental food. Among the starters, the Fish Fingers and the Mexican Chilly Baby Corn are especially recommended. The salads are best avoided.
 
The main courses are surprisingly good, both in terms of quantity and quality. The fish used in the dishes is very good, so the Grilled Fish, the Fish Florentine and the Fish 'n Chips (which can be ordered as a starter as well) are particularly well made. Among the chicken dishes, I would single out what they call the "Chicken Ceciliana" and the Chicken Stroganoff.
 
The service is slow, which is possibly the only major drawback of the place. Apart from that, this is certainly a good place to go and eat at in Calcutta.

I sincerely hope that that they rename a part of Park Street as Food Street or revelry street. While this restaurant competes with numerous others on Park Street the food always has a certain standard which if not sweeps one off one's feet leaves them feeling satisfied, as is the ways with this side of the town. Then again one should probably avoid Italian food at this place. Their fish n chips is quite tasty but then again it would take special talent to mess up something as simple as chunks of fish fillet dipped in batter and deep fried and served with a basic tartar sauce. On several occasions that I have tried their fish n chips I have found the fish to always be fresh and the tartar sauce was  probably served straight out of a jar but was  nevertheless tasty. The chicken facon du chef is quite tasty but the taste is a bit too creamy for my palate. The ambiance is not spectacular but the place is of course hygienic and clean. The ingredients used are fresh which is probably due to the closeness of this restaurant to the wonderful market and that is always an upside.

It's a nice place for a quiet italian diner, the dishes are authentic as far as possible in kolkata. Tried the stroganoff and chicken a la kiev here, the latter being exceptionally good.

This is the place where I turn to blindly, when I'm really looking for some good food. Both the Italian n Indian dishes are delectable. I speak so as a vegetarian.
The Risotto n the Canelloni are a must try.
The ambience is the small downside in the otherwise excellent restaurant. The staff are really upto the mark.
I recommend the place to any vegetarian who's looking for some lip-smacking Italian fare.

Food is good. Specially continental dishes. 

Try Chicken Ala kiev. 

Price is moderate. Decor is ok. We tried one Indian dish. " Chicken Shashlik ". Consists of butter, rice, chicken kabab, salad etc. It was really nice and resembled Chello kebab of Peter Cat. The chicken kebabs were really good.

Step in at One Step Up and pamper your taste buds!
4.5 out of 5

Lined with restaurants and food joints, Park Street area in Kolkata is always crowded with food lovers, hailing from all corners of the city.  From street food stalls to posh five star restaurants, Park Street resembles a unique montage of variations, styles and tastes. Here, you can get mouth watering food in some restaurants by paying a few hundred bucks while eating in some would be a pocket pinch for many. Well, I am a kind a person who follows the middle path. I don't go in for the cheap ones nor will I be seen hanging out at five-star food hubs. I prefer restaurants in Park Street that offer delicious food at reasonable rates, and I think One Step Up is once such restaurant where you get to eat scrumptious Continental and North Indian food at very nominal cost ( meal for two costs approximately Rs. 900 + Vat + service charges). 

I have eaten at One Step Up dozens of times, and I keep trying difference items from their menu. I still remember the first time I was here, I ordered a couple of Continental dishes and (I must say) I was truly satisfied. My order consisted of seafood chowder soup (a soup prepared with mixed mince of seafood and cream). Seafood is cooked with cream to bring out the salty- sweet taste. My main course included chicken Sicilian ( a taste preparation of chicken - whole chicken breast cooked in white sauce with mushrooms, topped with asparagus before baking), spaghetti carbonara (spaghetti pasta with alfredo sauce, bacon & egg yolk, topped with parmesan cheese) and fish steak (bhetki fillet cooked to perfection and served with mushroom sauce).  Each item was superbly delicious! That is the beauty of One Step Up - Brendon and his team are great at serving you consistent fare every single time you dine here! 

The next time I was at One Step Up I decided to dig into their Indian preparations. This time my table was laid with hot bowls and plates of tandoori chicken, mutton seekh kebab, cheese naan and chicken shashlik (boneless chicken kebabs prepared with capsicum and tomatoes and served on a bed of buttered rice). This time, I also ordered some hot chocolate truffle (spongy and yummy!), just the right kind of thing after a sumptuous meal. The credit for preparing such delicious food obviously goes to the master chef at One Step Up. I must say that he has mastered the art of cooking perfectly. He knows the appropriate proportions of ingredients to use to make each item taste appetizing. The next time you are in Park Street, just drop in here if you can get a table!

A great place to have Continental food. I've loved the Chicken Stroganoff and the Chicken a la Kiev here. Also, somehow the flavour of the sauces they use here has affected my fragile, gravy loving mind more than most places.
I must add: the waiters here also behave with just the right amount of politeness, and that definitely adds to the experience. A wee bit overpriced, but certainly worth a visit.

I have been planning to eat here quite some time now and today was the day I went here for some light lunch. The restaurant is kind of small even though it has 2 floors the seating capacity isnt too many. We sat in an oddly placed table for two and then moved upstairs where we were more comfortably seated. The service is ok nothing wowish about it. We ordered for a pepsi, Pinacolada, fish fingers with tartar sauce, chicken in a basket and caramel custard. The Pinacolda was lovely it isnt as good everywhere, there are very less places that make lovely Pinacoladas and this was one of them, the blend was perfect. The fish fingers were great too nice and soft and crunchy and soft on the inside ( mouthwatering?! I know ;) ) and the chicken in the basket was good with a lot of chicken in it and both these dishes were served with french fries like everywhere. Lastly we had the caramel custard which wasnt good really, a bit over baked I guess but I have had better ones. What surprised me was the bill which mounted up to 1070 I could call this a bit over priced taking my order into consideration. All in all an ok ok place to go to but there are better options in Park Street!

ghastly pathetic service. zero in hospitality mannerisms.
they do consciously let the customers stand n sit at lurch...till the time they curse their decision to having stepped over to this joint and leave.. perhaps a way to keep their work lean..
food is just average with an xcessive tag. thats what makes them earn their budgeted dough from a few billers...n ignore the rest...
as a calcuttan n a foodie I strongly advise custom newers to think through n hop in at any of the city's new restaurants with creative cuisine n receptable mannerisms.... they firget they earn their living from billers and billers repeat only on good service and mannerisms.

This is a well known place for its continental dishes served and rightly. It consists of two floors and is almost always crowded. It stays open all day and you can drop in whenever you please. The ambiance is not great however the place is pretty well furnished and comfortable.
Now coming to the menu. The offer continental dishes. For starters you may try Prawn Gambas al azilo, or their traditional Caesar salad that comes in both veg and non-veg.
For vegetarian main course you can try Char grilled exotic vegetable lasagne! And for non veg i have got a huge list of my favorites.I swear by Chicken ala kiev here. It is heavenly! Others are Chicken tetrazini, Chicken Facon du chef, chicken stroganoff. A tetrazini you might not be able to finish alone. Try splitting it into two. Order bread rolls or Garlic bread! You can also go for fish and chips if you are having a light meal. Also the lasagne ala bolognaise is something worth trying! Take a pick!

So far as i know they also serve indian, though i have never tried them. you can order those as well. Do visit and have fun! :)

The restaurant is located in the heart of Park Street. 
Once you enter the place you wont feel like it matches upto other counterparts in vicinity.
The sitting is not great its ok..Would make you feel you have entered some runaway office goers daily restaurant. We straight away ordered the starters...a kebab platter.
I would rate it 4..as it was having good amount of food for 4 people..It was quite tasty as well.
The ambiance was not good at all...Kitty party was going on in full swing so it was damn noisy...
We tried other north indian food which was decent enough...The main turnoff was the ambience and sitting arrangement.

This one is located in the heart of Kolkata 'Park Street'. No one will ever have a problem locating it. To start with the ambience is well done and quite clean. People who love continental food must visit this one. Their salads are nice with Ceaser salad being my favourite. I love their desserts. The pricing I feel is a bit on the higher side but not very expensive at the same time. The staff is quite friendly and cheerful which will impress you. Park Street is filled with amazing restaurants but this one definitely stands out among all. 
I would rate it 3.5 as I always have a pleasant experience here but not a great one.

I have been to one step up quite a few number of times. Today i visited again and was pleasantly satisfied with the experience. After having shopped in park street for 2 hours i and my friend were very hungry and wanted to eat continental food. We headed to One step up. 

We ordered a Spagetti pasta and a Paneer shashlik, and 2 beers. 
The paneer shashlik was very good. Spagetti pasta was also very good. The taste and preparation of the food was satisfactory.  The beers were chilled.

The staff was courteous and familiar with the menu card items. The positives of the place are
location, food quality, and service. The negatives could be an average ambiance and slightly overpriced.

At around 8.30 on a Saturday night, our group of 6 people hit One Step Up. We ordered pretty fast, and apart from the drinks, we ordered a plate of Crispy Chicken Fingers and Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce. 

The crispy chicken fingers were good... albeit nothing to write home about. I loved the sauce it came with - spicy with chillies and garlic in it. The fish was good too, albeit the quantity was low... however, the accompanying mash was really tasteless and felt like it was made from potato flakes reconstituted. 

The service was fast and our drinks were served quickly. Overall, not bad!

I have been there quite few times. Its located at Park Street. 

Its having a ordinary ambience and food quality is good too. Chicken Stroganoff is my favourite  and also the tomato soup. Chicken Tetrazzini is good and i never miss Fish Florentine. Staffs are well-behaved and prices are affordable. 

Please visit there...its a nice place to visit...

3.5 from me.

Simple place with awesome food.

The chicken paprika is awesome and so is the veg( for vegetarians). The cream of tomato is really good to (classic parkstreet tomato soup), so is the prawn cocktail.

Good quick service and helpful staff with good knowledge about the menu.

Haven't tried much here cos i can stop myself from ordering the chicken paprika and by the time i finish that im too stuffed to even breathe. Will come back soon for you my chicken paprika :-D

Okay,I don't like this place,for a number of reasons.
Firstly,it isn't as inexpensive as it sounds. I've had far more reasonable(and satisfying) meals at Peter Cat than in here,so why would I pay more for less value?
I'm not a stickler for ambiance,so this resaturant's rather plain look(almost like a house where people have just moved in!) doesn't bother me all that much but things could be made a little more lively with good music. The first floor dining is better,with a view of the road(lovely on an evening).
As for the food,they haven't got a great variety. The continental fare isnt upto the mark: the breads are often too dry and chewy,the baked dishes often seem just about boiled with huge,chunky pieces of vegetables. I much prefer their veg dishes to their non-veg ones. Now that almost every cafe serves dishes like chicken a la kiev, there's no special reason to go all the way to one step up for it,specially since it tastes pretty average.
They dont have a great variety of cocktails and are often closed without any apparent warning or reason. 
As for desserts,nothing new or especially yum has attracted my attention.Having flury's next door means people automatically head there for a sweet something after meals. :)

Must say the continental food here is quite a catch . Chicken a la kiev was yum and buttery just the way its supposed to be.Service was brilliant as the servers were very polite, jovial and quick.

Menu wise quiet a spread in terms of food and alcohol and most importantly very pocket frenly.

Honestly,I wasn't too keen on the place due to its plain ambiance. Dint strike me and made me opt other places in Park Street. But visiting the place was definitely a good choice. I just wish they do the place and make it more appealing. 

Above all a reasonable and good food joint and would recommend it to conti.lovers for sure. 

Also note its isn't any fancy restaurant so don't expect class or go for fine dining. Its a casual place for casual hangout.

Gone to this restaurant few days back only and have been here quiet a few times before also and as always I like the quality of food served here....its a small place, reasonably priced and full emphasis is on quality...keep it up...

Only thing I don't like about this place is seating arrangement...since its a small place chairs are not very comfortable and table is bit small...

One of the few places you can start with continental stuff as a student.. Quite affordable given the location. Even though theres not a lot of space.. nice ambience!! great place to sit, eat, sip a drink or two and spend an afternoon. Chicken Tetrazzini is a must here!! Nice and friendly staff!

Four years back, the only major problem with this place was the tacky furniture. But now it has just become a complete mess.I ordered a chicken steak last week, which arrived a good 40 minutes later and when I enquired I was told how it requires time and I was being impatient. As if I had never had a steak before.¬†
Only if the food was upto the mark I would have not made an appeal here. If you want to have good food in peace stay away from this place.¬†
¬†Anyway once the food arrived, I realised I had just wasted my money. The portion was small,the ¬†meat was slightly undone and instead of vegetables, there were three kinds of potatoes (mashed, fried and boiled). The french fries had become soggy due to improper plating of the sauce. For the money they charged, any other restaurant in Park Street would have put up better quality food.
This along with the fact that the waiters were rude made it a bad experience. This place has lost its charm.¬†
Definitely not recommended for foodies.

Park Street has been blessed with a lot of fine dining options over the years and One Step Up is no exception to that trend. Situated on the haloed path which also hosts Flurys and Peter Cat, One Step Up has not only kept the reputation of the street alive but also contributes to its fame. It is a cozy place for a nice family or friends dinner over music and alcohol. The genre of food is mainly continental though they also have the Indian section available for the mains. The most notable items would be Chicken Ala Kiev, Chicken Paprika, Fish Florentine and the Seafood Platter. A decent variety of Mocktails are also available for those who are not keen on the Single Malt whiskey unlike me. The pocket pinch is around Rs 700 without alcohol and around Rs 1200 with alcohol for a couple. Good food suppresses the average decor in this place. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed.

Park Street has a number of eating options to choose from, starting with a five-star hotel to a humble roadside roll shop. One Step Up, however, is literally that. It stands out from other eating joints in terms of its great selection of continental food. Granted, those who prefer extremely spicy fare, may be a bit disappointed, but then again, continental food is more about subtle flavours than in-your-face ones. It is here that the food offered by One Step Up certainly does not disappoint. Some must-try dishes include the Chicken Ala Kiev and the Chicken Paprika.

The one thing you should be concerned about is how much you'll eat when you'll eat here.

The paprika was good, the lasagna was excellent, the cocktails were fantastic and the service was smooth. One small point about ambiance though, I think they can do a whole lot better in terms of ambiance, they were going for the simple and casual touch in terms of the decorations, but personally I would have preferred a little more class in the interiors. As in, please buy some comfortable seating arrangements that also look glamorous and you guys can not go wrong!

Love this place for its informal ambiance and the casual and minimal decor which makes it a great place to unwind, especially during pujas. 
Great finger food to go with drinks, amazing continental dishes for the main courses.. and reasonably priced drinks..all make this place a great HIT.
For all park st fans, this place is a must visit!

Went last month to this place, and I have to say the place has a very good feel to it. A friend told me that the place made very good steak's so I visited. 

I ordered a Chicken Steak, and sat there for a long time. Sad thing is the delivery takes a very long time, and as a person with limited time I didn't really appreciate that. So one star is cut because of that.

The Steak was pretty good. The gravy tasted kinda bland but not non edible. Half a star cut for that.

Now the price, the price is very good for a place in Park Street, but well, it could have been lower. Not a place a college student like me could visit every week. Half a star cut for that.

But would i go back again? I will, as it is a very good place. Some very good continental dishes undoubtedly.

My first impression as I walk into the restaurant recently is that the place has seen better days. And it has. I remember eating here a few years ago and everything was amazing. Food, drinks, crowd, decor. Unfortunately, my last visit with my family to this restaurant might end up being my last literally.

Bland food, smoking, lack of lighting, shabby decor and unpleasant looking crowd makes this restaurant a shadow of its former self. I would recommend this restaurant, only as a last option.

the portions of food i felt were too big..you could just fill urself up with a single starter.
and a bit too overpriced i thought.

I have been visiting the place from the time it opened about a decade back.
The continental food was good. Excellent mocktails. The crowd was decent, with more college goers and teenagers. Off late all that has changed.
The food, quality and taste is now more indian. The mocktails are watered down.
Worst of all, there are usually groups of rough looking characters frequenting the place, and smoking too. The restaurant does not object to this, cosidering that now smoking in an air conditioned restaurant is expressly prohibited.
One would never step in "one step up" with family again.

When you have had so many times at Peter Cat and Mocambo on Park street, and you are in for something a bit different and if its towards the end of the month and you are a bit tight on the pocket, One Step Up is the perfect place to go to!To begin with, their warm chicken salad and own version of Ceaser salad( with breadcrumbs and cheese grated on the top) are must tries, and if you are a salad person you might as well complete your lunch with such a salad and a bottle of beer or maybe a nice cocktail( or mocktail),its that filling! The continental specialities which are just mouth watering are Chicken Tropicana(filled with a vibrant flavored prawn),the chef's special chicken and of course the classic chicken ala kiev(with sinful runny butter) and  chicken stroganoff!!!!! If you like Asian flavors, the red thai curry and the green thai curry will quite please you, the khowsuey is also very well prepared! I have never tried out their indian cuisine, but going by their standards it shouldnt be dissapointing! The quantity is very satisfactory and the price is also pleasent to the wallet!!!! And now the final cherry on the cake, if you are seated on the second floor, the magnificent view of park street (specially at night) is a treat you wont want to miss,after all the Champs elysees of Kolkata it is!!!!!In all i would rate the restaurant not less than a 3.8 out of 5... :)

Go to One Step Up for their Continental fare. I am a regular. 

Their Prawn Muniere, Chicken Facon Du Chef and Chicken Ala Kiev are amazing! 
I would not recommend the Indian food here, although they have quite and Indian section too, and if you do order Indian, do not order fish here. The ambiance is pretty good given it's location and the service is very good. 
So head for One Step Up, it's a treat!

A quality continental restaurant with great potentials. The potentials however need to be extended on hospitality, ambiance and crowd control. If you want to pay a first visit to this place in the middle of park street then trust me weekends are not the days for you when this place turns into a fish market. The dishes are generous in their proportions but lack presentation with a capital P. But the food is well above average and if you are ready to compromise on the secondary issues you would actually like the place!!
Cheers!!
