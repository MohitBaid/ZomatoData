Had Butter Naan, Dal Makhani and Paneer Butter Masala ... All of the dishes were tasty and prices were reasonable also... so a pocket friendly place indeed

Good food, good services, chicken rolls are great. Home delivery could be better as the minimum charge is a bit high for one person. It's 400rs.

I've ordered from this place several times. I liked their Chinese more than Indian cuisines. I tried their Veg fried rice n Garlic fish which was pretty good. Ambience is nothing good. Prices are decent.

I tried their Mutton Biriyani. Its really nice and i found it to be better than many other famous Biriyani places in Kolkata. It was much more flavourful and healthy. Staffs were not that effiecient and friendly. One should try their Indian and Mughlai cuisine. I did a take away because of the attitude of the staffs.

The person who sits at the counter thinks that he is the only person alive to run a restaurant in the city. I have not faced such a rude behaviour from the staffs till date. I do not know what make them so arrogant. They lack the decency to talk to customers and the staffs are not at all trained. The ambience is so dirty. A restaurant just serving food with no proper knowledge and decency is definitely not a good option to visit.

This place is very near too Jadubabu's bazaar in bhowanipur, easily located. I am reviewing this restaurant after ordering and dining there for at least a dozen times. Their indian cuisine is really good I have tried their veg dishes as well which really nice. But their rolls are something that I love and their Reshmi kebab was the best of the lot. And this place is moderately priced. I have also tried some bevarages like cold coffee and sweet lime soda which were not heavenly but will not disappoint you.

What did we love?
‚óè Crispy Baby Corn.
‚óè Fried Rice (veg)
‚óè Hakka Chowmein (veg)
‚óè One full chicken handi.
A bill of Rs 747/- for 5 people (including 2 children ) was great.

Ambience is fine. Service is not so good. 
Food quality is unstable and sometimes they make good dishes and sometimes the quality and taste is not so good. 
Recommended dishes would be lehsuni kabab which I loved and tandoori kabab. 
Butter masala is also good.

The staff and manager are not only very bad, but they lie to customers too. They proclaim in bold letters outside their restaurant that on Sundays & Wednesdays all items (except seafood and tandoori items) are worth Rs. 110. But this is a lie. There are several items like Chicken Handi, Mutton Rara, Keema Mutton, etc, are not discounted at all. When this is pointed out to the manager, he gets very rude and makes it appear that customers are idiots for even bringing up this issue! This apart there are problems with their food too, like I got spoilt stinking chicken in my roll, which they would not reimburse or replace. This is not a restaurant that reads our reviews and tries to improve. Rather they just don't care! So for all those people who like good hygienic food and good service, please boycott this place!! Hopefully they will then improve someday in the future, or alternatively they will go out of business and a better restaurant will take their place.

I'll give you like it is. And all the folks I know who've been down here share the same sentiments so I'm not only writing this as my own opinion - but also theirs.The employees are total c*nts. And to top it off - the food tastes like awful, boiled retirement home food for neglected old folks. You can get 10x better stuff at half the price out here in Kolkata.

But if you're a glutton for really crappy service - RAVIZ IS THE PLACE TO GO! Where the employees don't care and neither does the manager as long as you show them the money.

They don't even give two craps about their menu items being mispelled. And if you ask them about the confusion - you'll be met with a half-assed unmotivated answer in the form of a mumble. NOTE! When you order "Chicken Chop" as it's listed on the menu - it's actually "Chicken Chaap" and when we let them know about this - the manager or the cashier or whoever that useless retarded guy was - he just said, "There's not a food item in the WORLD called 'Chicken Chop' ". Freaking applause for this dumbass! Standing ovation! He just made an actual food item NOT EXIST because he had his head too deep in his butt to accept his fault! LMAO!

Talking to them and discussing the matter is like punching a bag full of crap - you get crap on yourself too. So if you step inside - and have actually tasted decent food in your entire life - you'll know what I mean.

I'm surprised this place doesn't have a lower rating.

But oh well.

Whatever floats your boat.

Situated near Netaji bhawan metro station, in the middle of jagu bazaar this restaurant is kinda underrated.
A decent place with minimal d√©cor, it serves both Chinese and Mughlai. I've tried both but personally I liked the mughlai dishes more than Chinese. Often neglected because of its location, but to be very honest I find here's biriyani and kebabs much better than some so called good restaurants!
Good food in a reasonable price with a great quantity..And what else do we need?

NOTE : this restaurant doesn't levy any additional tax.

Even if you have the best of food in town if the service and behaviour is not good you are not fit for the hospitality industry.
Sad to see these kind of behaviour from restaurants. The staffs doesnt have sufficient knowledge which adds to their disasterous performance.
Being rude with customers when the fault is complety from the other side is something this restaurant has done quite a few times.
Being a blogger and visiting so many places across the city I have never given 1 to anyone but I didnt have any choice here.
Its high time you all need a quality check.

It was a hotel with dine in restaurant and a Chinese rools counter outside. They serve north indian dishes and mughlai cuisine. North indian dishes were good and mughlai cuisine tastes above average. I liked the most north indian vegetables and biryani. Food was average, place was beautiful. Good experience.

Decor : Moderate....

Location : Absolutely brilliant.. Very Easy to find....

Food : We ordered chicken reshmi kabab as starter....2 Kashmiri Polao, 1 Chicken Reshmi butter masala and 1 Chicken Rezala....

Chicken Reshmi Kabab ¬†Was absolutely briliant... it made our expectation very high...
But as soon as main course arrived our expectations were shattered...
Kashmiri Polao was the worst polao i ever had....they should name it Kashir(Cough) Polao..... but it was not the worst thing we had here.... Rezala was even more worse than the polao.. it was like a bowl of water having a piece of meat in it... Though the Chicken Reshmi butter masala was still better... but it was not enough to compensate....¬†

Definitely wont head to this place for second time...

Been here a lot of times, mostly for takeaway. The kebabs are quite good. Try Lahsuni Kabab, it's got a good flavour. Raviz special chicken in the Chinese section is amazing. So is the Kadhai Paneer and Kashmiri Pulao.

Its a new restorant in bhowanipur ( opened 1-2 yrs hardly). Food quality n quantity is good in compaison to the price but there is no bar! Mainly serve north indian n muglai quisine recently they opened a take away for fast food mainly rolls with different ingredients that too is not bad, quality of kebabs r quite good n price seems affordable interior decor seems fine n ppl of vicinity prefer nowadays to dine in coz its clean n hygienic with a provision of air condition

I ordered food from here just a few minutes back and guess what! I made the biggest mistake. The people here have so much attitude.... For a parcel of Rs.400, they fail to give a change of a 500 note and on asking for a change the parcel guy replied with such an irritating attitude. I quote him "500 taka change to hobe na, dokane bolben giye, eito ekhuni ekta parcel dilam,apnader kache change thakena?" And icing on the cake was done when I called the restraunt. Without a single tone of apology they said " ok madam!" JUST THIS!NEVER EVER VISIT THIS RESTRAUNT,YOU'LL ONLY GET A PLATE FULL OF BAD ATTITUDE AND BAD BEHAVIOUR....

I only ordered biriyani once from raviz for 5ppl . That was a dissappointmnt.. After tiring work in the hospital since morning we were looking forward to the biriyani for lunch.. Sadly the biriyani was very average. The rice was dry , the chickn and the potato had no flavour..tasted very bland !! The biriyani was a bit too spicy for my liking.. Simply put i didn't like it.

We always order food from raviz when I visit a friend's house in Bhawanipore. The Indian dishes are good, including the biriyani, which I actually find disappointing in most places. But the tandoori roti! That was one hell of an experience. It was so hard that we could not even tear it, let alone have it. We never ordered any kind of roti or naan after that. Also, the Chinese dishes are not up to the mark.

Tasted from Raviz for the first time since it opened. We took home delivery and they clearly mentioned that they would home deliver for order over rs300 . They also do deliver in pretty decent time. We ordered palak paneer which was good taste, chicken bharta which was not that good in taste n too much oily and we had chicken biryani it was tasteless but quantity n 2pcs of chicken were good n juicy. Would say on a cheaper option it was ok.

Raviz - A horrible experience.¬†
=====
Location + Intro:¬†
Raviz is Located near Netaji Bhawan Metro Station. Been there a few days back to try out the mughlai dishes. When you see the restaurant on outside, you can see combo meals at quite reasonable prices. I wanted to try their combo but due to unavailability at that particular time, i stuck up to biriyani.¬†

The ambience of the place is strange. The seatings of 1 floor is divided into 3 sections like a stack. The music played here is very old style. The stewards and waiters are not much bothered about the table. The menu was also just laminated and in no way makes you feel like you are in a restaurant. Nevertheless, after observing the ambience (Chandelier - the only good thing) , i continued with my order.
=====¬†
Food Ordered:

1) Chicken Special Biriyani @ 160 - Two big pieces of Chicken was served with one potato and rice on top. One of the chicken piece was uncooked totally and served to me which made me call out the staff and he apologised and changed the plate. However, the rice had a bit of flavour and a lot of oil to it. The aloo was decent having a little sweetish touch to it.¬†

2) Raita - It was presented very nicely but it was so thick that it turned out to be curd. Highly disappointed with it.¬†
=====
Pros:

1) Location is nearby market place and metro station.
2) A lot of space to accommodate many tables.¬†
3) Reasonably priced.
4) Good quantity of Food

Cons:
1) Bad Food Quality¬†
2) Bad hospitality.
3) Staffs are not well trained.
4) Serving uncooked chicken is absolutely a disgust.¬†
=====
Summary:

Food quality 2.4/5
Food quantity 3.6/5
Taste 3.2/5
Hygiene 2.3/5
Ambience 3.1/5
Value for money 2/5
=====
Conclusion: Frankly speaking, i would not revisit it again because they served me uncooked chicken. Even the raita was not like raita. Really very disappointed.¬†

On a friend's birthday he had ordered a takeaway from raviz. The order was biriyani, fried rice and chilli chicken. The biryani was superb, the fried rice was good but the chilli chicken was disappointing. It was not like the one you would like to have with fried rice. Rest the food is good.

surprisingly decent & pocket friendly is how i will introduce  raviz .  located near chakraberia more in bhowanipore , it is one of those underrated places you would love to explore , specially when you 're on a budget .   The food   here is not what  one would call gourmet , but regular indian fare with a few innovations thrown in . I went there with family to have a  quiet time & i wasn't disappointed . Coming to our order , we had 1 plate of lassoni kebab ( rs 140 ) , a plate of regular reshmi kebab ( rs 150 ) along with 1 plate of tandoori fish ( rs 200 ) for starters . the lassoni kebab was succulent as was the reshmi . The fish took a while to prepare ( approx 15 mins ) but had regular bhetki instead of the cheaper alternatives we find in restaurants nowadays . satisfied but not yet satiated , we went for the main course . we  decided to check out their mutton delicacies , by ordering 1 plate of mutton rara punjabi ( rs 160 ) & 1 plate of kadai mutton ( rs 140 ) , accompanied by 1 plate of peas pulao ( rs 80 ) & 3 plain naan ( 3 X 25 =  rs 75 ) & not to forget 2 bottles of cold drinks ( rs 25 X 2 = 50 ) . the mutton rara punjaabi  was a revelation ,  juicy pieces of mutton assorted by a gravy of keema ( mincemeat ) , it should be a must try for anyone having indian at raviz . the same sadly cannot be said of the kadai mutton , which i found to be a bit of a let down . But then again    one cannot complain , when  one is having regular fare & not gourmet stuff . The bill  came at rs 995 +  tax =   rs 1200 , which i found to be  quite affordable for a full course meal for 4 persons . Overall, a  good place to beat the queue ( as you're always guaranteed a table , even during rush hour  )  or to catch   up with friends & family , without burning a hole in your pocket .

A newly opened joint, located in Bhawanipur nearby netaji bhawan metro station. The interiors are simple yet has cozy touch, the ambience of this place is soothing with dim lights all around. It has multi-floor sitting arrangements and has amply spacious to accommodate around a minimum of 25 people easily. They serve both mughlai and Chinese cuisines. I dropped into this joint few weeks back with my friend, we ordered biriyani, mutton rezala and chicken tandoori. We received our order within a reasonable amount of time, the sizes of the chicken pieces could have been a bit bigger(though the taste was quite good), the rezala was pretty yummy and worth cherishing and finally the biriyani was really not up to the mark, it was very dry, the rice grains were stuck with one another and lacked the distinctive aroma; but the portion of serving was quite abundant. The prices are legitimately fixed. Overall it was an average experience. As because this area lacks abundant choices of standard multi cuisine restaurants, hence this restaurant is the best option to turn up to for a decent dining experience.

Someone got a few packets of chicken biryani packed for us at where I teach part-time. I was not very impressed at all. The biryani rice was a bit mushy. Overall taste is what killed it, for it seems over and above the natural biryani flavour there seemed to be either added rock salt or plain salt. The potato to wasn't so tasty. The chicken piece was large enough and fairly okay.

The salad was nothing great. Even the onions seemed tasteless.

My colleague though spoke well of the restaurant.

Lack of good restaurants in this area easily make this one of the best possible options.The food is good.And quite easy on the purse.On Wednesdays and Sundays(lunch only),they have an offer where all items on the menu(other than Tandoor items)are priced at Rs. 100.Effectively a very filling meal can cost a person 300 bucks.On non-offer days,that will go up to 400,which is still quite a good deal.The ambience is horrible,with loud Bolly music playing on a TV all the time.The service is quite good.

Raviz is a new restaurant (1 yr old approx) in bhowanipore, beside my house actually. Being a foodie I was of course very excited to find a new multicuisine restaurant beside my house. The restaurant is well-furnished. Food is not bad too. But the service is good only when there is no rush in the restaurant. When the restaurant was opened 1 yr back, we went there & ordered biriyani and chicken bharta. The quantity was too much but the quality of chicken was too bad. However, later we ordered food for take-away which was okay. However, if you order any side dish you will find kabab pieces in differently flavoured gravy.But during the puja we went there (biggest mistake) and waited for 30min to get biriyani and bharta (we were afraid to order anything new). We also ordered salad but did not get as they reported that vegetables were finished in their kitchen ( it was 9.30 pm on Sasthi)! Firtsly our order was served to another table. Secondly, biriyani quantity was not the same in all tables. Waiters are not expert at all. Even for water we had to wait 15-20min. But the Chinese food was good (could't go for dine-in again. It was take-away order). So I would suggest to go for take-away order & not for dine-in,that also in peak season i n Raviz. However, with some properly trained persons and expert management the restaurant could catch good number of foodies in such a lucrative location.

Great food and service, mostly I got the food delivered to my house and still it was fairly warm. Deliveries are usually fairly quick. Chicken lasuni is a must to try. Great appetizer to go along with drinks.

Had taken office delivery few months back. Today 8 of us from office visited the place. Decently done up. Staffs are Ok type. Need to ask for everything. Spoons, fork and water. We ordered

1. Chicken Tandoori 2 plates - Nothing special tasted just like any other places.
2. Crispy chilli Babycorn 2 plates - This was spicy and tasted really good. Finished in a jiffy.
3. Kali Mirch butter Kulcha 2 pc- This was good and well made.
4. Cheese butter Naan 3 pc - I personally didn't have it but those who had it was disappointed with the quality of the naan. Not baked properly.
5. Mutton Rogan Josh 1 plt.- Ok type, but the quality of the mutton was good. 2 pc per serving.
6. Chicken Butter Masala (Delhi style) 4 decent size pcs and taste was good and had thick gravy.
7. Googly - This was yummy. Tasty and 2 pcs of chicken and 2 pcs of mutton. The gravy was spicy and tasted good.
8. Chick Do Piazza - Disappointing. Could not find any piazz in it. More of mutton curry.
9. The mix raita tasted well.
10 Mutton Biriyani - Nothing over the moon. Qty was good.
11. Plain pulao - Though its called pulao its basically ghee rice but well made. I had earlier so went straight for it. Qty was also quite good.
Total bill - Rs. 2200. No vat till now as they have yet to receive the VAT #.¬†
There is offer going on- Sunday and Wednesday all dishes will be charged Rs. 100 except Tandoors and sea food. Timing needs to be checked.
Overall not a bad deal considering the amount you pay. Good for one time visit.

treats from friends are always great wherever it may be..it is a new restaurant in the bhawanipur area where one of my friend decided to give us a small treat..we readily agreed and it is raviz..quite decently decorated and nice ambience with a properly oriented space this restaurant stands out in this area..

i preferred to have mughlai cuisine..some of us ordered for chana kulcha ,butter nan and chicken tikka masala and kadai mutton..and some of us went for chinese options and ordered for chicken hakka noodles,garlic chicken and chilli fish...in the mughlai side nun and kulcha was soft and delicious ..chicken tikka i loved though i dint like kadai mutton..and in the chinese noodles were perfect but the garlic chicken was yuckiesh..yet chilli fish was delicious..overall not a bad experience..
price of this place is quite pocket friendly...and the food quality was not bad but not great..would like to try their biriyani next time as i found their mughlai dishes grt !

Located at the heart of Bhowanipur (at Jadu babu's bazaar), this is one of the newer restaurants serving Indian and Chinese cuisine. Though its been more than a year that it has started its operations, its kinda new to me as I have been thinking of trying it for quite some time. On my way back home from office, I was thinking of taking away food during the weekend and as I reached home, I found that Dad has got food for dinner from Raviz. One hell of a co incidence. 

So today's dinner was mutton Biryani, Aloo paratha and Chicken TIkka Masala. 
I am very selective about the Biryani and as usual it failed to impress me since the mutton piece was not very soft. The rice tasted just average. The aloo paratha was also simple. Potato stuffing was not generous but the paratha was on the drier side which I liked as I dont prefer oil soaked parathas. The Chicken tikka masala on the other hand was splendid. The gravy was slightly red and creamy. Tasted really well and the chicken pieces were soft and tasty. 

Not sure of the service of the restaurant as I did not get the food but shall try out the place. They do have seating options. 
Pricing seems to be very affordable, especially for the chicken items (all within Rs120-150 range)
Rating it 3 as of now

Good kebabs at decent price(liked laswauni kebab,pahari kebab and fish irani tikka very much),I didn't like the mutton item,biryani was not upto the mark. Will visit again definitely but only for the kebabs.

Very good. Went out to RAVIZ with Friends. Had a lovely time, food was delicious. They were quick to serve.. and the best part was, the BILL was given to us seperately.. since they knew, it was a DUTCH by all friends, they gave different bills for each one of us. :)

The ambience is good and well lit. I ordered chicken reshmi butter masala. The price could have been a tad bit cheaper. But it tasted good. It was prepared in a short amount of time. Plus, it's close proximity to my residence is a definite positive point and I would be visiting this place often.
