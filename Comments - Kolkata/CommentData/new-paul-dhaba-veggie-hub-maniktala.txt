Good food. 
Raita was top notch with good amount of curd and vegetables. Amount was also large. 
Salad was also good,  perfectly cut into pieces containing carrot,  cucumber,  onion,  tomato. 
Masala coke was ok, taste like jal jerra.

Had the NPD Special thali. It's absolutely worth the money at Rs.120 + GST. The pulao tasted good and the baby butter naan was very well prepared. Paneer butter masala was the best among all the items.  Dal makhani and chana masala tasted ok. They also serve a big gulab jamun. I will definitely recommend it.

Today I went to this restro to take parcel for home . I have ordered paneer methi malai, mushroom do pyaza and butter nan . Paneer methi was fine not but not exceptional , there was lack of methi in it , I was feeling I'm having paneer tikka masala not methe panner . I have tasted malai methe which is bit similar to that taste it was not matching to it , so this methe paneer disappointed me coz there is no methe in it and its flavour . Mushroom do pyaza was very tasty , with crunchy veggies in it , adding good taste and flavour together . So thumps up for that . The reviews are more than it deserve just coz of mushroom dish .

Located near vivekananda road and Amherst Street crossing. Though the place is small they tried their best to make it a decent place. First floor and second floor altogether have a sitting capacity of around 12 to 15 people. Therefore during the rush hour the narrow ground floor remains crowded with people waiting for getting a seat.
I tried their north Indian items. PALAK PANEER was very tasty. Finger lacking. CHANA MASALA and MALAI KOFTA need special mention. I missed the crispness in LACHHA PAROTA. TANDORI ROTI and NUN were average.
Service was delayed.
Considering the taste and amount served, it was value for money. But ambience and sitting arrangement are not so comfortable.

I have never been to the place myself but have ordered food from here through Zomato. While I have no complaints regarding the delivery, the food in itself was abysmal. I had ordered the starter crispy babycorn and  I don't know how they fried it, but it was hard and actually hurt my teeth. The taste was poor too. I had also ordered the mushroom do pyaza and naan, of which the former was too spicy and had a weird taste, while the latter again, was hard. 
I would not recommend this place.

Today around 1pm I had been there.. I had ordered for crispy chilli baby corn, Hong Kong fried rice and chilli mashroom.. apart from crispy chilli bab. But apart from baby corn, both the dishes were good. But I am disappointed about crispy chilli baby corn, it was much hard..
2ndly, few of the staffs were having a loud conversation among them, made us difficult to enjoy the environment and as well as food. But as a whole new Paul dhaba veggie hub, is a pocket friendly mouth watering veggie hub indeed. Behaviour of serving staff was decent.  Overall experience was moderate..üòäüòäüòä

Located at manicktala loha patti, right opposite the New Paul break down old restaurant. This is a revamped veg version but with little sitting floors with serpentine staircase leading to the storeyed sitting. Sat on the floor where the kitchen is located,hence got a view of nice door and huge fridge.
There is nothing so called of ambience.
Food was standard. Ordered crispy baby corn and chinese bhel. Was on the spicier end of things.
Cold coffee was good.

Well, I placed a pretty modest order for home delivery ‚Äì just 1 plate of Kadhai Paneer from this New Paul Dhaba Veggie Hub based somewhere in Manicktala. And I am quite amazed, after looking at them working so hard for this simple order. They delivered well within time, never mind the sudden downpour of heavy rain and no, they did not charge me a single penny extra for travelling so long to my home at Narkeldanga, nor did they charge anything extra for packing!

Coming to the main course, simply awesome! Chunks of cottage cheese with slices of onions and capsicum, beautifully tempered with optimum spices ‚Äì low oily, good quality as well as great quantity. Needless to say, it was great on taste also ‚Äì and this 1 course served 2 of us! The paneer indeed went very well with the home made chapatis!

Last but not the least, food presentation is great!

Overall, an almost perfect experience ‚Äì and that too by paying just 120 bucks! I wish them the very best of luck and reward them with frequent visits and a biiiiiiiiiiggggggg RECOMMENDATION!

New Paul Dhaba Veggie Hub is a small place with good food at very affordable ( if not cheap) prices. We ordered crispy baby corn, paneer hariyali kebab and sweet corn soup for starters. I liked the corn more than the paneer. For the main course , we had the Thali. The thali had - one naan, rice, kaali daal, paneer butter masala, chana masala, raita, papad, onions, and a gulab jamun. We also ordered sweet lime soda which was fine. I would recommend this place to people who want to have inexpensive yet tasty vegetarian dishes. Bon appetit! üíú

Firstly, bad service; delivery was so late that I was going to cancel it. It was delivered after 1hr 40mins (approx). Food quality may be good when it was packed BUT after so much time, food was cold as ice. So I can say that it was just eatable, nothing good. And the restaurant reception told me they are sending it on "BIKE" but it was a boy in "BICYCLE", that's why it was late by soooo much time. Not good sir.

Hi,

I had been to New paul Dhaba again on Sunday [21st of August] during afternoon hours and ordered for Butter Dhosa and a hot coffee which was horrible. Above all the service this time was pathetic.

The dhosa was horrible as it was without proper butter and more over it was not properly prepared inf act a bit raw. and the coffee was tasteless.  This pissed off my mood.

The service was not good because I had to set for about 25 to 30 in only to order food and after ordering the food I have to wait for 20 min.  and at the end I had to sit for quite long time for a bill, seriously too slow. You need to increase your seed guys and kindly teach your members to give quick service as in when someone asks for bill he/she doesn't have to repeat it twice. 

But at the same time  family the sitting just beside me was given quick service which shows that they [the restaurant's servers] are ignoring me although I was sitting  from past couple of minutes.

I would like to know does the service depend on the amount of expensive food you order and the big crowed you come in with?

If this is the matter than do let me know.

I PREFER NOT TO GO TO THE PAUL DHABA AGAIN.

Last time we came for a dinner at Paul Dhaba, noticed this new veg outlet opposite the old one. Last Tuesday went there as wanted some veg food.

To begin with the place is small, but they have tried well to make it comfortable. A big leap from their old outlet. On the first floor there were 3 two seaters. The seats were comfortable and the AC was good. The table in front of the glass facade is the best one with a view of the busy Vivekananda Road.

Coming to food my first order was the Tandoori Aloo. Food looked great. They also plated it well. The paneer stuffing was decent. But the aloo was overcooked and became very soft. Also there was a covering outside the aloo which tasted more fried than being tandoored. Overall experience was not good. Do not order it if you are looking for a tandoori item.

Next I ordered a veg biryani. Quantity was good. Tastewise it was decent. Not bad, not exceptional too. Also it was more of a puloa than biryani. Veggies were well done and tasted good. There were two paneer pieces which tasted really bad, to the extent of being stale. Also I was told that the biryani is served with two potatoes. But there were none in my plate. When I asked the server, he told the chef might have forgotten adding the potatoes!!! I was already done with the biryani, but still asked him to serve the potatoes separately, as I wanted to taste them. 

I was served two pieces of potatoes in a separate bowl. They were boiled and then fried. As soon as I touched the bowl I understood they have microwaved them. It was still hot. So they boil and fry potatoes separately and then add them to biryanis before serving. Naturally the potatoes were nowhere close to what the biryani aloo should be.

The sweet fresh lime soda was too sweet and hardly had any taste of lemon. 

Coming to prices, this is where they score high. The tandoori aloo was 80, the biryani 95 and the sweet lime soda 30. These prices were all inclusive in an AC restaurant. Don't know any other place in this city which is cheaper.

So, If you are around and want some veg food at pocket friendly rates, this should be the place. I am sure the other items will be better. Will be back to try more.

To the management, please take care of that horrible and stale paneer which came with the biryani.

New Paul Dhaba has name itself in the Maniktalla area for their services from over a decade. Now after serving some delicious Non Vegetarian Dishes they have come up with a Pure Veg Paradise with a new outlet just opposite of the Old one.¬†
After having listened lot about this place Landed up here last week for a lunch with a cousin. Quite a small resto with two floored but contains only 6 tables with a total capacity of 12 people at a time.¬†
Took the seats and the menu card instantly so ordered few of there selected indian Chinese Dishes in forms of¬†

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn : A plate full of fine looking Baby corn with the crispy chilli flavor. A good quantity full of baby corn that were truly crispy but few pieces were difficult to dip with the fork yet tasted pretty decent.

Veg Hakka Chowmien : Tried veg Hakka which is certainly not their specialty but it was worth having a try. Contained good amount of capsicum and onion in it. Taste well and mostly what you can expect from a veg hakka.

Veg Manchurian : It was good and spicy on the other hand. Thou a bit too runny with the gravy but yet tasted well with the hakka noodles.

Sweet Lime Soda : Felt a little disappointed first up when didn't find the Fresh Lime soda and have to take this one. But nothing changed much as the drink truly disappointed me bug time. I felt like having a sikanji at road side.

Experience was quite good with the food until a waiter misbehaved ¬†thats what pissed me off. So management needs to be very cautious about this, it was really unprofessional. ¬†The 3 is for the food only.

*new paul dhaba veggie hub* was on my swiggy list since long, henceforth, today I decided to order their *NPD Special Thali* which was really reasonable & spring rolls. the food was delivered to me on the promised time. it was neatly packed. was quite impressed with the packing. and when it comes to food - the thali consisted of chana masala, paneer butter masala, dal makhni, veg biryani, butter nan, salad, pickle & dahi bada.....and this was quite a steal @ 100/-.  on the other hand, loved the spring rolls, it was yumm...tangy and spicy! and the thali was also awesome in taste :) highly recommended ‚ò∫

Small, cozy place with friendly staff. Being a regular here, I prefer their north indian cuisines specially their dal makhani and tandoori rotis.Beverages are okayish. Cool ambience plus pocket friendly.

This is a one place in maniktalla where one can get wonderful veggies. I find the food here quite tasty. They use good quality of ingredients in making the food. Service boys and management are friendly. I love dosas, veg chow, sandwitch. Vada paw is delicious. In only 90 rupees they are providing a tasteful and mouthful of veg thali. But it has very low space. Dining space is available for only 18 to 20 persons but the decoration is eye pleasing. And the major drawback in my view is the whole area is surrounded by the iron jungle. But the food is appreciable.

Good place for an occasional hunger quench, if you are in Maniktala area and want to stop by for a quick meal then this is the place. Cramped place but offers a variety of fast food and south Indian dishes. Vegetarian though.

New Paul Dhaba Veg Hub was one of my highlights in Kolkata. Anand and his family were very hospitable. I was visiting from out of town and he helped me get to my destination, use the wifi, and he also helped arrange an Ola (not an easy thing to do for a foreigner fresh to India). The food was delicious, the atmosphere was clean and welcoming. Sorry for cancelling the taxi the second time around! ;) Highly recommended!

Serves us all north indian, south indian, desi and Chinese cuisines and all the dishes are looks good, taste good. North indian cuisine is their speciality. best for veggie lover but if want to eat non-veg items then you must visit the old one.
