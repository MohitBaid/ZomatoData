This eatery is situated near Poddar Court. It's a streetside joint with no sitting arrangenents.

Zero ambience.

Service is prompt.

Tried Veg Cheese grilled sandwich & Dahi Kachori. Both tasted decent and well made.

Price is reasonable.

I visited here in the evening today. Most of their item were out of stock. I decided to try their Dahi Kalochuri. The place doesn't have a seating arrangement. There are table beside which you can stand and keep your food and eat. Ambiance is nothing more then a street side restaurant. The Dahi Kachuri we had was completely amazing in taste and also in their presentation.
I would surely visit this place again to try their other dishes.

Rabindra jalpan is a small outlet just opposite to my office at poddar court. It is very popular in offices around this area. People prefer take away as the place is very small. Though there are 4 tables where we can stand and eat.

Service here is excellent. They serve food hot and the service is very prompt. They are very generous is giving extra servings of chutneys and sambhars.

All food here are good and hygenic. They serve varieties of south indian food, sandwiches, snacks , tea, coffee , lassi etc. I have tried most of the items in the menu and all are good. 

Today I tried sambhar Wada and coffee. Both the items were excellent. I think they serve one of the best coffee among local outlets. For sambhar Wada they were generous to offer extra servings of chutneys & sambhar. 

Overall a must try place. Though presentation can be improved specially these days they serve food in thermacol plate. I also feel the items are a bit overpriced.

Channa batura is awesome good for take away also...they serve sandwiches also and south indian also,  masala dhosa tastes a little different not like a typical South Indian dhosa rather a twist of south nd west begal i say...

My favourite lunch place... Rabindra jalpan is my go to place whenever I don't have my lunch with me in office...  The chola bhatura, the Bombay masala club sandwich, the uttapam, the coffee... Its a never ending liat of my favorites... The place is always packed during lunch hours... Even take away takes some time... But the food is amazing... The new additions are also very tempting... If any time in this area you should definitely try this place out... Worth every penny...
