Food was very bad. We ordered chicken basil soup which tasted quite bad, fish cakes which tasted worse, and the "lamb" was actually just goat meat or bangali mutton...and the margarita was not well made. Felt this place is way too over hyped. Definitely did not feel it can get 4. Service of staff was equally bad. The staff kept loading our table with our starters and main course dishes at the same time even when there was no space. And on being asked to wait before they served the main course dishes they said it was alrdy made so they ended up keeping the main course on the window sill beside us, for us to take when we finished our soup and starters. All in all, very bad experience. Will never visit again or even recommend it to anyone.

The decor and food are top-notch, though if you look closer - neither of the two are that well maintained in terms of quality. Overpriced would be an understatement. Good for photo opportunities. Terrible service, the staff seem constantly depressed.
To sum it up, they tried. But overall, it doesn't add up.

The Corner Courtyard wins its game with the ambience. A 0.5 extra for this.Words like 'marvellous', 'fantastic', 'wonderful' can describe this place of aesthetic brilliance. The dim lights added to its quirky eeriness. The vintage feeling. Oh! I love this place. 
The food is good. Well-cooked. The blend of spices is fantastic. Oreo shakes are a love. And the dessert. A bite from heaven itself. ❤️
What wins here is the ambience. Anyday. You get such a regal feeling once you enter this place. The vintage light bulbs, the balcony upstairs, the wall with the keys, the wall with the books, it is all out of a dream it seems. Once in a while you go to this beautiful place and it's being overpriced does not really matter then. 

Had a wonderful experience. 
Thank you!

The interiors of corner courtyard is exceptionally good. The cafe is spacious , quiet and very quirky. Its perfect to spend some time. I would give a 5 on 5 for the decor.
The food on the other side is nice, but the worst part is ,most of the items mentioned in the menu aren't available.
I hope they take this into consideration and I get to try  more things apart from their ice teas and hot chocolate.

It was on a chilly weekday morning that we went to The Corner Courtyard for a breakfast, before the rigors of office began. Here's my two pennies on the experience:

a) It's understaffed, just one guy manning the reception, cleaning the tables and delivering the food.

b) The menu for breakfast was very limited

c) The menu is on the expensive side; with an Upma costing 270/250 bucks.

d) The waiter (cum receptionist cum cleaning staff) wasn't well trained and couldn't answer basic requests for suggestion, on the food.

e) It took AGES for the food to be served; around 20 mins for coffee and Omelette.

f) The food was tasty and they did a good job of a simple dish like an omellete. The coffee was strong and nice. But by this time, the wait had killed any goodwill for the place.

g) The decor of the place is fabulous, it has an oldworldly charm which is maybe the only thing that can draw me to the place again.

So there you Go! Happy eating!

The corner courtyard happened by chance. We were supposed to go to another restaurant but a split second change lead us to this place and I'm glad that happened. 

Quiet and quaint, I fell in love with the ambience and decor. We ordered a brocolli and almond soup with a chicken roll and then rounded it up with a cheesecake that was divine. The evening ended with some coffee in addition to what we had already ordered :)

I'd definitely come back to this place if I lived in Kolkatta.

Have been wanting to go here for quite a long time now. Yesterday finally I did with my oldest friend and I loved it. The decor takes you straight to some eatery in Europe. The chairs are so comfy. We ordered Negroni and Full moon party for drinks and I loved Full moon party. Very interesting. In food we ordered catch or the day with peri peri sauce which I think was a bit of a disappointment. However the basil and pesto sauce pasta that we ordered was out of this world and I wanted to lick the plate white. I am definitely going back for more pasta.

Located on Sarat Bose Road is this beautiful little place with a European touch. We dropped by on a rainy day for some Cappuccino and Spaghetti aglio e olio with add on grilled chicken. The spaghetti happened to be a tad too oily but was otherwise tasty enough. 
Service was prompt and courteous. The washroom was very clean and well maintained. The prices of the dishes are however, on the higher side.

Great ambience. Unique decor.
Food could be better. Aglio olio pasta was good, quantity was very less.
Pizza was okay, crust was more like a cracker.
Service should be more prompt

Update- tried quesadillas and cafe mocha. Very disappointed. The drink tasted like watery flavored milk. Quesadillas were nothing like they were supposed to be.
They need to do something about ventilation when the ACs are switched off. Was so stuffy.
Overpriced, especially in comparison to the food and service. Nice decor can not replace good food.

It was an unplanned visit to The Corner Courtyard. As they provided valet service, it was very comfortable. The ambience of the place, old Kolkata charm of a courtyard, impressed me from the moment I stepped in. I had tried Italian cuisine which is quite authentic. For the food and warm service, I would love to revisit.

The most complicated skill is to make simplest of things. People try most difficult of things trying to be different in league forgetting the basics! This place Corner Courtyard is one such boutique cafe that will leave one amazed at the simplicity that it portrays..And boy this place is done beautifully. Leme start the Gupshup:
 
First up is The Ambience 
Methinks Ambience is much talked about when it comes to Cafe and it plays a major role in setting up the mood for good food. This place is located in Sarat bose lane, Ballygunge. One of the best and simple decor i have seen till date. Smart use of: locks, latches, keys, doorknobs, hinges and lots of books fill the room. Interestingly, it offers 9-10 different types of rooms for stay. Each room has unique theme. Super nice seating arena. In a word the Ambience was Royal!

Next is Food:

They have 5 different types of menu. One is solely for drinks: cocktails, mocktails & liquors! Others are for starters, main course and the specials for the day!
Here’s what I ordered:

Pesto Pizza: We all know Pesto has that bitter aftertaste. And when one is dealing with Pizza it better be crunchy and full of pesto and cheese. This one is by far the best Pesto pizza i have had. If in Kolkata this Pizza is a must must try!

Rosti: Potatoes stuffed with cabbage along with cheesy sauce that they pour over it. And trust me, this sauce is sooo sooo yum that u would want to gulp it down just like that.. I want to thank the chef for the most simplest Rosti done in a beautiful way.. kudos Chef for this lip smacking dish! 

Lastly, The Service & Pocket Pinch:
So when it comes to service, its slow and one is kept waiting longer for food. So if you are looking for a date place and wish to spend time with your partner. This is the Corner! It’s perfectly priced. As they say, most simplest things can be beautiful & bring most happiness.. Do leme know in the comment section below if u were left beaming just like me..

It was the day of Maha-Ashtami!! Now that I'm reviewing it, with the incessant rain pouring outside , I remember ashtami was also a rain marred day.
So after the raining stopped we decided to visit the Maddox square. But seeing the soaked condition of the placed we called quits and took refuge herein.
It's located just in nearby vicinity of the @Maddox square. It's a corner plot, hence the name corner courtyard.
I've always been intrigued to visit this place but somehow this ashtami was the day which we could finally visit here.
The ambience is something to talk about; soothing lights, perfect wooden floors, plush sofas, with huge tables, lovely chandeliers accentuating the class of this place, everything quaint yet very chique.
Seated, a server attended us, I wanted to have beer and the wifey decided for a glass of sangria. We also ordered their speciality a fresh baked pizza, the pepperoni one.
We were served with our poisons in no time followed by the seductive looking pizza.
My wife  was absolutely bowled away by the white wine based sangria. It was a knockout for her.
The pizza was a thin crust one, 8 slices, not exceptionally big, but something two people can easily manage, with hearty doses of melted cheese , decent amount of diced sausages and bell peppers that it tasted almost perfect. I felt for the price they take, the quantity of meat can be improved. However, it tasted lovely, better than the usual pizzas we have from Domino's.
So to sum up it's a lovely place , spacious, lovely interiors , costly and some awesome cocktail and good food.


Ps it cost us about 1200 bux.

Went to this place called "The Corner Courtyard" which is located at Sarat Bose Road, Kolkata.
And, I can't get over with how beautiful this place was🙈😍. As soon as you enter this place its interior and the decorations will fill your heart❤️.
It is basically an huge colonial bungalow from the 19th century which is given a new form and revamped into a beautifully decorated and organised restaurant.
Its has a really calm & cozy ambience with some good music playing😌. It is mainly popular for its interiors and the food presentation. 
Coming on to the food-
They serve you with Continental, Italian, Seafood & European dishes. So, I tried 5 different items in total which were :- 
1. Grilled Italian Chicken Bites with caprese salad and parsley garlic aioli listed under appetizers❤️. Loved how the dish was prepared and the cheese slice given along with this was quite different from the regular one and really yummy😋. It contained 5 pieces in a plate and was presented in a really attractive way💝.
Also, they had a wide range of varieties in their menu to choose from so yaya!😀.
Will give this dish a 4/5✌🏻️
2. Mexican Grilled Fish cakes with jalapeños, scallions and tomato caper dressing listed under appetizers.
This was indeed a good dish and looked much more delicious by the way it was presented❤️.
Would give this one 4/5👍🏻.
3. Grilled Jamaican Jerk Chicken with lemon saffron rice & vegetables. 
This was yet another delicious preparation and loved the lemon saffron rice❤️. The chicken had a hint of barbecue sauce in it which made it more tasty😋.
4. Bangkock style green curry with herbed garlic rice💚 which is an authentic dish of Bangkock. 
This has a wonderful fragrance as it contains lemongrass & kaffir lime leaves in it making it more delicious & attractive😋😍.
It was one of the unique preparation I've had in a while. And I loved this so much😍
The food was really good and quite uncommon. 
5. this was the last and most amazing among all the 5 dishes I had from The Corner Courtyard❤️.
Not a really big fan of sweets but this one surely did make me crave for more😍. It is named as- Kiwi lime pie with lemon zest and topped with whipped cream and kiwi slices. 
Its inner pudding was similar to milkmaid and also had a really beautiful aroma of kaffir lime❤️.
Overall, had a great experience dining in @thecornercourtyard and surely visiting them again! 
Do visit this place if your are planning for a sunday brunch with your family or friends. You'll definitely love this place😀❤️.

Not a nice experience. Went there after reading so much reviews. Service was pathetic. There was clearly no focus on customer service. I ordered 2 pasta and I pan smeared grilled chicken and 1 plate of chicken wings.
The chicken wings were not value for money at all.
Ordered for 2 plates and received one plate when the food arrived. The white sauce smelled of preservatives. The consistency too thick.
The vegetables in Pan smeared grilled chicken had only 1 piece of broccoli and few other greens.  Overall wait time was way too long than promised.

Serves Italian delicacies which definitely a must try for all pizza and pasta lovers. What stand outstanding for me was the Waldorf salad n mocktails... though am not a salad lover but if I pay another visit to this place so this salad will be on the top of my order. The decor was unique n ambience was absolutely perfect.   Coming to food I liked every items  we ordered but to me quantity can be improved.

Situated near Maddox square, this is easy to find. We visited the place on Ashtami evening. We had some burnt garlic prawns for starter with some great cocktails. The Margarita was tequilla based and strong. The cosmopolitan and the lychee martini were made to perfection. We had an amazing thin crust Pizza con Pollo, loaded with chicken sausages and grilled chicken. We also had some delicious lamb cooked in a spicy rich gravy, served with rice and baby potatoes.  We also tried their baked Philadelphia Cheesecake, which to our much delight, tasted like Shandesh. The pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side, but the food and the beverages are worth the money. In addition to the great food, extra points for the extremely courteous staff who helped us to choose from the menu and the lovely decor. Surely going back soon to this place. Highly recommended.

A stone's throw from Lansdowne crossing, this hidden gem presents an exquisite blend of rustic charms with a chic modern twist. The building itself, is a bunglow styled two storeyed house that has been tastefully refurbished to suit the needs of the business. Stepping into the place often feels like a time woven dream, like a glimpse from a bygone era, where your mobile devices, somehow, still seems to work.  Past the initial appearances, the restaurant is dimly lit and has a tasteful choice of songs that make for the perfect musical backdrop to cover the next table's conversation. The servers are courteous and accommodating. The place has a reasonably good food menu which sports anything from Continental to Mexican to even Indian delights like Aloo Paratha as a part of their breakfast menu. On the downside, I did find the quality of the food to vary according to time and the number of punters they had to deal with. The bar menu seemed to be far more detailed and to my liking. The variety was impressive and the beverages were served promptly, and at the right temperatures.The pocket pinch is slightly on the more expensive side, but it's a place where you pay not only for what you consume, but also for what you experience. With its inexplicable charm and mystique, the place will entice you, time and again, and you will be, but, a slave to it.

Yet another beautifully done up restaurant in Kolkata. Decor is classy and and the ambience is lovely. At least one extra point for its decor 😊

It has a limited food menu (I believe it had a much longer menu earlier). We tried the following :
- spinach hummus (server's recommendation) which came with in-house lavash. Very good hummus. Recommended 
- mushroom cupcakes. Usually I don't like cheesy dishes but this was really good. Recommended. 
- prawns flavoured with burnt chilli garlic. The prawns were too tough. Probably needed another two-three minutes of cooking. Not recommended 
- crusty pepperoni pizza. When it's called "crusty" pepperoni, one expects it to be crisp. It was too soft and limp. Pizza was large and good enough for 3-4 people. Average.
- basilica pesto treat. Quite good.  
- Iced tea. Very good. Not very sweet which is the way I like it :)

Service was good and prompt.

Ambience - 5/5

The Corner Courtyard is a beautiful place to lunch at not just in terms of the wonderful decor but also the innovative food that fails to disappoint. It was a much awaited visit for us and we ordered tons of things including the Mushroom Cappucino soup, Mushroom Cakes, Three Cheese Fondue with Rosemary Baby Potatoes and garlic sticks, the Sea Salt Fig Chicken Salad in a pomegranate yoghurt dressing and the hawaiian pizza! The pizza was okay, the Mushroom cakes were a slight disappointment in terms of quantity but the fondue and the salad were out of the world. We also ordered mocktails which were perfect for a summer day! A big shoutout to the staff who were the best!

Ordered garlic bread and fries for kids. They slept before the could serve as the "OVEN" was blocked. Don't know what fries what do in an oven. 

Would not recommend at least on a weekend.

This pretty cafe cum bar is located in Sarat Bose Road which according to me is one of the most beautiful dine-ins in town. The whole cafe looks like a vintage house from outside, when you enter you see a classy and sophisticated ambience with pretty decor and colourful paintings, wall hangings etc all around. It has an area upstairs which was closed when I visited. We chose a table in one corner beside a window which had a mini library attached to it. The place gives an Elizabethan era feel and you will keep admiring it. 
The menu card has been designed very uniquely with innovative cocktails and food inclusions. I went with a friend and we ordered two cocktails - Indian Summer which is a gin based cocktail with lime juice, basil and cucumber and Before Sunrise which is a rum based cocktail with lime ,passion fruits, syrups etc. We ordered Californian pizza which is a recommended dish in the menu. This has grilled chicken, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and bell peppers. The pizza was delicious to taste and I wouldn't mind to repeat the order. The pizza and the cocktails was heavy on the stomach but there's always place for desserts. We ordered a chocolate truffle cake which was filled with chocolate sauce and tasted like heaven. The ambience is undoubtedly one of the best, the service is very good, the food is commendable, the presentation gets full marks. The price is a little on the higher side but I wouldn't mind paying a little more for such tasty food and beautiful ambience.

I had passed this restaurant lots of times and always felt it looked very cosy and romantic from outside. So I decided to give it a try on a special date night. Turns out it is actually very cosy and cute! The decor is unique and consists of a variety of off beat items used artistically. We ordered starters of mushroom cupcakes and chicken wings and a main course of Jamaican jerk chicken. The starters were amazing. The mushrooms specially are worth a mention. The chicken steak in the main course was a bit tough and chewy. The quantity of the food was enough for two (two not so big eaters). The staff was very polite. And contrary to other reviews, I didn't find it too pricey as well. I would suggest this place for anyone looking for a quiet dinner date.

This is a very pretty cafe and the interiors are very well decorated.
It has rooftop sitting arrangements too.
Since,it was summer we sat inside.
•Mocktails-We started our meal with two refreshing mocktails.
We took one Mint to be which was much like a litchi flavoured mojito and very refreshing.
I loved the cherry blossom too which had strawberry juice,orange juice and other ingredients blend to perfection.
We were very hungry and directly moved on to the main course.
We took two steaks and it was very wholesome.
The prices are on the higher side though.
•Jamaican Grilled Chicken-We took one Jamaican Jerk grilled chicken steak.The steak had very well cooked two big succulent pieces of chicken breast and one leg piece.It was served with little saffron rice and salad.The gravy tasted too good.
•Peruvian grilled bhetki served with cajun spiced crab meat-This is quite a costly dish.The fish was good but I dont know where exactly they put the crab meat.Anyway,It was a big piece of fish which was soft and absolutely lip smacking.Served with mashed potatoes,rice and tomatoes,olives.

After the sumptous maincourse,we were in a mood to try a dessert.
We took a baked cheesecake.
•Baked Cheesecake-This is absolutely delicious and this is the first time we tried a baked cheesecake.We absolutely loved it.

The staffs are friendly.I wish the service was more prompt.
The taxes were 30% back when we went.
Pocket pinch for a good meal for two-1.8k 
The ambience will win your heart. 😊

This pretty cafe cum bar is located in Sarat Bose Road which according to me is one of the most beautiful dine-ins in town. The whole cafe looks like a vintage house from outside, when you enter you see a classy and sophisticated ambience with pretty decor and colourful paintings, wall hangings etc all around. It has an area upstairs which was closed when I visited. We chose a table in one corner beside a window which had a mini library attached to it. The place gives an Elizabethan era feel and you will keep admiring it. 
The menu card has been designed very uniquely with innovative cocktails and food inclusions. I went with a friend and we ordered two cocktails - Indian Summer which is a gin based cocktail with lime juice, basil and cucumber and Before Sunrise which is a rum based cocktail with lime ,passion fruits, syrups etc. We ordered Californian pizza which is a recommended dish in the menu. This has grilled chicken, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and bell peppers. The pizza was delicious to taste and I wouldn't mind to repeat the order. The pizza and the cocktails was heavy on the stomach but there's always place for desserts. We ordered a chocolate truffle cake which was filled with chocolate sauce and tasted like heaven. The ambience is undoubtedly one of the best, the service is very good, the food is commendable, the presentation gets full marks. The price is a little on the higher side but I wouldn't mind paying a little more for such tasty food and beautiful ambience.

I had passed this restaurant lots of times and always felt it looked very cosy and romantic from outside. So I decided to give it a try on a special date night. Turns out it is actually very cosy and cute! The decor is unique and consists of a variety of off beat items used artistically. We ordered starters of mushroom cupcakes and chicken wings and a main course of Jamaican jerk chicken. The starters were amazing. The mushrooms specially are worth a mention. The chicken steak in the main course was a bit tough and chewy. The quantity of the food was enough for two (two not so big eaters). The staff was very polite. And contrary to other reviews, I didn't find it too pricey as well. I would suggest this place for anyone looking for a quiet dinner date.

This is a very pretty cafe and the interiors are very well decorated.
It has rooftop sitting arrangements too.
Since,it was summer we sat inside.
•Mocktails-We started our meal with two refreshing mocktails.
We took one Mint to be which was much like a litchi flavoured mojito and very refreshing.
I loved the cherry blossom too which had strawberry juice,orange juice and other ingredients blend to perfection.
We were very hungry and directly moved on to the main course.
We took two steaks and it was very wholesome.
The prices are on the higher side though.
•Jamaican Grilled Chicken-We took one Jamaican Jerk grilled chicken steak.The steak had very well cooked two big succulent pieces of chicken breast and one leg piece.It was served with little saffron rice and salad.The gravy tasted too good.
•Peruvian grilled bhetki served with cajun spiced crab meat-This is quite a costly dish.The fish was good but I dont know where exactly they put the crab meat.Anyway,It was a big piece of fish which was soft and absolutely lip smacking.Served with mashed potatoes,rice and tomatoes,olives.

After the sumptous maincourse,we were in a mood to try a dessert.
We took a baked cheesecake.
•Baked Cheesecake-This is absolutely delicious and this is the first time we tried a baked cheesecake.We absolutely loved it.

The staffs are friendly.I wish the service was more prompt.
The taxes were 30% back when we went.
Pocket pinch for a good meal for two-1.8k 
The ambience will win your heart. 😊

Had visited this place located in a quiet corner on Sarat Bose Road. From the moment you step in, the interiors will impress you. This restaurant serves Continental platter mainly. There is a variety in options and the food garnishing is top class. However, the quantity/portion is really small and unfulfilling, considering the high charge amount per plate. Food quality and taste are good. But, inspite of spending a lot of money over a meal, somehow there was something missing w.r.t lesser portions.

The corner courtyard is undoubtedly one of the most talked about restaurants in the city. It is known for its posh decor and scrumptious delicacies. 
I had paid a visit to this place the last Sunday and fell in awe of the place. It was amazing to see how they've managed to turn an old British building into something so much more likable. The place was tidy to the peak and there were songs playing in the background. It was also a very well lit place keeping aside the fact that lights were frequently being switched off due to day time. 
Jumping on to the food , I'd like to call it delectable.
Generous in amount and extremely delicious in taste.
They just know , what dish to serve with what dip and exactly how. Every dish ordered was seasoned to perfection. The minimal yet neat presentation made the food look more finger licking. 
What we ordered: mocktails, chef's special chicken wings served with blue cheese dip , fish and chips served with mayo dip.
Taste- 4.5/5
Ambience- 4/5
Value for money- 4/5

Special mention: The guard at the entrance. 
He led us inside the restaurant sheltering us under his umbrella as we had none. This was something you don't get to see regularly.

The excitement of dining at this landmark restaurant pretty much dwindles the second you step inside. Poor lighting, negligent waiters, and so-so food - are such a let down. Their coffee, though is the only saving grace. Please don't bother with a visit here.

The Corner Courtyard is situated on Sarat Bose road. After a long visit to a doctor, we were hungry and the most closet restaurant is the corner courtyard. The inner interior is absolutely beautiful and refreshing. From my guessing, the building is at least an old British building, having a courtyard and thus the name.

The servers were really nice and polite. The food was delicious too, however a bit expensive and less in portion.

This place is just a few steps away from my house. It is located just opposite to Sarat Bose road CCD. Today I visited this place for the first time and I was astonished to see their interior. It is done beautifully and I can't help praising it.
The restaurant was quite empty when we entered so I managed to click loads of pictures as well.
To be honest I am little picky about food and I would say I am not very delighted on that part.
We ordered :
1. Grilled Italian chicken bites with caprese salad and parsley garlic aioli - it was a little salty for my taste.
2. Malaysian chicken satay served with a spicy peanut sauce - tasted average. I would have liked a little softer chicken.
3. Grilled Jamaican jerk chicken with lemon and saffron rice and boiled vegetables - the leg piece did not please me at all. I found it tasting weird at parts. The rice was fine.
4. California dreaming - tastes good but presentation is not wow.
The quantity could be some more but the quality was fine.
The staff was polite and friendly. A nice restaurant to get great pictures for sure.
*Just a small piece of advice, I would have felt better if the staff asked about my opinion regarding the food as well rather than just concentrating on my male counterpart for his opinions.

Amazing place with an outstanding ambience. This was a place where I wished to explore more and more. It just took my mind away! Coming to the food.. I was vegetarian for the day and generally there isn't much option for it!  Surprisingly I didn't order any paneer item! We ordered Mini Raviolis, seared mushroom & garlic potato with cheddar cheese and caramelized onion with French bread (it took my heart away, tasted just perfect, the mushrooms were nice and juicy and the garlic potato was perfectly crisp.. It was a tummy filling appetizer), to end with we had Bangkok style green curry with garlic herb rice (A Thai dish.. The curry was delicious with veggies just on point. I actually didn't regret opting for the dish). Coming to presentation of food, it satiates one's eyes. That's all I could say! 
Service was not bad..they tried to put up a good one but it lagged a bit!  Overall the service was nice and cooperative! 
For some prices might seem to be on the upper end but that's worth paying.
Hope to visit soon to try out the non vegetarian dishes. 
Thank you :)

What I love most about this place is its ambience.  That corridor on the left as you enter is ideal for spending a quiet evening with an old friend (or even new ones!) or even for brooding alone over a drink in a cosy corner. They have ideal sitting arrangements - 2 seaters, 3 seaters and 4 seaters. The 2 seater is also perfect for loners. The staff is friendly and yet professional. 

Coming to the food - I tried their mushroom cupcakes. They were delicious. I had them along with Bloody Mary. Then I had the veg Rosti which was also good to eat. Overall, it was an enjoyable evening even though I was alone.

I am a food enthusiast and keep hopping to different food joints whenever I get a chance. This place was in my to do list for a long I was following their social media page and got to know some amazing things about the place since then I wanted to visit so on my last visit to kolkata I was there with my family and it was a very special occasion of my parents anniversary. I love the decor ambiance colors and the bright combination all around. As it was a weekday table was available no waiting time which is a big thing in kolkata. Food we ordered was very well presented top on taste no space for any negative points. I will add the name of the dish along with the pics but ya 2 of the dishes we missed to clicked as we were super busy in eating. The pizza is super yum handmade woodfire style.

Corner Courtyard is a hidden gem of a restaurant near Maddox Square. Located in a traditional Bangali bari, it exudes a nostalgic charm of its own. The existing architectural features have been restored tastefully with the 'courtyard' the as the centre piece.
Don't be fooled by the attempt to preserve the Bangali feel, as the cuisine is intercontinental. 
I had the lamb burger, a magnificently moist minced lamb patty, delicately seasoned and served with perfect potato wedges. The Indian palate might find it bland but I found it refreshingly authentic. The wedges of potato were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, the salad sharp and zingy. All in all a pleasant experience.

It was intended a great experience to visit this place. The service was prompt. We found a hair like thing in our salad and they apologized and replaced the order. Overall we were satisfied. Only the kiwi lemon tart kind of desert was very lemony. They put a bit too much of lemon zest and thus we couldn't eat our desert. What I liked best was their lasagna. It was soft, shuttle and full of flavours. I would surely visit this place again to try more of their entrees.

So disappointed! Had high hopes. The decor is the only good thing about this place.
Food is not at all tasty. They gave a stale bread with the pesto pasta. The lasagna sheets were not cooked properly. The Oreo shake had no hint of Oreo. The glasses were not washed properly and had an unpleasant odour. The pepperoni in the pizza wasn't fresh. The barbeque chicken wings with blue cheese dip was the only palatable item.
Definitely not visiting this place again.

Wow is the only thing that you will saying once you visit this place. You might also be streching it to say "Wooooooow"

The location fits perfectly and is very easily reachable. Its an old mansion sort of place renovated amd designed to keep a balance between the new and the old era. The interiors the furnitures all in all the ambience is beautiful. You will definitely feel very comfortable and a single visit to this place will just not be enough to experience all these.

The taste of the food just adds another feather to its cap. It is delicious and every bite leaves an echosing flavour in your mouth. We had ordered peruvian bhetki with crab meat sause and south african peri peri prawn. One might find the peruvian bhetki to be a but tangy but then again that may vary from person to person. As for me it was melting beautifully in my mouth.

On the service I shall say that it was neatly done and we were well attented to.

The damage on the pocket is not much, would roughly say that it is Rs. 1800/- for two which would cover two main course exclusive of drinks and inclusive of taxes.

Statutory warning: If you are going in a group of two or three you will be given the seats away from the main dining hall as the main hall is kept for  having atleast four members. Trust me you donot want to miss the main diing area.


P.S: Woooooooow.

The decor and the ambience is non conventional and has an eclectic flavour which makes the restaurant instantly likeable on entering. The food which is a mix of Italian continental pizzas and budgets offer different varieties of food from betki fish to the barbecued wings to the figs and the traditional salmon which is so rare to find in this city. The cocktails are good. They are better than most of the ones in other pubs but there is a chance of improvement. The green curry was my favourite of the night which was authentic in taste and texture. The Peruvian wish was a little bit tangy and those with special inclination towards the tomato type tangy flavour would like it. 

Overall a must Vist. Something different and refreshing. Value for money wise a little bit more on the expensive side .

The Good:
The Corner Courtyard surely scores highly on ambience.The  is nicely done  and looks really inviting.The food we ordered was delicious too.
Recommended:Crispy Calamari,Chef's Special baked chicken lasagna,Peruvian Style Grilled Bhetki,Rum with a view

The Bad:
The probability of getting what you order is 1/3.So if you are ordering a drink or any food item make sure you think of 2 alternatives.It's really frustrating when you go through an elaborate menu card and finally choose something to order only to find that it is not there.Moreover the waiter doesn't say no straightaway.He checks with the kitchen staff and comes back after 5 minutes to inform that the item is not available.
They served the worst Long Island Iced Tea I have ever had.And the Sangria had huge pieces of fruits.I don't know if they tried to customise,but whatever it is,it wasn't good and certainly not value for money.

The Ugly:
The restaurant is evidently understaffed.We could not find anyone to serve us a glass of water for around 20 minutes.They took 1 hour to serve 5 jagerbomb shots and by the time the shots arrived on the table we had finished our dinner.If they really wanna grow they have to improve their service ASAP.

I visited this restaurant around 2 years back when I went to Kolkata to meet my very special friend. But, even now I can vividly describe my experience at this very beautiful place.

I will start with the architecture and ambience. Located at the corner of a street which I vaguely remember was Hazra Road, this restaurant certainly catches everyone's attention because of it's big gallery windows which has a British touch. Once you enter the restaurant, you will be awestruck with it's beauty which is magnificent. It was quite spread out and had a very pompous sitting arrangement.

They had the selected Continental delicacies in their menu. I had a very good medley of European breakfast items since I went in the morning. The food was brought to us in a very presentable manner and it tasted perfect.

I am glad that I visited this restaurant and spent a quality time with my friend there! This place certainly deserves a 4.5.

The place looks very nicely decorated and has a very upscale atmosphere but out experience there was horrible. Most of the drinks we wanted to order wasn't available. They didn't have the tonic water for a simple gin and tonic drink. I had ordered a Sangria for myself, which was 90% fruits and a tiny amount of red wine. If I wanted a fruit salad, I wouldn't order a drink. 
The appetizers were good. But in the main course again, they don't have more than half the things we wanted to have. I don't understand why they keep so many dishes on the menu if you cannot serve them to anyone when they order. 
On top of that, the service was pathetic. We went there on a Wednesday night, and almost all the tables were full. But this place was so under-staffed, it was impossible to find anyone around to even ask for some water, let alone order anything. Our food and drinks took more than 45minutes-1hr to get to our plates. By which time we just wanted to get out of there. 
A very over-priced over-hyped under-staffed place. 
Never going back there again. Wouldn't recommend anyone.

Service is very bad...there are very few staff as compared to the number of covers and because of the layout of the restaurant you can't see the staff at most times and are kept waiting for long. We ordered drinks and they were not served for about an hour after we ordered them..or food came and was polished off but the drinks just didn't turn up. Quite disappointing. Food was tasty. But quite a few items are unavailable, both drinks and food. Even beer was only available in one brand. Staff was courteous but they were uninformed about what is available and had to keep coming back to us telling us that things we ordered are not available. I am not going to revisit this place in the near future.

Being a die hard fan of continental cuisine, I always look for places which offers the absolute best of it...and undeniably, The Corner Courtyard is one of those, on the top of my list. To start with,I was pretty charmed by their decor, which is very elegantly decorated with various antique items and exquisite chandeliers which gives the whole place a classic, quaint European ambience. When it comes to their repertoire, trust me...it is even more piquant. From classic mocktails to quirky cocktails,wines, variety of classic liqueurs and a tastefully assembled inventory, you will be left baffled with the exemplary choices. Off whatever I had tried of their august ensemble,each and every dish was absolutely delectable and executed with finesse. Do try this place at least once and I hope you won't be left dissapointed.

This restaurant had been on my wish list since last few years. Finally I went there for dinner today, with my lady friend. However, we had the worst dining experience possible, much to our shock and disbelief, having heard really nice reviews from our friends earlier. The interior is really warm and pleasant, but the service is not! We had to ask five times before someone bothered to take down the order. The chocolate truffle with chocolate sauce was served very cold. The peruvian rice with bhetki was alright, while the california pizza was so good that we devoured the slices in no time. Plus one for the pizza. Water was served not until we were midway into our meal, that too, after repeated prodding. To make matters worse, they forgot to serve the mocktail we ordered. It was never served and we left after telling the confused staff how unhappy we were.

I want to give a negative rating . Out of internet decorum I am not abusing . But you guys are cheats and extremely rude . We went there for breakfast . For some unknown reason we were asked to sit in a particular table when the entire restaurant was empty . Ok we ignored it and ordered for food . eggs benedict was average ,. You guys should learn how to make hash brown . Now coming to the main disappointment . We ordered nutella pancake . It was 3 minuscule cookie shaped burnt pancakes for which we were charged some good 350 bucks .I felt like throwing the plate off . Stop cheating your customers and try to live up to the ratings which other generous customers have given you

This restaurant has been on my list for a long time. Based on the ratings of Zomato, I decided to visit this place with my friends. Firstly, what a wonderful decor !!! Honestly the pictures also attracted me to explore the place. I was so delighted to see the decor. I am giving 5/5 for the decor and ambiance. You can even just sit there for hours. The idea of the interior designer is just awesome.

Then coming to the food..every,I repeat every dish was just soooo perfect. They tastes heavenly. I can go on praising the food. Special mention: the pizza. It was out of the world. Plus the cheese cake. Food is 5/5 as well. 

The staffs were very helpful and well trained. 

I am highly satisfied with this restaurant. I want to visit it and try all their dishes because they have such a huge menu. Keep up the good work. Loved the food, actually loved everything there. 😊

The first words that come to my mind- Quaint and Classy. 
I've been there for breakfast, and lunch. 
Ambience- The decor mainly, lifts up your mood. The place is for quiet dining,
Food- The quality is great, from plating to garnishing. The quantity isn't bad either. The effort shows on the plate. It tastes beautiful, no doubt. 
Service- Prompt.
A must visit. 😊

Quaint decor, quiet ambience, an impressive drinks menu and a lengthy food menu is what you can expect. I don't come here often, and every visit reveals a new menu. So this time around we tried a few new items (well new to me). From the appetiser selection we had some stuffed mushrooms, chicken satay, and spinach and ricotta ravioli. The chicken was tasty, but the rest were blah. From the entree selection we had Peruvian style grilled Bengal bekti fish and chef's special chicken and spinach lasagna (see pics). Again, very average. However, this is one of those few places that stock Bira beer, and from memories of previous visits the pizzas are quite decent too. So if you're after a chill sesh with the mates, this is a good option. But not an attractive menu if you're hungry for a good meal.

It is getting difficult for me to review places in Kolkata. We vegetarians have to skim through the menu, read it 3-4 times, go through the same keywords- mushroom, babycorn, paneer, mix veg. etc.  and finally order one of the few combinations available. 

Here there was one thing different which can make a vegetarian glad. Obviously the options are less, but the dishes are quite unique. You will be spoilt for choice in this limited option veg menu as you might not have tried many things on it. 

We were a mix of veg and non veg. I ordered a multigrain wrap with mushrooms and jalapenos and a friend ordered ragi wrap with asparagus. Both the wraps were delectable. The taste was noticably different and you can taste ingredients in them as well as the taste of vegetables used. 

Non vegetarian food was also good as per the account of my friends. Fish was quite tasty. Can be tried here. 
Cocktails are good and do compliment the ambiance of the place. 

The ambiance is the best thing about the place. Perfect for a family outing as well as a date with nice old style interiors and exquisite design on the walls.

Today I had gone for dinner with my family.. Ordered Mexican Fish Cake( circular shaped,5 pieces) as starter and then ordered Californian Pizza 🍕 Sloppy Joe, a form of 🍔 Burger and Jerk Chicken. We were 4 in no.All the dishes were wonderful in taste and presentation, specially the Sloppy Joe. Jerk Chicken is a Jaimican dish soya sauce based.Where they will loose marks is on service front. They are not prompt enough.. The guys are courteous but not good with service. Pizza 🍕 sides had to be asked even drinking water.. The ambiance and the look is top notch. Having a single washroom is an issue with so many customers around. No high chair for infants. But its good they have valet parking and free wifi. Next visit will be with friends only I guess..

Incredible food !!! Plus the ambience and decor is vintage and lovely. The seating is comfortable with well spaced tables lending a cosy and private aura. The menu is the star, absolutely 'paisa vasool'. The money you pay for your food is justified by both the quality and the quantity. They serve some of the finest drinks in the city. Mixture of italian and continental, their food is a delight for your taste buds.
What I had ordered was :

Malaysian Chicken satay, served with a spicy peanut sauce. - the chicken was juicy. The sauce in which it is swathed in, is delicious. The peanut sauce which comes on the side has a light tangy flavour which complements the dish well. A plate of 6 pieces, this dish serves as an amazing appetizer.

Chicken Breast stuffed with bacon, brocolli florets, mozarella in an orange cognac gravy with root vegetables and seared greens - the gravy in which this entree is served is a sticky sweet one. It is not at all overwhelming and it accentuates the flavour of the dish. The chicken breast is stuffed with massive amounts of bacon and the cheese serving is generous. In fact even the green veggies are perfectly seared. The root vegetables are diced and packed into a sticky deck on the side and it tastes wonderful. The gravy binds the dish very well. It brings all the components together. Each and every item on the plate is well cooked.

Peruvian style grilled Bengal Bhetki fish, served with cajun spiced crab meat, tomato capper butter, house salad and garlic rice - another outrageously delicious entree. The portions are extremely generous and they are really kind with the sauce. The olives bring a freshness to the dish and adds to the riot of flavours.

Chocolate truffle slice with chocolate sauce - the cake is so soft that you will not believe me until you have it. And you will know what sin is when you have this dessert.

Kiwi lime pie with whipped cream, lemon zest and kiwi slices - the pie crust is nice and thick (not flaky and crusty) and has the perfect amount of sweetness however the filling is a bit too sweet. Some may like that amount of sweetness and some may not. The lemon zest makes its pressnce felt but it is not enough to take away the sharp sweetness. The kiwi slices and the whipped cream are there too, to ease your palate from the onslaught of the sweet pie.

Overall the food was EXTREMELY satifying in taste and tremendously filling. I am in love with their sauces. They gave a variety of them and all of them are lovely.

Definitely going there for more and would DEFINITELY recommend people to go there.

If you're always on the hunt for good interiors like me, this place will satisfy you. It is a small hotel plus restaurant, with a rooftop. (bonus) Happy hours from 12-7 on weekdays. But they ask you to go to the rooftop to avail the happy hour offer. I didn't try much but one drink (BEFORE SUNRISE) and RAVIOLI, both were pretty damn good. Overall, I was super happy.

This place is very close to my heart, since I went on my first date with my 'special someone' here! No wonder I chose this place for my first review. The way it has been decorated more than justifies the importance I attach to it. Though I couldn't manage to sit in the main hall both the times I visited (for some weird reason, they always keep it reserved), The Corner Courtyard holds a very special place in my timeline. The interiors are decorated very creatively. The ambiance is pleasant and romantic. The food here is quite overpriced, even though the taste is pretty good. I have tried their Pizza with goat cheese ( they serve thin crust pizzas only), Pork Ribs, Chicken Skewers, Grilled Jamaican Jerk Chicken and their Lemon Pie. Most of their dishes taste good, but in my opinion, they are too overpriced. The quality or the quantity of the food doesn't come close to justifying the exorbitant amount they charge. It falls beyond the budget for college students like us!

I'm going to give this place a pretty high review for its many, many plus points. The décor is done up in an artsy, vintage chic manner with pastels and bright colours coexisting beautifully and the result is a really pretty, cozy boutique hotel. 
The food is well cooked, nicely presented and the quantity works well for the price. I would have liked the service to be slightly more fast paced. We ordered the California Pizza, Peri Peri Prawns with herbed rice, Bhetki in Jamaican spices, Fish and Chips, Malaysian Chicken Satay and the Prawns doused in Champagne. All of which was fantastic. 

For dessert we ordered the cheesecake which was honestly a bit too dense, crust was good, and the apple crumble which wasn't made for the gods either. 

A negative point is that there were flies in the hotel, sharing my meal is fine, but I kinda draw the line at flies lining up for the prawns too. We spent a good few minutes swatting them away and it was bloody irritating. 
That aside, I'd visit again, and tell everyone about it too. This place is perfect for any get together or even a quiet meal alone.

This place is located opposite of Indian Oil Petrol pump in Hazra. Pretty place. When me and my friend entered this place around 4.45pm, it was surprisingly empty. Pretty decor,cosy atmosphere but due to the low light the decoration wasnt clearly visible. I dunno wether its a problem for that day only cause the pictures tells something very different. Now coming to the food. We ordered Hawaiiaan pizza🍕 and Heineken beer.🍻 Yes,their entire menu got changed. Pizza was yummy. Thin crust with cheese,ham and onions on it. And the beer was chilled too.
 Soft music was playing in the background. So the ambience was really nice.  ❤ We both were too full to order more. The waiters seemed clueless. They don't know wether there's happy hours or not. Zomato showing happy hours from 4-8pm but they said n
 they dont have. Zomato showing Women's Day soecial offers but they said they dont have. It seemed they dont know what they are doing.  😟
 Anyway my experience in the Corner courtyard was good except the behaviour of the staffs and the light issue. 😇

I was eyeing this place for quite a long time on Zomato mostly due to the colourful ambience. So when I got the chance to treat my friend for my birthday last month I grabbed the opportunity to visit this awesome restaurant.
The interiors are just as attractive as in the photos, if not more. The wall decors, antique looking mirrors, furnitures speak of the long gone colonial era.
The environment is cordial and waiters are well informed. I was having a sore throat so denied from having any cocktails, when one of the waiters suggested 'the babumoshai'.. Whiskey in warm water infused with cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns, lemon and honey..A couple of which worked like magic on my throat.
The food was just so good! We had grilled Italian chicken bites with caprese sauce and garlic aioli..It was tender and tasted heavenly. For the main course we had grilled Jamaican jerk chicken with lemon saffron rice and chef special braised lamb tagine. The chicken was good. But the showstopper was the lamb. Tender juicy little peices of lamb in wonderful aromatic stew which brought out the Moroccan vibe nicely, melted away in our mouths while leaving behind the aftertaste which made us crave for more. The onion rice and rosemary potatoes came as perfect accompaniments.
It's a bit on the costly side but definitely worth every single penny with respect to ambience service or food. A highly recommended place for dinner with family or friends.

This place is a treat for just not the taste buds but also for the eyes. An old bungalow on Sarat Bose Road restored tastefully to retain the vintage feel yet bring d modern day brightness. Bright colour doors, windows, door knobs & books as wall installations - art with cuteness overloaded. 
Judging the book by its cover I expected nothing but excellent food and I was not disappointed at all. Right from the appetisers to the entrees everything was quite spot on. Mushroom soup, bruschetta, roesti, green curry, mini raviolis were some of d dishes I sampled and it only left me craving for another visit soon!!

There in house cocktails are just amazing, I've never had anything like that before. The food was perfect.. plating was delicate and beautiful and above all the flavour was something to remember. One of our preferred was braised lamb, which was unbelievably tender and juicy. Must try place

My All Time Favourite! This place kinda tops at creative! They really did a lot for the cute and UNIQUE Decor. From vintage radios, telephones, cameras, to a wall decorated with door knobs, to cutely designed mirrors. They have put a lot thought in it! And no complaints about the Food. Like seriously! I recommend the California Pizza (its my favourite). They serve the large one, and it's really a must have. They gave good collection of wines as well. I had Sula (Shiraz) and my friend took a mocktail which was really refreshing, as per her. She also ordered a burger which at the end became too much to consume, as the Pizza takes up a lot of space and I'm not exactly a foodie! :3
So anyway, to sum up this place, it totally gets an A+ for Food and Decor. The staffs were 'Okay'. And yes, they even keep good books on the window side! They also provide rooftop sitting arr
I also ordered from this place for home delivery. The same Pizza of course! They were a little late though. :/

Visited this during the puja along with some friends. This is really a place to visit for food lovers.
Staffs are polite and helpful. Ambience is the best thing about this place, its purely soothing. Decor is absolutely awesome and something to look out for. Seats are good and gives you the right comfort to enjoy the food. 
We ordered a couple of different dishes as each one ordered something different. Very happy to say that all of them tasted so good.
Desserts were good too with the slight exception of one. I ordered a mocktail with a pale pinkish color in a short glass with lemon slice. That tasted a bit light.(picture is provided below)
Only one negative point I would like to point out is that the washroom was common for all (male & female) means you have to wait in a line to get in. A big restaurant like this one should have atleast one for each gender.

Have you ever had a meal in an old abandoned bungalow? This place gives you the exact feels! The guys here have done their best to renovate this old house into a beautiful restaurant-cafe-bar and everything in this place just looks like a dream! 
We ordered salad and a chicken dish! 
Ambience of the place is spacious and it feels like home. The intricate detailing to the decoration adds glamour and ethnicity of the place. 
Quality of thr food is amazing but i felt the quantity to be less and that is where my review had lost point. 
Service is very responsive.

It was weekend and we were desperately in search of some proper place to hang out. After going through the reviews we finally decided to land here.
As we entered it gives you the feeling of the old Kolkata. Lovely ambiance, perfectly set music.. The mirrors setup n the wall was something very amazing and ofcourse very innovative.
Coming to the food. We ordered peruvian bhetki with crab meat sauce and south african peri peri prawns. The bhetki was perfectly done. It actually had that charcoal grilled smell and the also the sauce which had that tangy flavor. On the other hand the peri peri prawn was also amazing. The prawn was delicate just as it needs to be, Not too much fried. The fried potato was another attraction in that dish. It actually has given us immense satisfaction in our tastebuds.

Some amazing place to visit.

P. S- It is actually a hotel with very private looking beautiful hotel rooms and the hotel rooms have personalised names!! Do not miss to see them in rhe second floor 😇

It was weekend and we were desperately in search of some proper place to hang out. After going through the reviews we finally decided to land here.
As we entered it gives you the feeling of the old Kolkata. Lovely ambiance, perfectly set music.. The mirrors setup n the wall was something very amazing and ofcourse very innovative.
Coming to the food. We ordered peruvian bhetki with crab meat sauce and south african peri peri prawns. The bhetki was perfectly done. It actually had that charcoal grilled smell and the also the sauce which had that tangy flavor. On the other hand the peri peri prawn was also amazing. The prawn was delicate just as it needs to be, Not too much fried. The fried potato was another attraction in that dish. It actually has given us immense satisfaction in our tastebuds.

Some amazing place to visit.

On a lazy Sunday afternoon,when it's quiet outside ,you feel poetic when you see the sun peeping through the window in a colonial British building.This place has the ambience to take you back in time.
Food is good as well.Tried the mushroom cappuccino & it was exquisite.So was the truffle cake.The burger wasn't too promising though.

This place was on list for sometime, finally went for dinner on Saraswati puja. Ambience is so pretty and eye-soothing and nice music played in background. The cutlery, mirrors on the wall and furniture impressed me. Coming to food, we ordered shrimp flavoured burnt garlic in appetizers. It arrived quick and the taste was a bit chinese as well as continental, with bell peppers and lemon squeezed and curry leaves, was different to palette. Main course we ordered baked chicken and spinach lasagne and jamaican jerk chicken with saffron rice and veggies. Though our waiter told it it may take a while for food, we were surprised it arrived before we finished our starters. Well lasagne was lovely creamy, i dislike spinach bt hardly could recognise the taste as it was very well cooked and flavors were nice. Jamaican jerk chicken was mouth watering, juicy and sauce was excellent. Even the garnish sauce on the plate was tasty to dip and take a bite. Almost full with both dishes, we ordered apple crumble pie and it was really nice warm apple pie served with whipped cream. Had a great dining experience and staff is courteous and service charge was included with the bill. Cost for 2 was Rs 2000 which is a bit on higher side but a good overall experience.

Recently went for dinner to The Corner Courtyard ...what i like most about the place is the decor...makes you want to have your meal with a lot of patience.....I strongly recommend to order for items which are more close to the kind of place they are...meaning not to go for oriental dishes...Their strong point are their Salads, Italian and American fare....and it's justified...Each place has its speciality and cannot serve all kinds of food..Go to The Corner Courtyard only if you like to take time on your meal and enjoy a good conversation...

An old residential house converted into a restaurant and an hotel. Amazing is its interior. Gives a glamour of old Kolkata with few modern touches. 
Coming to the cuisine this is one place which serves world cuisine. 
The mock tails: Cherry Blossom and Bombay Monsoons both were very nice indeed. 
The winner undoubtedly was the starter we tried ... Crispy Calamari Uruguayan Style with garlic aioli. 
The close second will be the 2 desserts we tried ... yummy totally ... the Cheesecake and kiwi Tart

Among the main course Chef's special braised lamb tagine served with brown onion rice and rosemary baby potatoes deserves mention. However the Peruvian style grilled Bengal bhetki could hv been better taste wise.

Only bothered part is I felt it's priced a bit too high

There are some restaurants who will woo the customers with an excellent ambience. Well, The Corner Courtyard definitely is a top contender in this. The decor can even melt down the biggest of all critics. The Corner Courtyard has got a vintage traditional look with extremely comfortable seating arrangement. The staffs are very polite and friendly. I had Egg Benedict here for breakfast. The eggs were poached to perfection, the ham: brilliant, English muffins were great as well. The Hollandaise sauce was a bit sour, but apart from that everything was just perfect. The Egg Benedict also had perfectly cooked caramelised onions. The Corner Courtyard is highly recommended!!

Went there for evening snacks but all of us very very disappointed with the food.

Ordered the ravioli which was cold and stringy. The risotto balls that we ordered were super dry and had no flavor or texture what so ever. 

The pizza was under cooked and lacked flavor in the sauce but still better then the other dishes as we could at least finish it.

The mushroom soup was only nice thing on the table. 

Did not enjoy the food at all.. not my first visit had loved it earlier but the food quality has gone down by notches.

What else would you expect from Corner Courtyard !! 
Ive read a lot of reviews and found out that people write more about the ambience and music and things like that , but what is most required is about the FOOD !! 
Okay so the food , the perfect italian food you will get in kolkata . Not sure about the ingredients and stuff but pretty sure that my mouth was watering even before it was served . 
The taste you get after you eat it is even better . Dont think twice ..just book your table here ..Bon Appetit !!

The decor is certainly their USP.

I'm sure many, like me, would have visited this place just for the furbishing of this place. 

A friend of mine had narrated about his exemplary experience at TCC. After checking out their page on Zomato, I kept gushing about how grand and beautiful the setting of this place is.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand on my birthday, my beau surprised me with lunch at The Corner Courtyard! And boy, was I pleased! :)

I tasted the best chocolate cake of my life here (Chocolate truffle slice 175 INR).The drink- Midsummer Night's Dream(150 INR) was quite refreshing.The food was good but did not quite tick with my taste buds(Italian chicken bites- 345 INR and Peruvian fish- 495 INR).

Truth be told, I wished to visit this place only for their interior and that has been fulfilled. Since the food failed to impress me highly, I might not visit this place again. 
The meal cost us 1500+ tax inclusive.
Rating it a 4 because of the fond memories spent here. :)

World  food - Club Style

The grand finale in this trip to Kolkata was all about world cuisine. Since the last ten days various virtual and real friends have been recommending many continental/international restaurants to us. It had been extremely difficult to zero down to that one choice. It was a birthday treat by a family member and therefore the selection was important from his point of view. We shortlisted three and then selected Corner Courtyard. We wanted to sit and chat in a place at leisure and then we did look up the reviews - the positive and negatives and birthday boy chose this one.

The ambience is old style and provides an aura of comfort. A residential property has been converted to a restaurant without changing the room structure where the guest room, the drawing room, the dining room, etc have all been transformed to seat guests. I walked around and the place exuded an old world English club feel.

The menu is extensive and I understand that it was curated by Chef Rohan D' Souza who has since left this venture and gone on to open his own in Australia. Cocktails were the first to arrive and I did manage to taste a few of them. I ordered a Tequila with Jalapeños and Lime Juice and that I must say was a correct choice. Two of our members down with a sore throat ordered the 'Babumoshai', a whisky drink flavoured with peppercorns, cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon. I did sample the drink and found it flavourful and perfect for a winter setting. The Bloody Mary was good too, where the attention to detail was evident with that celery stick provided as a stirrer.

For appetisers we ordered the Mushroom Cupcake with ricotta, Grilled Italian Chicken Bites with Aioli and the Shrimp with burnt chilli and garlic tossed in champagne. Five stars for all three, the mushroom cupcake being my top favourite. 

In a situation where all members ordered their own choice of entrees - I was shameless enough to ensure that I did not miss out on sampling each one of them. We ordered the following:

a) Grilled Jamaican Jerk chicken with saffron rice. Grilled to perfection, the texture was smooth and that saffron rice was just right.
b) Peruvian Bhetki with Cajun spiced crab meat and garlic rice was quite good. I liked that crab meat sauce topping. 
c) The Peri Peri prawns was good but nothing extraordinary. The seasoned wedges were good though.
d) The Baked chicken with spinach lasagne was very well done and was one of the stars of the show. The lasagne to repeat was brilliant.
e) The rolled Chicken breast stuffed with bacon and broccoli was exquisite and to me was the best choice.
f) The Turkish Grilled chicken was a wrong choice though I must admit that the spinach hummus was on it's own perfect and so was the couscous.
g) The lamb tagine was the second favourite for me, the Rosemary potatoes being very flavourful.

There was no place for dessert after this sumptuous meal. Met the chef on duty - Mr. Sarkar and complemented him on the food and the presentation. You would visit The Corner Courtyard to sample it's epicurean delights and a few innovative cocktails in a club style setting. Isn't that someplace you would want to go again? I would.

After seeing 4.1 rating, We decided to go here on 1st Jan.. Ambience is too classy. Nd we had chosen roof top seating for a good adda..
First thing for which I rated this too low was service, the worst service I had experienced. They didn't give us plates for starters, even after our request..
Secondly, the food.. We told them to choose our starter , they suggested us worst food Malaysian Chicken and cheese fondue. Why they did suggest such disgusting food , really don't understand.. Such a bad service was unexpected..

After hearing much about this place, finally went there for lunch.
Menu list seemed fascinating, but the food.... well
Had ordered for spicy zucchini witg basil with chicken which tasted nothing less than spinach soup, it was tasteless.
Next we ordered for shrimp flavoured  with burnt chilli, which was sweet, there was no flavour of chilli and didn't taste good at all, was much lower than the expectation. Mushrooms cupcakes - utterly sour in taste.
Only philadelphia cheese cake was good in taste and could eat the whole. 
Ratings are just for the rustic ambience.

So the perks of this place.  Easy to locate and the oh-my-god decor. It captures the bygone era perfectly and stepping into it you 'll be transported to the Dickens kind of place. That being said the service was extremely good and staff were very attentive. We ordered the cocktails.  Pina colada could do with a little less coconut essence.  Otherwise the alcohol content was perfect. As was the cosmopoliton. Mocktails were excellent as well. Coming to the good. The lasagna was a bit of a let down. But the Californian pizza compensated for that. We had Greek chicken skewers which had a fresh taste to it. Also the Turkish grilled chicken with pitta bread is something of a variation with a slightly tangy zing to it. Overall a good place to have a quiet brunch

I was shocked at the cleanliness and hospitality offered. The floor under the table set for us is scattered with dirt, leftover food and filthy tissues. The seats were filled with food crumbs and the table was sticky. The management is extremely rude and refuses to adhere to the customers need. A waiter named Biswajit completely ignored our complaint and instead answered saying that its a busy time and nothing can be done. The experience has been pathetic. Wouldn't recommend anyone to go there. I would give a negative rating if i could.

Went there for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. The place is always crowded and during the weekends the rush is even more (you may need to wait for half an hour to get a table, so it is better to book a table in advanced)
The interior is beautiful and will surely lift the mood. There are tables for big groups and couples. However, the table for two are actually quite small and are perefct for single people dating with food. :P
The waiters are courteous and have good knowledge of the food available in the menu. Although the place is always crowded, the service is prompt.
We ordered crispy chicken sausage and crispy calamari. The sausages were nothing extraordinary, but not bad either. I just loved the calamari. The taste was irresistible and I will surely have this again when I go back.
For main course, we had Lobster king prawn thermidor and the grilled New Zealand pork chops. 
The prawn was perfectly cooked. The mushroom sauce blended perfectly with the fresh prawn and it was cooked to perfection.
The pork chops are one of the most expensive dishes in this place. Well, it is really really tasty and the meat is cooked amazingly (neither overcooked nor under-cooked). But I don't think that the price is justified.

We were too full to order any dessert.

Overall, I loved this place although the price is little on the higher side. I would like to go back again and taste more delicacies.

It one words it's just awesome. Visited for the first time and I fell in love with the decor and decor only. Like I can't express the same in words. Just you need to visit to experience the place....
Now about the pricing part. Seriously guys it very much expensive like 2 cocktails and 1 side costs Rs.1300 approximately.
Now coming to the quality of food and the drinks served the drink that is The Babusaheb is a must try item. And about the other two it's equivalent to the price charged for the same.
In short if you have money you should visit the place once. It's yes very expensive and superb in quality of the food served...

I went there along with my friend for Astami dinner.Great place to have Continental & Italian cuisine. They have a huge menu on offer and understanding each dish is a task itself as you might not be familiar with all the dishes. Coming to food, the dishes are well presented and adequate quantity is given. Price is on higher side and serving time is comparatively less. Ambience is the USP of this restaurant. You get a fine dining experience and it is so beautifully decorated inside. Perfect to take someone out for a date.

I went on a lazy Saturday morning looking for some good breakfast and that's exactly what I found. 
First of all, shout out to the establishment for the amazing décor. I felt like I was transported to colonial Calcutta. The interior is so charming that you can easily spend one hour admiring the old Calcutta photographs on the wall and the funky book shelf. 
The Breakfast menu is not very extensive, its concise but I don't think that its necessarily a bad thing. You have choice of cereal, porridge, eggs, pancakes, waffles etc.
What we ordered were as follows
1. Omelette stuffed with bacon- this was perfect. Fluffy, light, the bacon enhancing the flavor of the omelette without making it greasy. This was served with two pieces of toast and hash brown and butter (optional)
2. Pancakes- light, fluffy, served with whipped cream maple syrup, honey and a summer fruit compote. Happy with both the taste and texture! 
3. Waffles-  Tip: don't leave waffles out for too long as they might get hard to cut afterwards. 
Saying that, the taste was spot on. Crunchy and chewy at the same time. Served with the same sides as mentioned above. Only thing I wish there was more whipped cream as I love my waffle with generous amounts of whipped cream. 
The service was fantastic and I left the place full, not stuffed, and a happy customer! The bill came to 1100 which for two people (including the watermelon juice we had) is I feel reasonable. 
Will visit again!

I am very glad to have found this place, as an enthusiast of continental food I will gladly recommend this place to any and everyone who appreciates good food and does not mind paying for it. I recommend the chicken stuffed with bacon, the lasagna, frankly almost everything. Excellent place for an afternoon luncheon and a drink!

It one words it's just awesome. Visited for the first time and I fell in love with the decor and decor only. Like I can't express the same in words. Just you need to visit to experience the place....
Now about the pricing part. Seriously guys it very much expensive like 2 cocktails and 1 side costs Rs.1300 approximately.
Now coming to the quality of food and the drinks served the drink that is The Babusaheb is a must try item. And about the other two it's equivalent to the price charged for the same.
In short if you have money you should visit the place once. It's yes very expensive and superb in quality of the food served...

I went there along with my friend for Astami dinner.Great place to have Continental & Italian cuisine. They have a huge menu on offer and understanding each dish is a task itself as you might not be familiar with all the dishes. Coming to food, the dishes are well presented and adequate quantity is given. Price is on higher side and serving time is comparatively less. Ambience is the USP of this restaurant. You get a fine dining experience and it is so beautifully decorated inside. Perfect to take someone out for a date.

I went on a lazy Saturday morning looking for some good breakfast and that's exactly what I found. 
First of all, shout out to the establishment for the amazing décor. I felt like I was transported to colonial Calcutta. The interior is so charming that you can easily spend one hour admiring the old Calcutta photographs on the wall and the funky book shelf. 
The Breakfast menu is not very extensive, its concise but I don't think that its necessarily a bad thing. You have choice of cereal, porridge, eggs, pancakes, waffles etc.
What we ordered were as follows
1. Omelette stuffed with bacon- this was perfect. Fluffy, light, the bacon enhancing the flavor of the omelette without making it greasy. This was served with two pieces of toast and hash brown and butter (optional)
2. Pancakes- light, fluffy, served with whipped cream maple syrup, honey and a summer fruit compote. Happy with both the taste and texture! 
3. Waffles-  Tip: don't leave waffles out for too long as they might get hard to cut afterwards. 
Saying that, the taste was spot on. Crunchy and chewy at the same time. Served with the same sides as mentioned above. Only thing I wish there was more whipped cream as I love my waffle with generous amounts of whipped cream. 
The service was fantastic and I left the place full, not stuffed, and a happy customer! The bill came to 1100 which for two people (including the watermelon juice we had) is I feel reasonable. 
Will visit again!

Had heard a lot about this place and finally tried it today. Food is very good and service was also good. Portions are also more than adequate. The staff are courteous. We had their signature Romanian bacon wrapped prawn for starters. This is really good. Prices are a little on the higher side but it is worth it. Looking forward to visiting again.

One of the oldest Continental food joint in Kolkata. If you love continental food you should try atleast once here. The dish names were pretty large. But the taste were very good. Apart from that the ambience was very good. Suggested you should try Babumosai cocktail its awesome.

This place looks really classy. The walls and ceiling will give you hints of great taste in art. The ambiance is serene. The restaurant is divided into few sections and the seating arrangements are comfortable.

Wine & Dine: Ordered a Virgin Mojito and a cocktail (Rum with a view). I requested to get the Mojito in room temperature which they did and it was really good. Coming to the cocktail, a shoutout for this amazing mix of white rum, green apple, mint, apple juice & cinnamon. Loved it!

For starter we ordered Grilled Italian Chicken bites with caprese salad and parsley garlic aioli. The presentation was awesome. Also, it tasted delicious.

Next we ordered Turkish Grilled Chicken with Pomegranate Tabbouleh, Hummus & Pita Biscuit and Desi Style Roast Chicken in Red Wine Jus with Orange Mash. Both the dishes tasted great but the quantity was disappointing. 

Service: Okay. Could be better.

Price: Little on the higher side.

Recommended!

A complete treat for all your senses - visual, gustao,  olfaco and tactio...Let me tell you why and how.Situated just around the corner Hazra crossing, this is one classy place to visit in Kolkata: pleasant ambience, great food, soothing music , things to touch and feel. This is a gorgeous colonial house, which has been converted into a boutique hotel by a young entrepreneur, Megha Agarwal. There are just beautiful seven rooms, named after colours - from Indigo to Ivory. We stayed here in one of these beautiful rooms, our room was named Charcoal. My fav interiors in Black and in gray tones. What more could have I asked. 
There was a charming black wood bed, louvered windows, and objects around you to admire. And amidst all these lovely rooms is also a contemporary restaurant  which includes a Courtyard, high-stepped wooden staircase with wrought iron balusters to go to the first floor. Glass ceilings help in creating lovely play of light. Great work, the Architect! 

Let me move over to the food and drinks. We had both a breakfast and a lovely lunch. Surrounded with old paintings, clocks, dart boards and my favourite books - covering travel, poems, and life, and something as simple as latches and knobs, I loved to wait for a wonderful meal - both the time.

We had our omelettes with Americano and milk on the side. He took 'three eggs cooked in any way' and of course decided how he wanted.  and I took my egg divinity - the morney sauce was yummy.For lunch,  I couldn't stop having a fish from this land - my food was most amazing - can't stop vouching for the Steamed burnt Bengal Betki with Ratatouille and rice. 
Well, CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK :The beauty of the place and the food do wonders to your sense, at the same time -  the only thing that we would want them to change is the service - some promptness and that's it - they cracked it all. They have a decent group but then the folks could do better to be at serving faster. The prices are on the higher side, the service time could be quickened too. In fact, we lost the most important time to do the photography in the city, while sincerely waiting for our lunch to come.

Must Visit if you are in Kolkata :-) Enjoy the delightful time there, which will stay with you for years....

Full review on www. ourlittletravelbook. com

                        India has a rich and long standing colonial past, and there are some gem of places where one can dine & wine in the company of such old world charms. One such place is the colonial looking pretty place perfectly named ‘Corner Courtyard‘ and conveniently tucked into a corner in Hazra, Kolkata. This place is often hailed for being one of the most romantic places in the city and I might as well agree!

The Space: If you are a fan of cozy, bright and white colored interiors, if colonial old world charms appeals to you, and if you are looking for a quiet romantic meal, this is your place. The place has a striking interior with white walls with mirrors and frames hanging on them, huge dangling lights, big windows and a shelf full of travel books of India and Kolkata, the most unique look of the place is the wall with a 100+ door knobs of all shapes and sizes, pretty chairs all in shades of pastel; all this put together, it works out to be a perfect place for a cozy family dinner or a romantic one with that someone special.

Food & Drinks: The place specializes in continental cuisine, in fact one of the places in the city serving Italian and French cuisine pretty close to authentic. My favorites!core they serve really loaded and well done bruchettas, the pizzas and pastas can be ordered without second thoughts. Watch out for the Grilled chicken ‘The Californian’, it sure tasted as well as it sounds.

What’s unique: Definitely the huge wall full of colorful door knobs of all shapes and sizes, such a stunner!

Watch out for: It is best to ask the waiters for the best options available. I have tried to not listen to them and order as per my liking but I was kind of disappointed, so it is always to best to ask!

Pocket Pinch: The quantity is typically European in nature, by which I mean very measured and this left me with a feeling that the hit on my pocket was on a harder side. A dinner with drinks for a couple could be anywhere around Rs 3000+. Quite expensive with a rather not so full stomach!

It was a shaptami evening. Three friends. We ordered hazelnut cappuccino and cold coffee. And pizza. The pizza was amazing, to say the least. My friends say their beverages were up to the mark as well.
The main thing that attracts the visitors is the ambiance. Brilliant. Such a quaint place with some good music. And I love the fact that they use the radiotunes app for their music list. I love radiotunes. And I loved this place so much.
I will come back here for another pizza.💗

I was very confused as to how to rate this place, cause I am very been here twice and the first time it was out of the world, and the second time a huge disappointment. So I decided to rate it on the basis of the second visit. The ambience is just magical, better than anywhere else. But the last time I visited the food was not upto the mark. They were in a hurry to shut the place, but that is no reason to serve tasteless food. Not sure if I will visit again.

I visited Corner Courtyard with my husband and mom on a Monday night expecting to have a quiet, quick dinner as its a "school night". It was our first time to the restaurant and after hearing and reading good reviews about it we were eagerly looking forward to it. The place is fantastic, quaint but artistically done decor, each piece in the restaurant is well thought out and goes perfectly together. The music, seating, and overall ambience gets a 5 star from me, however the service needs some work. We ordered the Gouda and Pomegranate salad, the chorizo and asparagus pizza and a bacon stuffed chicken. Firstly the server who took our order looked no older than 15 years old (lucky him!). He was unable to converse or respond regarding our queries about the menu, and after we finally spent 10mins placing the order, having him repeat the order several times, the task was done. I will point out that when we placed the order for the stuffed chicken with bacon, he said, and I quote "do you want?" Which meant what, I still cannot fathom. The ordeal did not end there. While the salad and pizza arrived promptly and tasted super. Again 5 stars to the chef. The chicken (which we did in fact want!) still had not arrived. We asked the same server twice what the delay was and he said, and again I am quoting, "it is stuff chicken so take time"...really? Does it take an hour? We waited for 25mins more after which the wretched chicken arrived, by which time we were tired, so sadly the chicken experience was not as good. We later asked the same server why it really took so long and if he had forgotten to place the order in the first place to which he reluctantly admitted he had forgotten. Now the point is, if only he has mentioned that earlier, we would have accepted it and moved on. Rather than being lied to and making us wait for over an hour. Sorry Corner Courtyard...while your food is good, you will never see me visiting there again, only because your service SUCKS!

This is a very pretty restaurant. From outside its an old Kolkata house and from inside a beautiful man modern bistro.The antique cameras and other small things on display are done very tastefully and gives a different charm to the restaurant.The collection of teas here are also pretty nice.The seating beside the window is very pretty and so are the unique details of the furniture. Now coming to the food.Brilliant. We ordered a crab soup which was amazing. We were completely drooling for more by the end of it.We ordered some crispy fried squids after that which was good as well.For main course we ordered peri peri prawns and New Zealand lamb chops.The lamb chop was my favourite,the prawns were nice too.We ended our meal with a cup of tea as we were having a late lunch.I celebrated my mother's birthday there and it was an amazing experience. This restaurant is strongly recommended.

Been here last evening with my boyfriend... Situated just beside the petrol pump of lansdowne Hazra crossing this is one of the most classy place I have ever visited. 'Pleasant ambience and soothing music ' as he described it. The decor is simply stunning... Extremely well behaved staff and service was good as well. Pricing a bit on the higher side which I felt could be a reason why I didn't see more than 2 tables occupied on a Sunday evening... We missed the terrace as it was temporarily closed due to bad weather conditions... The food was delicious. It can be a nice choice if you are planning to spend a quite romantic dinner with your loved ones.

When one steps into The Corner Courtyard, vintage is the word that first comes to the mind. An old south Kolkata house with its old world charm, renovated and made up with antiquated curios, along with some good continental and European food is what makes up the Corner Courtyard. It is as much a visual delight and lets you soak in its ambience as it is a culinary den.

For directions, if one heads from JD Park metro station, walk on Hazra road and take a right onto Sarat Bose road. Head up a few buildings, and you find your destination at the corner of a small by-lane. It is the old world charm which is so unique to the CC. A house with a courtyard, with wooden louver style windows, high stepped staircase with wrought iron balustrade. A balcony overlooking the courtyard. The walls done up with old paintings, clocks, dart boards and books and something as simple as latches and knobs. The shelves with the erstwhile telephone, the box type radio and vintage cameras. The old tall chandelier. All this and more make up the CC.

Moving over to the food and drinks. The menu offers a range of options both in food and drinks. We cooled off with a virgin vino and a virgin mojito green apple. I liked the flavour that the mojito had with the lime and the mint in the soda. The vino was okay for my palate. Moving on, something that just made our visit worth was the panko crusted fish fingers with wasabi tartar sauce. Finger shaped tender nuggets of fish, deep fried with a crisp crust, served with a mayonnaise dip. I now rue that we didn't indulge with another portion. It surely remains on my list in the next visit. Moving on we decided on the Californian pizza. The pizza was well made with a perfect topping of corn, chicken and veggies and cheese. We would have preferred a normal base to a thin crust though. For desserts, it was baked cheesecake and it was a sweet end to a good meal.

Well, the beauty of the place and the food do wonders to the pace, but then the service needs to be made more prompt. They have a decent sized fleet but then the stewards could do well being more available. The prices are on the higher side. The service time could be quickened too.

Overall, it was a heart warming experience. Would surely visit again. There's a lot on the menu which will head me here.

Happy eating!!!

This place is for soaking in the beauty and appealing ambiance of this place, having a gastronomic experience or indulging in some good time with wine in the beautifully done terrace. Everything is immaculately done. 
Which is what our experience was like. It was more about the beauty than the food, though.
After wine we ordered for ceasar salad and Turkish grilled chicken. Ceasar salad was good, nothing extraordinary. The Turkish chicken was delicious. 
I only wish the bar wasn't confined only to the terrace.

Every time I visit this place, I get attracted with their ambience and the lovely antique pieces all around with English style furniture decor. The thin crust sea food pizza,  parmesan chicken breast and the blue berry cheese cake are mind blowing.

To begin with, this place is a visual treat. You fall in love with the place as soon as you enter. Went there for dinner with my family & all of us thoroughly enjoyed the food & ambience.
Their pizzas are a must try as they make it really really well. We ordered for the CRUSTY PEPPERONI PIZZA & we simply loved it..!!
We also ordered for CRISPY SAUSAGE TOSSED IN SOY WITH GRILLED ONIONS & CORIANDER, this perhaps was one of the best sausage dish i have had ever.
Their FISH & CHIPS is also very good, the fish being absolutely fresh without any smell of the same.
Their CHOCOLATE OREO MOUSSE is to die for. 
Strongly recommend..!!! Will definitely visit again.

To begin with this place is a visual treat. I was taken aback with its masterfully crafted decor which had a story to tell in every cornor. The Menu is formulated with the decor like a good barrel select whiskey. Its very hard to impress me with Whiskey Sour and Chicken wings, but this place has nailed it. Family dinner, hangout with friends but a first date, thats wher you have me!!!

Overlooking the hustle and bustle of Lansdowne and Hazra Road crossing, this quaint and cosy place is a perfect place to unwind. Painted, in white, The Corner Courtyard offers you the best of Italian cuisine, in the most elegant of discourses. The ambience is drool worthy and the mocktails heavenly. Add a dash of a smiling server, and you have a perfect weekend. So, what to choose from the menu. Just can't pick out a favourite. They all are. Just don't forget the shakes. They literally shake you out of sobriety. The Corner Courtyard, is the place to be. Right now.

So this place was on my list for a very long time. Finally planned to visit with my besties for my pre birthday lunch.

Coming to the positives first. The ambience and the decor was spot on. Every single item was unique and carefully picked, starting from the furniture, to the paintings, hanging lamps, mirrors, books, vintage cameras. Not a single thing appeared out of the place. Beautiful colour scheme with vibrant items on a white backdrop.

The second thing I loved is the food presentation. Nothing over the top, however it was done neatly and the dishes appeared pretty.

Coming to the service and the hospitality. In one word the service was sloppy. It took at least twenty minutes to serve three beverages, and at least 35-40 minutes for each dish being ordered. We had ordered the beverages along with the appetiser, however by the time the appetiser arrived, the beverages were almost digested. What's more shocking is that, this was the time when we were the only diners present in the cafe. The entrée was ordered while the appetiser was served, still it took forty minutes to arrive. The waiters did not ask if we want our food to be served on the plate. After each course was finished, the plates and the cutleries were not replaced. The waiters did not even pick up the serving plates and the glasses after they were empty.

Now, the most important part: food. As I have mentioned the food looked pretty. The beverages were below average. The Virgin Vino tasted weird and medicine like. The mojitos were okayish. We had ordered bacon wrapped prawns, which came with a peanut butter sauce and root salad. The sauce was refreshing but the prawns were a bit chewy. Plus only half of the prawn was wrapped in bacon. I have had bacon wrapped prawns in various restaurants in the city, this was a let down in comparison to the price.

For the entrée we had ordered roasted chicken breast stuffed with bacon, broccoli and mozzarella, on a bed of orange cognac broth, served with boiled root veggies and seared greens. The dish looked amazingly pretty. Now the chicken portion were pathetically small, and the filling was too less. Could not find bacon in the filling, a few florets of broccoli were surely present. This dish did not have any distinct taste. The broth tasted fine. The roasted potatoes and carrots did taste okay. However the overall taste was nothing impressive. Another disappointing thing was, butter knives were given in the cutlery.

We choose baked cheesecake for dessert. The presentation again was neat. Rich yellow cheesecake with a rum based crumble, decorated with a basil shoot and musk melon ball. However the taste was bland. The cheesecake was a bit dry and the rum crumble appeared to be a bit overpowering in comparison to the rest of the cake, which did not have a distinct taste of It's own.

The entire menu is overpriced. Now, I do not mind paying extra if I get that extra bit, in terms of food and service. I go to restaurants which are three times pricier than this, however those are worth the money; this is not. The food is very basic in taste, and the portions are so small that they are not even enough for one person. To top that, the service is disappointing.

The rating is based only and only on the decor. Rest of the sections do not qualify for a rating

The food was good but the service was terrible.  The waiter had no idea about the food or the drinks that were being served.  As a party was going on we were informed that there would be delay in service as the bartender was busy serving the other party.  When we asked to speak to the manager,  he too was very 'busy' to come over.  We had to pay the bill at the counter because of lack of servers .  Very disappointed with the behaviour of the staff.

This place is so elegant and so very well decorated  you will fall in love as soon as you enter... Great ambience and great stuff I must say... Now coming to the food, very classy menu with genuine touch of sophistication.. Food is really good and as they say "Presentation does matter"  this pace knows that very well..The food looked so fancy I couldn't stop taking pictures... 

We ordered a glass of virgin Mojito and a fresh lime soda followed by a veg main dish and a grilled chicken that came with couscous which was very delicious but if you are more of a spicy food lover then you might not like it...and for dessert we had the chocolate cake...and finally the bill came around 1500 approx which was not very cheap but looking at the place and the food I guess it's quite okay... 
So For a nice meal out without making a huge whole in your pocket this place will come really handy.. 
A must try place..
Will definitely visit again..

Ohhh i will recomend this resturent for awsm interior and awsm cocktails and continental food... It has two part rooftop and ground floor ... Though they dnt serve cocktail and drinks to ground floor...we gone there two week ago for dinner... We took indian summer ,bloody merry,mojito as cocktail in rooftop.. Awsm experience and staff is very friendly and cooperative.. With a starter of steamed vetki which was very well garnished with meyoneese and all.. It was too much lavishing mouth watering.. Then we came in ground floor ordered a salad nonveg and one lamb item and chicken item.. Every item was too awsmm.. Though the most attracting part is awsmm ambience with soft music and awsm food presentation. Then we ordered two desert chocholate suffle and baked cheesecake.. Both r jst wowww... Mind blowing dinner.. Bt it will be better if they serve the alchohol ground floor ..although nice xperience.any continental food lover can go easily. Oh a little bit costly :-( Thank you.. I wanna go there again :-) Sounak Bepari

Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and was greatly disappointed with the food. The bhetki dish had a rotten mustard dressing. We had to complain about the same and the stuff was proactive at changing the dish right away. Opted for a chicken dish this time which turned out to be super hard and rubbery. Thoroughly disappointed.

Rarely have I visited any place and found it extremely disappointing. Went there to celebrate my birthday , was in two minds before visiting this place though as the previous reviews have been quite mixed, but still thought should give this place a try.

Coming straight to the point the ambiance is really great , has an old world charm in it. But the food has extremely disappointed us. When we entered the place was absolutely empty and when we wanted to sit at a place of our choice they just said that the section is closed.

Wonder why! 

The food we ordered

 #  Grilled Italian chicken bites with caprese salad and parsley garlic aioli 

#  Steamed burnt garlic Bengal Bhetki fish with Ratatouille and rice (we had asked the waiter for suggestion as that's what he suggested us)

The grilled chicken bites was hard that what was expected , it was just average! However the dip served along with it was very good ,mayo which had flavour of burnt garlic in it which tasted really good!  the quantity was served was good for 2 people .

Now coming to the Steamed Bengal Bhetki dish - well, the fish had a foul odour , and a sour taste and I am not kidding. The mustard that was used didn't seem fresh at all. The bhetki fish didn't have the tenderness to it.. at all ! On complaining they said the chef himself came over .His claim was that the fish was fresh. so the staff and the chef finally agreed to change the dish and we asked them to serve something in chicken. 

So instead we were served with Turkish grilled chicken with pomegranate tabbouleh salad,hummus and pita biscuit. Th chicken slices was so hard  and rubbery that it was really difficult to even slice them with the knife. The cereal served with it  (which i think was couscous) was too sour and it was just bad! I didn't even feel like trying the pita bread.. everything was such a letdown! We couldn't even finish the dish.

This was the first time I ever had such a bad dining experience where all the dishes were such a let down! Having fancy themed place can pull crowds for sometime but not in the long run because it ultimately the food is what you pay for ! It high time the management takes the customer reviews seriously !

I had been waiting to visit this place for such a long time hence this will be a detailed review. This place has mind blowing decor and ambience. I fell in love with the decor the colourfully adorned walls, the chandeliers, the quaint atmosphere , it was just so beautiful I was drooling all over it. If the food and the service was half as good as the decor I would have given this place a 5 on 5.

But it was extremely disappointing. We had ordered the spicy calamari uruguyaeian style. It came with a dip and was indeed good. However it took quite some time to arrive . The restaurant was almost empty as we went on an afternoon. Next we ordered a pizza the seafood one. I kid you not it took exactly 35 mins to arrive. We were one of the first customers to arrive however I was surprised that the waiters kept serving the other customers who had arrived later than us and they too had ordered pizza!
I had to ask him how long was it till we got our pizza.
Finally when the pizza arrived it was quite a big one but I was so disappointed :( considering this place is a bit pricey I was really sad that I couldn't eat more than one slice of the pizza . Because all it tasted and smell like was a weird kind of milk powder. No amount of oregano or chilly flakes could fix it.The cheese itself wasn't fresh.
Even after the disappointing pizza we ordered dessert. You have to go up to their came counter to choose your dessert . None of the available options looked quite appealing to me. Still we ordered the relatively better option chocolate truffle.

It was so dry and ashy! Again a bummer.

To sum up,to me the quality of a food is the most important thing to me above everything. And they failed miserably in this part . The service too was quite disappointing. The proverb 'Don't judge a book by its cover' is true for this place!

Omg..!! A real classy place is The Corner Courtyard. So beautiful it is...u will surely fall in love with their ambiance,simple yet so classy decor. the food is soo delicious,enough in quantity.. We ordered south indian peri peri prawn skews...it was to beautifully plated,and tasted amazing.. 😍 The staffs are very cooperative. We also had one pizza,that was too good for me really. They have a terrace .. and we loved hanging out there too. So I will recommend this place highly...go and have a nice evening. 😀

One word for The corner courtyard will be "Marvelous". Well lit and decorated this place has its own uniqueness. The food here is amazing with friendly staff. Hawaiian pizza, is a must. 10% service charge along with 20.5% normal charges was the only disappointing thing. Nonetheless, one should visit it.

Ordered a pizza through Swiggy. It was one of the worst Pizzas I've had in my life. 
It had processed cheese instead of mozzarella and it had a funky smell. 
Also found a piece of hair on one of the slices. 
I called up the restaurant and told them about it. They simply said we don't know what to do if you've already paid. 
Garden cafe pizzas are better. Disgusting service

Beautiful! That's the word I would use to describe this place. Very soothing ambience and the simple yet elegant decor gives you a very nice feeling. And it has only started. Wait till the food arrives and you are assured that the smile in your face only broadens. Coffee was good as well and the chocolate cake was yummy! Pricing is moderate given that the portion size is good. Only thing that was disappointing is that the valet parking was not available and it is a very narrow lane. Anyways this can be ignored. Overall this is one of the must visit places in Kolkata.

The pictures show the place well-lit & bright, but in reality it is not really so. Though, the decor is absolutely different and eccentric, & we loved it. We ordered fish fingers, chicken wings for appetizer. Both were yum. Then we had lamb with spaghetti, prawns in peri-peri sauce & rice, California pizza & pepperoni pizza. The thin crusted hand made pizzas were out of the world. The lamb was too sweet. The other food items were pretty good. For dessert, kiwi lime pie was tangy and smooth. But the cheesecake was too heavy and too sweet for a proper balanced dessert. The quantity in each portion is not skimpy, so you get good value for money. The price is good keeping in mind the quality of food and the standard of the place.

Coming to food, we ordered Nachos, Crostini with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes, sweet and spicy chilly garlic fries and Veggie Lovers Pizza. None disappointed us. But the Pizza stood out as it was perfectly baked with the right amount of toppings! Special mention to the Eggless Chocolate Truffle Slice which was sinful and deliciously yummy!!! Overall had a good time.

The location gets you the instant you walk into the place. The tiny lane, the fence, the name board hanging outside. What else could mimic a French/Spanish restaurant off the travel guides! Kudos to the mind behind the presentation of the entire place & the fine dining experience in the heritage property near Poddopukur! To the creative people who designed the interiors, the menu, picked the cutlery and so on. And lastly, to the personnel within the kitchens and outside that ensure that well-presented mishmash of European food reaches your tables right when you're done with your selfies and gossip. The food has the right amount of taste and blandness mingled, part of a very experimental menu with an Oriental touch (mushroom poppers, stuffed with cheese and wasabi, with Thai sweet chilli dip) and a fine collection of cocktails to go with. A bit on the pricier end, The Corner Courtyard has an excellent proliferation for lunches and dinners, not so for vegetarian breakfasters, and for those seeking quiet time, there is private dining on the roof! Left impressed with everything, except perhaps for their super overloaded house special pizza (too many toppings spoil a pizza). A must visit and a definitely must revisit!

Went to this place on 26th June, 2016, to treat my friends. The place is on Sarat bose road (Hazra) opposite Axis bank. It has an amazing decor, beautiful place. From food to decor to ambience to hospitality, everything was just satisfactory. Starting from glasses, everything had a uniqueness.

Food was decent but nothing out of the world. Three of us visited this place. Portions were pitiful for 3. Ordered -

1. Cheese fondue flavour - This being creamy and cheesy, this was good.

2. Classic Margherita pizzas - Absolutely amazing. Perfect baked thin crust pizzas

3. Veg pasta - Just like any other pasta. Nothing new or different about it.
4. Virgin mojito

5. Shirley temple

Food was good but was served little late. Burns a mean hole in the pocket against the portions they offer. The waiters need to be trained more. We had to ask for basics like tissue, water etc!

An old house renovated to perfection - Thats what comes into your mind when you step into this place. The place has been done so beautifully  that you actually dont bother about the food much. Its located on sarat bose road, not difficult to locate. The ambience impresses you to a great extent with cutely done walls, chairs and the ceiling. We had gone for breakfast availing the nearbuy offer , so we didnt have any choice and had to order whatever was being offered for that voucher. We had the Chicken Sandwich which was served with salad and ketchup, and Pancakes which was served with whipped cream, strawberry jelly kind of a thing, chocolate sauce and maple syrup. The food tasted great, especially the Sandwich with generous amount of chicken. The Pancakes were good too, could have been better but the chocolate sauce and maple syrup makes up for it - not complaining though :) Staff was cordial and service was quick.
On the whole, I recommend Corner Courtyard for the entire experience - Food+ Ambience.

There are elements to a typical bar cum restaurant but warmth doesn't qualify as one of those elements. The Corner Courtyard definitely is one of the rare and yet refreshing exceptions to this rule of thumb.

Pros: Quality food, availability of almost everything you see on the menu, great service & subtle and classy ambience.

Cons: Burns a mean hole in your pocket, Personally found the Greek Chicken Souvlaki Skewers a bit overrated.

Must haves in food: Bengal bhetki bite sized grilled served in paprika sauce(please do ensure that the fish is fresh), Grilled shrimp tossed in peri-peri sauce.

Must haves in drinks: Rum diary.

Hey, if you found this helpful or even not to your agreement, please leave a comment down below. Burp & Cheers!

I would have given 3.5 but for the price. Food was decent but nothing out of the world. Rs.1290 for lamb chops of mediocre quality seemed highly over priced. I don't mind the price given the quality but here the quality here is at best 
at par with other restaurants having moderate rates. Decor is nice but food comes first. 

Overall impression : Food is ok-ish... Quality is mediocre.... price is way too high

When someone told me about "The Corner Courtyard", I made sure that I will check the place out when I manage to get back to Calcutta. So, I look up Zomato to get a sense of what I can expect from the reviews. I saw that the general complaint is about the portion size as compared to the price. That didn't bother me much as I generally don't mind paying top dollars for top notch food. When we walked into the restaurant, I didn't really pay attention to the so called "old world charm" as I know how over rated that term is in Calcutta. (Havana, Cuba is what I consider a benchmark of old world charm where decay and beauty compliment each other even today).

Known for my cavalier ways, I generally order a Martini to work up an appetite (a dry one). It was on the menu. The first alarm bell rang in my head when the gentleman serving us came back with a bottle of readymade Martini Rosso with only 60 ml left in the bottle. When something from the menu as popular as a Martini is not available it reflects poor stock management. They may argue "Sir, it doesn't move". Then why do you even have it on the menu? That argument may just reflect poor understanding of the market and the target audience. So we settled for a Classic Margarita. 

The food menu is pretty exhaustive. But if one looks closely, you will see that there is a flavour mismatch or a flavour clash in many of the dishes. For example "Mussels and Shrimps". How does that work out, since both are distinctly strong flavours. Then there is basil and fennel in the same dish along with many more of such examples. It seems that the Menu Planner has added as many names as possible to create an impression. Just like we Indians love to drop names whenever we find ourselves in a tight spot. But I was really curious and I requested to talk to the chef to get better clarity. I asked him if there was any particular reason they have a dish with mussels and shrimps together AND if its possible to have the dish ONLY with the mussels. The reason given by the chef was "people complain of quantity and we add shrimps to the dish to increase quantity". I was speechless.

Being extremely cautious by now, I ordered for ONLY ONE PLATE of the Risotto of the non veg variety, just to see if a restaurant claiming to handle exotic flavours in a daring dance of creative cuisine has got their basics right. Risotto is a good check as, though simple to make, it will reveal how much one knows about the culinary art. Whatever was served to me can be anything but Risotto. Risotto is just not rice that's green in colour with some meat and veggies. I was so glad that I ordered only one plate. Though I was ready to leave by then, I decided to check if the desserts were satisfactory. I ordered for an Apple Crumble. Guess what, it was so stale that I had to send it back.

Now, about the decor. It's a restaurant. So if the food fails, the decor doesn't mean much. 

I saw a lot of reviews that said fantastic food. Therefore, my conclusions are as follows. Calcutta is yet to experience what Gourmet dining is. Reviewers complain about quantity and not the quality. Which betrays the fact that most of us are not aware of what the quality SHOULD be. Corner Courtyard is just another addition to the mediocrity that seems to plague the Calcutta dining options. But I guess that's what sells in this city. As long as the foodies of Calcutta  don't demand excellence, you cant really blame the establishments for not delivering it.

Corner Courtyard Restaurant Team - There is room for a LOT of improvement. I recommend you focus on the food. Food is what your main business is. Everything else is secondary.

P.S - And yes, I insist on calling my home Calcutta (Old World Charm, you see?)

The presentation, the ambience all was amazing no doubt. The service was good, too. They've got good music playing. Also the way they renovated the old shack was superb. The cheese fondue was amazing the cheese being creamy and very much cheesy. Although the thai curry wasn't that good but the mac and cheese played the compensation part. Mac and cheese was super!

This place is on sarat bose road, opposite to axis bank and adjoining a petrol pump.
I visited corner courtyard for dinner few months ago and my visit was disappointing.
I had heard a lot about the quality of food there but I believe if you wanna judge the quality and savour the taste, you gotta order too many dishes here as the quantity is pitiful.
A dish of prawns (don't remember the name) was worth over 400 and when it arrived, there were 5 saw shrimps lying miserable on corners of a huge plate with some purple cabbage dressing at the center.

Disappointing- is an understatement. Soup comes in tea cups, hence is over in 2-3 sips. Over priced. No management of kids. You would pay 450 bucks for 5 shrimps and at least expect a peaceful dining.. But you would find noisy kids running around, shaking your tables, picking up your salt pepper stands and what not. 
Terrible.
Shall i go back? No. I value my hard earned money. Hence, no.

This is bad news for people hoping to grab breakfast at this cozy restaurant. we placed an order for roughly 4 simple dishes on a sunday morning and despite being the only customers got our first order after 40 mins ,following the other 3 after a gap of 10mins each. i fail to understand why it took them so long to make a simple pancake and omelettes, not to forget , we had to ask for basics like napkins and sauces. The service, clearly, was bad, the food is overpriced (we paid a rs 1500 bill ) and average but ambience is what made us head their in the first place.
So if you're looking to start your day by spilling some money off your pocket for average food and bad service, head here .

Easily, one of my favourite places to eat in kolkata. Everything about this place screams out class. Right from the decor (which I absolutely adore) straight down to the menu and service, every aspect o the place is top notch. Prices are on the higher side, but the quality and quantity, more than make up for the price. Most of all, the ambience is cozy and the food is just simply delicious. I hope they can keep up their standard and I am definitely goin to go back there very soon.

The place is cute. The food is poor. The service is ok - though I saw a waiter handle my chocolate cake with his hands after it fell on the counter - he casually put it back on the plate. 
The menu looks promising but delivers very bad flavours. Overall everything was sweet. Ordered what was supposed to be a mutton goulash type dish. Was bad and sweet kosha Mangsho at best. 
Overpriced for this quality. Go here for coffee and order a salad at best. The cooking is not good.

Sitting pretty at Hazra, this lovely place going to excite 4 out of your 5 senses. Cool decor. Good food. Good service. Nothing there to dislike really.

Ambiance : Sense of sight. The white coloured walls along with the beautifully decorated ceilings and well set props are a treat to the eyes. It has two floors and 3 seperate sections. The top floor is a rooftop . 

Food : Delicable. We ordered a mushroom poppers for starters and a pizza. The mushrooms will melt in your mouth. Pizza was quite good.

Service : Well behaved staff. They attended us quite nicely.

Service time : Quick. You will get your food in 10 15 minutes. Well, who wants to wait for 30 minutes in any resteraunt :D

Drinks : We ordered a tomorrow land in cocktails and a one other mock tail. Decent enough.

Pocket pinch : 1100 for two (without drinks)

I definitely recommend corner courtyard. It's not a typical resteraunt where you just sit and eat your food. It's an experience.
PS: The washrooms are amazing. :D

An old house dressed to perfection to feel like restaurant. Though it's a little too congested but it's mainly because they have attempted to fit in more tables in the least possible space. Spread out over floors, they have rooms for guests and an open terrace bar. Nice concept though!

Basilica pesto pizza was nice but would suggest add some topping of your choice to avoid extra onions. Rosti with Swiss potato in creamy leaks is  good too but I didn't quite like the idea of putting some caramelised onions in the sides. It made the taste sweet. Mojito was just Ok. Their cutlery and crockery are different and goes with the feel heavy ambience. They look bulky. 

Since the portions are not quite you will have to make repeat orders and that makes the place not quite worth the price, nevertheless it's a good place to hangout in rotation. 

Overall, this place makes you feel happy and you tend to enjoy your food even more in the process. Extra half a point only for that. Else 3.5 is optimal for TCC.

Went there on a special occassion-to celebrate my first salary with my girlfriend...this place was a long time on our "to visit" list and it came highly recommended by close friends

It's located on sarat bose road just a little way off where hazra road intersects sarat bose road...it's aptly named and i'll leave it to the visitors to realize why ;)...we were welcomed warmly by the staff and were shown our seats...to be honest we were expecting a really classy high end ambience(if you know what i mean)...but i have to say we were pleasantly surprised to find that the ambience to be really nice and cosy...it's kinda perfect...the place has been made by refurbishing a residence and that residential homely feel has been preserved

We had ordered Mushroom Poppers as appetizer...it was decent enough...a new taste in mushrooms...we had then ordered jerk chicken and rosti as the entreé...the jerk chicken was one of the best chicken dishes i have ever tasted...i enjoyed every bite of it...my girlfriend had the rosti...she said it was pretty great as well...it i had to recommend something from my lone visit, i would definitely suggest our entree dishes

The best features about the place is it's feel...you can sit comfortably and enjoy your food...taking in the ambience...the tables are well spaced so there is optimum privacy...the waiters would not rush you into ordering the next course and pop up time to time to ask about each and every dish...the way they served with a smile and allowed us to enjoy our meal in our own time and in our own way really impressed me....hope to visit again soon

While its terrace ambience is pretty decent, my experience was not particularly good when it came to service and food. Firstly the beer served in a glass was not in its full amount, with the waiter taking back the bottle with some in it. Moreover the Continental segment was not satisfactory both quantitatively and qualitatively. The roast chicken was stale and smelt of burnt oil. The herbed rice tasted bad and above all the quality of food is not matched up to its price. If one is looking forward to some chatty time with friends with some drinks for company, its a fair space. However I have had better Continental for the same range of price. Personally it was disappointing for me and my friends.

The place is awesome in all aspects. From the design, the interiors, the rooms, to food and the service- Its actually got it all. The restaurant is exceptionally great. Must try the mushrooms and the pizza. There is valet so dont worry about parking.  Love the place and will always recommend others to visit.

I am a bit late in writing this review. Had gone for a family dinner on May 1st, had ordered tomato basil soup... Was having it myself and also feeding 2 of my kids.. Suddenly something came in my mouth... It was a piece of WIRE... Thank god it came in my mouth and not the kids. Called the manager there and showed him.he did not seem to be too apologetic. The owner was also right there and we said we wanted to meet her. The manager went to call her and suds came and said that she had left. We were unite surprised at this response. Instead of facing the situation she just avoided it and left. What if my child had gulped down the wire?? I was really shocked at this kind of response from the corner courtyard management. Last they had the opacity to charge for the soup... Leave alone the whole bill. WE PAID THE FULL AMOUNT And THEY ACCEPTED IT WITH NO GUILT. Posing pics also...

Ambience has become the most important thing nowadays other than food. So much so that restaurants r forgetting to serve good quality food. I m not saying corner courtyard's food quality is bad. I just wanna point out the fact that nowadays people r more hyped about the ambience nd feel of a place other than its food. Being a foodie i just dont like this craze thats popular nowadays. Service is top notch, very helpful to select the menu and also very swift to react. Quantity is very less even for a kid and even the quality and taste cant be said to be too good. I have given them 3 points based on their ambience and decor, their service and their presentation of food. More so its a costly affair.Sorry cant say whether i would visit the place once again or not.😕

Located in Lansdowne, it is a wonderful small place. The interiors are very well done and they have taken really great care choosing each and every piece of furniture.
Their Pizzas are absolutely amazing. Perfect baked thin crusts Pizzas which are one of the best the city has to offer.

A gorgeous colonial house that was last inhabited in 1904, has been converted into a boutique hotel by a young entrepreneur Megha Agarwal.... There are just seven rooms,,, named after colours that echo British trade nd lifestyle in the Colonies,,, from Indigo to Ivory.... There are charming four-poster beds, carved widows, floral balconies nd more.... But sitting amidst all this prettiness is also a fairly contemporary restaurant..... 

The global menu offers a jumble of flavours: you can dip Potato Wedges in Cheese Fondue with Sundried Tomatoes,,, or have beet-flavoured Hummus,,,, Honey Glazed Grilled Chicken paired with Bengali mustard nd even Grilled Shrimps tossed in a Chocolate Sauce.... It is one of those places that you must visit to breathe in the atmosphere nd yet come back having managed a light nd cosmopolitan bite.....

Being the wife of a food lover we keep trying new places... And never get a chance to repeat.. And this place was one where v were craving so badly to go again for the 4 th time... Craving to have real good Italian!!
Must say it was a real bad experience and had to later on hop to the dhaba to complete our dinner...
The cheese fondue was pathetic with no taste of cheese... The pizza looked like straight out of garden cafe( I love tat Indian pizza too but not here!!)
The portions have reduced and so has the taste! Bad experience....

My first experience last night.  Quite honestly very average food. Infact we ordered a couple of things out of which the THAI green curry was vey bitter and overly salty. Just a heads up for all those who love cheese. " it's sweet in most cases ". Fondue as well as the pizzas had a sweet taste to it.  Quite heavily priced for its portions. Elaborate menu but no so good food

Disappointing is the service and the Stewart's .

Quaint decor that maintains the old Bangali bari edifice but adds its own funky touches.

This place will definitely impress you with its classy décor and ambience. The way they present their food is something to look out for.. Visited The Corner Courtyard a week back around 6ish for a quick coffee and a light meal.. Ordered a Focaccia Sandwich and a Grilled Chicken and later on some Cappuccino..
The sandwich had fresh buffalo mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, roasted aubergines, with a sweet garlic and spicy pesto sauce served on Focaccia bread. It tasted good.
The Grilled Jamaican Jerk Chicken was done to perfection and was served with lemon saffron rice with veggies. Loved it. Presentation was top-notch.
The place has an European street café feel, and that makes the place better than most of the cafés in that area.. The prices are on the higher side, but alot goes in the preparation and presentation of the food there..so its worth all the money spent. Will revisit for sure.

An absolute 5/5 for their interiors. You feel so fresh to be dining in such a tastefully done restaurant. Speaking of food, their old menu had much more variety for vegetarians which were filling as compared to the new menu. 
Really loved their bruschetta which ain't available in the new updated menu tho.

They know how to spoil ur mood on ur special day and how to mess up ur drink. I think all the waiters are hired on that day itself. How can a restaurant with such a "wannabe" environment not know how to make a mojito or whiskey on the rocks. After a point I had no option but to teach them how to make it. And the only good part was that out of 3 dishes ordered atleast 2 were good. The bar tender and the service will just put u off and spoil ur dinner. Never going in there again, its a fine dine restaurant where u need to go up and find a waiter and invite him to come to ur table.

What really works for this place is the way it has been done up. Its one of those ancient Bengali homes converted into boutique hotel and a very delightful cafe on the ground floor. 

The food I would say is good, not the best and a bit over priced for the portions they serve. All in all its a great experience more so for the way the restaurant has been done up, not the food so much :)

I bookmarked this place since a long time and have been waiting to try it out after going thru several reviews and finally hit it on the day of indo-pak cricket match last week. Since the weather was fine we decided to sit at their recently launched terrace bar that they have been advertising for a drink while waiting for our other friends to arrive. 

We ordered a gin and tonic & a vodka tonic but they arrived after waiting for quite a long time. No ice cubes were offered nor any tissue papers or serviette were given. There was no one around so that we could ask for these. After our friends joined we ordered few more drinks (this time we had to mention about ice cubes n tissues). 

We ordered 2 starters: 1. Sea salt roasted fig apple etc. salad...it was good. 2. Potato skins stuffed with choice of Bacon & cheddar (we were particularly excited about this dish) - what came to our table looked good but we could not see any bacon & cheddar rather it was filled wt what seemed baked beans, after a bite or two all of us were sure that there was absolutely no meat or cheese on it. We called the person who took the order he said he will check in the kitchen and will be back. After waiting what seemed eternity...with food lying in front of us...we saw them conversing excited among eachother...but no one turned up to our table to confirm what we had been served. Tired of waiting we called the person again and this time he sheepishly told us that we have been served Potato skin stuffed with Chilly beans instead of Bacon & cheddar! The best part is not even once the person offered any apology for the mistake that has been made from their part. 

We did not further eat that starter but since it was already late and we didnt wanted to spoil our evening we continued there with 3 different main course and 2 desserts. At the end when the bill came they charged us for the starter that they served but we didnt ordered to our amazement!! 

Overrall the food was good but portion not very great. Service is just pathetic & slow. Not at all very professional approach. The person who took the order was in plain cloth with no name badge otherwise I would have mentioned his name. 

After this bad experience we don't think we will go back to this joint again specially with the range of food joints with good food service ambience & cordial behavior that has come up in Kolkata these days.

I had visited The Corner Courtyard for the first time yesterday after hearing and reading about its rave reviews.
The first thing that strikes you is obviously the wonderful décor and the attention to detail paid by the designers.
Coming to the food,me and my parents had gone there in the evening so we only ordered two dishes to start with-grilled chicken skewers with Bengal mustard,honey and whiskey glaze followed by Mexican grilled fish & corn cakes with tomato caper dressing.
The first dish to arrive was the grilled chicken and it truly was beauty on a plate.
Next came a confusion in the form of a dish. After we ate the mexican fish or what we thought was the mexican fish anyway,we asked the waiter about the dish and he said it was grilled italian chicken bites with salad caprése and garlic aioli!We then told him that we had ordered a fish dish and he himself had said that the fish would be bhekti so how did we end up with a chicken dish?He then came back and told us that it was in fact the mexican fish. We were still not convinced as it tasted like chicken,so we asked to see the chef. The waiter ignored our request and brought the bill instead.
Now both the dishes tasted really good,no doubt about that,but the staff is incompetent-all of them were busy watching the match.
I would love to see a picture of the actual mexican fish dish that you serve just to clear my confusion.
P.S. The rating is only on the basis of the food and ambience.

I visited "The Corner Courtard" with my family, I liked the ambience of the place! The restaurant has newly opened their rooftop, I was pretty keen on eating food there, but as the weather wasn't too pleasant, we took our seats down on the ground floor. 
The service person who was looking after my table, wasn't too well verse with the menu, he couldn't really explain me the dishes and wasn't sure of the accompaniments, some more training needed for him. 
Coming to the food we had ordered:
1.Grilled Chicken Escallop with wild mushroom: the chicken was well cooked, the sauce was tasty, but I was expecting a better texture to the sauce ! The chicken was served on a bed of mashed potato, which had creamy texture, liked the potato, but the potato had chilli flakes added to it, I personally couldn't eat mashed potato without the chicken and sauce, as it was getting spicy! The chilli flakes were concentrated in the center of the mashed potato, which didn't give a spicy taste till I reached that point. 
2. The Corner Courtyard Baked Chicken on a bed of Spinach: it was minced chicken, with sheets of lasagne in between. The chicken mixture was spicy, my dad who isn't too fond of spicy food, didn't quite really appreciate it but he liked the flavours. He said a little less spicy could have been a lot better. 
3. Grilled Chicken with Jamaican Spices: This was served on a bed of rice, which was infused with lemon! The rice had some really good flavours. There were 2 pieces of chicken, one was a leg piece and a breast piece! 
I have a suggestion for you guys, as you are charging close to 500 bucks for this dish, I would expect a more better way of presenting the dish. Adding 2 pieces of chicken on top of some veggies served with some rice with a lemon wedge is not what am expecting. Taste and Presentation both are important components of the dish.  
Overall not a bad experience, but you can really Improvise on the issues.

This is one place which is famous for its decorations, service and we'll organized dishes and I'll say the same thing about it.
The place is extremely beautiful, very well decorated. Starting from the glasses to the food, everything has a uniqueness in it which is very beautiful.
The place is a perfect fine dining, the food is well made with beautiful flavors and taste, the drinks are similar to most other places but surely goes with the theme. Free valet parking available. 

A must go for every food lover. Perfect for couples or families interested in a good fine dining.

I finally ate here for lunch after reading so many nice reviews and waiting like for a few months. It was amazing, there were stuff put up everywhere and the ambience was nice, i went for a late lunch around 4, so not many tables were occupied but it was still fun. We ordered a chicken starter which looked amazing and was beautiful, followed by a chicken pizza. I came here early once at 12 to give a cake for my girlfriends' birthday which was to be served to us when we were gonna have after our lunch over there at 3. I did not get to try any of the looking-so-delicious-maincourses or desserts, but I'm sure ill be back to try it. I'll upload pictures once i have it. But yea it was an amazing experience and not too expensive aswell.

I had an excellent meal on January 1, 2015 at this place. The salmon was fresh, the plating was beautiful, and the appetizers were interesting. Unfortunately, my visit last evening was nothing short of appalling. If you're reading this review, I suggest you strap in for a long ride. 

The service was terrible. Perhaps they were understaffed, but for a mostly empty restaurant (3-4 tables were occupied) at around 8 pm there was no reason for us to have to aggressively hail the waiter, yell "excuse me" and gesticulate wildly in order to get them to take our main order and to get the cheque as well as to point out that the sangria we had been served was a wine that was so far gone it was basically vinegar (we sent the sangria back and it was replaced with somewhat better wine). No one came to refill our water glasses over the course of 1.25 hours. And we had to wait 15 minutes for our drinks and appetizer to be served. Thereafter we waited another 15 after or plates were cleared (which also took 10 minutes) for the mains to arrive. And we considered getting up to pay the bill at the counter up front after waiting too long at the table. No dessert selection was offered or recommended by our server. We were also misinformed by our server. Before ordering the lamb sliders as an appetizer for a table of 4 I asked whether there would be 4 sliders. I was told, yes. When it arrived there were only 3, and there was no apology for the misinformation forthcoming when I pointed it out. Perhaps most shocking was he big clatter with with which our plates were cleared off the table after the starter and how, shockingly, our used and dirty forks and knives were just unceremoniously dumped onto the place mats as the plates were cleared away. If we are paying international prices and pretending to be providing a fine dining experience then these basics of service need a severe overhaul. 

That was the service. Tragically the plating of the food remains beautiful but the food itself was below average. I'll point out the most obvious problems keeping in mind that other issues are more open to subjective tastes. The lamb sliders were hard to eat. The lamb itself was alright, but the buns, which are integral to the idea of a slider were tough and chewy. They had either been pre toasted so far in advance that they had hardened up so that biting into them was a messy affair leading to the whole thing falling apart or they were just straight up stale. 
The mains I ordered was the grilled Turkish chicken with tabouleh salad with pomegranate. The grilled chicken and the sauce it was slathered in was extremely salty. So salty that my tongue felt raw after a few bites. It was edible only with the basil chutney it was served with which countered the extreme saltiness. The chicken itself was stringy and hard to cut. It wasn't succulent, the juices had run dry. It's a rookie mistake, to overdo chicken and then douse it in a strong sauce to cover for the fact that meat itself is cardboard. The tabouleh salad was, err, NOT tabouleh. It had neither the freshness, the zest or the lightness specific to that salad. It was soggy. It had the consistency of sooji ka halwa. The "with pomegranate" was incidental, in that the fruit was not the best it could be given that it IS pomegranate season here. The seeds were mildly sweet and light pink rather than bursting with sweetness and bright red. In any case, it was disproportionately added to the tabouleh so that its presence was hardly visible. So there's the food. My fellow diners were not particularly happy with their meals but I did not attempt to taste theirs given how awful my own order was. 

A word about the "ambience" that reviewers go on about. Yes, the decor is interesting, bright and generally pleasant. However, the general experience can be much better. I wrote this in my review at the restaurant last year as well: club music is not appropriate for a restaurant such as this. It's appropriate for clubs (DUH) and lounge-y resto-bars and such like, where the lights are dimmer, where the experience is more geared to bar food, drinks and the possibility of dancing. I don't know about my fellow Calcuttans, but I should imagine that no one wishes to cut into their grilled chicken (tasteless though it may be), while having a thumping dubstep hit from
2013 searing itself into your skull at 8 pm on a Wednesday evening. Ambience is not just about putting up a bunch of fancy stuff on the walls to wow the supposedly provincial crowd in Cal. It's about providing a pleasurable dining experience. And that, I can assure you, is NOT something this place can provide until they train their staff in the norms of basic service, until the management takes cognizance that the music cannot be incidental and that mindlessly playing club dance hits just does not cut it, in fact, it undercuts any success they have with providing good food, WHICH, as they demonstrated last night, is not something that they can do consistently. 

I always tip the international 10-15% in India too through I know lots of people do not. Yesterday was the first time I refused to leave any tip at all. Do NOT take your chances with this place u less you have lots of time on your hands in Calcutta. And certainly do not make the mistake I did, of taking guests to it. Most embarrassing.

Tonight was the second time I visited the restaurant and this could be the most abysmal comedown in recent history. The first time was a little over a year ago and the difference between the two experiences is magnum. Tonight the staff were ignorant..service was slow and sketchy...the sangria that we ordered had red wine which had turned to vinegar and was vile to taste..on returning it a more palatable drink was produced.. The bread on the sliders was stale making them difficult to chew..and finally to get the bill we had to wait quite a while in a nearly empty restaurant!!what happened to this once excellent place?? Very disappointed. Folks avoid.. And let it shut down.

Much has been spoken about this place and deservedly so.
Went with a gang if friends on a Sunday.
The decor deserves its hype. Absolutely gem of colonial ambience.
The staff were top notch in professionalism and greetings.
Which brings me to the food. And what food. Probably the best continental I had in kolkata.
Comparison with even some of the places of hells kitchen in NYC won't be an exaggeration.
We ordered the beacon wrapped prawns in appetizers and I took the shrimp mollusc dish in main course. Friends ordered jamaican jerk chicken, maxican chicken and baked bhetki in mustard flavor.
The corner courtyard didn't give me/my friends any option to complain even after putting on d critical glasses.
Esp thanks to the staff for the amazing group pic.
Would I go back? Obviously.
Not a perfect 5 for the high pricing. We spent 930 per head.

I visited the place last Sunday. I must its really well decorated. A new kind of experience in terms of decoration. Very well done. 5 out of 5. But the food quality is not as good as expected. Rather I would say the taste of few dishes were not good. Starters were awesome, but the main course was not. Maybe i should try some other dishes next time. But you must visit this resturant for the awesome experience. My suggestion, go for dinner. The lighting inside will take your breath away. Perfect place for Valuntine's Dinner.

Without a second thought decor and ambiance is excellent. My personal experience on food is that it's tasty but when it comes to quantity it's unreasonably less(at the same time having any meal there definitely screws up your budget). Apart from that presentation of servings and staff attitude was very much upto the mark. 

Overall satisfied 😇

I was excited to visit this restaurant after reading Zomato reviews of different foodies. So I visited the place on 1st Jan 2016 for lunch with my Mom...
The Decor is excellent n most imp thing I liked was that different Book of photography on the display with you can go through while waiting for ur order..
We ordered -
1. Chief spl Rock crab ,corn chilly soup  [1/5] - Portion was Half cup,specially it was smelling so badly that we couldn't eat it.. It was low quality crab n not processes properly.. I always try crab soup where ever i get as i love crab more than anything. But when we complained about it steward said. crab soups r like dat they always smells.. I was quite surprised to know that.. any way he was good enough to replace it to a Chicken soup- may be a cream of  chicken or Potato leak leek chicken soup [2.5 /5] I don't know.. Tasted average , There was no chucks of chicken in it only puree, u have to try hard to identify its taste.. But at least edible.. If we compare the cost in 240 u'll get pretty good amount of soup with plenty of chickens in it in other Gourmet Restaurants...
2. Potato Skin- Chilly Lamb [3/5] 
3. Shrimp tossed with Dark Chocolate with Parsely lemon sauce [4/5]
4. Jamaican Jerk Chicken with lemon saffron rice n veggies [3/5]-
            As we r not very fond of rice we asked for bread or pasta (if they have) so the person in charge suggested they can serve boiled potato n veggies with it instead. I was quite surprised when they served half of the Potato r stale.. We some how managed to finish the chicken( chewy and blunt not properly marinated ) n veggies which was bit soggy...
To conclude our new year lunch was spoiled as food tasted pretty average but pinch in pocket was big Rs 1800+.. Very Disappointing...

This is what my friend suggested, "Don’t go for the food–no, you definitely don’t go for the food–go for the vintage European decor,  for the cutesy souvenirs that you wish you could buy in a gift shop."

Tucked at a corner on Sarat Bose Road (it’s been there since ~ God knows when) the whole place, positively oozes charm and character.
The first thing that you experience upon walking in is a crew of restaurant staff smiling and greeting you. Then you turn your head and see a jewel-box of a room with miniature artpieces, old-fashioned furniture of the bygone era that definitely add an old-world charm to the overall setting. Unique surroundings and a welcome atmosphere makes Courtyard even more interesting, as are its food and drinks. The ambience is charming, and we had a great time chatting, eating and drinking in this beautiful and cosy setting. The antique atmosphere imbues a vibe just perfect for spending quality time with people you love to hang around with. 

We tried the chicken breast stuffed with bacon alongwith brocolli and it tasted flawless. Perfectly crisp, perfectly buttery and fragrant with garlic this was a lovely start to the meal.The grilled Jamaican jerk chicken which was served alongwith lemmon saffron rice and veggies and it tasted just perfect. I ended with green apple Mojito, although the chocolate caramel Smoothie did wonders (thats what C said).The staff was very attentive and the food arrived well-paced. I would say, the service was extremely good. 

All-in-all, Corner Courtyard is that rare bird of a restaurant: a veritable ancient era setup that also happens to serve wonderful food. This place is definitely a gem in its own right and a great place for the special occasions. Make this a compulsory if you are venturing into Sarat Bose Road with food on your mind. Definitely, you won't be dissapointed.

If you haven't been to Italy yet, visit Corner Courtyard.
Such a lovely place. I did not know that Sarat Bose Road has such a beauty on it.

If you have heard about their Mushroom Soup, you have heard it so damn right! It is amazing. The restaurant will give you a flavor of Italy and France street side cafe, here in Calcutta.

The decor: I just love it.
The sitting arrangement, the furniture and the lights - they are just perfect.

If you girl is a reader, loves English, Europe and Calcutta - do take her to this place. Sit over a cup of mushroom soup and read her a poetry. I bet nothing else can make her feel more special.

Decor: Amazing.
Food: Very nice.
Music: The way it should be
Staffs: Friendly.
Menu: They have a moderate collection. But whatever they have tastes good. 

Also try out their selection of pizzas. You will love it.
Good place for a first date: TAKE HER THERE, for sure!

Second Visit: Definitely.

We were here on new year's eve, apparently lucky to get a table. I am ever wary of salads, but the poached pear salad read as too exotic to resist. While interesting, I think I could have done with more pear. Otherwise, the feta, the nuts, they were all good. The chilled egg mayo and scallions on bread was interesting as well. A bit eggy for my palate but the scallions were beautifully caramelized. The rosti and more was a big hit in my books. Fried potato, creamy sauce, greens for an accent. The dish was done very well; most satisfying. My companion stuck to his standard opinion of good not great for the stuffed chicken breast. We had a look at the desserts on display but were met with a rare problem of too much :D We were stuffed and skipped it with misgivings. The place is quaint; that word sits right. The setting and menu reminded me a lot of Olive Bar back in Bangalore, which is a good thing :) This is one for the occasions.

The Corner Courtyard, Kolkata :
A very Corner, Archaic, Heritage if not Quaint, place. Very Gothic, takes one into the British era, the decor was correct and perfect to resurrect the Raj with its impeccable rendition with clusters of Brass knobs and mirrors. 

The menu was Fusion and the pricing a bit unbalanced, cutlery very curved bespoken of the courtyard! Food was Good whilst the Desert deserted in a corner outside the Menu! Now thats Quaint if not forgetful! 

All the while we just could not keep our eyes off every nook & corner! Tasteful!!! 

Commenced from the Appetisers with Potato skin stuffed with Bacon & Cheddar at Rs 285/- and Calamari fried in tangy gondhoraj lebu ( fragrant Lime) were both lovely and Good! Loved the presentation of the roasted potatoes skin! Bacon was clearly lost even though the flavour remained present! 

The Calamari was crisp and devoid of grease and crunchy lovely! 

Must admit the food was fusion with similar theme of any Fusion food from Kolkata! So what was new?

We sauntered to the next course being Soups and ordered one half portion of 
Chefs Rock crab with Corn Chilly Tangy soup at Rs. 220/- and another half of French Onion Soup at Rs 195/-

My chefs Rock crab was a new taste to my tastebuds and was visibly impressed but the French Onion soup and utter inferior copy of the real thing! 

Like excited kids we stepped around discovering the place and even stepped into the loo to prove a point and check out the place! Every thing about the place was surreal and sort of transforms you to another world. This place was extraordinary and what ever we tasted was Good! 

Confused in the Fusion of things we moved into the Main Course with me choosing The Chefs special Grilled Pomfret fillets stuffed with Mexican rice with crab crushed potatoes in horseradish cream sauce at Rs 650/- whilst my wife opted for 
The Corner Courtyard baked Chicken & spinach lasagna topped with grilled onions at Rs 460/-. 

My experience of the chefs special Grilled pomfret was a let down in Taste and the quantity of the fillet! My take on it - i said okay enough! Didn't i? 

However the Lasagna was delicious with wonderful flavours of the spinach, minced Chicken! Good turnout, here! 

Here we were in the heart of Kolkata and not a mention of Desert on the menu!! Rather Queer, ain't it? 

You need to step up to corner front to choose from amongst the display! The idea was a clear art of Desertification not dereliction! 

We chose Baked Cheese cake! This too was Good! 

Not  bad but Good! So what are we missing? Taste, definitely! 

When the decor surpassed all with it's predicable standard the taste comparatively a let down! 

Excellent place on Sarat Bose road!  

Menu was seemingly hurried Fusion as if it was necessary to join the Fusion Bandwagon?

When the decor is so eye catching it would need more than GOOD taste to carry that punch! 

A must visit in Kolkata!

Re-visited this restaurant after almost a year and realised what we had been missing. The food was - as always - delicious. We ordered a Baked Fish (Betki) and a Breast of Chicken. Both were outstanding. While the chicken was quite filling, I think the quantity of fish was a little disappointing...there could have been a little more of it!
But the best was yet to come - their Chocolate Trouffle is the best we have ever tried anywhere.
Just one word of advice to the management - service was a little too slow. Otherwise, the staff are very well trained and most courteous and attentive.
A great evening...

This was my first visit and the food was simply great - though the service was good and courteous - the order we gave was totally messed up. We had asked for Thai Chicken green Curry with a lots of mushrooms. We were served vegetarian thai green curry without any mushrooms. When this was pointed out - the waiter came with mushrooms and mixed it with the curry. There was no offer to change the curry for Chicken. We ordered Magarita pizza and it was fantastic. I thought of packing one for my daughter, and though it was only 2.30 p.m. in the afternoon, the pizza base was exhausted. I then chose to to pack up a pasta instead. I was asked Penne or spagetti. I opted for penne and was aghast to see spegetti when we opened the packet at home. 
Apart from the goof up of the orders the food was great, service very nice and courteous and the dessert followed by coffee was out of the world....Truly a great food experience.
The decor was great but it surely needs some sound absorbing walls and thick curtains. It was a bit too noisy for fine quiet dining....
I would definitely recommend this place - but will need to be on guard regarding the order !!!!!!

A friend was in town and we had decided to meet in a nice quite place which served good continental food. And we happened to discover this place. The best part of this place is how they have taken up a bungalow and made a very chic restaurant out of it. The interiors are lined with different stuff. Old polaroids. Old latches. In the windows, you could find coffee table books of Calcutta. An awesome ambience  was created. The music too was very nice and the place was not very crowded either. I guess many people have not discovered this gem yet. In fact, they have a seating space in the 1st floor too. Amazing right! 

Now comes the main part. The menu was loaded with different cuisines. Some of them were new to me which I had not tried before. We ordered the following spread:
1. Figs Salad
2. French Onion Soup
3. Spicy Lamb Sliders
4. Michael Angelo Chicken Pizza
5. Jamaican Jerk Chicken with rice and veggies
6. Mint Mojito
7. Cheese Cake

All the dishes were good and served fresh but I guess a little late. The portions were filling and three of us were quite full after the meal. The Jamaican Jerk Chicken was good in taste with soft chicken breasts. The staff was good and were always asking whether or not we required anything. In fact, a perfect Friday evening like the ones in Mumbai.

Would highly recommend if you want to come for a bite with friends and a long chat. The interiors as I had said before are inspiring and the food presentation is unique.

Corner Courtyard! I've been meaning to go this place for so long! I finally went here and loved every bit of it. 

Ambiance (4.5/5) : out of the Victorian era. Calcutta charm, cute, warm, comfy. This place is the cafe you need to go to. Located just before the hazra crossing, in a corner, this place is a treat to the eyes! 

Service (3/5) : While the staff was nice and polite and very courteous, service was very slow. 

Food (4/5) : I took a Latte flavoured with Tiramisu (it came in a cute little pot!) - it was really nice! Next we took cheese fondue flavoured with sundried tomato and jalapenos, accompanied with potato wedges and bread sticks. I have to say this, this was fabulous! Good fondue after so long! The bread was really nice and the cheese was mind blowing! I took a veggie delight pizza. It had spinach, roasted bell pepper, jalapeños, cheese and mushroom. I don't have mushroom so I got that replaced with babycorn. The spinach topping was really less, but all in all the pizza was baked well and tasted okay. Not the best Ive had, but good. We took a cream cheese pasta in penne. It seemed to have similar flavours as compared to the fondue. But my friend didn't mind. All in all, good Italian food at the corner! 

Vfm (3.5/5) : Good place, lovely ambiance, not so easy on the pocket, but good food and the lovely backdrop on your photos make up for it! :D

This is a must visit place if you love continental food!!
The interiors give you the feeling that you have traveled back in time...It could be called a romantic fine dining restaurant

Coming to food,we ordered Buttermilk Parmesan Chicken for starters,which had a slightly sour taste due to the buttermilk.Nevertheless,it tasted good as the chicken was quite tender and went well with the dressing.

It was accompanied by a Mojito which tasted average.

For mains,we had Mediterranean stuffed chicken with pimento spinach and the relish.The chicken had a distinct smoky flavor stuffed with parmesan. For accompaniments,the home-made relish and spinach made a very interesting combination since they both were at different temperatures(The relish being cold compared to the spinach).Overall,a good dish to try out.

Next we had ordered Greek lamb mousaka but the waiter forgot to take our order!!!Just imagine!!!We kept on waiting till we asked about the lamb...to which he said that he hadn't taken the order for the lamb and had just taken the order for the stuffed chicken!!!This was a complete mood spoiler since we wasted like 30 minutes waiting for the lamb.The waiter gave us two complimentary mocktails to make up for his mistake and took our next order which is the Grilled chicken with wild mushrooms.

The chicken tasted fine but what turned off our mood was the callousness of the waiter who took our order!!!

Great food and good place to visit but my points were deducted mainly because of the service...

This was my second visit....as my first experience was good!! The ambience talks a lot....vintage..antiques...dim lights adding to the atmosphere is good... The entire interior is just fab!! Kudos to you people on dat....! We ordered a chicken aglio-olio,expresso,caffe latte,pink grape lemonade... Drinks was good...loved the lemonade! Pasta in dat case tastes good but quantity was very low in comparison what we paid. Now,the waiter serving us,also served us a misunderstanding..he wasn't clear in his explanations for which we ordered a salmon grill fish which really burnt a hole in our pockets! Yes..,your rates are pretty expensive as well!! Nevertheless service was good!! Food tastes fine..drooling ambience..and expensiveness of food is what i can sum up!! Yet...i loved the place all because i loved the ambience!! The people working are good...they even let us click photos in probably every corner of the cafe!!! 😉😊 
P.S the wall of mirror is my favourite! 😍

Jao pakhi bolo haowa chholo chholo
... Abchhaya janlar kaanch 

Ami ki amake hariyechhi baanke
... Roopkotha anach-kanach

(Go fly bird, sing Breezes blowin'... Misty the window's glass, 

Have I lost me Or could it be... A fairy tale at last?)

Its exactly this feeling that this place evokes in you when you sit here, appreciating the romance of its sky lit courtyard. The walls are adorned passionately with tastefully done miniature art installations and while you could spend hours looking at every piece with words of 'Love' 'Summer' 'Lonely' 'Heartbeat' you long to return to that first lunch date, its excitement and the awkwardness. 

The menu translates similar thoughts, its passionate, evocative and awkward in parts. If you are out of city traveler, do come on a honeymoon with your lover and stay in one of the heritage rooms upstairs or else have a romantic date here in its quietness that would give you hours to bond :)

Since I was staying here during my stay in Kolkata, I went from its breakfast to lunch and a romantic dinner with myself. 

Their breakfast if you are staying here, is simple eggs and toast with butter and marmalade jellies but, its their organic eggs with their perfect bright yellow yolks that best describe their talented chefs. 

The other dishes I tried can easily be classified into themes from Awkward to comfortable; Exciting to Orgasmic. They were;

Awkward: Grilled Shrimps tossed in mild dark Chocolate infused parsley lemon sauce; Chocolate and seafood, two different personalities trying to marry each other, a little strange, awkward yet with a hint of excitement and anticipation

Comfortable: Seafood Spaghetti in Aglio Olio sauce; a perfect comfort food, loads of garlic in butter and really fresh seafood, every bite makes you comfortable and happy

Exciting: Potato skins stuffed with chilly lamb and Handmade Pizza Rustica Picante (pepperoni, spicy sausage and jalapeno) Both the dishes carry that super excitement and complete turnons; chilly lamb potato skins with sprinkled paprika and the pizza with loads of that sausage and pepperoni. Every bite pushes over the edge into a world of excitement where you anticipate the ending to be completely orgasmic.

In the end comes that Orgasm: In Chef's special 'Peruvian styled Grilled Bhetki with cajun spiced crabmeat, tomato caper butter' Amazingly well prepared flaky fish with that crabmeat topping; with every bite my soul was floating towards the skylight bit by bit, yet returning back to have another bite :)

I don't know whether I can redo these experiences again, as i fear I might lose the excitement of my first date with this place :) A must experience for anyone travelling to kolkata and definitely for the struggling one sided lovers cuz the food at this place for sure is an aphrodisiac :)

Just to make it clear the reviews is on the basis of the stay experience at these hotel..!! I am a resident of Mumbai visited Kolkata for work for 3 night. While searching for hotel while planning my trip I came across these places which is so called Boutique hotel. I thought it will be great experience to visit these place and I paid a good amount of money at which I was getting a better hotels. I checked in at 12:30 am as I had a late evening flight from Delhi. At the time of checking there only one guy at the whole hotel and it was his first day.. I got my room at 2:30 as the rooms were not clean no water no manager no food, nothing was in place it was too annoying that was time when me and my colleague decided to checkout both the room next day morning and go to some other better hotel then we thought we'll discuss it next morning and at morning after looking at the kind of breakfast we were sure that we need to change the hotel so we asked for manager at 10:30 but manager was not there in the hotel then we had to wait till 11:30. Then when we told her the whole experience and we want to check out then the was she said sorry and the way  she was begging that don't check out you are the only Coustomer we have at these moment if u go I will be in danger and bla bla..!! Then we thought let be we continue with the same hotel and the same pathetic service. Plus at the settlement we had to pay the payment twice as the manager had no clue about the advance we had paid to them. Please never visit these place for stay but on the contrary the food here is toooo good it is amazingly yum..!!!

Zomato says this place is known for interiors and food presentation and U cannot even slightly disagree with the point. A very well decorated place , which gives you a very classy feel. A soothing jazz music was being played during our last visit here . And that complimented the ambience so well.
Service was extraordinary, the staff responds to every request of yours and take utmost care of your comfort.
We ordered potato skins stuffed with tequila flavored chicken mince for appetizer and chicken breast stuffed with bacon for main course. The chicken breast stuffed with bacon is a sure try , it was awesomely decorated and taste was as good as it could be.
This restaurant will be a page in my Kolkata visit. Great time being here.

Memories revisited as we visited this place. This restaurant is set up at my ancestral home and so it was pretty nostalgic going there for the first time. Simply loved how they have recreated the place without gutting the entire structure down and losing its heritage. Loved the ambience and the retro decor. Thank You The Corner Courtyard for making my former home so beautiful.
Coming to the food it was pretty good, maybe a little costly but you have that in almost all posh restaurants nowadays. We had ordered Buttermilk & garlic marinated baked parmesan chicken, mexican grilled fish, crispy calamari, michael angelo chicken delight pizza, pink grape fruit lemonade and normal cappuccino and weren't disappointed with any of it. Special mention to the chicken and pizza. Loved them.
Lastly would like to say was very very pleased with the staff there.
This visit surely made diwali even more special for me and my entire family.

I have been eyeing this outlet quite for sometime. Today I had to undergo a medical treatment nearby and after that I went there.
The decore is exquisite. The lamps, the decorative articles, the chandeliers - all of them display the unmatchable taste of the proprietor.
I was made to sit at a corner table and the menu card was handed over. After discussing with the Maitre de Table, I decided on green apple mojito, a healthy salad with pomegranate and apple and sea slay roasted dried figs and crunchy salad leaves and Gouda cheese and grilled roasted prawn tossed with lime, balsamic leaves, pomegranate etc.
After about five minutes mojito arrived. It immediately freshened me up. After asking my permission, the salad came forth. There was no appropriate fork to eat it, unlike in many other restaurants. I ate it with ordinary fork but with difficulty. But I must say one thing - the salad had just the right amount of crunch and oil and spice that I love and I relished it.
Again after taking my permission, grilled prawn arrived. There were five prawns each placed around the rim of the plate and in the middle were balsamic leaves etc. I squeezed the lemon on the prawns and tasted one of them. It was juicy and very tasty. The prawns are properly de-veined and shelled.
After I had these wonderful items, the Maitre de Table asked if I wanted to taste dessert? Now this is something that I cannot resist, having sweet tooth. I looked at the display counter. Very few pastries were on display. I chose chocolate caramel mousse. It came in no time in a glass tea cup. Well, it is good and sinful but too sweet for my choice.
The price is very steep , after having a look at the menu card you may feel confused as to whether you have come to a five star hotel by mistake.
The staff are good and attentive. I especially like the way they asked me each times before serving.
Overall good experience.

This place was on my list for a long time.
And I finally managed to come here.
It's really beautifully done. The interior is done very aesthetically.  3 of us visisted the place.
Coming to the food. We ordered 2 peach mojitos and 1 pink grapefruit lemonade. I felt the mojitos tasted like the virgin ones only. Didn't get any peach flavour. But it was good. We took a apple, dry figs, walnut, salad with roasted chicken. I was apprehensive about this because it had fruits mixed with chicken and leafy vegetables and apple cider vinegar. But it was actually good. I didn't like the figs as they felt a bit bitter so I passed them along to my sister's plate but apart from that it was good. The walnut, apple provided the right crunch along with the pomegranate which gave the hint of sweetness and then there was the perfectly cooked roasted chicken. 
In the appetisers we ordered buttermilk and garlic parmesan baked chicken. It was served with a mayonnaise based sauce. It was a bit hard to cut the chicken pieces but the meat was soft. Then I got it because of the covering it was hard to cut. In the main course we took south African peri peri prawns served with garlic rice. 5 jumbo prawns are served along with a bit of rice. The rice was really really yummy. The prawns were ok. And it came with a curry/sauce which I didn't like.
We had  ordered garlic bread as the rice quantity was less. It had 5 bread slices.
another main course we took was the jamaican jerk chicken. This dish had a tangy taste to it. It also came with a portion of rice. 2 breast pieces of chicken and one leg piece was served. I didn't see any desserts in the menu, maybe they were in front were the coffees were made. So not sure of that. Another thing I must point out is that they don't give any after refreshments. As in saunf or sugar coated saunf.
we missed that part.
The prices are on the higher side.
Our bill came to 2946. This was including service tax, service charge and vat

After roaming around across south kolkata on a hot n humid ashtami day where all the restaurants had huge queue...we decided to try our luck with this restaurant and as luck favoured us we found ourselves a table there.

I have been to this restaurant before...it has a very classy decor..done up in white...gives an European feel...so I will come directly to the food!!

We ordered grilled fish n corn cake, chicken skewers as starters...along with virgin mojito,raspberry iced tea and I opted for a pink fruit lemonade and the drinks tasted really good...the fish cakes were mildly spiced and melted in the mouth...the chicken skewers had a spicy rub on and were very tender..all thanks to the servers for their recommendations!!

For mains we ordered a thin crust pizza with pepperoni,cheese,olives (I'm sorry I don't remember the name) and it was yummy...this was followed by penne in chilly tomato sauce with chicken,it was served with 2 pieces of garlic bread and I loved it...we ended the meal with stuffed chicken breasts with molten cheese which was served with mash-stir fried veggies and a tangy dip...the combination of the chicken and cheese was to die for.

We were too stuffed for dessert as the portions were good enough to fill the 4 of us...but I would surely like to visit this place again to try their desserts

Wonderful lil place to look at , very interestingly done and esp the theme rooms they have upstairs is worth a visit 
Best bite : cream cheese cupcakes
Rest of the food can surely be improved in taste of not appearance 
Worth a shot
Just discovered: on my third visit, I discovered that they even have a roof top bar, which is a great place for a small gathering in a good weather !  
 
Best product: I loved their sangria with watermelon balls in it , very refreshing ! 
PS: this review includes pics of their theme rooms. Although we couldn't see the two rooms they have on the terrace too

We visited the Corner Courtyard on the 26th. of Sept. for lunch. The menu in general is overpriced. Even if one is paying for the ambience there has to some justification especially when you are at a stand alone eatery. This is not a five start hotel dining room where pricing would start at Rs.400/- plus and a rack of lamb would be Rs. 1200/- plus. 
Amazingly the pricing at the Corner Courtyard is actually that high. We tried the Peri peri prawns which were served (4 to 5 pieces of prawn) with a portion of buttered rice and some potatoes. The prawns where rubbery and hard dashing the expectations of being soft and melt in the mouth. 
My wife tried the pomfret which was smelly. Trust me, a Bengali knows fresh fish from smelly, fibrous fish and  when we drew the attention of the person serving us, he said that he would have a word with the Chef and get back to us but he simply vanished. Very unbecoming of any professionally run establishment.  The thin crust pizza was nice but the cheese topping was miserly and ONE basil leaf poised in the centre of the pizza looked funny !
The plating is nice and the portions adequate for modest eaters like the members of our family but when one foots a bill of Rs.3000/- for 3 people at Kolkata with just 3 main dishes and one pizza one expects quality food, served well and with more attention and courteousness. NEVER AGAIN, I would think, although the place is right round the corner for us.

The decor of this place is the show stopper. The food is good but definitely over- priced. The pizzas are thin and crisp and the pastas are satisfactory. Ask the staff for a tour around the place and you'll discover the lovely rooms. The bengali badi converted into a boutique hotel has its own charm which definitely works on each and every person who walks through the doors.

That is just for the interiors. The staffs are not really courteous. They did not let us chose ourself a table, when the place was half empty. And the service is real slow. They don't have a decent variety of options in deserts either. Zomato says it is known for its interiors and food presentation, yeah and that is pretty much all. The food is not that great as to what they charge. Want an eye candy? Then this is your place.

The food was okay but there was hardly much of it. Quite a bit over priced actually.  But what really got to me ? The service. So.slow. I mean was it supposed to be like that  ? Like I'm supposed to pretend I've walked into a period drama piece and the pace is going to make me want to walk into the kitchen and cook me some fries? Also why aren't there any fries on the menu ? Maybe this place is too fancy for me. Or something.

This is a very beautiful continental restaurant. I've been here quite a number of times. It's a renovated typical Bengali style house (aka Badi). It's not just a restaurant it's also a boutique hotel. I've never lived there but you can ask for a tour and in case a room is empty they'll happily show you around.

The ambience is artistic. It's different than what most restaurants have to offer and at the same time they've managed for it to be brilliant. I like it.

The food is absolutely amazing. Note they serve food in the continental style as in a plate  per person as against a portion style that we're used to. However, they've not objected if you share it. Their quantities are fairly large and filing. Now the food is delicious because my father who is very very very very picky about food had a clean plate and the end of the meal. My mother loved the minestrone soup, she'll have it every time she's here. I love the food as well.

Ok, having said all that try and avoid pizzas, let be honest if I want to have a pizza I'm probably go to the experts. So go ahead and try anything else from the menu everything is brilliant. I've not tried all but from what ever I've tried it's safe to say it'll all be good. ;)

The one thing I'm looking forward to is that they manage to get liquor license as well. As of now they do not serve liquor ( that's what I know as of now).

Their desserts counter is handled by Rouge. Which is brilliant again.

P.s. they have valet parking.

Happy eating. Enjoy the experience.

The first thing that swayed me off my foot was the interiors , it's a house of those ester years which hosted a joint family when luxury meant owning a telephone or a gramophone , now remodelled into a fantastic concept dining with lodging facility. The interiors are done in a neo classical style wherein you get a feel of an European do with the shades of blue and white accentuating the details .The  small artefacts comprising books on city of joy , some antiques and the various bolts and locks as wall hangings makes it interesting.
Now the food , well it's ought to be an aficionado's delight . The food has a subtle mix of flavours and each of it can be felt distinctly . The baked fish which I tried can be worked upon as it seemed slightly blanched and some more parsley , oregano could be added . The hummus is one of the best . I heard that you can buy a mix of herbal tea as they have some of the good and the authentic variety .
Oh yes the prices are slightly steep but that's ok with the experience you get steeping in . 
Overall it's worth an experience of you are on of those who likes to bask in the classic with a neo touch !!!

Been planning to go to this place from ages especially after all the amazing reviews. Maybe that's y i had very high expectations. Beautiful ambience and pleasant atmosphere further enhanced that. But when it came to the food it was kind of underwhelming. For starters we tried the mushroom. Which was nice. But the white sauce was a bit too rich for my liking. Main course we tried half and half pizza. Michelangelo chicken. And Margherita. Again. Nice taste. But I've had much better thin crust pizza in kolkata in other places for the same price. The bhetki main course was again good. But nothing extraordinary.

Convenient location, elegant decor, and excellent food. I tried the mussels and shrimp dish which I'd strongly recommend to everyone. Same with the crabmeat soup. Service was good and the dishes arrived fairly quickly. The waiter serving us could improve his communication skills though. The only downside is the ambient music which is outright stupid and totally mismatched with the classic Calcutta charm the decor otherwise wishes to recreate.

Oh my god!!! This is on my most favourite list.
I am in love with this place. Perfect british theme settings, perfect interiors, soothing and it does make your heart wonder.
Food we ordered:-
1.  Romanian bacon wraped prawn with thousand island dressing and seasonal salad- i loved the presentation of this dish.the prawns were oh so yummy teamed up with season salad in the middle.
2. Michael angelo chicken delight pizza- it was thin crust with perfect blend of spices.just the way i like it.
3. Peprica and lemon grilled chicken- grilled chicken was soft and juicy teamed up with mashed potatoes,brocolli.
4. Lemon ice tea- one word refreshing .

Yes i admit its a costly affair. But man the food and the service and the environment makes up to it.

An absolute pleasure of a place. You cannot help but notice the decor as soon as you enter the place. It is not just a clumsy attempt to fit into trends in interiors like most new restaurants/cafes. It actually works. There's creativity, innovation and thought. It does look like a place that belongs to someone rather than a place left at he mercy of enthusiastic decorators. And the chairs are comfortable, not just beautiful. I doubt many places think about how important it is to have ergonomic furniture in a restaurant. I like that the tables are simple and clutter free to offset the amount of activity that goes on on the walls. I am a fan of their small salt and pepper shakers which do not have to be constantly moved on the table to clear the view or space. 

Coming to the food. This is absolutely the best food of modern global fusion style I have ever eaten. There is thought and effort in each dish. It is clearly a chef's menu and not a businessman's. I first visited this place about a year and a half ago, when they had a spring menu. I ordered a pie (I don't remember specifics) and loved it. When I went there again after many months for the pie, the menu had changed and I was a little disappointed. Totally unnecessary. I ordered cottage cheese balls spaghetti and can I tell you you the classic meatballs and spaghetti could not get a better vegetarian counterpart. The enchilada was tasty. The mocktails are have fresh and real flavours, not laden with sugar syrup and synthetic essence. I went there again after a week and ordered garden veg tortellini which didn't let the spaghetti down at all. I am surprised I waited until my fourth visit to write this review, but it only gives me more confidence to say that you can try just about any dish and it should be delicious in the least. This time I tried a pizza and cottage cheese steak. Pizza was good, but the steak... Can you imagine combining a european concept with indian protein and japanese flavours? They sure can and how beautifully. Panko crust steak, paprika mash, perfectly creamy and smooth, arugula and apple salad dressed in miso and sesame, wow. Outside my home, for the first time in my life I had fresh crumbly, just set enough paneer, instead of dense weird cubes that were probably placed under a hundred kilos for two days. The cheesecake was a cheesecake; not a wobbly rubbery thing sitting on a frozen and tough base. Light, fluffy, and the spoon didn't hit the plate to clink everytime I took a piece. 

Why have not rated the place 5 when I love it so much? The service is a bit of a let down. The servers are all right but can get a little noisy and sometimes hard to find. I could say the prices are a bit steep but hey, the food is miles ahead in quality and taste than so many other places similarly priced who serve teeny tiny portions that wouldn't fill up a 4 year old.

I still have to give their non vegetarian food a go but even then this is my favourite food destination in Kolkata.

One place, you will not forget in a long time after a visit. The ambience is simply mind blowing. This place looks like a well maintained heritage building from the outside...quite a classy look. The inside is equally classy...the decor is excellent. The music that was playing was equally good.
Coming to the service....quite good...although a little more promptness would help further. The food is awesome. We had Zingy Thai fish and Grilled Italian Chicken bites as starters. Also on the order was a Michaelangelo Chicken delight pizza. As main course we ordered Roasted pimento and mozzarella stuffed Mediterranean chicken and Grilled bhetki fish fillet with cashew, lemon and chilly. The food is beyond words....both presentation and taste are excellent.
The price is a tad bit high but that too has been rightly predicted on Zomato. 
Overall a very good experience and one that will be a reminder to come back to this place another time.
Another positive is that they have valet parking.....a very good option to have.
This place is a must visit for all foodies and I would certainly suggest it to all.

It's no doubt an expensive place...what I realized after taking chicken steak and pasta was, its not worth paying so much for this kinda food.I mean it tastes okayish,not very good ,not very bad.But ambience ,staff behavior ,cleanliness ,and dish presentation is really good.

This 'courtyard' in one corner of Sarat Bose road is one delightful place :)

The ambience is very wonderland-ish and it gives one a feeling of being inside a story book of that deals with great food :D the waiters are extremely patient and well mannered :)

The food is beyond reproach. Owing to the fact that this review is coming almost 4 months after I visited the place, the names of the dishes have been buried somewhere I can't access :/
They have a mushroom truffle like dish that is exquisite. 
The steaks here have a generous quantity.

And as far as the quality is concerned, the food speaks for itself.

The only, if at all, downside is the price of dishes.

Corner Courtyard....great ambience with an old calcutta charm...it has an unique warmth n homely feel to it....we ordered..orange n ginger based mocktail (Cucumber Berry Soda).....which could be made better....followed by thin crust pesto based pizza ( Basilico Pesto Treats) n lemon thyme artichoke mascarpone risotto (Mascarpone cheese, artichoke and lemon thyme herbed Risotto with pan grilled zucchini steaks)..both the pizza n the risotto where out of the world...the pizza being pesto based tastes pleasantly different n delightful....the risotto was creamy..cheesy...n dat bit of acidic taste from the lemon to cut thru all the creaminess...will definitely be coming back here for more...

There are few, I mean barely barely few places in town that can whip up a fare as phenomenal as Country Courtyard! If you're an adventurous hedonist and it's one of those days where you need to reward yourself, you know where to go! Yes Sir, Yes Ma'm! The Country Courtyard, of course!  Do be informed that it's on the pricey side, but only fair for the portion sizes, dining experience, & overall food quality. If you're super hungry and think that you can eat a village, go ahead and order the Panko Crusted Parmesan Chicken! Why this one in particular, you say?! Because...it's a perfect mix of crunchy crust, buttery soft meat, and a delectable sauce! Also, try the New York styled chicken wings, Grilled Norwegian Salmon, and smoked chicken and apple salad! You're done now? Good! Now, do remember to soak up the ambience. The decorative mirrors, the ornate hardware, the sturdy cutlery, the friendly staff ...each element is worthy of several brownie points! And more importantly, exotic food tastes exponentially better when you have your dear ones to share it with!

I had one of the best experiance in this place tonight. The contemporary ambience and the decoration is realy very nice and i am preety sure i will go back to this place some time soon.
I ordered the bacon wraped prawn for the starter which was realy good, infact i wanted more but couldn't have it because the michael angelo pizza was large with only two mouths to feed. I also ordered the peparica with lemn roast baby chicken which was awsom in taste and in considerable quantity, The lemon ice tea was also good and very re-freshing.
Over all i had a lovely time, the service was a bit slow but the food made up to it and also the friendly servers.

After hearing so much about this place unfortunately it did let me down. The decor is fantastic, kudos to that. I ordered pesto pizza which hardly had any pesto and was overpowered by bell peppers giving it a very indian taste. It was way overcooked and burnt which gave me boils in my mouth. The button mushrooms were okay, mind wasn't blown. And dessert menu is mostly just coffee and chocolate. Waw expecting pannacotta. Tirumisu which I ordered, the cream waw so heavy felt like it was from monginis. Would prefer smoke house deli or yatuacha any given day.

So the interiors are really nice. I like how they've used ladders and old books to deck the place up.

The service was good but a tad bit slow. They have a valet service as well for those who're driving there.

The food was good. The pizzas were thin crust and nicely made. Though for the price they charge, I've had better.  The lasagna was really really good. Perfect portion as well. I also tried the chicken nachos as an appetizer and it wasn't up to the mark. Too messy. The bacon wrapped prawns were a winner! Also, the peach mojito. Absolute beauty!

Dinner for 2: 1800-2000 INR

The corner courtyard has been on my to-do list since it opened and I finally got the chance go to there during my lat visit to the city. It is n ode to the lost colonial grandeur that was once synonymous with Calcutta. The historic Villa fills you with a sense of culture and intrigue. Modern history that seamlessly blends calcuttan ways with the influence of the British into a unique culture of its own. The ambience is beautifully balanced between rustic and colonial charms. We ordered for grilled prawns, they were tasty but poor in quantity and not particularly memorable. Next came the calamari which was better in quantity and flavour than the prawns. We finished it off with a cheesecake with fig compote which held my attention for the longest time and chocolate mousse which was good as well.

The Corner Courtyard; A place where I always always wanted to come and experience it's dishes. The moment I entered here, I was in completely at the awe of it. The place is beautiful. The walls, the interior is so unique and intimidating that one just need a book, a couch and a glass of red wine to relax. Honestly I just love this place as it really reflects the part of me...!!! 
But the main motive to come here was Food... So ordered for double cheese chicken pasta and a full pepper baby chicken roast. And one espresso coffee till the time my main course arrives...
I must tell my readers and foodie friends, do not dare to have anything here. It's one of the bad tasted food I ever had in my life. Double cheese pasta tasted plain while the chicken was smelly and undercooked. Coffee was not a coffee but a 'Kaadha' (bitter tasted medicine). 
One step up @Park street and this place is a neck to neck competitor in serving the wackiest food.  
Mobi-Ul, our attendant was extremely polite and kind to understand the taste of our food served. He was courteous, nice and attentive. 
The place is beautiful, staffs are cordial bit the primary reason for any restaurant to run is their food, and this place is not worth a penny for food. 
I would like to suggest The Corner Courtyard to change or revitalise their chef in order to get the dishes cooked properly. 
I would love to come to this place if the food is good. 

Thank you

Turkish grilled chicken with pomegranate tabbouleh salad, hummus and pita biscuits, followed by a strong shot of Machiato, the ordeal sealed with a fresh watermelon juice. What a ride for the crazy taste buds! 
The chicken pieces were extremely sumptuous however, I felt they should've have been cooked more tenderly; chicken seemed undercooked and stiff. But the flavours of the gravy with rosemary and the salad made up quite well for the lack in chicken tenderness. 
The decor is cozy, slumber-inducing, stuffed with a variety of books that you can read through if you've got the time to spare. I picked up a particular book on old Calcutta photos, all in B&W and perhaps I'll go back to Corner Courtyard just to read that book again!

Perfect for birthday dinners or romantic celebrations, The Corner Courtyard is one of those places you really look forward to dining at. If you think you're rather well-acquainted with continental food, allow the unique, lip-smacking food at TCC to open your eyes.

It was again a rainy afternoon when five of us meet at The Corner Courtyard for some light snacks. Ever since the Zomato meet, bonding between us growing stronger day by day. I love being with them due to their simplicity and pure love towards food like me, no big words no lecture and showing off your knowledge about food, just simple ‘adda’ between fellow foodies.

We asked Koninika to decide today’s menu and she wisely selected ‘Cucumber Berry Soda’, ‘Green Apple Mojito’, ‘Pink Grape fruit Lemonade’, ‘Peach Mojito’ and ‘Red Berry Smoothie’ in mocktails and a large ‘Pizza Margherita’ for all of us.

Cucumber Berry Soda was delicious with a light, fruity aftertaste. Green Apple Mojito was an apple twist on the classic Mojito, along with a mint flavour from fresh leaves gives a refreshing great taste. Delicious and healthy Pink Grapefruit Lemonade was classic summertime beverage. The aroma of the fruits will leave you feeling refreshed and uplifted.

Peach Mojito was made with a fragrant combination of and refreshing mint. It was a cooler that was certain to stir up lots of summer fun. Use the back of a spoon to muddle the mint for more exciting taste. Red Berry Smoothie was a glass of fruity goodness. It was a perfect smoothie to enjoy with friends or loved ones.

Pizza Margherita served piping hot topped with Tomato, Mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan Cheese) and extra virgin olive oil with extra Cheese, Paneer chunks and Mushrooms. In view of Shahbaaz we ruined it little by wasting time in clicking pictures but still good enough. It doesn't get any better than this - combine a tender and crispy crust with gooey, flavourful cheeses and mushrooms fresh from the garden, a fabulous way to enjoy juicy tomatoes. Pizza Margherita was a wonderful monsoon treat and ideal to end our meal.

Go for the Pizza Margherita, but take your photo fast — the pizza freezes really quickly!

Located at the Sarat Bose Road exactly opposite to the CCD. A small by lane and you are in front of the Corner courtyard. The first feel that you get about this place, is an old Kolkata feel which is nice and as soon as you enter the restaurant, you  see some beautifully decorated place along with very lively colors. The ambiance is just brilliant.

First we wanted to have the soup and ordered Winter chicken and Rock crab soup. Loved the two soups tastes perfect.

On the starters we ordered, Cheese garlic bread, Grilled Garlic prawns, Grilled chicken satay and Greek chicken souvlaki. I did not like the prawn it did not live up to the mark. The chicken satay and Souvlaki were really nice in terms of the presentation and taste.

From the main course we ordered Turkish grilled chicken, Cilantro chicken and baked bhetki. All of them where nice specially the Cilantro chicken was awesome.

Real letdown of an experience. Ordered basic stuff from the menu, only to be told by the waiter that the pepperoni is not fresh????? Since when is pepperoni supposed to be fresh? Even if it is why do your dirty laundry in front of me, when I challenged the waiter and asked him to bring me the pepperoni that he claims is not fresh, he went to the kitchen and came back out to tell me that they don't have pepperoni.

Ordered the margarita pizza instead with aragula, the aragula didn't show up, and the pizza showed up after the other 3 diners on the table had finished.
I ordered the panko crumbed chicken escalope, anywhere in the world that's a deep fried battered chicken breast...not here, it's a dry breast of chicken sprinkled with some kind of batter.

Very disappointing

Okay. So I absolutely loved the food at this place but today I visited the place after a while and ordered an Uruguayan fried calamari, after a long wait I received a plate of something that looked far from what I had asked for. Fried calamari isn't usually doused in risotto. So my friend and I went ahead and had it and after the first three spoonfuls we realise that they had given us the wrong dish. They had confused the appetiser for the main course. So when we called for the waiter he said he would go and speak to the manager, when he came back, he did not replace the dish, in turn asked us why we had tried it in the first place and asked us to just deal with it (in the least polite way possible). So we paid twice the price and when we asked to speak to the manager he was not available for the complaint and the waiter was constantly grinning away. Anyway, a place despite  the classy exterior showed us that it has no respect for its customers and feels no need to follow the protocol of replacement by which  almost all of the other restaurants in the city follow. Huge disappointment.

========================================

The Corner Courtyard - Simply stupendous! From the moment we entered TCC, we were into a themed world. It is beautiful, beguiling with stunning artistic paintings and books and other things put up here and there on each and every walls. First I was confused whether it was a house or a restaurant but later I was overwhelmed to know how they turned this old house into a restaurant so tastefully. Awesome attention to detail. First and foremost we got there early. The ambience was great but the waiters suggested us a place. We didn't like it and then chose ourself one in the middle section of the restaurant. From the ground floor the whole house upto the roof can be seen upwards. Its awesome. Although the lack of lights felt a bit dull. Don't know why the lights were still not on when we were sitting down there. The waiters were cooperative but somehow he wanted us to try one Tuna dish which we were not in a mood to try out. Frankly speaking the waiter seemed to be a bit offended for not trying out what he suggested. We were not in a mood to try out fish and my partner avoids eating fish outside for some reason. I really don't get the picture why he behaved like that. For the rest of the time whatever we ordered he was damn silent and didn't even mention about serving or something. It is on one hand one of the best restaurants in town currently and we don't expect behaviours like this. Anyways who cares, we are here for the food mainly!

Now food - First and foremost we ordered were the BRUSCHETTA AL POMODORO MOZZARELLA. Although it did take some time when it came it looked promising and it was superbly decorated. The Bruschetta is a vegetarian appetizer of bread topped with fresh & sundried tomato, basil and some balsamic dressing. It was yummy. Simply awesome and it just melts in your mouth with a slight tangy and salty flavour in it.
Next we went into non vegetarian mode and ordered the GRILLED ITALIAN CHICKEN SALAD BITES WIRH SALAD CAPRI AND PARSLEY GARLIC AIOLI. The mixture of tangy balsamic vinegar with the juicy tomatoes, salty soft mozzarella, garlic and olive oil is one of the favorite flavor combination we ever had. Italian food at its best! I have to say presentation is 10/10.
To enjoy more food we needed to cool ourselves down and for that reason we ordered GREEN APPLE SODA but it was not available. Fine enough, then we ordered PEACH MOJITO and it took a while when we really loved the sun-ripe peaches and crisp, refreshing mint mixed in the Peach Mojito.
Next our tummy was ready for some Pizza treat. We ordered thin crust MICHELANGELO PIZZA. It came quickly within 10-15 minutes(dont remember the time exactly). It was a damn delicious spread of Chicken, Mushroom, Spinach leaves, Sundried tomatoes. It was too damn good. The pizza slices had all the required flavors in it with the crispy and crunchy textures in its place. A good day turns only better with a good Pizza experience. This made us quite happy and full and more over brought a wide grin on our face.
Lastly time for some dessert. We were in for some chocolate treat. We ordered CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT MOOZE that came in a cup with some hazelnut on it. It looked delicious and it was simply orgasmic. Pure chocolate heaven. One scoop of it takes you to the chocolate nirvana. It made us even happier.
After this fine dining experience at the TCC, my impression about the cuisines at this place further went above and filled up the gap, where I personally think it lacked that service I was expecting with that kind of behaviour from the waiter. Well enough said. Beautiful place, Excellent food and it is a bit pricey but then again the food is great too. Overall good experience at the Corner Courtyard.

This one place definitely needs a special mention.  A paradise for serious food lovers with a fine dining experience.  International manu, featuring mostly continental,  mexican and Italian,  chik decor, sophisticated ambience,  knowledgeable staff and personalised service are some of the key features which needs special mention.  You will surely miss an elaborate wine listing with the kind of menu they have. Plus the dishes are a bit over priced considering their portion sizes.
It was an Tuesday evening when me along with two other foodies decided to check this place out for dinner.  We got a table easily. They have a special hi tea menu which seems interesting but we decided to have an early dinner that day. I found their beverage menu quite interesting with every popular mock tails with a twist. Our group is a big fan of nachos grande and we always order it at Irish house or at chilli so we thought of not to experiment and order that for starter.  Super presentation with sliced chicken but portion size was disappointing.  For the main course we had a lamb and pasta preparation and a chicken stuffed with mushroom and cheese. Chicken was a bit hard and we shared our feedback with the service people present. We skipped the dessert as we were all full. 
Overall a good place...
Visit.  I am sure you will carry memories..

The Corner Courtyard is a welcome oasis. A quaint eatery that stands out for its toothsome, diverse dishes. The staff is warm, crisp, knowledgeable. The decor is eclectic, individualistic, not copybook. An inviting look and feel – without a predictable, cookie-cutter design formula.
Tucked away from thick traffic and bright lights, The Corner Courtyard has a good chance of becoming a destination restaurant. Three of us with very different palate preferences and all very pernickety about what we eat, lunched there on Sunday. We shared a salad and six very-different bacon, lamb and chicken dishes, yet we were unanimous about the place's food and mood.
We don't go back to the same restaurant in a hurry – if we have a choice. But, just 55 hours later, we find it good enough to think of going back there for dinner – now!
Most good things are short-lived. It will be a real pity if this charming place doesn't last long. At least till our dinner tonight:)

TCC had been on my wishlist for quite sometime now, and the dining experience there was something out of a dream. First of all, I will be brutally honest and say that the place is really expensive, but at the end of the meal, you will probably realise it has been worth it. The decor,very picturesque and colourful, with those old ornamented mirrors, the 3-d effect bookshelf and also golden locks,keys,hinges and doorknobs adorning the walls makes for a very striking first impression. We were very hungry and straightaway ordered greek chicken souvlaki and uruguayan styled crispy calamari. The souvlaki or chicken skewers were perfectly seasoned and melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The deep-fried calamari was amazingly crunchy and tasted great with the mayonnaise. Had it not been for our limited budget we would have ordered another plate. Now coming to the main course, the paprika and lemon grilled chicken with spring onion and buttered vegetables was pure perfection. We polished off the plate within seconds. Also, the linguine tossed with roast chicken, olives, bacon bits and mushrooms in creamy parmesan sauce was unusually delicious. TCC disappointed us when it came to desserts. Some of the items in the menu were not available, like for instance I wanted to try Tiramisu and toffee pudding but unfortunately they failed to provide them. So finally, we settled for philadelphia cheesecake and chocolate hazelnut mousse. Dont get me wrong..I am not complaining about the desserts, the ones we ordered were really amazing though the best cheesecake I have had till date was the one at Smokehouse Deli. Our total bill for three people came out to be 2875 rupees, as I expected from earlier reviews. The waiters are very polite and they really help you out in choosing your delicacies. A bit expensive but nevertheless a fine dining experience! Kudos to the team! :)

I think the food here is very good and the service is also fantastic. Even the decor is just right along with the appropriate name the corner courtyard. I like the fresh desserts here also. I don't think one can go wrong in taking guests from out of town here for a meal. They have liked the food and ambience so it works well for me.

Visited a month ago. This place is surely going to blow you unless you have already been there.
This place takes care of the two most important things i.e ambience and food.
The decor is amazing (keep your instagram ready). If that's enough for you to fall in love with the place then wait for the food.

To start with, we  took peach mojito and peach iced tea and salad (spring greens, watermelon, feta cheese with crispy bacon). The salad was delicious specially to hit off the summer lunch on a right note. Then came the appetizer (grilled garlic prawns in balsamic dressing with pomegranate salad), it was equally good. Prawns were juicy and soft. Now coming to the main course, we took grilled salmon with brazilian marinade with spaghetti agilo Olio. It was nothing but sheer awesomeness.

Thanx to my love for taking me out there. Simply loved the place. Highly recommended.

P.S - Just one disadvantage for a student like me is that it can make a decent hole in your pocket.

Went for Sunday lunch. The place was just average. The food was a little too creamy and oily for my liking. I requested for something to be made with under a teaspoon of oil. The dish probably had 3 tablespoons of oil. The sauce used in the pizzas is extra sweet. The leek and chicken soup and the turkish chicken were just ok. They lacked a high chair so we had to deal with my toddler running around. The lack of alcohol made it an even worse experience. Probably not go back here.

Situated on Sarat Bose Road which is well known for housing some of the best restaurants in the city, this quaint  restaurant is a welcome sight for the sore eyes. Itself being a recently restored colonial house, this Italian eatery has the look and feel of a pretty European cafe. As we enter, we see the pastry and dessert shop Rouge to the left. Special attention has been given to the decor to add to its charm, and we see everyday objects and relics of a bygone era adorning the shelves. We also see pretty paintings and artefacts. 
Now, for the food. From Appetizers, we ordered California Styled White Meat Crab Cakes, and Prawn Tempuras. The plating is nicely done and attratctive to the eyes. And the portions are just enough so that you don't feel very full. Both the items were delicious! Next, from Main Course, we ordered Malayasian Scampi Laksa with Rice, and Pink Salmon. The Laksa was good, but I didn't like the salmon preparation too much, maybe because of the spices that were used. Finally, we had some Homemade Blueberry Cheesecake for dessert.
Pricing is a bit on the heavy side, so it's not really an ideal hangout place for college friends or a couple who aren't working yet. But if you have money to spare, or you are with your family, it's a great experience and a dinner well spent. :)

It was a warm and lazy afternoon and we were wondering where to go. We tried looking around southern avenue first. With no promising outlet.in sight. We decided to try corner courtyard. The place has a serene ambience  perfect for a date or anniversary. Anyway we were two hungry guys so we got to business and had Thai chicken curry and rice, and a chicken burger with thai style patty. Its a nice place if you can decipher the menu...

A perfect place to spend a cosy afternoon...visited this place yesterday for lunch...the first thing that strikes you is the ambience and the decor..it brings out the rich heritage of calcutta during the british era.it s not so crowded and you can sit along and have a chat even after you finish your food.the food is also pretty decent though i felt it is slightly overpriced. We had ordered a baked salmon preparation for the main course.the sauce served with it was awsome though the fish tasted a little bland.the dessert was a chocolate cheese cake which was good.overall this is a place to spend some quality time and have a good food!!

Food = Awesome, Service = Remember Nestor from Tintin series.
Try the chicken wings, greek skewers.

Try the Seafood as recommended, but the Lamb and poultry dishes are way to good, try the thick chicken soup, it is just delicious.
Try the cheesecake in desserts.

As this is restored building which is part restaurant and part stay - Check out the rooms upstairs; even to look they are amazingly comforting.

The whole place is vibrant, colorful and filled with life :) the central courtyard of the place has natural light coming in and the naming of the restaurant is apt. Go Visit this place

It's an insane and overwhelming place, a feel at home;  very good interiors, quite, and the spell bound delicious food items. The Pink Salmon is a must try dish for non vegetarians. Loved the overall food quality, presentations, accompaniments. It was delicious after a long time got to try anew place with remarkable continental food. It should be tried and you would love it.

A welcome menu with Mediterranean cuisine. Definitely should be given a try. I have been there thrice and have tried various dishes, and all of them exceeded expectations. With a comprehensive menu on both veg and non veg, corner courtyard offers a delightful experience with a classic ambience. Of all the dishes I tried, I would rate the main course chicken dishes to be very good and worth a shot...yet to try all the sea food dishes.

Hmmmm…Well what do you say about a place like TCC.  It’s a restaurant “ of the gourmet, by the gourmet, for the gourmet”.  If you know your food, love it, savour it- you have to visit this place.

This  old colonial restored building will definitely catch your attention if you pass by it. With its pristine white walls, French windows- it makes you want to stop and adore it. Once bhowanipore was full of such buildings but they are a rare sight nowadays with so many land sharks on the prowl. TCC is a welcome step towards preserving the history & heritage of  Calcutta and the entire credit goes to the owner- Megha  Agarwal. It is a boutique hotel also with some 7-8 rooms. They opened up a patisserie recently as well.

As soon as you enter the restaurant you will be enchanted by its décor perhaps a little overwhelming for few but I liked it a lot. Lot of vintage & antique items adorning the walls. “ Quaint & queer” are words that would best describe it. 

OUR ORDER:

Starters:  

Thai Risotto balls: Tangy n spicy thai risotto balls with a nice flavor of lemongrass. Perfecly fried.  A must try, even the dip is very good.

Main Course:  

-	Pizza : We did a half n half, Bechamel Pizza had feta cheese n pesto drops in it & a puttanesca which was tomato based. Both were simply brilliant. 

-	Baked Italian Eggplant: Believe me even eggplant haters would fall in love with this dish. The eggplant is so perfectly baked, moist n flavourful. Its served with a sauce n some rice n potatoes by the side.  

Desserts:   

Baked philadephia cheese cake:  Slightly on the dry side probably because its oven baked but tastes good. Served with small melon scoops.

Bill Amount:  For the two of us, Rs1800 ( approx). It’s a liitle expensive but the food quality and Ambience justify the pricing. 

Conclusion:  I would definitely suggest eating out at this place. It’s a niche restaurant and not for the masses & certainly not for Gluttons.

Been to this restaurant many times before and had a good experience. Food today was simply horrible. The chef seems to have changed and really did nit seem to know what he was doing when we complained about the food. Ordered minestrone soup. It tasted of tomato ketchup. The chef actually said that they put ketchup in it to give tanginess. Then we ordered a Thai red curry with burnt garlic rice. Rice was undercooked and the gravy was so thick and salty that the combination was barely edible. We replaced the order with a pizza. It's difficult to get pizza wrong and I am not quite sure how they managed it but it was completely tasteless. And service was so slow that we spent 1.5 hours there despite low occupancy. To top it off there does not seem to be any manager running the place, only staff. I am definitely not going back there

Located in a quiet corner of Sarat Bose Road, this place has a charm of colonial Calcutta. The ambience is well thought out. This place is one of my favorite places in Kolkata and I have visited this place thrice in the last one month. The Philadelphia cheese cake is simply delectable. Getting a cheese cake right is a big feat and this place has got it right. The spinach, zucchini and ricotta stuffed connelloni is flavoursome and filling. The thai green curry was well made minus the galangal. The ricotta and sun dried tomatoes stuffed mushroom cupcakes were delightful. The service is slow by the coffee table books kept on the window sills are amusing and interesting. While leaving you can grab bread, pesto and some dips and not worry about the next day's breakfast. I would certainly visit this place again!

A place in the shade with proper light to finish a book, a small kitty party - if that's what you have in mind, run to this place. Look at the old building they have renovated and created this genius - literally a courtyard in a house on a corner. The service is brilliant with adequate recommendations from the waiter to pair a proper starter entrée and a sweet delicacy. You're missing out on a little Kolkata if you do not visit this place. It is much unlike any other Kolkata eatery outlets.

I visited this spot with our familiy lunch for 20 peoples on 10 may'15 sunday at around 4.30 pm,.the food was extrmly awesome we cant complain on it.,but the behaviour of the waiter shabbir was very hurt,.and he should have this much decency and manners how to talk with the guest and respect,.when i said him please return the desert which we really dont want cause we were totally packed up with the food,.when we can pay total bill amout 6500,.so he should know that 1 desert return wont make much loss,.but continuesly he was telling, u have to take n u have to pay,.in front of my family members,even when i said i know your owner very wel, bt still he was argueing with me in front of the manager,and really dont care abt it.,this was my last visit to tcc and wont be able to come again only because of this waiter,this type of guy who spoil the hotel image.

It's a very quaint restaurant located in south Kolkata and is a perfect place for your romantic dinner date with your bae. We went there on the New Year's Day. We called them up for reservation, but they didn't attend the call because it was already reserved. On reaching they provided us a small coffee table first. We asked them to get us shifted if any booking was cancelled. Within 15minutes they got us shifted to their main dining area, which is very well decorated and cosy. The food was good. We had ordered grilled prawns, malaysian fish curry and baked bengal bhetki. The fish curry was a bit stinky because I can't bear the smell of lemongrass, otherwise everything was pretty good. For desserts, we had carrot cake. I think it was okay because I think I bake better ones. But you will love the ambience, the decor; the staffs are really courteous. Food is overall good. But you have to be careful while choosing because they serve authentic cuisines, and all of the dishes might not suit your palate. Otherwise, hands up for The Corner Courtyard. Try out this place. Happy Dining! :)

A perfect place for foodies who love Mediterranean food. This place has beautiful decor combined with awesome food. We went for lunch and for starters we ordered Romanian bacon wrapped prawn along with a refreshing drink pink grape Fruit lemonade. The drink was good but it has a minty flavour which i didn't quite like..prawns were juicy and tested good. For the main course we had chicken lemon paprika with red wine reduction. Chicken was tender yet well cooked, the buttered vegetables and mashed potato was heavenly. This dish was a real stand out. For the dessert we had Philadelphia cheesecake which steals the show. Its probably the best cheesecake i have ever had. 
As a whole corner courtyard is a must visit. The service was a bit slow but very good. Will visit soon to have their pizzas.

As the name suggests, situated right at the corner at hazra road, I visited this spot for family dinner as my prime focus was to have Italian. We ordered for overloaded nachos which were decent enough with cheese sauce, tomato chilli salsa and very few beans. Somehow, the tortillas tasted like cornitos. 
Grilled Italian chicken bites were lip smacking, but lacked juiciness.
Moving to the main course, the waiter shabbir was quick enough to recommend a few options which were enticing and we ended up ordering for a basilico pesto pizza topped with bell peppers, olives, sun dried tomatoes, onions and beans. Every Italian joint, that I have come across pays a lot of attention to pesto sauce. Here at corner, it could have been slightly better only if given they had given the attention it needed.
The grilled Napoleon lamb meat balls with spaghetti turned out decent as being a guy from delhi, I know exactly how the meat balls should have been cooked. The meat balls were a little dry and the red sauce had a bit of sweetness which ideally shouldn't have been that way.
I'd Rate this place a 4.0 purely on the interior and hospitality as it was raining and the valet guy was courteous enough to escort us to our car under the umbrella despite of heavy rains.

You want to have decent Italian food, good ambience, good chats, the corner court yard wouldn't be a disappointment.

Today I am unable to attach my customary 5 photos to my review as I couldn't go beyond ordering appetizers. While the winter chicken soup was quite delicious, after getting one whiff of the Bengal black mussels and clams we knew the fish had gone off. We merely sent the dish back, saying we will order something else. I suppose our maitre de, Shabbir, got insecure that we would refuse to pay for the dish and decided to educate us as to how clams and mussels actually taste. It was at that point that we decided to ask for the bill and moved to the next door Cafe Coffee Day for unfailingly good sandwiches and coffee!

I was looking forward to this friday dinner here after reading the reviews. It was a matter of only an hour! My husband and I had the arabic chicken skewers and the reggae pizza along with two mocktails. Surprisingly felt quite full after these two so had to give a miss to the desserts. The bill was around 1500 for the items mentioned. The food was quite good, something that makes me want to taste the other items on the menu. We did miss our glasses of cocktail along with our dinner, but since we had gone knowing it would be so, we can't complain. The service was very good. The preparation time required for each dish was told to us while ordering and we were asked whether we liked our food or not more than once. One can also buy various kinds of bread or condiments from here. I feel I would have appreciated this place more had I gone for a lunch, because the decor will probably look more charming during the daytime. Overall I liked it. Thumbs up for the valet parking!

Remember the song you fell in love with the moment you heard the piano notes at the beginning, and have been unable to let go off ever since? That's Corner Courtyard for you in a sentence. A white building at a corner of Hazra Road, this is an addition to the new crop of restaurants that has come up in the city. 'Charming' is the first word that comes in mind when reviewing this place. And it's followed closely by 'elegant'.

We went there for a weekday dinner last week. The place was almost completely full, but we were ushered in after waiting for about 5 minutes at the counter. The area is quite small compared to the crowd it attracts. But they have somehow managed to arrange the tables in a manner that maximizes the seating capacity, without making the act of walking up to the restroom an absolute nightmare. The walls are decorated with photographs, odd curios, or just random patterns. The seating arrangement is pretty vibrant, as different tables are accompanied by chairs of different designs. In fact, all the nooks and all the corners here demand your attention. Even the restroom makes you look up and take notice.

Coming to the food, we went for the Italian chicken bites and the white meat crab cakes from the starters section. While the chicken bites were good, the crab cakes were absolutely delicious. I am not a big fan of crab, but the crab cakes here are highly recommended (I won't even go into describing how nicely the items were arranged on the plate). I also ordered a cucumber berry soda, which was alright. The main course proved to be a bit of a challenge - we wanted to try the calamari first, and then red snapper, but both the items were over. So we finally ordered the bhetki fish fillet and spaghetti with lamb balls. Spaghetti isn't really something I die for, and my conviction was re-affirmed here. The bhetki fish, though, was quite tasty. And full marks for presentation once again.

The pocket pinch is on the higher side, but the taste, the ambience, and the presentation more than make up for it. This place is a must-visit for so many reasons, and I am definitely going back. At least for a round of desserts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I ended up visiting Corner Courtyard again, during Nabami. This time we ordered the Malaysian chicken satay in spicy peanut sauce and Bhetki grilled fish in paprika sauce in starters. The chicken satay was decent, but the Bhetki was just excellent. More than the fish pieces, it was the sauce that was full of flavour. Even capsicum pieces dipped in paprika sauce transformed into something unbelievably sumptuous. For the main course, I chose the Steamed burnt garlic bhetki with Ratatouille and rice. Now my main motive here was to taste the Ratatouille, and not the bhetki. Unfortunately, I didn't quite like the taste of Ratatouille, which can be described as a mixture of vegetables prepared in a sweet and spicy sauce. The bhetki fillet, though, was quite filling and tasty. 

The service seemed slower than last time. It could have been attributed to the Puja rush, but then again, there was hardly a crowd there. In fact, the place was less occupied than it was during my last visit. Overall, the quality of food was not as  par my expectation, which had been set quite high by my first visit, and a couple of items were not available - both crab cakes and Polyjuice Potion were out of stock. Having said that, the bhetki starter was lip-smacking, and the other items were quite good as well. This place is still highly recommended.

What's not good about this restaurant..
From nice food to great ambience and decor and the best part free wi fi and extra friendly waiters.
Don't mistake it by its outside look. I know it doesn't look so much attractive but once u enter the whole scenario changes. There seafood and continental are the best. 
Only one flaw they charge a bit more and give less quantity compared to the amount of bucks spent.
Anyways surely try this one before u die :)

Very cute and cozy place. Loved the history and photo books and the little newsletter they have created for the restaurant that they keep scattered around for people to look at have while waiting for your food, which is delicious. A nice authentic Italian selection worth every penny and one of the best cappuccinos I've ever tasted. They also have a selection of delicious bread, baked desserts, hummus, and other treats you can purchase to take home with you. I got a loaf of olive bread and it was great. There wasn't anything particularly memorable to be said about the wait staff. They weren't incredibly friendly and they didn't go above and beyond for anything. Also, our appetizer order was wrong so we had to wait a bit longer to start eating, but the books helped with that. Overall it was a great experience and I would love to go back and stay in one of the adorable hotel rooms they have as well.

Have been to this place, and the vibes are really nice. Its a cute little place that makes you feel good.

Visited it recently with a bunch of Friends and the experience with food was a disaster.
We ordered the following:
Waffles- Decent. But i did not like the chocolate syrup and it was very less in quantity ( esp since i neither like maple nor honey with the waffles)
Tomato basil Soup- The best thing I had there. Even though it was not that hot (the way i like it)
Spagetti aglio e olio- Under cooked and hard. Also dry even though there was lot of oil in the bottom of the dish
Pizza- Very Very bland. Managed to eat it after loads of salt, oregano, chilli flakes and tobasco.
Risotto- I was too full and could not dare to try it after seeing the dish. But the rest of my friends had a bad expression on their face. Again they had to resort to oregano etc to make it edible.

To top it the staff kept asking us how is the dish after serving each dish. And we all had no answer after finding faults in the first few dishes. All had atleast some problem!

Hope they improve on their food. I like the feel of the place a lot.

Three of us visited this joint with very high expectations, considering the feedback I have got from my friends and I must say being a foodie this is one such joint I would love to repeat reason being :

Excellent food,beautiful and refreshing ambiance, nice location.

1. Romanian bacon wrapped prawns with a thousand island dressing : I just loved it. It was nothing short of foodgasm !! :) :)

2. Linguine tossed with roast chicken, mushroom, olives and bacon bites in a creamy Parmesan sauce: Nicely cooked soft and tender, the sauce was yummy 

3. Grilled Norwegian Salmon with creamy garlic etc etc : We were so hungry and overawed by this place, we went probably for one of the costliest plates :P :P.... And I would say I have tasted nothing like this in my life. It was mind blowing. Just have it not thinking much about the price for once atleast

4. Chocolate hazelnut mousse : Nice mousse, but I have had better desserts in places like Serafina (considering the price)

5. Oven baked Philadelphia cheese cake : Probably the best cheese cake I have had in my life (its better than the ones served in Irish House)

-.5 only for quantity, probably because its steeply priced and also we three eat a lot !! :) :)

A must try for not very price conscious foodies

It is very rare to find a gem of a place, one where the food as well as the place speak to you and creates an experiential journey unlike one you have been on before. This restaurant here had me head over heels on the first sip of their soup. We ordered a vegetarian version of the french onion soup. The robust flavours of the broth and the well caramalised onions added a richness to this soup while the shredded cubed mozarella cheese topping the soup added a creaminess to the light broth. We then ordered the courtyard salad with smoked chicken and the crunchiness of the lettuce, apples and walnuts along with the sweetness of the ingredients was well complimented by the simple and light dressing. The smoked chicken added a lovely flavour and dimension to the dish. We also ordered spinach hummus with toasted flat bread, which again had the richness of the green celebrated with the lovely olive oil. The dual tomato bengal mustard gouda cheese tart had the delicate pastry which added to the texture of the food without interfering with the flavours of the ingredients, which by themselves did not overlap or interfere with each other. The mains we ordered a portion of the norwegian salmon, roast lamb shanks, spiced garden vegetable tortellini and grilled panko mustard crusted cottage cheese steak. The salmon was well cooked and juicy with a creamy garlic sauce and steamed veggies, one i have found rare to find. The wine reduction sauce accompanying the lamb shanks had a fruity yet earth flavour to it, complimenting a well seasoned and cooked lamb. The butter tossed steamed veggies and carrots served with the roast meat were a treat. The tortellini served with a creamy tomato sauce was soft to the bite and full of flavour and last but not the least panko crusted cottage cheese was soft on the inside and had a great contrasting texture on the first bite. The only unfortunate part, if i need to find one and point out for the sake of it was the generous serving of potatoes on every dish, which nonetheless were delicious. We wrapped this delicious meal with an espresso infused apple crumble, which had the perfect balance of sweetness and crunch. While i personally could not taste the espresso flavour as much, the tart was a brilliant end to a great meal. This is surely a place i would love to visit as often as i can for the food, the ambience as well as for the very courteous staff, i also recommend it to everyone staying in the city of joy!

Went for the first time for my birthday treat. 
The first thing that caught my attention was the interior, then the aroma that brings water to the mouth. 
Service is okayish, but the food is out of the world. 
I was amazed at the quantity they serve at such reasonable rates, when Italian Dishes are generally not pocket friendly. 
Visit corner courtyard for some amazing pocket friendly food. And if you are a cheese lover like me, it's a win win.
P.s- the very kindly waiter showed us the rooms on the first floor. At a very reasonable tariff, the rooms were as cosy as I would like them to be, and the washrooms as pretty. :)

So we went to this place for our anniversary lunch and were pleasantly surprised with the ambiance and extremely polite behavior of the staff- the food though overall good, had a few ups and downs along the way. I would've loved to rate this place a little higher than 4, but a 4.5 would be a shade too high.

So coming to the different aspects:

Food (4.0): We ordered a salad which had figs, pomegranates and smoked chicken and it was really well presented as well as prepared. The california white meat crab cakes looked like a dream but left you a little disappointed( just a little bit ) once you tasted them. The paprika and lemon roast baby chicken was soft and succulent and the quantity was more than enough for two people. However, my personal favorite for the day was the Oven baked Philadelphia cheesecake which they had specially decorated with candles and all for our anniversary.

Ambiance (4.0) : Very nicely done, an old world  European charm which they have captured pretty well.

Staff ( 5) : Very very polite and helpful. They were eager to assist with the menu as well as the other little things like taking photos etc.

Price (4) : Well, it really isn't exorbitant, but some items can seem a bit pricey. Overall a decent 4 course meal for two would set you back by a fraction over 2000 bucks

Late evening and as I was driving from bhowanipur to tollygunge. I had to have dinner. It's around 10:30 and most of the eateries start to close. If they are not, then they try to hurry up your food so that you leave. I ended up at the corner courtyard. Yes it is at the corner. ?  quaint white building. Home turned restaurant. The decor inside is a collage of house artefacts. A must visit for a new home owner or a collector. Couldn't experiment much on the food as it was straight to the mains. But they do a mean Thai curry and an awesome rice to go along. Ban Thai watch out. The pasta could do with a bit of improvement as it was a little on the sweeter side for my taste. Good ingenuity and showmanship by the chef on the plate presentations. Will definitely go for a second visit.

Very lively and happy interiors! Decent service..We went for nachos with refried beans, fried risotto balls, pita bread with spinach humus, garlic breads and couple of mocktails. Garlic bread needs improvement.. Risotto balls were yumm.. Nachos should be served on a different (flat) platter, as we had to reach out for beans which had settled at the bottom of the concave/hollow serveware. Overall, a soothing experience! Cheers

It's where quiet luxury meets talk nice continental cuisine.. Excellent pastries.... A tag expensive but it's quite good... I loved the roast mutton.. Ask them to use wine...

Parking was an issue but now they have a valley service. The place however usually shuts a bit early compared to other places around.

When you go out for a meal there are 3 things that you normally look for - ambience, taste and the service. Corner courtyard scores high in each of the departments with élan. From the moment you step in, the unique ambience with variety of door locks hanging in one wall (unique), to the glass roof that brings in ample sunlight sets up perfect mood for the meal ahead. We tried quite a few veg and non veg appetisers like - oven roasted beetroot carpaccio, pan seared mushroom with garlic chilli, grilled chicken souvlaki and calamari. Apart from the calamari which was a bit chewy and was replaced when complained, all the appetisers were delectable. For the mains we had bangkok style thai green curry, Paprika and lemon grilled chicken, Pablo and Parmesan crusted chicken escallop, grilled bhetki with cashew. All the items were cooked to perfection, were served at the right temperature with crispy and neat garnishing. The activity inside the restaurant is very relaxed and laid back. The place is nothing extraordinary but there is an underlying finesse, be it in the food or the helpful staff that makes the experience complete. One of my favourite places to dine in South kolkata.

The first thing that strikes you about the place is the interiors! Beautiful. 
It is easy to locate and the food is damn good! The peach mojito was refreshing. The green apple soda was average and nothing special. 
We ordered Italian chicken bites for appetizers. The dish was lovely. The spiced vegetable tortellini was different and the tamarind flavour was nice. 
The one thing I loved about the place was the Philadelphia cheesecake. It was so beautifully presented and simply melted in our mouths. The apple crumble pie was a disappointment. 
If you're visiting this place, definitely try the cheesecake. Don't miss out on it! 
All in all, a great experience.

Visited the corner courtyard as all my family members are diehard Italian food addicts and wanted to sample some authentic food.

The seating is well lit with a tavern feel. The decorative pieces are probably family heirlooms and gel well with the ambience.

We had a simple vegetarian meal starting with their signature roast fig salad moving to the stuffed canallonini and a very good margherita  pizza.

Probably one of the very few places where the chef manages the pasta Al dente instead of a squishy mish mash of sauces.

My only grouse is the very less quantity of the cheeses. The salad says " feta cheese " but you really need to dig out the small pieces.

Very good food, service and ambience of a quaint french cafe. I had a chicken burger which was served with lots of sides and superbly plated. Chicken patty was grilled, its taste light and refreshing unlike any other fried patty burgers. For dessert I had baked cheese cake which is the best one I have ever had. Super fresh and just yum. Kudos for the service too. I had initially ordered a crab crak appetiser which I found too pungent. The server happily took it back, offered a replacement which I didnt eat. This was not charged in the bill :)  The only downside I feel is that they dont serve alchohol. It wud hv been nice to hv a wine or beer with the burger.

Three of us visited the place on a Sunday afternoon and as we walked in we observed that the place was totally crowded. The whole place is uniquely decorated and we just love the feel of the whole place. As we were super hungry we quickly ordered two drinks and three main courses which were Turkish grilled chicken with pomegranate tabbouleh salad,hummus and pita biscuit and the second dish was roasted pimento and mozzarella stuffed Mediterranean chicken with grilled garlic spinach ciabatta poch and  Mediterranean relish and the third dish was Grilled bhetki fish fillet with cashew lemon and chili crusted with romasco dressing seasonal potatoes and salad. The drinks were pink grape fruit lemonade and cucumber berry soda. The very first thing which one will notice that they prepare their dishes with great care with a touch of their own so that is what sets their dish apart from other places. The drinks were well prepared and the dishes had top notch presentation. Apart from the presentation one thing which upset me was the quantity with respect to the price that they were charging. The taste was really good and i had no idea spinach can taste so good with a bread but the chicken was a bit on the drier side. My friend enjoyed the bhetki dish but personally i liked the two chicken dishes more. In desserts we ordered strawberry cheesecake which was heavenly and chocolate truffle cake which was okay but nothing great. The total bill was rs. 2800.

Its such a wonder to see an old house been transformed into one of the sort out fine dining options in town. Reservation prior visiting is recommended. There is a option for valet parking was available too. 

In beverages we had Peach Mojito, Green Apple Mojito and Pink Grapefruit Lemonade. Will recommend Pink Grapefruit Lemonade which is very refreshing while mojitos are pretty simple syrups mixed with sprite. 

In seafood starters we ordered Romanian Bacon Wrapped Prawn, Californian White Meat Crab Cake and Zingy Thai Fish. 
Romanian Bacon Wrapped Prawn is truly one of their signature dishes. Crusty coating outside on a layer of bacon wrapped around prawn leaves such a smoky flavour with every bite of juicy prawns.
Californian White Meat Crab Cake comes second in my ranking for its taste of smooth crab meat and the eye-catching presentation. But disliked the fact of only 4 pieces in a portion.
Zingy Thai Fish will last in the ranking which is more like fish mashed dumplings and fried as nuggets with a twist of lime. Taste was amazing.

With an intention to have poultry main course we ordered for Panko and Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Paprika and Lemon grilled chicken, Turkish Grilled Chicken and Roasted Pimonto n Mozzarella stuffed Mediterranean Chicken. Each and every dish were exquisite and so was presentation and taste. However in all dishes we found chicken was bit though. I am sure the kitchen is aware of techniques on how to make it softer and less chewy.

In dessert Philadelphia Cheese Cake was the best cheese cake I ever had at any part of the world. 

I found the servers are extremely polite and professional and speaks fluent English (with fake accent though). They give bill in cute jute basket. They don't charge service charges at all. Price still a bit on the higher side and the entire affair costed us around INR 4800 inclusive all.

I wouldn't want to go back to The Corner Courtyard again! This is the second time that we went and even thought the food was good, the service was atrocious.
We, a family of three went for our usual outing for Sunday lunch. As it was getting late, decided to go to TCC. The first thought that came to mind was we reminded ourselves on the first time around we had to wait a long time for our meal. We walked in, the front staff was courteous and guided us to our table. Being Woman's Day there was a special menu but we were told that it would be faster if we ordered from the usual menu. A salad, a pizza and two non veg mains were ordered by us and we had to wait 45 minutes for it

A place, I have always been for desserts and should go for main course next time, this place amazes me with it's food.
The first time I went I had delectable macaroons, red velvet cupcake filled with chocolate fudge inside and chocolate mousse. This time I ordered a baked Cheesecake and my friend ordered a Mocha Mousse Flan.
Lets talk about the Cheesecake: The crumb crust was perfect and the cheesecake was soft, melt in my mouth. Presentation was perfect with melon scooped on top of the cheesecake.
Mocha Mousse Flan looked perfect with an oreo cookie perched on top. Drizzled with ample amount of chocolate and served with a dollop of vanilla. It was a comfort food. Wish they would have better quality vanilla ice cream with the flan.

I would visit this place for Seafood and many more great desserts.

P.S. They should get back macaroons on their menu :")

As my first review, I decided to pick a restaurant of which I had heard a lot of good things about.. But sadly hadn't visited till recently. So on a non-descript weeknight, the wife and I landed up here to taste the source of all the good word. An old school bengali styled mansion converted into a uniquely styled cafe and boutique hotel, this place in all its white.. Gave off a very welcoming vibe. The staff were warm and eager, while the Maitre'd was knowledgeable about the items on offer. We started off with a Gouda cheese and mustard tart accompanied by a duo of tomato relishes. The tart itself was delicious, with the perfect pastry having the ironic qualities of being crumbly whilst firm. The relishes of balsamic tomatoes and chutney infused with orange zest, added a much needed citrusy twist to cut through the richness of the tart. I love chicken wings, so it wasnt hard to convince the Mrs. to try the New York Styled chicken wings next. This dish by definition (as made in the US) is chicken wings deep fried and then tossed in a sauce of choice (gen bbq or hot sauce). Over here though the wings were fried in a chinese style with an outer caramelised coating of what I guess is soy, sugar, balsamic, garlic and chillies. Thought it wasnt the real thing.. It tasted awsome, and the added touch of it being served with a mustard potato pomegranate salad, lifted the dish to a next level. Good thin crust pizzas are a rarity, but the Rustica Picante we ordered was just right.. Thin, crisp, fresh tasting. If im being picky though, the pepperoni was probably a bit overdone and chewy. We finished off with a tangy and traty bannana caramel smoothie and a rich chocolate and mocha induce flan. The only criticism that I have for the latter is that it wasn't bitter enough.. Though that's just my personal choice I guess. In conclusion, good food, well trained staff and surprisigly not heavy on the pockets. A must visit for all

I have to visit this place everytime I am back in Kolkata- I realized that I have subconsciously added this place to mocambo, barbq and arsalan. 
Be it for breakfast or for their apple crumble pie which is to die for! 

I actually feel their veg fare is so good, that everytime this friend orders this veg version of spaghetti bolognaise (obviously substituting the minced meat balls) I can't stop pecking off their plates. 
Their Mediterranean chicken, the Peruvian fish. The Bay of Bengal snapper. The Thai flavours 
Their pizza
Everything  is to write home about!

I had read about this place in top 6 brunch places in Kolkata and wanted to come here for a long time.
Finally, I went there today for dinner with friends. The ambience was really good with all kinds of paintings, and wall hangings. I was impressed by the presentation of the food. Everything looked very tempting. 
We ordered- 
2 appetizers: Tangy thai spiced risotto balls, Nachos, 
4 main course: Ravioli, Bangkok style Thai green, Rosti, Spaghetti, and
1 dessert: Cheesecake 
I had heard that they don't have good veg variety but everything we ordered was veg and was good. 
The appetizers were tasty but less in quantity. Ravioli, spaghetti and rosti were delicious but thai green could have been better. Cheesecake was soft and awesome.

Must go for all foodies!
Perfect - ambience and food presentation.

I have been to this place quite a few a times. Hot chocolate is a sin here but we land up only for that. Though service seems to have deteriorated a bit as the people are not warm as they initially were. 
Even the liquor teas are very good though last three times same tea had been served differently to me, but now i know that o need to specify my way of service as the staff probably is always different here. 
Food is also excellent though quantity is very small. 
Ambience has actually been done tastefully and is a change from the usual ones

This place gives you a premium vintage feel, with nice food that delights you by its first sight itself, however at bit of premium rates but overall the staff lack that warmth which  I would expect from such a place !!!

I visited TCC recently in spite of it being on top of my wishlist since a long time. The place has an excellent decor with nice and comfy seats. Overall a very comfortable for dining or even relaxing over some tea, coffee. The staff were prompt but lacked that warmth which was extremely disappointing. The prices are bit on higher side.

Coming to food, first of all they have a great menu with certain preparations very exclusive to them. However they are too rigid with their menu, that created a bit of hassle when I tried to customise my main course order. The presentation of food is very important to me, and they were superb in this aspect. For food, loved their pizza, spaghetti agli olio, spinach and hummus with flat bread. Nachos, pasta in double cheese, cannelloni were good but nothing extra ordinary. For desserts, cheese cake was only item I tried and it was nice, bit dryish but pretty fine. 

Overall I felt the place served great food but failed to give a memorable experience.

Landed up on a weekday afternoon a few days back for an indulgent birthday lunch.

The decor is lovely. Great use of general household items to do up the interiors... locks, latches, books, ladders, and doors. The ambience was very interesting!

For starters, we ordered bacon wrapped prawns and the Californian crab cakes. Loved the appetizers!! Even the Curacao infused onion on the crab cakeswas a delight. 

For mains, we ordered grilled pink salmon with aglio olio (which was enough for two) and grilled Peri Peri tiger prawn skewers with herbed rice. 

The main course was delicious and filling. To top off the meal, we had warm cinnamon croissant bread pudding.

The damages totaled up to almost 4000 bucks but no one complained. We walked out happy and full.

Oh, and a word to the wise. They do not have valet parking or a laid out parking spot. So, there.

We went there on Christmas eve, and were ousted :(.. literally. They were fully booked with reservations. So we took another chance in New year's eve and this time, made prior reservations too. The decor is wonderful, very british and classy. It is mostly themed in white. The inner room wall is uniquely designed with door locks and knobs, different kind.

Coming to the food, we ordered--
Grilled garlic prawn tossed in bengal lime, chilli,balsamic dressing and pomegranate salad-- the salad was average, but the prawns were yumm and juicy
Baked bengali bhetki with burnt garlic and mustard dressing with warm bean salad, baked egg yolk and wine pear lemon salad-- The fish tasted nice and was presented also very nicely, only it was normal bhapa fish of bengali cuisine
Grilled pink salmon with brazillian garlic marinade with spagetti aglio olio-- the fish was very fresh and was yumm and actual pink! the spagetti tasted nice and the dish was overall tasty
Rosemary grilled Lamb chops with roast potatoes- I did not know that potatoes this small a size and cabbage this small a size exists. It looked heavenly and tasted so too.
Summer barbeque chicken with pesto smashed potatoes,dark rum spiced barbeque sauce and tropical salad- I liked this dish best. Chicken roasted perfectly, the pesto sauce was yummy and can be had solo.
Chocolate hazzelnut mousse- Nice and crunchy on the top, but not the best that I've had
Sticky toffee pudding- It is served with ice cream, does not look much appealing, tastes nice though.

The desser seemed average to me, but the main course and starters were exquisite, big pocket hole though.

Tcc or the corner courtyard from a distance looks extremely enchanting till the time u have been there u are very eager but after your first visit your excitement would soon die out !!!
about looks it is a beautiful looking place with the olden day charm, well lit and prim and proper nothing overdone (i just love the windows)
when it comes to food it has nothing great to offer we had ordered quite a lot of food which was just okay and nothing extra ordinary !! pizza was great they serve the thin crust pizza, we did not like the risotto much and the meat ball with spaghetti had to be sent bak because the meatballs were awfully stiff and over cooked !!!
sigh !!! I will definitely not go bak to this place again !!!

The Corner Courtyard was a restaurant that belonged in my wishlists for a long time. I finally had the chance to visit the place on New Year's eve 2014. We entered the place around 8-8.30 pm at night and luckily got a table near to the counter where the live breakfast's are put up.

I started the journey with ordering the appetizer dish Zingy Thai fish cakes with bengal lime, cucumber salad and sweet chilli dressing. The cakes were good but what impressed me the most about the dish was the salad that accompanied the dish along with a chutney of pesto and pudina. A well infused fusion!

Now, moving on to the main course...I ordered a Linguine tossed with roast chicken, mushrooms, olives and bacon cooked to perfection with a nice and creamy parmesan sauce. The consistency of the sauce and the mixture were to go wow for. I got sudden bursts of tanginess in my mouth due to the olives which made the dish even better for me. 

The next dish was the grilled peruvian fish topped with cajun spiced crabmeat and capers accompanied with a tangy summer salad.  This quality of the bhetki fish was brilliant. The thickness and the juiciness were just slurpy! 

The final main course dish was the best of the lot...Grilled Norwegian Salmon with garlic, parsley served with a chilli butter roulade and a grilled artichoke. The salmon was despite being well cooked tasted great (for those who are unfamiliar, salmon is a type of fish which you need to keep slightly undercook every time you prepare it as cooking it fully will dry up all its natural flavours and juiciness). But this dish proved to be a real good one as the salmon was perfect and the aroma of a typical fresh salmon was intact. 

Overall the main course was a real delight as each and every aspect of it impressed me. 

Now to the desserts, to be honest after having all that amount of good food before it, the desserts didn't appeal to me much. I ordered myself a warm apple crumble pie with a vanilla foam, and my parents ordered for themselves a cheesecake and a warm cinnamon croissant bread pudding. 

I finished the deal finally with a nice shot of illy espresso. 

Overall this place is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend all. :)

This place had been on my go to list for a long time now and finally went there for Christmas lunch. The interiors is what drowns you as soon as you enter. This restaurant is set in an open courtyard like setting in a small hotel. The walls are done up beautifully and you can just stare and them and discover hidden stories. There are too many tables cramped in one place which does not give you any room for privacy. Every word you say can be heard by the person sitting at the table next to you. Coming to the food, it was well presented and the taste was good too. The place has a tie up with another bakery called rouge for their desserts and it works out well for them I guess. At the time of making a reservation I faced a bit of a problem but overall it was a good experience.

Great food. Quantity wise filling even without dessert. One preperation per person is adequate. Without alcohol it should not exceed 1500 for 2 persons. My wife thinks that the chicken pasta she had looked inadequate. But the pleasant surprise was that the dish was deep. Ambience enjoyable.

First things first. I never knew this is also a Hotel to stay with 7 rooms. The hotel and the restaurant it houses has the same name The Corner Courtyard. Now I know. I actually went there in view of it being a great Italian restaurant so this review is on the restaurant.

We reached there and we got the seats. The staff is very courteous and always at ur service. We loved the ambience and the decor. Its a old times haveli converted to the modern hotel and restaurant. One who is familiar with the havelies will understand the structure very well.

Everything is perfectly decorated and you feel that you have actually come in old times but with a taste of model design. I was stunned to see how old places can be used for the good of modern times.

We ordered what i always like in Italian, that is Nachos and Spaghetti. Nachos were served with am amazing presentation very soon and then after we finished came the spaghetti. Nachos blew our mind off and Spaghetti took our heart away. Simply awesome taste which gives a sort of serene peace and satisfaction to your soul and stomach. The quantity was also good and by the time we finished the spaghetti we were completely full. The service was amazing and the food was more amazing. The presentation was such you would love to see it again and again. The food was served and it gave a sense of freshness. What best we liked in spaghetti was that it had more vegetables than the spaghetti itself. That was what we have been searching all over everywhere and is seldom given n any joint. The types of veges was also more than what you would usually have anywhere.

My wife and my taste buds are still struggling to get off the taste but we simply can't get over the delicious tastes. I would highly recommend this and I would give this restaurant full marks. A must try for all the lovers of tasty food.

The ambience and attention to detail with the decor was wonderful, especially the old-Kolkata sort of charm that the old refurbished building exuded. As for the food, what we had was the Paprika and lemon grilled chicken with a Shiraz red wine shallot reduction, spring onion mash and buttered vegetables and a Turkish grilled chicken with a pomegranate tabbouleh salad, hummus and pita biscuits, both of which were delicious with perfect portion sizes. Dessert, an oven baked Philadelphia cheesecake with a fig compote and melon, was a bit of a let down though, in spite of it being from the much-hyped confectionery chain Rouge. And yes, the raspberry iced tea is perhaps one of the main reasons why this is missing out on a 5 star rating. You will be wise to not even venture into that path.

Visited this place for lunch on a tuesday. The decor is very unique with old books on the walls and latches and bolts. The seats are brightly coloured. The staff was very well behaved and courteous. We ordered Romanian bacon wrapped prawns for appetizers, and it was quite nicely done. For main course I ordered Peruvian grilled fish. It was nicely presented but the fish was a bit smelly which put my friend off, so we had to order another dish, after gazing through the long menu we thought chicken would be a safer option and ordered parmesan chicken with spring onion mashed potatoes. This dish tasted good and I loved the mased potatoes and the veggies. We were filled to the brim and did not want to have desserts, but the macaroons in the display counter looked appealing and we ended up tasting all the four flavours! A nice place to visit, although the price is quite high.

An old house converted cleverly into a nice restaurant. The crisp thin crust pizza was delicious and as they allow 2 flavours half and half it gives you a little more bang for your buck. The grilled jalapeño polenta was good too. On the whole a happy experience. Keep it up guys!

The ambience of the restaurant is mesmerising and the interior is innovatively decorated. The team members are warm and cordial. The menu looks quite tempting. We ordered for some delicious looking food which were beautifully arranged. 
The crab soup and sea food chowder was a delight to the taste bud. But if I have to consider the value for money factor. The remaining dishes were gorgeous but as per taste it is not upto the mark. 
I suggest one to experiance The corner courtyard ride.

In a nutshell: 

A very cool café made by transforming yet preserving an Old house into a restaurant, good service & some very good Global food made using Local ingredients.

Short Description – in case u r in a hurry:

The house is situated in the corner of the road. I wud have passed by it numerous times earlier & never really noticed it. It wud have looked like any other old building on that street. Someone had the vision to see the potential of the building, do it up while preserving the look & feel. Hats off. The transformed building is now a landmark & stands out from the rest.

The interiors r just too good. I wud say that there r a few discovery zones inside. Each room has a character of its own while having a common design language.

A central Dining Hall has high ceiling & a passage balcony on one side.

A wall was full of brass daily use items. Looked stunning. An old door with movable shades (khorkhori) added to the look.

On the walls there were framed pictures of different rooms in the building & the façade before renovation. That made us realize how well the place has been done up.

We went here close to Durga Pujo. So we were given only Durga Pujo menu. As mentioned above, it had a wide & nice variety of dishes from around the world but made with local ingredients , with a local twist.

Food was very enjoyable in general.

Detailed Description – In case u have the Time to NJOY reading:

We started with a Caribbean drink that had green coconut base, gondhoraj flavor & an olive. Really nice. Rate it 4.25/5

We started our meal with Grilled Garlic prawn tossed in garlic, gondhoraj lime, chilli & balsamic dressing with a summer pomegranate salad

Prawns were much fresher and better than inland locked delhi. Very nice, juicy, succulent . Flavours of prawn and garlic both were felt well. SalAd was very good as well bit I have surely had better. Rate prawns 4.5/5 and salad 4/5. Overall rating averages out to 4.25/5

WE moved on to Bay of Bengal’s Black mussels and clams tossed in brown garlic & vino bianco cherry tomato sauce. Outstanding flavors and taste of both mussels and spices. Cheese grated, this dish does not fill stomach. it's only for taste. Rate it 4.25/5

The next dish we had was Corner Courtyard’s Aqua pizza – a medley mix of calamari, shrimps, crabmeat& flaked tuna tossed in butter. Tomato was the predominant taste in this pizza to such an extent that all seafood was lost. 

Seafood often has subtle flavours that need to b handled properly. Here it was manhandled. The sea animAls were brutally murdered by the tomato and their traces clinically exterminated. Crust of the pizza was thin and nice. Texture was good. Rate this dish 1/5.

We next ordered Pan Grilled fresh water bhetki with a French Mussel cream sauce on a bed of lemon, shallot, peas, spinach & potatoes. The green peas were not good as they were out of season. The sauce was made in house from mussels. 

That was just too good. The fish was thin strips of bhetki full of layers, soft inside, very tasty, crisp outside. The fish was served on a bed of Greens and potatoes. The greens were outstanding and potatoes were very good. Loved it overall. Rate it 4.25/5.

Espresso infused apple crumbled pie with vanilla foam. Over promised and under delivered. Espresso did not make its presence felt. Vanilla foam made no impact. Having said that , it a swell good old apple crumble. Loved it as it is. Excellent crisp warm freshly baked outer layer, perfect sweet n sour filling with an overall hint of salt. Rate it 4.5/5 as a humble apple crumble.

Overall average rating of food & beverages at this restaurant is 3.75/5. This rating is largely due to the aqua pizza pulling it down. If we ignore that one dish, the rating exceeds 4. I wud surely revisit not only to have great food again but also to have a good time with friends in this nice ambience.

Corner Courtyard is a pleasure for your eyes first because of their interiors and super ambience. This restaurant, which is actually located at the corner of a busy street, surprised me with the excellent service and great food. I have been to this outlet several times and experienced their different meal periods. The first experience was a dinner where we tasted their Smoked, chicken apple and crushed tortilla ceaser salad. It was fresh and crispy and the taste was awesome. i knew I was coming back. I experienced their breakfast. I was very impressed by their food presentation and accompaniments. The outlet is usually full, yet the service is fast and staff attentive. Keep up the good work! One of my favourite joint.

Later a chicken in bbq sauce was ordered which was quiet filling..
The food served is of a good standard and the service is pleasing..
There is a cupcake counter which serves macroons as well... macroons are yummm..
The atmosphere along with the high quality food makes it a good experience all the time i step in there!

We ordered the combo that offered us a soup , a starter and one main course . We ordered another BBQ chicken for main course . And Macaroons after . 

For starters ,We had chicken soup and Crispy Chicken Wings in BBQ Sauce. Though Chicken soup sounds really boring and bland . But since it was the beginning of winter , wanted to try something simple , soothing and nice . And trust me , it turned out to be better than I thought it would . 
Crispy Chicken wings in BBQ Sauce was mind blowing and amazing . 

Then there was Fish Laksa . The fish laksa was not as original as the roadside Malaysian Laksa , but something is better than nothing . It was not bad,considering you hardly get laksa anywhere .

So was the BBQ Chicken . The big BBQ chicken was half a chicken , so enough to fill your one day meal .
I can only say , the main course was 'okay'.

Then , there comes the macaroon, hazelnut and coffee flavored . Hazelnut was the preferred choice . 

4.0 for its ambience , Chicken wings and really good macaroons .

Decor is unique. With all the doorknobs, the old timey antique pieces, it lends itself an individual air. 
Ambience is quite good with dim lighting and soft music.
Service is prompt and no nonsense.
Food:
The menu is quite ambitious with its range in ingredients, flavors and preparations. The bold effort almost fulfills its potential. Almost...
Appetizers: Greek skewered chicken - full of flavors, soft tender meat but a bit too soft for my liking, melting into the sauce, losing its individuality. Prawn tempura was flawless with soft, tender prawns. The sauce complemented it well.
Main: Ordered the red snapper and the paprika and lemon grilled chicken. The snapper was well prepared though the gravy was a bit too pungent. The lemon grilled chicken had but one flaw - the chicken was stiff and slightly overcooked. The other aspects of the dish made up for it. The sauce with shallot was exquisite with the flavorful mashed potatoes providing a beautiful contrast and the assortment of fresh vegetables giving the dish a nice crunch.
Overall, a nice experience and definitely a must try for everyone - be it with friends or loved ones.

I have now been to the Corner Courtyard twice, and I have many positive things to say about it. The staff do, for the most part, a truly wonderful job. The service is prompt but not intrusive, the servers are knowledgeable about the menu, and the food is generally quite good. It's a comfortable environment, and both visits were pleasant.

That said however, I do have some criticisms, which I hope might help to elevate The Corner Courtyard to the level to which they aspire. 

I'll start with what matters most to me: the food. The menu here is way too long and complex. Many restaurants in my home country make the mistake of trying to be all things to all people, and they inevitably end up falling short. I suggest that the folks at TCC do their best to trim their menu, especially if they're branding themselves as a champion of things local and organic. Customers just aren't going to buy that your focus is on local and seasonal ingredients if you have a hundred items on your menu. TCC should concentrate on what they do well and ditch everything else.

As for the ambiance, I was a little put off by the techno-dance hall music, which feels incongruous at best, and oppressive and distracting at worst. I would suggest they try something that better suits their theme, like jazz.

Finally, I have noticed that at times there seem to be an excessive number of staff members standing idle when customers' tables still have to be cleared, water glasses are empty, etc. Every staff member should be available for these tasks, and nothing is more irritating to a customer than staring at a dirty plate for fifteen minutes while a staff member is SMSing nearby.

All in all, I really appreciate what these folks are doing and I would recommend giving them a try if your wallet can take it. But if they want to justify their high prices then the food needs to speak volumes more than it does now, and they have really got to step back and settle on their identity lest they spread themselves too thin.

Now good continental food is hard to come by, even from expensive boutique establishments, and corner courtyard continues in the same tradition. The basic problem I feel is that everyone feels that the Continent consists of one country- Italy and dousing any food with cheese tomato and oregano will make it taste heavenly. Take for example their calamari stuffed with prawn and crabmeat- beautifully done preserving all the tender flavours of the individual ingredients but then they serve it on an abomination called risotto which is so cheesy and overpowering that all the flavours get lost. Their seafood chowder is heavenly,  and romanian bacon wrapped prawns are most interesting but the place has several shortcomings which completely ruins the experience. The music is completely out of sync with the decor which was going in the right direction of aping colonial era till a monstrosity in the form of a wall with doorknobs with more than a passing resemblance to carbuncles hits your sensibilities. The cutlery is all wrong, so are the china- now you may call me picky but if you claim lofty levels of niche experience you really have to know what you are trying to emulate. So it works half the time and mostly doesn't.

The absence of a well stocked bar is usually a big deterrent for me in checking out any new eating hole. However , when we checked into this place on a lazy holiday afternoon , the first thing that struck us was the ambience. It is one of those old fashioned south Calcutta buildings with a courtyard , now done up fabulously with ingredients found most within the house. So you have old binoculars and other optics , an old fashioned radio , a wall full of various kinds of locks (see pic) and a whole lot of amazing stills clicked by someone with an obvious fetish for closed doors . The overhead balcony  has 7 rooms that are let out for accommodation purposes (need to check them out next time). Coming to the food , we decided to do a Romanian bacon wrapped prawn with thousand island dressing and grilled chicken satays with kafir infused Apple and red cabbage chutney. The chicken satay was good but we have had better. The bacon wrapped prawn with its brilliant crumb was the artpiece of the meal. Moving on to the main course , we had the paprika and lemon grilled chicken with a Shiraz red wine shallot reduction , spring onion mash and buttered veggies.  And baby you can eat each alphabet and punctuation mark off that long name. While the wife devoured that, I went for the linguini tossed with roast chicken , mushrooms , olives and bacon bites in a creamy Parmesan sauce. The amount of cheese was just perfect and the portion adequate. However with a gun to my head I would say that the chicken could have been flavoured differently.... that or maybe just that I'm a red meat man. We wrapped up with an espresso infused Apple pie and signed off with the maitre d' promising a working bar which is just a few administrative paperwork away. I know I am coming back soon and when you do land inside , let those fire hoses be your conversation starter. Bon appetit !

I tried just 2 items : the red velvet cupcake with butter frosting and waffles with fruits. 
Based on these two items and a glass of watermelon juice, I definitely loved the place. 
Cant wait to go back and try some more items.

A wonderful place to be in just at the corner of the road -
Ambience awesome .
And talking about the decor its just beautiful.
Coming to the food ; if any one asks me - the first thing i would suggest is to try the Omelettes - be it Cheese or Spanish - just perfect with the correct amount of mashed buttered potato , mushroom and spinach - all cooked to the finest .
And since i am always an Italian food buff - the Penne pasta in white sauce with chicken and mushroom has been one of the bests tasted till date .
Can always come up again and again .
Excelllent food and a beautifully done decor :)
Okay , the Meditteranian chicken with Ciabatta Bread , The mushroom and corn stuffed Ravioli and the Grilled Chicken escallop with creamy mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes - awesome 👏🏻

This place holds a very special place in my heart as my Fiancé and I had celebrated our 2nd Anniversary here. The day was very special for us and The Corner Courtyard made it perfect. As we entered the old Colonial house, the interior decorations, the books on the book shelves, the wall decorations, the sitting arrangements, the chandelier, the lighting’s were absolutely perfect. The waiters were very polite and helpful. The aroma of freshly baked breads made the ambiance perfect. 

We had ordered 

Appetizers:
1. Romanian Bacon wrapped prawns with a thousand Island dressing and seasonal Salad
2. Greek Chicken Souvlaki skewers with Arabic slaw and Coriander Ginger pesto
3. Californian styled white meat crab cakes topped with Blue Curacao vinegar soaked onion salad and tomato caper dressing

Main Course Poultry:
1. Panko and parmesan rusted chicken escallop with a creamy wild mushroom sauce, buttered seasonal veggies and spring onion smashed potatoes

Dessert:
1. Chocolate Macaroon
2. Coffee Macaroon
3. Hazel Nut Macaroon
4. Blueberry Macaroon

All these were recommended to us by the server. He was of great help. I highly recommend Greek Chicken Souvlaki skewers with Arabic slaw and Coriander Ginger pesto and Californian styled white meat crab cakes topped with Blue Curacao vinegar soaked onion salad and tomato caper dressing.
 
The price is little on the higher side. It pinches your pocket but the food was worth the price. 
I am definitely going back to TCC again. And I highly recommend this place.

Bon Appétit

Had gone there on a date and I couldn't have been more delighted a the quality of food presented out there. The ambiance at CC was beautiful and talking of food - the taste of continental, which also happens to be my favorite, was exemplary. We had ordered a pizza and frankly speaking, they give the American outlets a run for their money. The tomato puree, the thin crust - it is nothing short of heavenly. The Romanian bacon wrapped prawns were delicious and the accompanying cooler was nice too. We had ordered a couple of more side dishes and they too, gave orgasms to our taste buds. But the only thing we were disappointed were was with the service being a tad bit slow - considering that we had visited post Durga Puja.

Didn't liked it. We had veg pizza and veg risotto and found quality and preparation is not up to the mark and bit pricey, as compared to spaghetti kitchen, casa toscana or cafe mezzuna.

A real awesome place to be. The ambience is picturesque. The Service and Food are special too, starting from the Appetizers to Desserts. Only thing I felt a bit bad about is the Rosemary Grilled New Zealand lamb chops. According to the quantity, 1950 is too Over Priced.

The high rating is because of the grand ambience that this restaurant provides for. Food is good but not exceptional. Presentation of food is amazing. I didn't get a chance to look at their regular menu as I visited during Diwali. Interestingly, no dish has a name; only explanation. So ordering food was tideous. I had ordered for bacon wrapped tiger prawns, paprika and lemon roast chicken and cucumber berry soda. Bacon wrapped tiger prawns can give a good contest to some of the best continental restaurants in the country. Chicken roast was average and the chicken was not juicy at all. Drink was very refreshing. Pricing is expensive compared to the quality and quantity. Someone had ordered lamb chops on our table and there was hardly any meat! However, the feel of the restaurant compensates for everything. Do visit this place.

A great place to while away time, when you have some to kill. The ambience is like a Parisian cafe, perfect for a lazy afternoon with your friends or a date. The food is okay, my only complaint being the portions are too small. I plan to go again soon. Please try out the sea food which they offer.

My husband surprised me by tkng me for a dinner on a sunday evening.. we had no idea tht this plc wud b soo occupied.. So had to wait fr the table and we fortunately gt a seat without 20-25 mins.. I loved the ambience, and could easily make out that this was a an old house converted to a restaurant. The restaurant from outside looks like one of the old houses of Kolkata..entering it u will find old antique cameras nd iron in one wall, books nd magazines in another, different mirrors adorning a wall nd the green door with all the door knobs nd locks surrounding it was really v pretty.. The tables were neatly laid out with the large grandfather kind of chairs..the staff was prompt nd friendly. As far as food is considered i guess i had one of the bestest pizza n the bestest blueberry cheese cake along wid a chickn starter which was mouth watering too..a higly recommended place... Me waitng to visit this awesum plc once agn!!

The corner courtyard.... a house on the corner of a road just off the Hazra road - Sarat bose road crossing. A beautiful white building, which, at one glance gives you a feel of rich fine dining place. We went there a couple of days after durga puja for lunch. It was a bit late and we had to wait for sometime. As we were waiting, we looked through the very beautiful decorations of that place, a very heritage look was given to the restaurant with some pictures of the same house some 50-60 years ago, giving a retro kinda feel. The ambiance was excellent and the wonderful aroma made our wait difficult.

Once we got our seat, we quickly put out orders... new york style wings, Romanian bacon wrapped prawns

The corner courtyard or TCC is one of my favourite places to eat out in the city. Not only does the ambience take you back to a cozy colonial dining set up, but the food journey is simply divine. For me the mushroom soup was easily forgettable, but the Thai risotto balls so made up for that blandish soup. Expect lots of cheese and a bit of spice. Complete satisfaction for the taste buds.

Next was the pizza, which had a crust that was fine but not wafer like. They are generous with their toppings and the tomato puree on the pizza is fresh and soothes your taste buds. I loved the aubergine main course with baby potatoes and parsley rice. And getting me eat aubergine is not an easy task. You should try this for its mere smokey flavour and the freshness of the veggies.
 
Simply happy post such meals!

Well never seen a resturant with very nice interior decorating in Kolkata. The place is awesome. The music was good.I went there with my friends during Durga Puja. The waiters are polite and kind. They will serve you well. We have ordered only a large pizza and it was the best pizza I had in my whole life till now. Trust me when I tell you that the pizza was far better than ones in Pizza Hut and Dominos. Planning to visit there soon. :D

To start with, the place has a beautiful and serene decor. The cutlery is exemplary with equal standards of food plating. Being a veggie, there weren't as many options for me as my non-vegetarian friends. However, the 3 dishes ordered by me were topnotch (canalloni, tortillas and rissotto). The non veg dishes were brilliantly flavoured making up for the slightly undercooked lamb served. A complete package worth every penny spent. Do visit if rs 1500/-  for dinner for 2 not an issue for you.

Fancy place and a fancy price tag!
I am a sucker for continental food, so this had to be a place for me, had been planning a trip for long so when my bestie suggested we try out this place there was no scope for a second thought!
Considering this eatery to be quite popular and more so being that time of the year (Durga Puja) we decided on reaching there a bit early, so at 1pm when we reach we were surprised to find that it was only us!...
the staff helped us find a nice corner and we made ourselves comfortable, the menu card had been shortened like most of the restaurants in kolkata during pujas to manage the crowd and the delivery time i suppose.
I was a lil dissapointed not to find the famous 'Carribean cooler' in the pujo themed menu card, however since we wer the only people the staff were quite nice and accomodating to specially make it for me..its a coconut water drink with a hint of gondho raaj lebu..quite refreshing and low on calories too! My friend ordered a 'Pink grape fruit lemonade' which had quite a tangy flavour to it..to go along with the drinks we ordered 'Grilled Italian chicken bites with salad caprese and parsley garlic aioli'...it was not quite impressive, the chicken bites wer more like minced chicken kebabs flavoured with garlic, and the aioli was a simple mayo dip.
In the meanwhile the pujo crowd started filling in and within 10 mins or so all the tables were full..we went on to order our main courses ...Pizza : Micheal Angelo chicken delight..no clue of the significance of the name though the pizza itself was absolutely gorgeous to look at and very tasty...fresh spinach , beautifully flavoured chicken and what i strangely liked the most was the sweet n tangy sundried tomatoes, the tastiest so far!
The 2nd dish was 'Parika and lemon grilled chicken with a red wine shallot reduction'..the gravy was one of the best i had so far..most restaurants do not give much attention to the mashed potatoes, however for me here they were the heroes, burnt buttery flavoured mash overloaded with the right herbs..completely lip smacking,
the chicken was tender n well cooked the adjoining elements completely lifted the entire dish from being an average to a classy dish.
My experince being : One in a while we can afford such luxuries!

This is one nice place to eat at!
We were three. We were hungry! We had to wait. For 20 minutes ( apparently, they forgot all about us, even though we were standing right there, and seated two other folks who came in after us :P )

The ambiance was cool! nice way to decorate your walls. 

The food. It was nice to say the least! It was better than what we expected!

We ordered : 

Uruguayan styled crispy calamari ( the squid was a bit rubbery, but the taste was good enough )
Romanian bacon wrapped prawns ( The star of the sho! this was AMAZING! )
Panko and parmesan crusted chicken ( this was tasty, but a bit on the smaller size )
Summer Barbecue chicken with pesto smashed potato ( The chicken was HUGE! The old monk spiked barbecue sauce was pretty whacky, in a good way )
Grilled napoleon lamb meat balls with spaghetti americano and crumbled fetta ( Hits the spot! )

Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse ( delightfully not all sweet! )
Sticky Toffee Pudding ( It was sticky alright! very moist and the ice cream complemented the richness of the pudding very well )
Warm chocolate croissant bread pudding ( not too sweet, real moist. GOOD! )

All in all, the food was amazing! The location was pretty convenient ( near the sarat bose road and the hazra crossing ).

The ambiance was pretty cool and had an old world feel to it.

We were expecting a bill around 5k, but it was only around 3.7k .. so it was cheaper than we expected!

Ambiance : 4/5
Food : 4/5
Cost : 4/5

Would definitely go back, the next time I'm here ( Kolkata, I mean ).
Highly recommended, if your looking for a nice meal to gladden your heart!!

I went here for the first time when I was visiting Cal. Maybe, I went at the wrong time, being puja time but I did think there were certain loopholes that could have been filled in.

The good -
Awesome food, quirky and interesting decor and a delectable menu to select from.

Areas of improvement -
1. The waiters need to know the menu in details
2. When you bring food to a table, you should bring all the food for everyone at one go to avoid the awkwardness of some people eating and others waiting
3. We asked whether the bread basket was complimentary and we were immediately given one and realised it is chargeable only when the bill came.

Anyway, like I said it is puja time and I would like to give them a chance at another time.

Watever I write will be less in terms of the ambience, decor and food that transported me to a different world altogether. I had heard of this place a long time back but never really made it until yesterday. The restaurant from outside looks like one of the old houses of Kolkata..entering it u will feel a bygone charm with old antique cameras nd iron in one wall, books nd magazines in another, different mirrors adorning a wall nd wow to the green door with all the door knobs nd locks surrounding it..felt like having dinner in a mueseum. The tables were neatly laid out with the large grandfather kind of chairs..the staff was prompt nd friendly.
 Now coming to the food..IT WAS AWESOME..the taste and the presentation..u should try the romanian bacon wrapped prawns and grilled italian chicken bites for appetizers. .tasted heavenly. For mocktails u can try the papaya muskmelon ginger twist (the name might not tintilate ur taste buds but believe me the drink will definitely) or Affogato al cafe (upper layer cold nd bottom hot!) Or watermelon feta mango powder..roasted mango twist nd carribean cooler with bengal lime is so-so. 
For the main course try the pizza con pollo..roasted pimento nd mozarella stuffed Mediterranean chicken or the baked fish with lemon sauce nd mashed potatoes..
The restaurant may seem a bit expensive bt its worth the food nd experience..

The Corner Courtyard was on our list for a long time. One fine weekend, we set out. The beautiful building in itself is so heart warming. Beautiful, pristine decor. Ample sitting space. Nicely done tables. 
The staff was very helpful and cheerful.
There was a nice mix of oldies and young crowd. The food options I felt could be more for the Non-veg (poultry) main course. Would be delighted if pork dishes (barring the bacon ones) are introduced.
 
All in all a good experience!

My first and the only visit to TCC was on the occasion of my best friend's birthday.The sole reason for landing up here was the decor! its a treat in itself ^_^
we directly ordered for the mains which included-

ROASTED PIMENTO AND MOZARELLA STUFFED MEDITTERANEAN CHICKEN : this was the first dish to hit the table..n bang on!! from the flavours to presentation, its a topscorer of everything i had there.the pesto mash was incredibly done, and along with the garlic spinach ciabatta pouch, the dish was delish. highly highly 6recommended.

PAPRIKA & LEMON GRILLED CHICKEN WITH SHIRAZ RED WINE SHALLOT REDUCTION : even this was good as the previous one.spring onion mash & buttered vegetables were also delectable. worth high recommendations as well.

GRILLED SOUTH AFRICAN PERI PERI TIGER PRAWN SKEWERS : this was a downfall,the prawns were succlucent enough,but the curry paste like flavour spoilt it. the baby potatoes were plain boiled & lacked seasoning. the herb rice was rather good. disliked the only prawn item on the menu!

BAKED FISH WITH BURNT GARLIC AND MUSTARD DRESSING : i loved the smell of the fish, fresh and well baked, tasted similar to homemade bhekti paturi(with mustard sauce and bhetki ).the warm bean salad was equally yumm.

a word of caution: do not order more than 1 main course per person initially,as they are very filling.

the only con i felt was the service time was pretty long. At such premium rates, one expects a more efficient service & one thing more, as some of the best places in town add some complementaries for special occasions, like birthdays or anniversaries, with anything...a bag of chocolates or a brownie or a complimentary dessert, TCC should also come up with such ideas,to add a personal touch to the celebration of these special days of the guests.

N i must add,valet parking is an add on..
Cheers :)'

Went to the famous Mediterranean restaurant with my family, on Dad's birthday..
The moment we entered through the doors.. We found ourselves in a beautiful ambience.. The perfect "boutique" experience.. Right from the beginning the staff were extremely courteous, and found us a nice cozy spot..
We started off with their recommended Grilled Italian Chicken Bites, with a sumptuous dip of parsley garlic aioli.. Tasted really good..
The main course, we took, were, Panko and Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Grilled Atlantic Salmon, Paprika and lemon grilled chicken and finally, Summer Barbeque Chicken.. 
Each of these tasted heavenly and we could find nothing to criticise..
The heavy main course left us with no option but to forfeit the deserts..
However, our server told us that one plate of Atlantic Salmon would be enough for two.. That was not the case, and we found out that one plate was just enough for one.. Because of that, we had to order another one, which was a little inconvenient.. 
However, the food did not disappoint us, and would like to visit more in the future, and hope for a little better communication from staff..

I vote this as one of the most elite places that I've been to in Kolkata. Not only the finger licking food but the fascinating vintage interiors are also an added attraction to me. Though this place is close to me for reasons beyond food, but to pamper your appetite on a lazy afternoon, the restaurant would be an awesome choice!

Well , after coming to know the chef behind this restaurant had worked under Marco Pierre White !!!! it was a no brainer to rush to it as soon as possible , and the rave reviews also helped in raising the expectations . I will try to give an honest review of my first visit here :

Ambience : Somehow I felt claustrphobic , I have  never been a fan of restaurants having partitions . It is soothing though and kind of gives the motility of  being in a nice French cafe .  

Service : Decent , but the waiters did not seem to be knowledgeable about the food that they are serving , and despite my request to cook my food at minimal oil I was largely disappointed when it came with a thick layer of oil . 

When I wanted to know what spices went into a certain dish one of them told me it was not spicy XD !! Since the waiters are the bridge between the chef and a diner , I guess having knowledgeable waiters who would be able to take personal requests is a must .May be  I am sounding a bit cynical but I guess it is not wrong to expect the best when it comes to a place which is trying to set the standards at par with the best in the world .

Food :  I was a tad disappointed with the minimal selection of meat - no duck , beef or veal . Even the lamb section had just two options . And most of the dishes in the main section are ones which do not require delicacy or long hours to prepare .
I had ordered polenta stacks with ratatouille and NY chicken wings . The polenta stacks along with the ratatouille was decent enough and the presentation was also pretty nice . The chicken wings was a bit disappointing - the barbeque sauce was too sticky for my liking and very heavy and unfortunately it was swimming in a sea of oil ( despite my request of cooking it in minimal oil . I had ordered creme brulee as desert , and I expected more - serving the creme brulee in the same ramekin in which it has been baked is a big let down , as one does not get to see the beautiful contrast of the soft velvety texture at the bottom and the glass like crust at the top , also I was expecting it to be accompanied with rhubard or dried apples or something , it was just a very basic creme brulee . Desserts for me are the pièce de résistance of any meal , so I was expecting something more . Also unfortunately the dessert section was very limited .
 However ,  it would be extremely naive on my part if I comment about the quality and taste of food based on a single visit .
Another thing that I would like to point out is - the portions are HUGE !!!  With respect to this , I have one thing to say - less is more .

Will I visit again : Ofcourse . There are not many restaurants who are trying to cater to a niche palate in Kolkata , so I would be missing out big time if I make up my mind on a single visit .

Expectations : I really want to be wowed the next time I visit  - how about a couple of select specials which would also have  liquid  nitrogen  ?? Price is never a problem when one is thinking of fine dining .  It is an ambitious beginning and I hope Corner Courtyard will help in educating a lot of people when it comes to global cuisine . Here's to wishing all the very best for turning a new leaf as far as fine dining is concerned in Kolkata .

This place is a must visit if you are an experimental foodie.. A beautifully decorated place with a cosy ambience and it boasts about a different menu...
The crab meat cake and chicken satay is a must try... Even the main course platters are delicious and the garnishing makes the dishes appear more delicious.. 
If you are in to satisfy your sweet tooth definitely try the sticky toffee pudding that they serve.. 
All in all its a great place to satisfy your experimental side with some extraordinary dishes...

Two reasons why the rating is low: 

One quite poor first impression. The manager just informed the route to our seat and not showed us the seat. Even the cheapest and the worst of hotels have the etiquette to treat the guests well. 

Second, quite expensive considering what we get there. I can have similar stuffs at spaghetti kitchen/Cafe Mezzuna (Margarita Pizza and Mocktails) or Amigos (The Apple Crumble) at the same price and a better taste. 

French Onion Soup is a must have here. Overall, cuisine was average, but not good. However, I have veggies only, so this comes from me. Am sure the delightful delicacies in the non-veg department might be good. The server was quite good and he tried his best to attend us properly. 

I would say, if you have a lot of money to spend in a classy ambiance and if you are unlucky like us and do not mind being shown the route to the seat, then do visit The Corner Courtyard.

This place had been on my wishlist ever since it started. On my last visit to Calcutta, I visited TCC for lunch with a friend. The first look of this milky white building had won half my heart. The ancient architecture of the building had been preserved well which was a perfect set for a heritage boutique hotel.
The interior of the restaurant is warmly done, with white walls, wooden furniture and a wall filled with metal door knobs/knockers. The beautiful décor had increased my appetite multi-folds. 

We ordered Romanian Bacon Wrapped Prawns for appetizer and Caribbean Cooler with Bengal Lime for drinks. One portion on the prawn starter contained 5 pieces of juicy prawns wrapped in generous slices of crispy bacon. The taste was wonderful, the prawn was perfectly cooked and went well with the thousand island dip. The Caribbean Cooler was an exquisite combination of tender coconut water and bengal lime or gandharaj lemon. 

For main course we ordered a portion of Grilled Peruvian Fish topped with Cajun spiced crabmeat. Since we had walked in after a heavy breakfast, the portion seemed enough for 2 of us. The fish was a perfect delight. Soft, melt in the mouth texture of the fish, with lightly spiced crabmeat sauce, this dish was a winner.

Dining at TCC was a wonderful experience, and I would definitely visit again soon.

Elegant dining with very good Italian food in an interesting old Bengali house turned into a hotel cum restaurant. Here, do not take this as a fall out scepting over how an old Bengali house would look as an Italian restaurant...they have perfected it. Parking at Sarat Bose Road would have been a big hassle however, they have enough valet service...

I had a perfect afternoon, a long, lazy meal with two of my besties, who I met after a long time. I won't spend time raving about the decor, which is lovely, just that the space felt cosy and bright and added to the mood of bonhomie. 

The best thing about the place was the service. Pleasant, unobtrusive, prompt, helpful. A smile in welcome and farewell makes all the difference and quite hard to find in Kolkata for some mysterious reason.

The food was just so, a menu that piques your curiosity and dishes that are a lovely surprise. Portions are decent.
The fig salad we had was perfect - a light yet flavorsome dressing, a medley of textures, together packed a punch. The bacon prawns were yum! The cheese trio turned out to be a crostini with melted spicy cheese, making the list of cheeses on the menu superfluous, was expecting a cheese platter of some sort, the onion balsamic(?) reduction could be more generous. Still yum. Wish there was a bigger selection of non vegetarian pastas.

My birthday lunch with friends was memorable , the conversation flowed and we lingered over the coffee and those lovely little macarons, just the perfect touch of sweetness to end a great meal.

My first visit to TCC was totally unplanned. It was a dinner date with my friend. I was thoroughly impressed by the decor and ambiance. Who wouldn't be! Anyway i won't go into details here, because every visitor needs to feel it for himself/herself. We were a bit full after a heavy lunch, so decided to share a single dish in each course. And i was happy to notice the serving to be plenty for two. We ordered "Grilled chicken satays with kafir infused apple and red cabbage chutney with sweet chili balsamic dressing" for starter. The long and exotic sounding name totally does justice to the food. The satays (five in number) were perfectly cooked and the chutney was simply delicious and so was the dressing. Next we ordered "Paprika and lemon grilled chicken with a Shiraz red wine reduction, spring onion mash and buttered vegetables." I was too happy with the dish. We rounded the dinner off with one creme brulee. The caramel crust was perfect in color and texture and so was the centre. To me it tasted so good that i decided then and there to take my boyfriend back just to taste the creme brulee.

So i went back two days later with high expectations, in time for HIGH TEA. We ordered two Earl Greys along with one plate of "Butter croissant filled with omelette, dressed with tomato, cucumber and leafy lettuce served with wedged potatoes and tossed salad on side", one plate of "day breaker slices of club delight chicken sandwich..." and a plate of "pancakes with whipped cream and maple syrup" followed by a creme brulee. 
I must add here that this particular visit didnt turn out good. The Earl Greys were as they should be, though i would have preferred lemon with it. The sandwich and croissant were as huge as their names. They were infact the only two good things i ate there that day and yes they definitely were pretty good and VERY filling. :) 
But after that it was a down-slide. The pancake was in one word, horrible. it tasted all wrong. there was a weird medicinal taste to it. the maple syrup was equally poor. i could have managed the dish if there had been an ample amount of good cream on the plate. But the cream serving was very meagre. i left half of the pancake untouched. the creme brulee was also not up to the mark. The waiter caramelized the sugar infront of us with a  blow torch and he over did it, the caramel crust was very thick and too hard. the custard base which is supposed to be gooyey and melt in your mouth had turned a bit grainy. But me being partial to creme brulee shouldnt complain too much

Over all my TCC experience has been good. The food was good in taste(i am trying to forget that mishappen pancake :/ ), and presentation. The waiters are well knowledgeable about what they are serving and courteous. I plan to return, hoping there wouldn't be any lapses in their part where the quality of food is concerned.

After all the hype and brouhaha this courtyard had generated we were real excited to visit the white grandiose place by a corner at Sarat Bose Road.
My friend had not even stepped out of the car when a guy came up and asked us whether we had any reservations… On answering it in negative he was bold enough to ask us to leave right away… it was only when we said that we had no idea that reservations were supposed to be made beforehand that another guy informed us that it might take about 45 minutes.

We were okay with that as well and we were called in way before 45 mins. We were blown over by the décor inside. It was astounding. Cozy yet bright, the interior showed mark of an excellent choice. But that’s about it. Everything good about the place ends right about there. 

The waiters were of practically no help when asked about the dishes and what their specialties are.
The appetizers of Crab cakes looked real good and tasted well enough…but the portions were small and unfulfilling.
The main course consisting of panko and parmesan crusted chicken escallop and paprika and lemon grilled chicken was good. But the grilled South African peri peri tiger prawns just had no taste. It failed to satisfy your taste buds…it was supposed to be spicy (atleast that was what was promised to us by the waiter) but it just felt bland and tasteless lumps.Even the potatoes were not seasoned enough. Was so horrified with it, that when they agreed to replace the dish I had no guts to gobble the same dish anymore and went with the safer bet being the panko and parmesan crusted chicken escallop(which is a cheaper dish,although we had to finally pay for the prawns only) .

Nobody cares to refill your glass of water once its finished. We were asked to order before 3.30pm as the kitchen was supposed to close down by that time but when we were asking to place our order nobody bothered to turn up. 
They just kept us waiting.

It had a lot of good points. We had high hopes. But just too many negatives on the very first day have disappointed us immensely. Won’t be able to recommend this to any of my friends ever.

So I visited 'TCC' after much pestering from the wife to try out. My experience there was rather mixed though. We had visited for an after dinner snack so we called for a burger and an appetizer plus a dessert. The good bits are that the burger was excellent. The patty was soft and crumbly, the taste was lovely and the bread was light and airy. The salad on the side was different with herb baby potatoes and fresh greens and tasted lovely but thats where the best part ended. The poor bit was the crab cakes. They were very dry and a little heavy handed on the lemon grass flavour. It masked the natural flavour of the crab completely. Then came the creme brule. The theatrics of seeing the sugar being freshly caramelized with a blow torch was nice but when served, the center was a little burnt and the sides still grainy. The top layer had also curdled maybe because of the heat, but all was forgiven since the creme itself was excellent.
The real issue however was the slow service. I had to get up to call the waiter who was on the other side of the restaurant and nobody really came to ask how was the food and experience (its the little things that matter). That said, I liked the cozy feel yet rich decor and ambiance.

Food: 3 for taste (maybe just a matter of what I ordered) but 4 for presentation.
Ambiance: 4.5
Service: 3
Value for Money: 3. At 1300 for 3 dishes that were good but flawed is way toooo much.

I feel another visit may do justice but not just yet.

I've been to this place a number of times. It's the best place at Calcutta. I recently went there for breakfast and I was highly impressed by the great service and irresistible food. It's amazing. The spread is wide and the food is delicious. The environment is soothing too. I would advice everyone to try this place at-least once because it's worth spending that much of money! I have found a wonderful place where you can see the presentation of the foods as well as the taste buds.......

Walked in on a Sunday afternoon without delving into any reviews or feedback. The first     site was pleasing and endearing considering the fact that an old Bengali mansion has been metamorphosed into a fine dining space with its old worldly charm intact. It seemed a nice escapade from the city hustle and provided a sweet sojourn into the romanticised Bengali ardour camouflaged into bohemian bonhomie. The staff was courteous yet not Pricky and pedantic. The menu is quite sumptuous and cover a wide variety of delicacies and finger foods. We restrained ourselves to the regular 2 course affair consisting of a starter and 2 main course items. The cutlery, presentation, serving effused minute detailing and through supervision. The soulful music added to the serenity of the place. The starter was a chicken delicacy which was well made and spoke highly of the chef's culinary creativity. One of the main course was a fish preparation which also scored highly with our gastrointestinal expectations. However the burger was a big let down. The patty was too stuffed and the spices were too heavy on the pallet. Considering the earlier standards set, it damped our spirits to a certain extent. Nevertheless a sublime experience and a resplendent get way for foodies who crave for an overall experience rather than just binge over food.

So I am reviewing this after my third visit to the Corner Courtyard. In todays fairly competitive market thats a lot.

The food as before was excellent. We ordered the following:

1) Chefs Mediterranean Salad - this was not great. the last time we had had much better salads in the Watermelon salad and the roasted beet roots salad.
2) Soups - did not order this time but had called for the french onion previously which was great.
3) Tangy Thai Risotto balls - this was a nice concept and we liked the taste overall. the papaya salad served alongside lacked a punch and crispiness that the dish needed and this probably was supposed to provide.
4) The Spinach,zucchini and ricotta stuffed cannelloni was nice. but there was close to zero zucchini. However as a spinach and ricotta cannelloni the dish was nice.
5) The Grilled Jalapeño flavoured polenta stacks was the dish of the day for me. The slight crispiness to the polenta from the grill, the jalapeño flavours along with the ratatouille was great. I only felt a little more sauce/mash was needed alongside.

Unfortunately for me the desserts were a let down as the creme brûlée and the toffee pudding i wanted to try were both out. 

All in all it is a place that I have gone to three times now after having had a disastrous 1st visit and that I guess says it all.

As I used to pass down Sarat Bose Road my eyes always went towards this place The Corner Courtyard. Though I never visited but recommended it to my friends but about three months ago I entered the place and was completely bowled over with its decor the ambiance and the food. The warmth of the people serving us projected the old house charm which is the decor. Please this place is must for the people in Kolkata and also for the people visiting Kolkata.

The moment I entered this white building I knew I was carrying a lot of expectations from the place, riding high on all the reviews. The very 1st thing that made us happy was valet parking, it was an extremely rainy day and such help was necessary. On entering the decor blew me away. We were seated at a cozy table for two right opposite a wall full of quirky decorations. The lighting could have been a little brighter. The waiters were nice and friendly and helped us with the orders -the Roasted Mango Twist was nice like a green mango punch but the Watermelon Feta Mango Powder was something I have never tasted before and in a wonderfully unique way. The crab cakes were perfect after a long time and the Romanian bacon wrapped prawns were as delicious as they looked. Some thing very important that i noticed they do not compromise on the food portions - and on an average its quite a lot for 2 people. And therefore I suggest the waiters help with this. Because what came next is linked with it. For Mains we ordered the Paprika and Lemon grilled chicken with red wine reduction which was on the spicy end and the Summer barbecue chicken which was more mellowed in taste. The former was perfect, but the latter was a medium sized whole chicken and when it arrived the thought that 1st struck me was 'omg how will I  finish that!' Therefore a heads-up is necessary from next time. We finished with a sinful blueberry cheesecake. My overall experience was fantastic, one of the best places for fine dining. A 9.5 out of 10 for everything. Come here for amazing taste, very artful way of presenting dishes (yes food photographers delight), come for the ambiance. Everything is perfect!

TCC was a big bummer for me, food and hospitality wise. I have no complaints about the decor, which is really much appreciable and quite unique. But the appreciation ended there itself. The staff are really not much friendly, and they seemed utter confused and ill informed. We waited for almost 20 minutes after being seated for water to be served. We had to remind them every 5 minutes, and they would just nod their head and disappear. I read in one of the reviews that they were told by the staff that there were not enough glasses to serve water???!! Really, i do think that might be a genuine case, since the problem is persistent. Secondly, since we had a pregnant friend with us, who had hunger pangs due to the waiting period (which was almost 25 minutes), we requested one of the staff if at least they could serve the nachos from their appetizer section (as we thought that would be faster), but he said that would take a lot of time, and suggested us something that came after almost 30 minutes. We had to order garlic breads in between. And the funniest part is, when we got impatient and enquired another staff why it was taking so much time, he casually said, that we should have ordered nachos if we were that hungry, it would be delivered in no time. We were aghast!!. The main course menu was not really impressive for non-vegetarians like us. It perhaps mainly caters to the vegetarian clientele. The two fish dishes that we ordered were really not impressive. They had a distinct fishy smell, which was quite obnoxious. The staff were pretty confused initially about the two chicken dishes that were ordered, as they couldn't identify the one from the other, and we had to use our taste bud and intuition to make out which could be what. 
Really for that much premium price, I do not think it is worth the experience and would be a one time go. Kolkata has much better options than burn a hole here and have an ordinary experience.

Finally this place is from wishlist to been there, thanks to a friend and her sister. It is round the corner near hazra-lansdowne crossing.
The place from outside looked pretty classy. The decor inside is like a old house very smartly furnished, spacious and music seemed lil loud between the conversations.
We ordered Fondu, which was not the traditional style but the cheese dip served was really yummm.
Next the pizza, thin crust and yummy topping.
Last was Cannelloni, again nicely made cherry tomato and garlic sauce topped on perfectly baked cannelloni. 
Superb food..Being a vegetarian had lot of options.
Place is pricey but worth for its food once in a while.

So firstly thanks to bf for taking me here. This place was on my wish-list for a LONG time, and all thanks to foodie boyfriend who made sure I visit this place before I die. 
This place was just perfect ! Food , ambience , service , everything. 
It was raining when we got here and to top it all it wasn't much crowded so I had my sweet time romancing until food came and then I forgot my boyfriend  
Because I die over oink (pork) we started with oink appetiser. 
We ordered Romanian bacon wrapped prawns with thousand island dressing and seasonal salad. 
~ this was really good , the bacon wrap was juicy and the dressing and the salad finely complimented the dish. Although I thought it could have been better 
Then for main course, we went for paprika and Lemon grilled chicken with Shiraz red wine shallot reduction , spring onion mash and buttered veggies. And garlic bread. 
~ no complains at all from this particular dish. It was PERFECTLY cooked. 
Then came the bliss ! The blueberry cheesecake. Trust me when I say this, one of the BEST cheesecakes I've EVER had ! The bill was around 2000 which wasn't bad at all.

It's classy :) the first time I went there I was very pleased with the service and the food too! we odered for risotto balls which was amazing, a grilled chicken pizza which was well done and a oreo pancake which was too good! The next time I visited this place I was not very happy with the service... the person who took our order seemed wierd and casual! we odered for a tomato mozzarella cupcake which was good and a baked fish... I somehow did not like the baked fish..m probably the flavours dint suit me! Then I odered for a chocolate mouse which was good too :) so overall a satisfactory experience is what I had!

Surely, its one of the best restaurants that has come up in the city...
As soon as you enter the place, there's a nice vibrancy in the whole atmosphere, and while leaving, you would surely think of revisiting the place :)
Me and my friend went for dinner, and the wide range of menu was absolutely a delight for a foodie like me.
We started off with trio cheese chili medley, that seemed absolutely out-of-the-world!!! It was like a crunchy bite of cheese, that had a light tinge of garlic taste.
Then we ordered grilled Italian chicken bites with caprese salad, and panko-parmessan chicken escallop. Both of them were absolutely perfect, and filling s well.... for dessert we had choco-hazelnut mousse... 
Its a must try place, and though its a bit expensive, indulging yourself once is not a bad deal. 
Happy Eating :)

My sister discovered this place on Zomato and seven of us immediately drove down to try this restaurant for my cousins farewell party. Before I move on to the nitty-gritties, I must first make it clear that I absolutely LOVED The Corner Courtyard and  I would have given it a 5 had it not been for a couple of mistakes on the part of the restaurant that will come in the detailed analysis. In case you  want to skip the in-depth report, I suggest just go for this lovely place and have a great time!

First Impressions: Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed with the look of the restaurant. Ethnic and classy is what comes to mind. Along with the look comes the practicality of Valet Parking.

Decor: Simply amazing. Especially the wall with the doorknobs as well as the oversize cutlery pieces hanging on the walls.

Menu: Now comes the good part. Simply amazing spread with a plethora of options. Yeah you need to learn a bit about the different types of cheese and sauce to get the hang of it but the waiters are very helpful in this regard. I suggest having numbers along with the dishes as the names are long. This poliy is followed by Big Chill in Delhi who have equally long dish names :) :)

Starters. We ordered the Grileld Chicken Souvali Skewers and we loved the soft chicken with not a single bit of charred carbon particle. The salad and sauce accompanying this was also very nice. It is definitely a nice dish to try out.
Next we ordered Ricotta and Sundried Tomato Stuffed Mushroom Cupcakes and they were also very nice. The trick is to take the entire dish in your mouth and then feel the taste.
Next came the OPUS MAGNUM of the chef, IMHO of course, the Romanian Bacon Wrapped Prawns. Its been a week since I visited the restaurant and I can still feel the taste. The crispy feeling of bacon infused with the soft prawns and the intermingling of the two smells is sure to take you to heaven for a few seconds. This speciality is a MUST TRY!!!

Main Course: Some of us ordered Panko and Parmesan Crusted Chicken... and I found that to be tastier than the other dishes that we ordered. It was crisp and fresh and smelled great. THe accompanying veggies and the sauce was also very tasty.
I ordered Paprika and Lemon grilled chicken... and I enjoyed my dinner. The chicken breasts were thin which helped in the infusion of the flavors and good cooking.
Others ordered Roasted Pimento and Mozarella Stuffed Mediterranean CHicken. It was good but NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Herein lies my problem. Firstly, the sauce it tasted a bit like pav bhaji which I could have eaten outside. Secondly, the Mozarella was missing or almost non-existent. This was confirmed by my sister the foodie, chef and lover of cooking shows. Thirdly, they ended up providing some other ingredient and mixing up the orders. So I was not satisfied with this particular dish.

NEGATIVES: You DO NOT mix orders and forget the Mozarella cheese in a dish that cheese lovers order specifiaclly for the Mozarella in the dish. This might have been because the waiter was relying on memory alone while taking the order bu t I might be wrong

Behvaiour of waiters: Absolutely amazing. Very curt and helpful. Special thanks to Mr. Rozario for all the hospitality and also taking in my jokes about Bangasree Roll Center outside being a better option. The gatekeepers were also very nice and helped us out by clicking our group photograph

POCKET PINCH: Oh it pinches. 6475 is a nigh number for 7 people that comes to INR 925 per head. But you gotta pay for all the decor I guess. Kolkata ain't the cheap food haven anymore. I suggest going in a group so that you can try various dishes sine if you go alone and order three dishes it will pinch you hard.

The Corner Courtyard is a nice place to visit with a  fine ambiance. I went to this place  around 6PM to have our weekend chitter-chatter. At that  time, it was drizzling outside, so we decided to go inside this joint, this joint looked elegant from its outside decoration  which is visible from the main road. I liked it because it is free from the daily hustle- bustle of Kolkata, rather calm and serene. Their sitting arrangement is classy and cozy which will make you relaxed. 

We decided to have The Five Dollar ( a type of milkshake),Hot Chocolate and The Simpleton ( from Cake section). As far as quality is concerned, it is pretty good, but, the Simpleton could have been a bit better, in my opinion. Their way of presentation is catchy. The staffs were good. Our total bill was Rs.481 with VAT and Service Tax.

This place was recommended to me by quite a few friends, especially for its unique decor. And truly once you enter this place you will rendered speechless. Those who remember this place 4-5 years ago there was an old near dilapidated house. Now there stands one of the most uniquely and brilliantly decorated restaurants of Kolkata, with plans for starting a guest house soon.
From décor to cutlery to crockery, the place is designed to surprise you. The menu boasts of a variety of dishes all of which look extremely appetizing. However, for people like me who dig red meat, this will be kind of a let-down. The place only serves 2 dishes of lamb (Spaghetti with meat balls and a steak with red wind reduction). 
One of the biggest turn off for me is when I enter a place that charges a premium and does not provide me proper service. We were starved and as soon as we entered we ordered Garlic Bread and Chicken Skewers. To our surprise the bread came before we were served water. Even after asking for water twice we didn’t get any. Only when we refused to place any further main course orders till we got water, the waiters started to pay attention. Finally we were told that there was some issue regarding enough glasses. We finally were served water 15-20 minutes after we entered
The menu was surely impressive the food was surely not. We tries 3 kinds of fishes, all of them were stinking a bit. The whole chicken (though eventually a half chicken was served) with a red wine reduction was a disaster. The sauce was burnt. However, my friends suggested that this was most probably it was an off day, since on other occasions the food (same dishes) was very good.
Though I did not have a good experience, I would definitely like to give this place another shot.

Tcc is the first of its kind in Calcutta. Elegant and classy interiors with hospitable staff make it a pleasure to visit. And of course the great food. The unique ingredients and interesting combinations bring me back. Gone there 4 times and always had something different, and always loved it.

Eggplants which I always hated is mind blowing here :) The thin crust pizzas are delicious and on request half of 2 kinds can be ordered. The new menu has many more options for a vegetarian like me. And the summer coolers here are so rarely found.

They have 7 rooms themed on Calcutta and the staff always is courteous to show around. Always a great experience. Highly recommended.

Don't know what all the fuss is about this restaurant. I went there a few days ago and I thought the food was extremely confused. Each dish has so many different elements in it ( and it could easily do with half of the ingredients present in them) so the combinations between different ingredients could not be felt in the palate. One of the salads had two different kinds of fruits, two different nuts, different salad leaves, onion, tomato, beetroot. Just unnecessary. Their pesto pizza was topped with chickpeas which was definitely a bold call but not a good one. The concept of cheese fondue is mainly béchamel sauce with cheese added to it. It is not authentic European food. It had a massive Indian twist to it and maybe a bit too much.  As a vegetarian I would not recommend this restaurant.

You know those times when you really crave for italian or continental and find no place to quest your desire? Well that happened to me today. By FOOD's grace I found this restaurant. 

First things first, what drew my attention was the simplicity and powerful elegance that the restaurant  portrayed- an Old Calcutta House, preserved and restored to its  glory and grace. Its pleasing, heart-felt, warm environment gave me, a foodie, all the assurance I needed. I was impressed by the way they blended two age old concepts- "Old is Gold" and "New is better"- into one fabulous cocktail of fun, pleasure and Joy. The manner in which they have renovated this place makes you want to admire it.

THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is the quality of the food. I ordered Pizza puttanesca which was an 8 piece thin crust pizza that melted in your mouth , giving your taste buds a joyful ride of raw flavours of tomato, cheese, oregano , garlic and olives. As my friend said, it was a 'chumeshwari' food :p.

Unfortunately I didn't have the time to try anything else. But I do plan to visit the place again soon. Overall, TCC has left a long lasting effect on my mind. I have already referred it to few of my foodie friends. It is a class apart restaurant that has definitely earned my loyalty towards it.

The food is good , menu changes a lot so dont really know what i ate is still there in the menu , but over all the place serve good food .

The risotto balls , caesar salad , mushroom with filling, pasta and pizza is good . Also try the tortilini in red sauce and ask the chef for pan tossed mushrooms brusseta.
   

You can even order the cupcakes from rogue kolkata , that they serve here.

The soup of the day is not that bad.

Fancy decor and fancy prices. You'd expect quite a lot from a place like this. However, despite there being some highlights (I am thinking of you, desserts - pannacotta & crème brûlée were great) there were just a few too many obvious misses for me to feel very excited about the place.  

The table was served at varying times, meaning some people had their food way ahead of others. Pizzas were horrible quality (how dare you sell me a pizza for 400+ and use processed cheese?), and what was basically coconut water for 200 Rs not only feels overpriced but ridiculous. If I'd go back, I'd have the risotto which was probably the best risotto I've tasted in India.

In summary, more style than substance with a few (very) bright exceptions, and the best thing about the place is that they've restored and maintained an old house keeping its character intact - a rare thing in Kolkata where old houses are disfigured to suit the needs of snazzy "modern looking" restaurants & cafés.

The Corner Courtyard dinner was sheer happiness. I do not know from where to start… right from the very concept of a boutique hotel , valet parking facilities ,amazing interiors ,courteous staffs and to top it all gorgeous food … TCC ticks all the boxes and sends you back enriched and at awe ! We were there for a holi dinner .. and ordered some coffee before we plunged into the gustatory roller coaster ! Though the coffee  was very average and a few savoury options that we wanted were not available it hardly mattered. We ordered 
	Jamaican grilled chicken with jerk butter and tropical salad  
	Grilled bhetki with miso glazing 
	Fondue
	Banofee pie…………………. AND LOVED everything !    The plating deserves a special mention too. Overall a must visit for all the food lovers of Kolkata 

The Corner Courtyard at Sarat Bose Road, is an outstanding restaurant with great food aesthetics. I went on a dinner date with my guy and it was our first time visit to that place. If there's anything like 'love at first sight ' then that's what we felt when we went to Corner Courtyard. A perfect blend of Classy, elegant , and romantic ambience. The food is excellent and worth the money. Quality and quantity is a top notch. It is a must visit for everyone especially if you are going for a romantic date. We will surely be visiting courtyard soon and now its been added to our favourite restaurant list. I hope they keep up the great service and food.

We have been hearing about The Corner Courtyard for sometime and wanted to visit the place, which we finally did this week for a family dinner. The experience was absolutely fantastic, the décor, the ambiance, the feeling, the presentation, the food...almost everything had a style and a aesthetic sense to it. It's actually a boutique hotel with lovely rooms too. I had the privilege of taking a tour of the rooms and the open terrace too. Each room is based on a theme and the décor, furniture reminds you of the rich heritage of this lovely city.
The presentation of the food is awesome, with lots of greens and herbs to soothe your taste buds as well as the mind. The servers are knowledgeable and smilingly serve you. They are around when you need them and are very helpful.
The only con, if I may say so, is maybe the place is a little cramped.
Overall, it's a must visit place for food aficionados.

The first best thing about The Corner courtyard is it being a like european restro. The ambience in entirety is a luxury lover's gusto. 

The second best being the quality of food, beverages and dessert served. I am yet to try the elaborate menu spreads at The Corner Courtyard but quite a fan of the pizzas they make. The lamb is soft, juicy with a crispness to the saute vegetables. I like my  stuffed pimento chicken elaborate with pesto mash and spinach pocket sandwich on the side. The blueberry cheesecake was a celebration of festivals on my taste buds. It basically signed off my entire binging perfectly. :)

I love living life king size and that is what the The Corner Courtyard never fails to please me with.


Thanks a lot for this lovely place. Keep it up and cheers..............

Had visited the place for the first time last nite with some friends, the first look, and I was impressed with the decor, The unique feature being the privacy guaranteed due to the separate small rooms and the high ceiling in the central dining room, Now it was the turn of the main reason for us to be there, FOOD, we ordered for pesto pizza,cannelloni,potato rosti,quesadilas, and this is where we were a little disappointed as the pizza was decent but rest of the dishes were not up to the mark. The desserts were a dissapointment as the mousse was a little too thick. To top it we discovered a piece of plastic in one of the dishes, I guess it was on of their off days, would like to give them the benefit of doubt for today and visit once again before I form any opinion about the place.

The Corner Courtyard provides one of the finest dining experiences in the City of Joy.  It is actually a boutique hotel and the ground floor is the restaurant which incorporates the courtyard in the most innovative and lovely manner. 

The ambiance is romantic and classy. I was telling my friend that the ambiance makes me want to acquire poise and grace. I like how they have used an old radio, a cookie tin, cup cake papers, a ladder and other various interesting items as decor.

The servers are smiley and always around when you need them and only when you need them. I give them full marks for not hovering around like servers at some other high end restaurant. They give the diners their space and privacy.

This Saturday, PB2 and me ended up at Corner Courtyard for a weekend brunch. Loved the chalk board at the entrance with the timings written on them.

This was our order.

STARTERS
=======================================
1. Smoked Chicken ,  in a Funky Ceasar Salad.  
                            They also had pomegranate seeds, fresh lettuce, lovely peppers and roasted figs. But what gave the salad that extra notch was the Arugula herb they used and the amazing Salad dressing.
2. Mozarella and Garlic Stuffed Grilled Chicken Bangers.
                              This was also served on a bed of poemgranate salad and was accompanied by a lovely cream cheese dressing which was giving on the side. Full marks for that again.

MAIN COURSE
=============================================
1.  Grilled Bhetki with a Miso Glazing.
                               We were already stuffed after the starters and so decided to order only one main course. It was in one word exquisite. The fish was fresh and soft. You could taste the after effect of the Miso on your pallete. It came with cubed spiced potatos and another salad side which complimented the fish perfectly.

DESSERT
=============================================
1. Mini Choco Love Cup Cakes.
                                   We were full but simply could not leave without trying the dessert. So we opted for the mini choco love cup cakes. Prized at 35 bucks each they are one bite cupcakes. Or in other words one bite of pure chocolate indulgence.

DRINKS
===========================================
1. Watermelon Feta Vitamin Boost
                                   I must mention the drink. The drink had watermelon, basil and mango powder and wait for it, feta cheese. A drink with feta cheese. It was amazing. 

I have deducted the 0,5 marks because I feel they really must incorporate a wine list.

Our bill came to 2200. It is on the expensive side, but it is more than worth it. I plan to visit again soon and try some other delights from their vast menu including their pizzas.

Being my first visit I had gone to CC with really high expectations cause I had heard such great reviews but I guess it was a wrong day for me...When we reached our reservation was not noted down so obviously our table wasn't ready... The person taking the order wasn't fully aware of the menu so cldnt really help with suggestions... And to top it off and kill my appetite I saw a cockroach crawling on the wall next to where I was sitting. N the food today was just average.

My first visit there with friends  visiting us from US. We ordered 2 starters and 3 entrees. Impossible to rate them in order of excellence. All dishes were great as were the desserts though dessert options are somewhat limited. Their purchasing of seafood is terrific and all items were very fresh.
Will definitely visit again with more friends.
Great ambience as well. Could do with some music.

The Corner Courtyard or lovingly TCC is a boutique hotel housed at 92B Sarat Bose Road. In shades of virgin white, this place is class apart. It can keep you guessing if a woman was incharge of the planning and interiors and mammamia!
That wonder woman is Megha, who has so tastefully done up this place that exudes warmth and love. Eating here is a treat in itself, be it a special day or not TCC can definitely brighten up your gloomy days!
The background scores are mostly classic rock or blues so it compliments the interiors very well.

I had been fantasizing about TCC from quite sometime now and when I finally saw a window of opportunity, I almost pounced on it. It was J's birthday treat. I decided to settle it with a luncheon at TCC.
My stomach clenched with excitement as the cab came to a halt. J and I got down and to our surprise, a magnificent white house stood infront. With a stylish font it read - The Corner Courtyard.
Little flower pots adorn the entrance and the door handle is a bow. This is like a still from your fairytale. I would definitely like meet Ms. Megha and have a small chat with her and yes congratulate her on her fabulous brainchild.

The speciality of this place is the seven different themed rooms in which guests can dine. Because this is a hotel, one can stay back. Though I am from Kolkata, I really do not mind! :D

Immediately as we walked in, we were ushered by a staff who was warm enough to smile and put back the chair for me.
We sat and quickly rummaged our eyes through the entire room. It was B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L 
The famous blue wall with the 3D effect bookshelf was to my right and the wall to my help had the golden locks, keys and hinges.
I sat between awesomeness. J was basking in happiness and his happiness doubled after the menu was presented.

Our order was prompt. The reason being I had already planned the order in my head.

1. Greek chicken souvalaki skewers with crunchy  Arabic slaw and coriander ginger pesto

2. Roasted pimento and mozzarella stuffed mediterranean chicken with grilled garlic spinach in a ciabatta pouch and pesto mash

3. Blueberry Cheesecake

Now, I had already heard a lot about the much famed greek chicken souvalaki skewer and I could not wait anymore. The order was placed within 5-8minutes of our arrival and the first chew into the chicken made my day. The spices were perfect, well seasoned and extremely tasty. Follow it up with the ginger pesto and it becomes even better. It was a pure delight. It was rubbed off clean in about 8 minutes sharp. I craved for more but of course we had the main course left. Now one thing about which I would like to warn all the fellow foodies.
When the food it served, at the first glance you might feel that the quantity is less but my friend wait and do not order in excess for the portions that they serve, can really really fill you up. Something that happened with me.

The maincourse arrived soon enough and I was stunned. Two finely cut out pieces of chicken which had stuffing inside and two ciabatta pouch which had grilled garlic spinach in them. I wondered a while if these could really fill us up and oh boy!

One chicken and bread inside the stomach and I was full. The pesto mas is brilliant and tastes amazing when paired with the chicken. It is also served with a tangy red sauce which has tomatoes and yes this delicacy is just out of the world. I could come back again and again just for the mediterranean chicken. This delicacy is one of their signature dishes which is priced at INR 510/-
Yes, you might cringe at the price but wait till you have it. TCC really knows how to break a notion in no time!

Happy and full with the lunch, I fiddled with the menu because I was not sure if I should order a dessert. But given the fact that I was treating a very close friend, I did not mind.
I had previously ordered for the raspberry cheesecake but due to its unavailability switched to the blueberry cheesecake. The desserts are catered by The Rouge. The blueberry cheesecake was good, nothing to boast about.
Ending the lunch on a sweet note is mandatory for me and the cheesecake was just fine for that matter.

I shall be back very soon for another dose of TCC's crazy luncheon because good food and foodies cannot be separated for long.

Cheers! :)

I am from Delhi.
After seeing this restaurant I was amazed because something like this would probably be a very new concept here in the city.
The ambience is just amazing and the staff is very courteous which goes in perfectly to complement the food which is as mind-boggling as one can expect. The variety of mocktails on the menu and the ability to serve a dish that offers a lasting taste and flavour is just commendable. 
I had a great experience all in all.
P.s. It'd be great if the restaurant could be located somewhere more central. Though as per Delhi standards everything in Calcutta is just a taxi's distance.

I went to this place with my family for dinner last Sunday, which happened to be Holi. I loved the quirky somewhat-victorian-style decor. Though not exactly a rip-off, but you can find similarity with 'Jhaal-Farezi' in this quarter.
Started the meal with coffee, which was ordinary. Then moved on to the appetizers - a fondue and a skewered chicken. While the latter bowled me away, the former had something missing and fell short of being awesome by a mile. 
Now their menu had only one main course option of lamb (others are fish, chicken or veg) but sadly that wasn't available. The waiter directed my attention to another red-meat option from the ancilliary menu, which was priced at a whooping 2000 rupees and hence i chose not to opt for it. Finally ordered  two fish and one chicken main course and all three of them tasted amazing, and looked super-amazing. But then again none of the eggplant options were available, which was a turn-off for me because that is one of the very few vegetarian options i love. 
Now coming to the desserts - there was a pretty show-case right in front of us, filled with drool-worthy cupcakes and what looked like an oreo cheesecake and other things. But when i wanted a cup-cake they said that 'Rouge' is closed for the day and hence the ones on display were not for sale. I didn't mind compromising a little after a nice meal and opted for the cheesecake, and was told that that was stale and again, just for display. Finally had to settle for a moderately good banoffee pie.
However, overall, this place is a must-visit not just for the decor but also for the lovely plating up of the dishes and a good mix of uncommon flavors.

It was a real nice surprise and pleasantly so walking in to this quaint yet eclectic restaurant. The decor and setting are well conceived and that was the highlight of our lunch. We had the following:
1. Caesars Salad. It was their version with crushed tortilla chips and chicken. I prefer mine to be regular...and with bacon. having said so it had its own appeal. 6/10.
2. Thai Red Curry Spiced Risotto Balls. Tasted good. Flavor of the red curry was subtle which was a positive. The accompanying sweet chilli sauce was just right. Overall a 7/10.
3. English Fish & Chips. Well prepared. The batter was good. Good to taste. If only it was not served on the green peas mash. which in itself could have been less sqishy. 7/10 only for the fish.
Service was very average. They need to get this right and quick. It will become a dampener for the VFM.

Had dinner last night at the Corner Courtyard after reading the reviews. The food was between good and okay as my buttermilk chicken was yummy but the paprika chicken was way to dry. Unfortunately the starter came after the main course so the romanian bacon wrapped prawns lost some of their appeal as they were mixed with other flavours but they were tasty. The way the salads were cut and dressed in the main courses showed a lack of care.

The Banofee pie was ordinary and offered none of the luscious enjoyment the desert normally offers. Though in all fairness, the gentleman at the desert counter did try and convincing me to try the chocolate hazelnut mousse and/or the cupcakes!!

What was odd was the waiter who took the order...a style of service more suited to an outlet serving tandoori chicken and butter naan to a non discerning crowd. Given the effort to create the old world charm of the restaurant ......really it was quite odd...not discourteous, just odd.

Lovely ambience ...just wish it was all tied together with service that was more suitable!

At times I seriously feel that generalising taste preferences would be a serious glitch that is observed at most restaurants, especially in Kolkata.Everything havjng tomatoes and spices does not make food great!
This was what I came out with...telling you why..
We ordered a dish(amongst others) names chicken stuffed with mozzarella.No where was it clear on the menu that it would be piled with he most sour topping made of tomatoes and god knows what!Just spoilt the whole preparation.
And for service at a fine dining place with "finer" pricing at least it would be expected that the waitera

The Corner Courtyard is, right now, one of the best fine dining places in town. Period! This is an insanely fabulous place, people -make sure you mark it in your got-to-visit wishlist!
First the decor - clean, innovative and done up so aesthetically (and with so simple and everyday items!). Tables (though some of them were small) are well spaced out. The menu was nicely designed too.
Service and hospitality were top notch - the steward we had explained most details and was always kind enough to get to the chef and give us more details on the sauces and spices used.

The food - was exquisite. It is one if the few places where we could find the chef experimenting with fusion food and combining palates of Middle Eastern, Indian and Far East. Greek Chicken Souvalaki Skewers with the crunchy slaw was the item we ordered for the entree. One bite and we could immediately feed that our evening was going to be great. We had the Turkish Chicken (with Pomegranate couscous) and the Bhetki paired with Wasabi Mayonnaise for the main course. Definitely try at least one of these two. Such innovative fusion of flavours are hard to come by nowadays.

I deducted 0.5 points as the dessert menu was slightly less impact(!) and most of the items in the dessert section were unavailable (including my favourite panna cotta). Also I felt the chicken in my main course could have been a tad softer! Price is slightly on the higher side, but I am okay to  pay this much premium for such a great fine dining experience.!

However, these are minor points - people. You cannot call yourself a Foodie in Kolkata if you have not paid a visit to this place.

OMG - An insane place. Got to visit what i was looking for after such a long time. 
--------------------------------
Brief:
Corner Courtyard - A place where you can chill comfortably and enjoy the luxurious food at competitive prices. 
I had paid a visit to corner courtyard today with one of my friend. Believe me, from entering to leaving this place it was altogether a mesmerising experience. 

The beautifully done interiors with so many show pieces and things which looked damn costly gave altogether an additional look to the ambience as a whole. When i first sat, it was really kind of the steward to explain me what are the various a la carte's about. 

This cafe had been doing good for the society too as they had explained me that there is a fund raising mission led by the famous actor Kunal Kapoor and they had been helping him for the same. When i first entered, cupcakes, cheese cakes and scones made me realise that this is definitely a placed owned by a girl/women. 

However, what impressed me much more was the beautifully designed menu with all the staffs and stewards in proper uniform. Not just that, the hospitality out here was superb. I wanted to have a tour of the whole place and with prior permission of the person in charge i could manage to click various pictures out here. They even have a hotel on the top where people can have their stay as an additional benefit. 
--------------------------------
Food Ordered:

As recommended, i ordered one appetiser item and a main course item. I did not want to go for the usual pizza's as i was bored eating the same. 

1) Green chicken souvalaki skewers with crunchy arabic slaw and coriander ginger pesto- Oh my goodness, what to say about this item. The chicken pieces were succulent and juicy. The slaw was up to the mark but could have been improved much more. The sauce was an icing on the cake. The way the dish was presented to us was melting and mouth watering. I have attached a picture below of the same. 

2) Mediterranean veggies tossed in a pasta( your choice) with sauce (your choice. i chose white sauce) - It was appealing and tempting when arrived. I must give a 5 on 5 on the food presentation. The bread sticks given along with the same had the right amount of garlic and was cruncy. However, the white sauce was not the best i ever had. It could be much better. 

3) Oreo Cheese cake- It was yumm. However, could have been much better. :) 
--------------------------------

Pros:-
1) Valet parking
2) Courteous staffs
3) Good hospitality 
4) Promptness in serving
5) quality food 
6) Presentation of the food is a win win
7) ambience - nothing to say about it. Simply AMAZING.

Cons:-
1) Costly affair.
2) There was a mark on the mirror. Big mark. Which none of the staffs failed to take notice of. I have attached the picture below. 
3) The white sauce was not a great one to bulge in. 

--------------------------------

Summary: 
Food presentation 5/5
Food quality 4.5/5
Food quantity 4.5/5
Hospitality 4.5/5
Ambience 5/5

Costly affair? Little on the higher side as compared to the amenities offered
--------------------------------
Conclusion: A must visit with family. Good place to dine in. Specially for girls. :-) Another visit on my cards definitely. :-) :-)

THE CORNER COURTYARD is right-bang-in-the-middle of the whole Italian/Cuisine Circle of Kolkata, as far as I am concerned.  I mean Waaoow! The decor, the FOOD & the ambiance! Other joints (read CasaToscana, Fire'N'Ice & the likes) better watch out. 
I heard about this place via a friend, read all the reviews on Zomato and this place had been on my Wishlist (on Zomato) for a quite a while. Its actually quite amusing that I had booked a table at CasaToscana for my Valentine's Day Dinner with my wife but ended up landing at the Corner Courtyard. 
Lucky were we, that we took a gamble of going via Sarat Bose Road and it paid off in the form of us getting seats at 8.00 p.m. without a reservation, on Valentine's Day which happened to be a friday! What are the odds? And it proved to be a truly Lovely Experience.
First-off the Decor - As far as I am concerned, its a sight for sore eyes. Not decked-up like the typical restaurant setup. They've tried, and succeeded is my verdict, to create an eclectic yet soothing ambiance. The photos and other hangings on the walls, The overhead Old-is-still-Gold hanging Lamps, the white-out interiors, The mix of upholstery on chairs & tables and the unique way in which they've been nicely jumbled up together, all create a very warm & welcoming atmosphere. 
we wanted to check out the rest of the restaurant but it was filling up so fast that we have kept that aside for our next visit. 

THANK GOD FOR ZOMATO! I had read almost all the reviews for this restaurant and the best thing about reading reviews is that you get a very good understanding of the most important things one needs to know before visiting a New restaurant/cafe .
The location, a good idea of Cost, what to try at your first visit, best time to visit AND most importantly, to Go to a particular joint, at all, or not. 

That being said, let's begin about the food:- 
We were seated immediately as we entered the restaurant. No waiting. A big Plus. 
My wife ordered the Cream of Mushroom Soup (funnily, it's not there on the Menu but our steward was kind enough to mention all the options for soups available.) My wife after  halfway through the soup, (finally!) offered me to try it. Bang ON! the flavors were all right. A very nice and light but packed with flavor soup. 
Although, my wife mentioned,  after half her soup was over that the soup served was just about lukewarm. (but i am overlooking this because the soup itself was bellissimo)
I ordered the Citrus Lemon Grass DRINK (was it twist or blast? can't remember) . Lip-Smacking and actually gives you enough tang of a cocktail without any alcohol in it! And its quite fragrant...only true foodies will understand this. 

Next we ordered the baked mexican potato with cheese and crushed tortilla chips and Gouda cheese! Delicious was this one too! (pardon me for my jumbled english but words got tossed around in my head just thinking about the food!). 
One little suggestion though, please  increase, just by a tad, the use of gouda in the gratin. 
For two people, this was more than an appetizer. Quite filling but at the same time light. 
I would like to mention here, that even this dish was a bit off-temperature. We requested our server to get it re-heated a bit more which they did immediately, and duly apologizing for it as well. 

Next came the extremely difficult decision to choose from a very enticing menu, and after much thinking, we tried the Pumpkin, Mushroom & Spinach lasagna with garlic bread. 
Lovely presentation all round and lip-smacking lasagna, albeit i would've liked a bit more mushrooms, but hey, I'm not complaining . 

Then we thought of ordering something else but our appetites were giving up on us. 
The mind & the heart wanted more, the stomach said STOP! So we decided to place our last order, of dessert. But as luck would've had it, they were already out of Profiteroles & Mousse . It is quite understandable, though,  because of it being Valentine's Day! 
Interestingly they've got a very nice corner displaying all their desserts & serving as a patisserie as well. So after having a look at the available options, I opted for the Banoffee Pie, which was not on the restaurant menu.
 
Anyone who likes bananas will go Bananas over this dessert! For people who don't like this fruit, please try this dessert and your opinion will change about the fruit! A very Lightly whipped-Cream topped over a very nice touch of a slight vanilla-banana fragrance in a crumbly yet soft tart pastry and filled in between with caramelized banana filling! Yummily slurpalicious! That's it!  we could not have anymore, as if all that we ate was LESS! 

GREAT PLACE! INTRIGUINGLY INTERESTING DECOR AND EQUALLY SUMPTUOUS FOOD! GASTRONOMICAL DELIGHT

People, LET me add one of the MOST IMPORTANT points of dining anywhere, whether be it Fine-Dinning or gorging at a Dhaba. 
When you want to have truly good and honest-to-the-menu food, sometimes you have to a little more pocket-pinch! Nonetheless, a pocket-pinch that doesn't hurt too much. The same goes for this place. I, for one won't mind shelling out a few extra bucks for this kind of food, ambiance, service et all! 

'Nuff said! I am definitely going again! very, very soon! 


P.S. I am deducting only 0.5 out of a 5 star rating because of the temperature of the soup and baked potatoes. Sorry!

Whoa !! That is the first thing that came to my mind when I entered the place. The decor, ambiance, the seating. It all just jelled. And yes, this could very well have been a restaurant anywhere in Europe. 

A friend of mine and I had gone in for a Sunday breakfast, and boy were we happy or what ? We found it really hard to decide which dish to order and what to leave out. The options are that tempting. We ended up ordering Pancakes with chopped fruits and honey, Stir Fry Veggies with Cheese Toast and Baked Beans, Fruit Melange with Honey, Hot Chocolate and Maple Syrup. Accompanied by Fresh Juice. The pancakes were the best i have had in this city. The sweetness of honey was just PERFECT ! The quantity of food just right for breakfast. The presentation was just as good as the taste. No complaints whatsoever.

We were really tempted to try some more of the dishes available, but we were already full. But next time. For sure. We will be coming back to this place a lot. Atleast till we have tried ALL the dishes on the menu :)

The staff was very courteous. At the end of the meal, the Manager and the Chef came up to us and asked for the feedback. Which we thought was a very nice gesture. 

I hope they keep up with the good work. 

One thing that we loved was that inspite of the place being on the main road, and cars passing by continuously, there was hardly any disturbance from that. That was also a big plus. 

Looking forward to visiting the place again. It is a must visit for the people of the city, as well as the tourists. It takes you to a different place altogether. Do not miss out on this wonderful experience called "The Corner Courtyard".

Had a lovely time a couple of weeks ago at The Corner Courtyard with my friend Koyeli who was visiting from Pune and her adorable little munchkin Ananya. 

The place has a very calm feel to it. We had ordered the Smoked Chicken 'funky' Caesar Salad and the Margharita pizza. Both tasted absolutely fabulous. The fresh, crunchy lettuce, thin shavings of sweet apples, light dressing and croutons made the salad a delight. The pizza was such a refreshing change from the tasteless, plasticky (not sure about the spelling!) cheese and cardboard bases that we have to endure from popular pizza outlets. The server was very courteous, and Ananya was quite happy with her French Fries and mini cupcakes. 

This is definitely a special place.

I am in kolkata for last one and half month, i really liked your country and  this city, specially the kolkata's rasgolla. last night one of my kolkata's friend took me this place for the dinner, after i enter this place, i really got amazed with interior and atmosphere. suddenly i just felt that i am in my own country neighborhood.
i really like the pizza, it was nicely done thin crust pizza with exact amount of cheese and toppings. as a suggestion it would be more better, if you just make your pizza base little more thicker.
we ordered honey balsamic chicken, which was awesome. from the main course we had grill cashew lemon bhetki and hot shito prawn. it was wonderful.]
when i will be back in india, i would love to see your place again.

we went to this place recently.. its an amazing place.. the inside is cozy and makes me feel like home.. the decor is fabulous.. the staffs are polite and serve neatly.. 

we had the basilico pesto treat, pizza primavera, tokyo styled miso bhetki, turkish grill chicken and oreo cheese cake.
the food presentation was superb, portion wise we felt it was a little extra to us but the taste bud was excellent.
it just felt like my last trip to santorini, greece, europe ...
thank you for making this lovely place in the heart of kolkata..........

Is this place amazing or what????? Very few times you come across a joint that manages to tick all the boxes. As soon as I entered this place for the first time it intrigued me. With cozy nooks and a home style decor this place is unlike any other i have been to. Its like Europe right here in Kolkata.

The presentation on all the dishes is top class and a treat to the eyes.

I have tried a number of dishes here. I tried the cheese fonsue here out of their special menu. It was top class on taste but missed out on the fact that it was not served in a fondue pot but just a soup plate. The stuffed mushrooms on the appetizer list is a must try. The Spaghetti Alio Oglio is some of the best i have had. I have tried the Lemon and Thyme Risotto and the Mushroom Risotto and both were amazing but I must say that i preferred the mushroom one over the lemon and thyme. The Pesto Pizza is amazing and both vegetarians and non- vegetarians must try the pesto version. Even the Pizza Putanesca is amazing for people who like spicy pizzas. The Spinach Gnocchi was also amazing.

The accompaniments to these dishes also deserve a mention. The beetroot salad served with the stuffed mushrooms, the bread served with the fondue, the lavash sticks and herb salads, all are worth a mention and how. 

For desserts they have the whole selection of Cupcakes that is available in Rouge cafe. But my recommendation would be to try the banoffee pie here. 

All in all a great place to visit with family, friends or even that special someone on a romantic date. 2 thumbs up

I went to this place for dinner with two of my friends . The decor and the interior of this place is beautiful . We ordered for a Cheese Fondue , Ceaser salad (chicken) , Grilled Honey Balsamic Chicken  , Mozzarella Cheese and Garlic Stuffed Chicken Bangers , Pizza Salsiccia   and a Butter Cream Red Velvet Cupcake. 

Good part :
The presentation of the food was nice , the service was done nicely , the cupcake was nice and moist and the butter cream frosting was fresh. 

Bad part :
>The Cheese Fondue was served in a non-traditional manner, i.e., in a glass pot, which made the cheese hard within 2/3 mins. Probably serving the Fondue in a Caquelon over a spirit burner on the table, is the traditional and the best way.
>The Ceaser salad was not satisfactory as the lettuce in the salad was not fresh and the croutons were soggy , the cheese was too little. 
>The Grilled Honey Balsamic Chicken which had the chicken and pepper skewers were nice but the orange chiilli mustard reduction wasn't that good as the orange was too over powering and the chilli and mustard were not hitting the taste bud.
>The mozzarella and garlic stuffed chicken bangers was also not satisfactory. The mozzarella cheese stuffed bangers weren't really mozzarella stuffed. It was just sparingly used and well the garlic stuffing, lets say there was no taste nor stuffing of garlic in there. The pomegranate salad had cucumbers which were really bitter and the black pepper cheese dressing tasted more like hummus with no taste of cheese nor the zing of black pepper.
>The Pizza Salsiccia was absolutely disappointing . Though mentioned , there was no mushroom and garlic . The cheese was inadequate for a pizza and the quality of the mozzarella was not good as it was just hard and being a thin crust pizza it was not at all crispy but instead the base was soggy .  It just felt like chapati with toppings. We complained about this to the staff , who promptly changed the pizza which i have appreciated in the good part . The pizza was then served with mushrooms and more cheese but alas no garlic and this time we didnt bother to ask again.
>The worst part is that the portions for that price is too less .


The best part of this place ends in the good interiors and service but the quality and the quantity of its food has to improve. 
As of now , this is not a place i would recommend or visit again. I would give it two out of five just because of the ambiance , the service and probably the moist cupcake.

This place uses the best of the ingredients and prepares authentic Italian dishes.

Unique concept for Kolkata, i haven't come across any other boutique hotels/restaurants like these . From the outside with the writings on black board, the place seemed  like a chic coffee joint. We went in pretty late at about 11 pm and the management told us to wait till they got a table organized for us.  So took my time taking in the beautiful interiors. It has a touch of Antiquity, Chic and Homely/Casual feeling. Was sitting in the center hall which had this amazing chandelier and the realization set in... it's a old house, refurnished for a hotel/restaurant and i was probably sitting in what use to be the center courtyard.The Cutlery were very Stylish,the chairs were  Comfortable armchairs, everything seemed very elegant but gives this funny feeling that you are not in a restaurant, the flow i normally expect was missing ( may be trying to give us a homely feeling)

THE FOOD :- From what i remember of them  -
 Stuffed mushroom - Its a fried dish and still didn't have a drop of oil on it ,the presentation was really well made, I didn't even know what the dish was still i took a bite. Taste 3/5
The Veg Mushroom Risotto was cheesy and among the best i have ever had. Taste 5/5
The Veg Pasta was very authentic. Loved the tomato sauce used, it seemed so fresh. Taste 5/5
The Veg Lasagna was very average, may be i am used to the indianised cheesy version. Taste 3/5
Garlic Bread- Didn't seem to have enough garlic on it. Taste 2/5
Service : - The staff were friendly and attentive and they didn't try to rush us -being the last order for the night. 

Liked the place and will try it again to check on other stuff 

The dishes are really good and in just the perfect quantity, if you want to stuff yourself better order two servings. A meal for two should cost around 1500 to 2k. 

Suggestion : We were with a baby and lack of baby chair/sitting was a issue. Expected such a high end place to have such stuff.

Nice ambience and food but service was disastrous. Glasses were not clean, ice was of local quality with plastic pieces.

No one to listen the complains and even the manager didn't bother to acknowledge the issue. Took my half glass filled ice tea for replacement but didn't served it again and to my surprise even charged for it. I didn't said anything rather just paid the bill and went out. No point raising any issues as I was aware that it will be of no use. 

My first and last visit to the restaurant and would never ever suggest to anyone. Spoiled my evening

Walked in for a dinner on the 22nd of december with family (3 of us). The greeter/maitre'd was very prompt in finding us a table even though we didnt have any reservation. The quirky decor and the christmas carols playing had us excited about the prospect of a great meal ahead. However, things started to go south from there. We were given only one menu for the three of us and had to wait a good 20 minutes before someone even looked our way to take an order. We were informed that our first and second choice of appetizer was not available (this after waiting for our order to be taken for what seemed like an eternity). After the order was taken we were then asked to move table, which we honestly didnt mind, however when we shifted tables our cutlery and napkins werent shifted to our new table. A bottle of mineral water which we asked for was then brought. We werent asked if the temperature was alright nor was it poured for us. We were even a glass short on the table and had to ask for one. It was at this point that we raised our concerns with the manager who happened to pass by and apologize for shifting tables. She assured us that the matter would be taken up. At this point the appetizer was brought and placed on our table. When my mother requested for it to be served, she was told that it was a "self service" platter. I had half a mind to cancel my order at that point but stayed on not wanting to ruin my festive spirit. On a very positive note though, in spite of the terrible terrible service the food was divine. The appetizer (Greek chicken) was succulent and perfectly spiced. We ordered thin crust pizza and linguine for the mains and both were cooked to perfection. Would go so far as to say its the best italian food i have had in kolkata. The kitchen was also very timely in sending out the dishes. However, the overall experience left a bad taste in our mouths as the terrible service more than outdid the excellent food. To top it all off the bill took 15 mins, had two wrong items on it, then took 10 mins to rectify. No check from the manager after the complaint to see if our issues had been dealt with. She was busy hosting a bunch of her friends at the table right next to us. I have to say that gave one the impression that certain customers were of a higher priority than unknown walk ins.

Really overpriced, the chicken wings was the only thing we ordered, and that too was undercooked... Good ambience is the only reason for a 1.5. The staff were rude and did not take back the chicken. We had to go to hatari to complete our meal.

Head Chef Chanchal is a Magician !!! Absolutely amazing food. My 8 year old son Yash actually finished a full Margarita Pizza all by himself.. the prawns were to die for.. the chicken tender and full of flavour.. the decor was interesting, yet warm..  The only reason I have given a 4.5 rating, rather than a 5 is because I feel that the serving staff although very polite and helpful, need a little more training. Given the high standards of food and decor, I am sure it is only a matter of time before the serving staff too lives up to the high expectations one has from this fresh new entrant into the Kolkata foodies must visit address !!!

Also, I hope the management is working on getting a liquor license.. some great wine would prefectly compliment the divine food..

One of the best restaurants the city has to offer . if you have traveled and exposed to good international food this city has got the answer in the corner courtyard . very well balanced international menu , comfortable seating , ambiance and decent service . went there a couple of nights ago with a group of my friends and ordered the extensively  from the menu and nothing failed on our taste buds . my friends who are so difficult to please and love there food were ecstatic  oh and not to forget the presentation . It can do with a little quicker service and on a busy night parking can be  bit of a pain  but nothing to complain .reeeeeee

The Good: Excellent decor, ambiance and prompt service. The soup of the day was a "mushroom cappuccino" - it was delightfully light and frothy with a home-made flavor. The accompaniments with the main dishes were generally great - especially the hummus+pita, the salad and the couscous with pomegranate. The presentation of the food is top notch. The fish was cooked well - I tried the Miso Bhekti.

The Bad: Although marketed as a italian/continental/middle-eastern restaurant, the food here is a fusion between american style italian/mid-eastern food with north west indian cuisine. Lots of onions and and Indian spices. Although this is understandable, it is unfortunate that a boutique restaurant in Kolkata cannot serve authentic cuisine at this price range.

Their meat selection is very limited, and there is an overabundance of chicken. There is *only* one lamb dish. I thought the chicken and lamb were both quite disappointing. The lamb chops were a bit too dry and too tough. The chicken (2 breast pieces) wasn't succulent at all. A restaurant at this level really should know how to make meat tender and let the juices get in.

I would recommend adding more lamb dishes, and possibly some pork chop based dishes, and if possible some kind of beef steak.

Competing restaurants like Fire & Ice and Spaghetti Kitchen might be just slightly more expensive, but their non-veg food is outstanding and offer better value for money.

Probably a great hangout spot for vegetarian foodies.

Had some delicious salads which were a refreshing and healthy change, and at the same time wholesome.  The pizza, pesto pasta and chicken wings are to die for.

Visited the corner courtyard this weekend and was truly awed by the experience . there is so much to write about this place but being an impatient person with the keyboard i will cut mine short and sweet .
I have visited loads of restaurants world over and also alot in india but only a few of them who have really impressed me i take time out to write .
Ambiance = I feel this place has got such an infectious restaurant environment that is has you linger longer more then expected . great design and very comfortable seating and interiors make this place a great restaurant marvel.

Food = well if your a foodie , love your food and have great exposure to food you would love this menu . the first thing which impressed me was each dish was paired by a unique side which not often you find we tried the grilled miso wish with wasabi dressing and side salad . fish was cooked to perfection , moist and with the right balance of seasoning . paired well with the wasabi  mayo and side salad .
the lamb chops was the second we could dig into with a lovely tabbouleh and a lemon yogurt dressing . although the lamb chops were a bit on the tougher side but the flavor was top notch .
Pasta was our third course and since we love our seafood we decided to try the thermidor . been to france a couple of times and eaten the thermidor there  not often do you see thermidor sauce with a pasta but this was awesome .  by then we were  stuffed and couldn't try any dessert  but will save it for next time .

service = well being a packed house during dinner the service was all smiles and efficient .

All and all  the corner courtyard was one great experience and would be seen there shortly .

Came across this restaurant quite by accident one day, driving down Sarat Bose Road. The look and feel of the place is excellent....pity about the food, which is pretentious and uniformly tasteless. I had 3 items: Beer Batter Fish London Style (bland, with overdressed potato wedges), Mixed Seafood Pasta (too, too heavy cheese sauce & drenched in a saffron flavour, like payesh) & finally Jamaican Jerk Chicken (tasted like disinfectant with sides of potatoes, suspiciously like aloo dum). Was so disappointed I didn't linger to try the desserts from The Rouge. Not planning to return, as I believe a restaurant is fundamentally a place to eat and enjoy food, this is more a place to see and be seen in.

A well deserved 5 by a stand alone boutique hotel.
Once I spotted it opposite 85 Lansdowne, the place immediately found space in my wishlist. What a pretty looking hotel, so so pretty. Vintage white can never fail to look uber classy and that is exactly what The Corner Courtyard's exteriors exude. The entry has a nice European touch to it and I knew this was going to be one hell of a fine dining experience.

BEAUTIFUL interiors. Vintage installations. Check. Clean and well planned. Check. Impressive crockery. Check. Eye-catching cushions. Check. Just everything is PERFECT about the ambience. So cosy yet grandeur. Being a boutique hotel, The Corner Courtyard will have seven different themed rooms on rent. That is yet to open but will soon be on a roll. *Makes dreamy eyes and notes on the wishlist*

Now, the food. Wow. We ordered the soup of the day, Greek chicken souvalaki for starters, rum based barbecue chicken pizza and mixed seafood almond thermidor linguine pasta for maincourse, and a citrus lemon grass drink. The drink was so perfectly like a good cocktail that I almost refused to believe it had no alcohol, but well, it did not. It was refreshing, appetising and smooth. The soup is served with thin toasted garlic brown bread. I have not tasted a garlic bread so crunchy with a balanced flavour of spices before. It went perfectly with the tomato basil soup, which was light yet tangy. The chicken skewer portion was big and tasted brilliant. Soft, juicy meat with cooked crunchy avocado and zucchini inside made the skewers taste so fresh and appetising. The pizza totally does justice to the description provided in the menu. I am a sucker for thin crust pizzas and thus my meal experience had attained a salvation level while gorging on the maincourse. I had the best seafood pasta till date at The Corner Courtyard - the profuse amount of cheese, almonds, prawns, kesar (oh yes, I would have never imagined that kesar can be used in pasta and that too this well) made it infinitely lip smacking. 

For desserts we ordered profiteroles and panna cotta. The desserts are catered to by The Rouge. I have had way better profiteroles in Thalassa, Vagator, Goa, therefore could not come to terms with the kind served here. The profiteroles tasted more like scones rather. The panna cotta was really nice though.

Given the interiors and quality of food served, The Corner Courtyard is a reasonably priced place to eat out at. You may not want to go there often because the word special is so for reasons. And this place is special. It plays Coldplay, Gotye too. Need I say more?

We were three friends thinking of a place to go have coffee and desserts, and when we saw The Corner Courtyard and The Rouge, we naturally thought it was a joint where we would get some desserts and drinks. We entered and were very pleasantly surprised by the lovely decor. However, we also noted that not too many desserts were available and whatever was, were mostly in packets. My friend and I checked out the menu and saw it was more of a continental food joint, but it did have desserts.

They did ask us what we wanted, and when we said we wanted dessert and coffee, they told us that they did have a limited selection of such stuff. My friend wanted a concoction with watermelon, feta and mango powder. However, the server told us it was not available. Naturally, we ordered two lemon iced teas and a cappuccino for me. The coffee was very good, bitter, foamy and exactly the way I liked it. They did not ask if we wanted water, and we found that slightly odd. We also ordered the profiteroles, and they came in a set of four, with chocolate sauce. The profiteroles were pretty cold inside, and I would have preferred it if it was slightly warmed up. The chocolate sauce with it was good. The one which was quite good was with salted caramel and nuts on it. However, the rest were mediocre. 

I would love to see more dessert options apart from these, since The Corner Courtyard boasts of being a part of The Rouge - maybe some cupcake options and more cheesecakes???

We had ordered for Carribean Rum Chicken Pizza for starters which was the most perfect pizza I had till date as it was just in the right proportion for 2 people, was of perfect dimension and was extremely tasty and juicy. For main course, we had ordered for a Tokyo Bhetki with Wasabi Sauce that was brilliantly garnished and tasted like heaven. The second dish for main course was a Malaysian Chicken that they served in sticks with peanut butter sauce which was also full of perfection. A complimentary Barbecue Chicken followed at last that was so good that the taste would stay on for a long time. 
However, we didn't find much pleasure out of 2 drinks that we had ordered, a pineapple drink and a watermelon based vegetable drink.
Nevertheless, the basics of the restaurant is extremely strong as it had very active staff who had a smile on their face all the time, very friendly and courteous, patient with questions and every time a dish arrived...a steward would arrive to explain you the dish. Food would always arrive within 10min of placing an order. The courtyard ambiance is also unique in its own way as every wall had been tastefully crafted and the cutlery was fantastic. The soft music had a long distance flowing effect that added wonders to the ambience. However, I felt that the marble tables was a bit short in size. 
Overall, it was an unique experience as it housed dishes from around the world and served as it would taste in their own region. Perfection seemed to be a norm there. The name of the place should have been The Perfect Corner or The Perfect Courtyard. Thank You for a great experience Mrs.Agarwal.

The Corner Courtyard at sarat bose road is a foodie's delight. It is a boutique hotel cum restuarant housed in an old building whose majestic structure has been restored keeping it's character intact. The interiors are decorated beautifully with antiques and books keeping a British feel all around. I have visited the place twice and both times the food were just lip-smacking. The first day I ordered grilled prawns with pomegranate salad which was just delicious and the oreo cheese cake was so good , it just melted into my mouth. I would also like to mention about the drinks I had which are concoctions of various vegetables and fruits, both healthy and tasty! The second day I had Mozzarella stuffed chicken frankfurters with salad and a mixed sea-food pasta with almonds which were just out of the world. The restuarant staffs are very cordial and the service is superb. I suggest every foodie wishing to pamper their taste buds with excellent delicacies to visit this place. Great going 'The Corner Courtyard'..Keep creating such awesome delicacies ;-)
