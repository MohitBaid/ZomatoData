Please avoid this place at all costs. The food provided is not even worth half the price. I ordered a veg burger and hotdog. The quality was below par. The dip was also useless. And to top it all! The shakes were delivered in small plastic containers ( the ones which are used for packing dal etc.) !!!!

Situated just opposite AJC Bose College...serves with a huge variety of lip smacking sandwiches. But the price is way to high as well as the service is poor.

It's a small joint without any seating facility. We ordered a Tomato pizza which was priced 140 bucks. After 15mins of waiting, what was served was really disappointing. It was a small pizza, a little larger than the ones sold at Mio Amore. The taste wasn't any good either.

I have visited this place, just because i have to use my Sodaxo coupons. The quality of the food is really very bad, i have just tried sandwich , but its not eatable. May be other items are good. So i will request everyone to avoid it, if are not so much hungry.

Corner Cafe is a joint which reminds me of my childhood. As a kid went there frequently at-least once. In those times, choices were limited and also due to VFM of Corner Cafe it was much cherished. 

Their heavenly burgers, pizzas and bottled cold coffee are like timeless! In front of this, the likes of Dominos, Pizza Hut just dont stand a chance.

A mix veg pizza costs around 170 rs so its very VFM also. Cold Coffee at 60 rs, burger at 70 rs if I recall correctly.

And thanks to Swiggy, now pizza and cold coffee is a few taps away. 

Their pizza are not too thin and not too thick. Has generous amount of pizza sauce and other toppings which makes it very flavorful and appetizing. Burger since we had called via Swiggy had become a bit soggy. Cold Coffe had a plastic lid on top for delivery and was quite leak-proof. 

Go and visit or order on phone. You wont be disappointed.

I never had a high place for corner cafe. Used to come to this place as a kid, but the food never excited me. After many years, that fact has not changed. I ordered online via zomato, and got 2 burgers and a mix cheese pizza. Whilst the delivery service was efficient (getting us the food real fast on a weekend), the food itself was average at best. All that said, the cheese burger was still better than the veg burger and the pizza. Maybe the order was a bit too tasteless and other dishes may prove better, but today's experience won't bring me back to the place till a while now.

Nice corner place situated at the corner of AJC Bose road and Pretoria street this place was a famous hangout while travelling to Metro station. They give u good burgers and nachos. Cold coffee is also nice but the only problem is sometime flies are there and hover around your food which gives u a irritating feeling and parking is issue over here so u can't also sit in the car and enjoy freely.

For as long as I can remember, corner cafe has been there near HHI. Before dominos and Pizza Hut stormed Kolkata, it was a regular stop for Pizzas for many. Even today this small outlet serves the meanest Mushroom Cheese Pizza. They also serve ice cream soda which is very rare to find. I really like the place for it is quick, reasonable and the food is tasty. All in all it is a very good place for snacks.

I heard so much about this place but today I happened to be at that side and so I couldn't resist myself from trying their food.. I tried the mix cheese pizza and it was worth the money totally... The taste of the pizza is so different from the regular pizzas we always try at pizza corners.. The pizza was wholesome as well. The outlet do not have any dine in facility so that would be the only negative point.. But I would request all pizza lovers to try this joint out..

Corner Cafe! Where do I begin? The things that immediately come to my mind are

- Pizzas that are melt in the mouth

- the first pizza place I visited, when I was a kid

- Unparalleled cold coffee in that trademark glass bottle of theirs 

- Nostalgia

- easy on the pocket!

- my love for Kasundi/Indian Mustard comes started thanks to them :) 

I have grown up eating the mixed cheese pizza from here! It is one of my comfort foods. And I'm glad that despite the various pizza chains coming up, Corner Cafe has managed to stay around. They have evolved with time in terms of their pizza and burger options as well as bringing in new items to their menu. 

We usually ordered pizzas and burgers as a take away so the fact that there is no seating area in the cafe never bothered me much :)

Do visit this place if you want a pizza which tastes just like a homecooked one and a quick meal!

Location: At the dogleg of Lee Road & AJC Bose Road. 

Corner Cafe as the name suggests is located at the 'corner' of Lee Road, in front of the gas station.
It is a small eatery majorly of the Grab-n'-Go type, but, also has a Stand-n'-Eat facility.
This place manages to dish up decently tasting fare and is mostly visited by people who are on the move. And, yes it's a pure vegetarian cafe. 

I have opted this place a number of times while am around the area and facing a time constraint. Have tried the following until now:

- Chacha Chips
It is basically potato crisps or wafers as one might describe. Served sealed. 
Mentioning this in the beginning as a lot of my orders have this along as a side.

- Veg. Sandwich with Chacha Chips (Tasted Okayish)
The sandwich had a homely taste to it; slightly buttered, cucumber and tomato cut into rounds and placed, seasoned with salt n' pepper.

- Veg. Burger with Chacha Chips 
The Burger felt to be a home-made burger with coriander chutney spread on one side of the bun with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and lettuce along with a vegetable cutlet type patty. 
Was quite tummy filling and did taste decent.

- Cheese Sandwich with Chacha Chips
This too had a homely taste; grated cheese spread on slightly buttered slices of bread seasoned with salt n' pepper.

- Cold Coffee with Icecream
Aah! A dollop of vanilla icecream in a balanced (sugar and coffee powder) coffee. Served chilled. Tasted good.

¬†The above list of food would be updated in the tune of future visits.
[Last updated: February 5, 2015]

‚Ä¢Ketchup, chilli sauce and mustard sauce available as complimentary accompaniments to your food.

SERVICE has always been at the bat of an eyelid. And, the STAFF, is friendly and polite.

PRICES would gift a smile to your wallet. Hasn't ever a full tummy burnt a hole in the wallet.

Overall a nice place to drop by when on the go!
- Visiting soon.

Located on the corner of ajc bose road and millemium building..it is only half-named correctly 'corner cafe'..since it is not a cafe..its just a roadside eatery where you have to stand and eat or simply takeaway..
Its located just opposite to my tution in the millenium..so i have been here few times..
they serve decent sandwich and burgers(it seems a bit overpriced) and the cold cofee (it is overpriced!!)..and above all it is served in a reused amul kool bottle..
There's nothing special about this joint...
To prevail in the fight going on between the food joints in the area they should be a little budget friendly...

Corner Cafe - A decent eatery or say, takeaway near the AJC, Petrol Pump.¬†
==================
Location:

As this cafe is situated in the main road, it is not difficult to locate this cafe at all. This cafe as far as a i remember is run by an old man. When i used to go for my tuitions, i somehow came across the cafe while crossing roads and there you go. Walk from Exide towards the honda showroom, i am sure you will discover it. ¬†:)¬†
==================
Ordered:

Veg Burger with Chips - The burger was quite filling and pretty reasonably priced. However, the chips were the usual local chips.¬†
==================
Pros:
1) Location is a win win.¬†
2) Serves Pure Veg ONLY.
3) Pocket Friendly.
4) Hygienic.¬†
5) Quality of food is decent.¬†

Cons:
1) Need to do more developments on service.¬†
2) Having such a location, this place can do much more wonders than the usual.¬†
3) Should get more varieties in the menu.
==================
Meal for Two :200-300 approx.¬†
==================
Conclusion:

Don't think it as a cafe where you can sit and eat. It hardly can accommodate. You have to stand and enjoy your meal here. However, suggested to do a takeaway.

How does one rate a restaurant, with which are associated childhood memories ? Being just is the only way.

Once a favorite joint of mine, I Visited this after many years last week. Staff was as courteous as ever, and since it is almost like a roadside cafe, the ambience has never been it's talking point.¬†

I ordered my Special Burger, as always, and I shall rate this better than, what we have at McDonalds, but not much compared to speciality restaurants that now we can talk about. Pizza was a let down, as the quality has deteriorated. It's cold coffee, always reminds me of the one made at our home, and was nice.¬†

Not a place to go, if you are looking for gourmet experience, and you have to eat standing. But a good place to grab a bite, whenever u r in a hurry and in this locality.

It is located in the main hustle bustle of AJC Bose road, in the petrol pump.
Among the first of all fast food parlors in Calcutta.
Pizzas, burgers, french fries and vada pav are the best pick there. Also the coffee!

Located in ajc bose road,corner cafe is situated within the petrol pump premises. Corner cafe used to be personal favourite for their burgers at a time when mc donalds and kfc werent in the picture.The big juicy burger,lettuce, cheese, tomatoes neatly packed in a paper bag with a side of "chacha chips" was an instant hit.I also loved corner cafe for their mixed cheese pizza.
Then the scenario changed.Entered the giants with good offerings and now many places serve good burgers.But corner cafe is just wonderful,only for its burgers.Recently our car broke down in ajc bose road and while my friend went searching for a mechanic , I rushed to corner cafe for a quick bite and parcel f.The veg cheese sandwich was done very home like and i didnt personally like it. The prices have increased over the years,still is pretty pocket friendly. 
Corner cafe for me is the vegcheese burger with chacha chips and the mixed cheese pizza .Other things just dont fit the bill.Overall its pretty average and attracts office goers from the busy lee road  offices. 
The rating of 3.5 is only for the veg cheese burger which still manages to make me smile.

Corner Cafe located at the Petrol Pump on the corner of Lee Road is an old and favored haunt. The food is vegetarian but what is the standout is the Cold Coffee which we would love much before all the CCD, Costa's and Barista's came to be. The Cheese Sandwich they serve is simple almost home made and yummy as is the Baked Beans Pizza which is pretty good as well. Their hot-seller though is an veg burger that we all grew up eating. Its a pocket friendly place and has decent portion sizes .... a nice place to grab a bite if your in the vicinity.

Corner Cafe has been my source of the burgers for a very long time before the city saw the lights of the mc donalds, kfc etc. They are located beside the lee road petrol pump and i have always had their food via the takeaway counter with the uncle sitting on the cash counter whom i am seeing for years. 

The menu contains a lot of options but my favorite has always been the big fat indian burger with a bottle of their cold coffee which has a very traditional old school flavor to it. Other than these hot dogs are good and others are just about average. Overall good food at decent prices ideal for a takeaway. I would say the place is good enough if you stick to their best items.

This is a quaint place - not a great crowd-puller as it is a cafe in a not so residential area maybe. It is located on the corner of Lee Road and AJC Bose Road.  In the recent past a bunch of cafes have come up on the opposite side. What however goes for it is it is a quiet place where you can take your girlfriend / wife and still enjoy old styled coffee sans ice cream or chocolate sauce. You nay even go for a sandwich and watch the roads . Last time I was there it was raining heavily and we could sit there for over and hour or more gently sipping our coffee after shopping at Big Bazar.

Located on small corner of a petrol pump near Exide the place with its cold coffee is the thing that always drags me to this place. They have a unique way of serving the coffee. It readymade, packaged and chilled in non-disposable glass bottles. Once you order on you take the bottle sip it down and return it to the caf√©. Have not tried anything else here but I have heard that the sandwiches and the pizza is pretty good too.
