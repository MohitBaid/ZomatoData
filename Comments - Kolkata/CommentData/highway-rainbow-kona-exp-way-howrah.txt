this dhaba ( more of a restaurant) is situated on NH 6 while going towards kolaghat . a very neat and clean restaurant with open kitchen, a stop over to to this place is a must for every tired and hungry traveller. Being vegetarian, we tried their north indian food and each and every dish was very good. much better than many of our restaurants situated in kolkata. the dal makhani, the mixed veg, paneer subzi all were very good. the rates are also reasonable . cost for 4 would be around 800. the service and staff also deserves  a special mention of appreciation. certainly looking forward to many more stopover at this wonderful place

Yesterday afternoon  I had taken my wife and 86 year old mother for a drive on Kona Express Way and then we decided to have lunch at Highway Rainbow.
We were surprised by the general cleanliness of the place, nice environment ,courteous behavior of staff, their wearing of gloves and cap, clean kitchen and clean toilets.
They do not have a bar and that is why the ambiance was nice and quiet.
The food was excellent (we had North Indian Non-Veg food)and reasonably priced.Once the Reliance Pump starts operating we are sure this place will become a favorite with travelers. My mother ( retd. Doctor) was very happy with the food.
We also met the owner Mr.Misra (this group also owns Gangaur in Kolkata).
We wish this restaurant all the very best. Please maintain what you have done. We plan to visit this place at least once a month.

I found to be the best place for food and refreshment after enjoying the long drive. Highway Rainbow is on Bombay Highway on NH-6 near Uluberia. It's a clean and hygienic place with sufficient parking place by. Food quality is excellent and especially Corn Methi Malai. Presentation is good, decent staff and@ good hospitality. The most amazing part is live kitchen and you can see the cleanliness of the kitchen and preparation of food in hygienic way. Overall experience is excellent. My personal recommendation to visit the place enjoy the food when you are on Bombay Highway .

I found it to be the best place to have food and refreshment if you are taking the Bombay Highway. Clean place, helpful staff, fair enough food, reasonable price. Except the tea (which tasted a bit weird) the food was pretty decent. Thumbs up!
