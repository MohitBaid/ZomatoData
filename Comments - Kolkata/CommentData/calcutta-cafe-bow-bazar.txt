Loud lovely music..located just besides jogajog bhavan..now talking about food..at first I have ordered chilli chicken egg chow,fried rice etc..extremely of high cost..but unfortunately amount is not worth for it...but the chilli chicken tastes so yummy and well cooked..but I don't know why they prohibit to take other chicken items!!absolutely disgusting! !!!but ambience is good as a bar but area is so short...

Extremely bad place... very bad environment... Extremely loud live music... staffs are very rude... food quality was unmentionable... Overall not for formal dine in with friends and family... can give it a try with college friends... pocket pinch was also not at all friendly...

Intro : Calcutta Cafe is a bar just beside Yogayog Bhavan . Is a place with too too loud music - just not bearable .

Food - Once I entered, I just decided that the best thing is to move out fast and hence just had a beer!

2.5/5

Located near to the Central Metro Station. 
It opens at 12 in the afternoon and we went around 12:15, in a group of 6.
As soon as we entered, could see the dim lights. Looked interesting.
Then we took our seats, the seats were uncomfortable and the place was clumsy. Whatever we had ordered, turned up unavailable. 
Staffs were courteous, to some extent.
They need to work on the ambience factor as well.

Cheers to the team !

Worst experience ever............ Tuborg beer quality was not good at alllllllllll.

I ordered a plate of chicken reshmi kebab, i never had a Chicken reshmi kebab like this before....... i mean tooooooo bad to have it...... i just had only one piece of chicken and left the rest on the plate....

And music is tooooo loud for that little place.....
And songs, u guys please arrange some good singer in the bar.... to sing some new, rock song that ppl can enjoy, not that sad song allllll time.....

I meant it.. ..
I mean worst experience everrrrrrrrrrrr....ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬

The Place is Good! Specially those who like live music! The Food is also good!!! Not much costly...
but the only con is the live music goes to high pitch sometime, that create irritation to ear!!! and the arear of the restaurant is small...
