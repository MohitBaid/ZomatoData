Ordered food while laying over on sealdah station. Food was really amazing , I never had any packed thali which tastes so good while travelling. Food was delicious as well as a perfect mood setter for my another journey. Delivery boy was really nice.  Everyone should try out this place. 

Happily satisfied customer

Off late this place has been our regular home-delivery supplier during the office lunch hours. Their food is extremely tasty and has a very home-cooked feel. Pricing too is very justified. This is a place where one can have food everyday without worrying about the pocket pinch and health factor.

Place for anyone wanting to enjoy good food although the place doesn't have more than a couple of table. Takeover is recommended. Have been here twice and would like to go more often.

ATS Dhaba is all time Saviour for the PG students. 
They are quite poket friendly, they have so many varieties of Paneer and every item is very tasty. Every time the PG food is horrible, we order Sabji from here only!

Extremely poor service. Ordered from swiggy. Thali was devoid of nan and dahi... Got only rice.  Whatever was delivered was useless. Devoid of any salt. Worst ever food of my life.

Tried their veg thali!
it consisted of rice,nan,papad,dahi,green chutney,salad,dal makhani,one paneer dish and sabzi!!
Everything tasted good..the paneer dish was yummy..paneer in creamy gravy which had a lovely dried fenugreek touch to it!the sabzi was bland..it felt like they haven't added anything else apart from salt for seasoning!
quantity was sufficient ..price of the food is cheap!

It is a college student's favourite. The tea, the samosa, the jalebis are delicious. But it is definitely overpriced. But the charm attached to it makes it worth a try. Moreover the St xaviers morning students had nowhere else to go

A place where students from Xaviers love to flock around ......the kachori jalebis gilab jamuns and tea are something u should try out when u go there...a small road side shop but u will always find a crowd there whenever u visit it.

Located on Outram Street this is a small place which can be easily missed. But food wise they serve really freshly cooked homestyle food. We often order from here. Never been disappointed or found any hygiene issues. 

For lunch time they have nice thalis on offer.

For dinner
We ordered
Reshmi Paneer Tikka
Mixed veg
Alu gobhi
Malai Kofta ( No onion no garlic)

Assorted breads

The food was really good. Less oily, spices were perfect though some veggies were little too sweet.

The pocket pinch is much lesser than other dhabas.

Had the Aloo Paratha and Kesar Chai from this place. I generally don't drink tea except for a few special variety. Loved this one. The Paratha was too oily, gorged upon by most of the masses, indicates to be a popular item from their menu.

I am not one of those person who splurge a lot on tea, but I did here. Had tried the kesar tea in a bhaar for Rs 25. It was worth it. Was delicious. The shop is always crowded with college students and office goers. 
The samosa is good as well.
