Visited on the eve of new year. Decoration is gorgeous. But a brighter lighting scheme would be nice. Ambience was perfect. Staffs are cordial but a bit slow maybe that is caused by the overcrowded scenario for that day. We ordered pan fried chilli fish and barbecued smoked fish. Pan fried fish was delicious but other one is average. Then we ordered lat Mai kai chicken and lemon chicken. Both are delicious specially the lat mai Kai. In main course we ordered pan fried chowmin , mixed gravy chowmin and mixed Hakka chowmin. Both the gravy chow was great. But I was surprised to see the quantity of the hakka chowmin. I thought it was for single person but they told it was for two. It was very less quantity. In dessert we had no option other than chocolate mousse for that day. It was good. Moreover a decent restaurant with a higher pocket pinch.

Last night went there for my masi's birthday.. Expected a lot but sadly my expectations became disappointment..
Food- Ordered
Spicy Lemon Chicken - Tasted like Chilly Chicken only.. Nothing very special about it.
Chicken Stroganoff- Creamy and delicious
Yaung Chow Fried Rice- tatsed like normal fried rice
Cantonesse Rice Noodles- worst in taste.. Never try it.
Ambience - Yes this us what i absolutely loved. Peaceful ambience.. The behavior of the staff are really very good.. They were very attentive what we need and they were helping me to choose food.
Pocket Pinch- I think compared to the quality and quantity the price is little high.
If u wanna spend a peaceful evening u can go there but if u wanna have a great meal then i will not recommended this place to u..

I guess I would say it's a bit over rated. The decor looks classy with dim lights and peaceful ambiance. The food was just okay. We ordered a spicy pasta, wings of heaven (so-so) and a kebab which was scrumptiously sloshed in cheese. Ice cream sandwich was heavenly. Though really courteous waiters and prompt service, I must mention.

Not great worth of money I would say, but still a good place for continental food if you are at Park Street.

Great staff. Very curteous. Great food. The chicken straganoff was delicious and so was the walnut brownie. Loved it! The ambience was great. The 2 year old son was with us and so they offered us the sofa seat which worked great for us.

An acclaimed restaurent in Kolkata. The restaurent is located in Park Street. The restaurent is a masterpiece centre for family dine-out or a romantic dine-out with a calm dim snug ambience. The taste quality is so remarkable that you will remember the taste in your tongue. Service is quite nice and a good location to hang-out with a palatable dish. You can create a cherishing experience with your family, partners or friends.

The city of Joy celebrates every festival with equal vigor and enthusiasm. Park Street area in Kolkata is where people flock to celebrate Christmas and New Year. The area beautifully decorated with lights, trees has an ongoing street food festival during this period. With the variety of restaurants available, this can safely be labelled as a food lover‚Äôs paradise. Over the Christmas weekend, we decided to brave the crowd of Park Street and head towards one of the best options for fine dining in the city¬†‚Äì Marco Polo.
                    
I would recommend this restaurant as one of the best options in the city to visit with family or as a couple. The picture perfect ambiance, professional service, delightfully tasty choice of cuisines and pocket friendly pricing create an overwhelming fine dining experience.

A restaurant of taste.

Although located slightly away from the crux of Park Street this restaurant has always been talked about. The decor and ambience is worth praising. And the food? Oh, yes, it will not let you complain.

Having visited this joint, for the first time, on the eve of the first day of 2018, I got the feeling that this place is really good. I was within a team of 14 people so my hands were a little tied but here's what I did put in my mouth -

Sea Breeze, Fish Hariyali Kebab, Chicken Cantonese Noodles and Chicken in Black Pepper sauce. I was pretty impressed by the quality of the fish that was used for cooking; tasty and fresh.

Worth the money, guys. Would love to come back for more.

My rating could have been 5.0 considering the parameters like food quality, taste, service etc only. But the reality is 'pocket pinch' is another issue for us ('us' includes majority of readers of the review and certainly not everyone). I don't know why Zomato thinks that Rs. 1200 is enough for two. At least Rs. 1800 is the requirement if you want to taste their signature dishes (and not the chinese ones).
However, the taste of the food is great. I will specially recommend their tandoor and pasta items. The dish 'mahi motia' is the best fish item I ever had in park street. Drinks are also available in some decent price.
Most of their dishes serves one unlike the other standard restaurant. So do not expect a very good qyantity of food here. Only thing you can expect a lot here is their QUALITY which really matters.
Love this restaurant.....!

The fish was excellent to taste. Nice golden crust outside and tenderly inside. Would definitely try it once again. For cocktail we order my tie and long island ice tea.

We went there for dinner on 25th December. The ambience was great and the staff courteous and gave good suggestions on the things we can try. For starters we ordered grilled bekti, murg malai nazaqat and fried prawns with sesame seeds. While the chicken and the prawn were an instant hit, the grilled bekti was a big disappointment; could not get the taste of lemon butter sauce and instead to my dislike got mustard sauce. For main course we kept it simple; butter naan, paneer butter masala and murg changezi. Murg changezi was delicious and was made up of cashewnut gravy. It would be worth trying. Had heard a lot about their desserts being delicious, so ordered chocolate mousse. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. Eventually left with happy memories and completely satisfied.

A very well known reputed name in the Park Street area, my experience was up to the mark as well. I had been on the Christmas Eve and hence had to wait for an hour for a table but the service overall was quite good. The wait time for my order to be delivered had been around 15 mins. The food was excellent especially the Chicken Mahti that we ordered with the hakka noodles. The chelo kabab was quite good as well. The dessert was a tad bit disappointing. Could have been better. We had a caramel pudding and a walnut brownie. The ambience of the place is excellent with ligt music. Overall you can enjoy a delicious dinner with a few drinks  with family or friends in a very healthy ambience. What irked me was the waiter asking for tips mentioning they don't have any service tax but anyway it was a festive season and that can be ignored.

Visited this outlet on Christmas Eve and as expected they doesn't disappoint . Despite overwhelming crowd they manage to give us set in about 15 mins . Now coming to food it was delicious and quantity was sufficient for 2 . We have had drums of heaven , mixed fried rice , hara kabab , chicken hokkien style , and blue lagoon it was worth the price..

Found rice in my cheese munchies, while having a cocktail... Yak..   Disgusting ... probably the rice was  from some previous order leftovers. Horrible... The attendant was acting as if he is as surprised as we were but never apologized for this filthy standard....  Typical park street restaurant.... When will they understand that they are not high class eateries anymore... Their standards are for casual dining only.

We went there for dinner on 25th December. The ambience was great and the staff courteous and gave good suggestions on the things we can try. For starters we ordered grilled bekti, murg malai nazaqat and fried prawns with sesame seeds. While the chicken and the prawn were an instant hit, the grilled bekti was a big disappointment; could not get the taste of lemon butter sauce and instead to my dislike got mustard sauce. For main course we kept it simple; butter naan, paneer butter masala and murg changezi. Murg changezi was delicious and was made up of cashewnut gravy. It would be worth trying. Had heard a lot about their desserts being delicious, so ordered chocolate mousse. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. Eventually left with happy memories and completely satisfied.

A very well known reputed name in the Park Street area, my experience was up to the mark as well. I had been on the Christmas Eve and hence had to wait for an hour for a table but the service overall was quite good. The wait time for my order to be delivered had been around 15 mins. The food was excellent especially the Chicken Mahti that we ordered with the hakka noodles. The chelo kabab was quite good as well. The dessert was a tad bit disappointing. Could have been better. We had a caramel pudding and a walnut brownie. The ambience of the place is excellent with ligt music. Overall you can enjoy a delicious dinner with a few drinks  with family or friends in a very healthy ambience. What irked me was the waiter asking for tips mentioning they don't have any service tax but anyway it was a festive season and that can be ignored.

Visited this outlet on Christmas Eve and as expected they doesn't disappoint . Despite overwhelming crowd they manage to give us set in about 15 mins . Now coming to food it was delicious and quantity was sufficient for 2 . We have had drums of heaven , mixed fried rice , hara kabab , chicken hokkien style , and blue lagoon it was worth the price..

I honestly couldnt find any flaw with this restaurant. Had gone there for a late lunch and trust me, I am glad that I did. I honestly had the notion that the place was too pricey but the food is so tasty that its worth every penny.

We ordered chicken stroganoff, lamb chops and ice cream sandwiches. Stroganoff is a tricky dish that most people get wrong but the chef at Marco Polo did it complete justice. The chicken and the buttery rice were so so good that I packed one for dinner too!üòä
The lamb was tender and juicy. We could literally run our forks through it and see the pieces fall apart; the perfect way to cook lamb.

I have seriously fallen in love with the place and want to visit again and again. Yes, it is tad expensive but trust me, it is one of the best restaurants out there.

Marco Polo is one of the most underrated restaurant in Park Street area. Seating arrangement is huge & the decoration is quite lit. Well behaviour staffs.

Coming the foods..
We started Prawn cocktail (too yummy) & lemon friend chicken and two blue lagoon. After that we ordered Bekti a la Meuniere, chelo kabab, chicken Stroganoff. And at last ice cream sandwich (inside vanilla), chocolate mousse (üòç). Lovely dessert.
One of the best place to eat at Park Street.

The decoration is superb .Really liked the staircase system which leads to the 2nd floor .The bar counter at the bottom looks authentic and unique.We had lovely mocktails,lemon fried chicken and prawn cocktail to start with .The taste of mocktails were pretty good .Since it‚Äôs winter season ,we were a little skeptical about the mocktails ,but it wasn‚Äôt too cold to drink .The lemon fried chicken was delicate and flavours were on point .The last starter we had was prawn cocktail .Prawns are cut into small pieces,mixed with cream and mayonnaise and served in a cocktail glass .It is a must try .The main course started with 1.chelo kabab which is again a good and famous dish .2.chicken stroganoff creamy and tasty .3.Bekti a la meuni√®re the best of the lot served with veggies and betki fillets .
Lastly ,desserts we had were chocolate mousse which was out of the world along with ice cream sandwich which had vanilla too .Had a great time and food was served fast and the best was the garnishing .Will visit soon ..

Marco Polo is one of the most underrated restaurants in Park Street. I have been to all the 'legendary' ones in that area and I can vouch for the superiority of Marco Polo in terms of food quality.
We booked our table in advance via Zomato. The moment we reached our waiter for the day escorted us to our table. The 1st floor where we were seated was sparsely populated. The ambience and decor makes you settle down very quickly.
We ordered for Grilled Bekti, Chicken Hokkien Style, Moon Faan, Sahi Tukra and Walnut Brownie. The grilled bekti was good, perfectly tendered and soft; selection of assorted veggies were also accurate. I loved the combo of Chicken Hokkien Style and Moon Faan rice in the main course. But the showstealers were the desserts. The hot Walnut Brownie with melting Ice Cream scoop was excellent in taste. The Sahi Tukra is probably the best Sahi Tukra I have had till date (and this I am saying keeping Oudh's in mind).
Overall a weekend lunch really well spent.
I deducted the 0.5 because -
1. When people move on the wooden top floor it gives the dinner an unsetlling earthquake-like (mild) feeling. This gets ignored on a bar like loud environment. But on an otherwise quiet place like this it is hard to ignore.
2. When we were already 1hr into the meal, a person called to ask if we were coming or should he cancel the reservation! The management team should look to enhance these type of coordination.

Marco Polo restaurant is of those times when not many people would go to restaurants to eat out. Only a chosen few would go to fulfill their desires of food. Whoever loved chinese would come here to savor the delicacies it had to provide.

My wife wanted to have chinese and that too here and finally we landed here. We are glad we chose this place to dine for the evening. 

We ordered Moon Faan which is rice and was amazingly made. Never had such a good taste of rice.

We also ordered Devil's Choice as gravy vegetable as side dish for our rice. Trust me this was the best devils choice I would have ever eaten. Every vegetable into it was fresh and so tasty I have no words to describe. Must try on my recommendation.

For the desserts we tried the ice-cream sandwich and it was amazing too. The portion was less and I craved for more and more. Whatever was served was simply mind-blowing. We had a filling and satisfying evening.

Marco Polo is a good and quite place to hang out and chill and enjoy food. People in hurry should avoid it. The decor was as it used to be. The service was good and the staff was very courteous and understanding.

All in all it is a high recommendation from my end. Must try.

A must visit place in park street if you love continental food. Situated just next to Mamagoto and MBar kitchen , serves delicious continental dishes. The place is quite spacious with 2 sections . Downstairs is bar section. The entire place is very dimly lit creates a very eye soothing look. Decor is beautiful. Staffs are courteous. Coming to the food we ordered: Fried Wonton ( prawn), jumbo prawn thermidor, grilled pork chop, chicken steak poivrade, pan fried noodles ( prawn ) and chicken mahti. In dessert darsaan. Each and every item was lipsmacking ( I personally tasted wonton, chicken steak poivrade, pork chop and darsaan and the rest 3 items are reviewed on the basis of others' opinion). Pork chop was grilled perfectly and the stuffing of the chicken breast was really good. The breast I found little dry but the sauce was again a winner . Quantity was generous. 1 pan fried noodles is good for 2. A must mention should be the dessert : I tasted the best darsaan here. Most importantly price is very reasonable , for 5 of us without drink the bill was rs.2400 ( also thanks to 5% GST ) . This place was long been on my list and my first visit was really good, will visit again.

I‚Äôm sure that this place is going to be one of the many famed names in the Kolkata food arena. I went to the Kouzina Minning with my office collegues on a Friday evning...

dark and soothing the ambiance is perfect for a early weekend dinner. Service was prompt and to the mark. Though the place was crowded, we were swiftly attended.....Coming to the food. It‚Äôs one of the best place to try continental dishes. If you are a foodie interested in continental line up this place is sure to tantalize your taste buds...Must try is the Italian., Grilled Bhakti is one of the best here and u can also try some Mocktails like Berry Blast, Orange Mojito if you want. Price is slightly on the higher side of the graph but the food is worth it. This place is going to bamboozle you with its menu.

Overall i had a good experience. When we reached it was not full (on a Sunday night) because of which we had no issue with the service and ambiance was also quiet (which i was looking for).

Food was fine. I ordered one cocktail drink and for starters ordered dahi kabab and prawn cocktail. Dahi kabab was delicious but i was disappointed with the later as it was served cold. I know cocktails in general are cold but they should have informed at least. Who likes cold prawns!

In mains ordered parda naan (naan sprinkled with sesame seeds) and one vegetable dish. Both were fine.

Good for a casual dining.

We happened to have lunch here but the staff seemed all sleepy and over worked. 

The chicken corn soup was nice , the caeser salad could have been better , the Chinese was a tad bit better ... tried the bekti in black pepper sauce ( great flavour  ) with a mixed meat Fried rice ... 4/5


The desserts were just ok ...

Wish they'd put more heart into everything as they had into the fish dish.

I would have given them a 4/5 But something is stopping me from doing so ...

Dunno if it's the seepage in the walls or the arid smell of the upholstery or the casual attitude of half the staff ... get your act right people  ( Marcopolo) you have a great property... fix it

The service bearers are extremely well behaved and always help us pick something different than what we order usually. They really understand what we want and give us a very good Sunday family luncheon experience. 

A MUST VISIT FOR ALL NORTH INDIAN LOVERS WHO LIKE TO HAVE A PEACEFUL SUNDAY LUNCH WITH FAMILY AT A VERY GOOD RESTAURANT WITH A QUALITY SERVICE, NO WAIT FOR TABLE, AND EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD FOOD. 

One of the best restaurants in Park Street with a very good ambience, quality food, fantastic service, and fairly less crowd. The total bill may seem a bit higher than most other restaurants in the area. However, I personally prefer paying a bit extra for better food ambience, and service.

This is an old one, in the same building as Mamagoto.
Went with a colleague for a couple of drinks.

I love how they've essentially created two floors of seating by taking advantage of the high ceiling. Beautiful decor. The lighting's perfect too and compliments the paintings on the walls very well.

We ordered whisky, slightly overpriced.
For starters, we ordered Smoked Fish in Barbeque Sauce, Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce and Pan Fried Chilli Fish. Delicious, all of them, especially the smoked fish.

For mains, we ordered Chicken noodles and Fish in Spicy Shanghai Sauce. The noodles, average. The fish, good enough to pack a serving for home.

Overall, very good. And unbelievably courteous staff. The last order's at 10.45. We stayed till 11.30 even after finishing and paying the bill. They pulled the shutter down only after we left.

I'd heard a lot about this place and its heritage, etc. Finally visited yesterday and returned with very mixed feelings about it. The place was almost empty and seemed to be very sombre. It's a super classy, high-end place. The decor is great and the ambiance makes you feel nice. A nice place if you want some quiet time with someone. It's also quite huge!

They take a lot of time to serve. We ordered two Fresh Lime Sodas and they served that without straws. I mean, it's basic that you'd expect straws from a restuarant like this. The Fresh Lime wasn't even served in a glass that could make drinking from it easier. 

We ordered a Chinese Appetiser- Lemon Crispy Chicken. It was cooked well and tasted good but nothing that I'd remember and it wasn't something that particularly stood out. I opted for a Spaghetti Aglio Olio while my friend ordered the Chicken Steak. He really liked the steak. The Spaghetti was average. It should have been cooked a bit more and should have been softer. I've had far better Aglio Olios so it was a tad bit disappointing.

One day i was scrolling through facebook homepage before puja and i came to a picture showing that there is a buffet during puja days in 'Marco Polo'.

After seeing this i didn't want to miss that golden chance and then and there made the plan and went there on Oshtomi 2017.

Location- beside barbeque nation park street.

Decoration- perfect including lighting and all,looked beautiful and eyecatchingüòé

Ambience-i felt comfortable and it was great to be there as i was already excited so the happiness was too highüòÉ

After being welcomed with a sweet smile and taking our seats i went to take my buffet items and before that-
 i ordered a sweet fresh lime soda which is a must item for a full course meal wherever i go and it was complimentary and u can count on me that it was the best ever sweet lime soda of all that i tasted,just amizing,i loved it‚ù§ and some other soft drinks were also available.

Here are the following items-
STARTERS :
1. Mutton shammi kabab- it was so so.
2. Fish balls in barbeque sauce- tasty,chatpata kind of feelingüòã
3. Crispy chilli baby corn-my all-time favourite in veg items and it was good üòä
4. Paneer tikka- yummy it was,so soft and properly madeüòÄ
5. Kaichi chicken wings- great tasteüëå
6. Murgh tikka dilum-mouthwatering,as i took this one 2 or 3 timesüòã
7. Salad-good presentation
8. Green chatni-nice taste.

MAIN COURSE :
1. Shikandari dum biriyani-normal taste but yahh nice one.
2. Raita- best everüòç
3.. Hyderabadi murgh masala- nice taste.
4. Grilled vetki with lemon butter- of all the items this is what i felt was showstopperüòâ
5. Jumbo prawn-2nd position in that previous caseüòâ
6. Dal makhani- good.
7. Egg hakka noodles- i tasted a spoonful and i found it quite good. 
8. Paneer jhal farezi- another paneer item which was successful in making me impressed. 
9. Indian bread- it became really hard i donno why but i guess if it was normal then it would have tasted well.
10. Steamed Rice-properly cooked.

DESSERTS :
1. Darsaan- it was really a good one i tasted something newüòå
2. Chocolate moose- chocolate is my favourite and this was too goodüòÅ
3. Shahi tukda- nicely made and i had many if themüëå
4. Vanilla ice cream- don't like the flavour much but it was good.

All over the experience over there was so good that i cannot describe in words,starting from the service to the food everything was commendable except 1 or 2 things that i mentioned in the food section..

Will surely come again for having ala carte menuüòÄ

Highly recommendedüòé

Liked the food. Wide range of items in the menu. Taste and presentation is also very nice. The bad part was the service and the behavior. We went in a group of five on last weekend. I hope friends meet up on weekends to spend some good time and for doing chit chat and we were exactly doing that. But we were asked to keep quite by one of the waiter , as per him we were talking a bit loud. 
If this is how they behave then I must think twice before my next visit. We really not liked the service at all.. 
The second incident was while we paid the bill by card that waiter suddenly came and said that the service charge is not included with the bill. Although the restaurant has already charged approx 800 rs for GST but we did not utter a single word and paid a decent amount of tips.

Today we had lunch in this restaurant.we ordered Chello kabab,1spagetti carbonara and spaghetti  bolognese and murg malai kabab.The kabab was well cooked but I liked the malai over the kabab.It was so delicious that I couldn't help to control myself and licked the malai from the plate üòã.Chello kabab was ok.not so good.sapagetti carbonara was good but I didn't like the spaghetti bolognese.i found this dish much better in other restaurants earlier.portion is not sufficient and portion wise the dishes are overpriced.

This place serves great Chinese and continental food. The interior is great. We tried the lamb and it was delicious and so were the noodles and fish. Even, salt and pepper mushrooms were pretty good. In short, they excel in the food. However, the wooden floor creaks and it is kind of a ruiner. The place is very dim lit. Also, the waiting time after you place your order and you receive your food on your plate is quite high. They take minimum 15 minutes to fulfil your order. Staff is very courteous.

I have only one thing to say....THIS. IS. THE. BEST. PLACE. EVER. I went there with my family thrice this year and I'll keep on going back for a lot more years to come. The food is as good as the service of the staff. They are very attentive, even at 12:00 at night.
We ordered the fried chilli and lemon chicken as starters with Gin n' Sin cocktail and RC. The cocktail was a perfect blend with a bittersweet taste and the chicken was beyond compare. The main course was Spheggetti lamb bolognese and Chicken Hara Dhania with Masala kulcha. These too were finger licking good. The cocktails were sooo perfect that we ordered another round with the main course. Last but not the least....dessert...Cr√®me Caramel. I will agree that this particular dessert was not up to the standard expected, but it was still good.
To top it all off....the ambience was absolutely mind blowing but also soothing.
Conclusion: Marco Polo has made a place and a well deserved name for itself in a vast chain of exclusive restaurants and if they continue this standard, the name will be heard for more years to come.

Have heard of this place for long time but never got a chance to visit.finally made it this time..ambiance is very nice with nice courteous staff..food I had a lot of expectation..what I felt is the food is normal and there is no much uniqueness in the food we ordered pasta which was tasty indeed but to much of spicy and oily,which was kind of turnoff..French fries was coated with shezwan sauce which spoiled the taste of the fries..veg cheese spinach roll was nice ..chicken stroganoff is what I loved..rest everything was tasty..overall nice experience

This is a restaurant of long legacy or may I say Lost Legacy? The heritage of this place is impeccable. The status symbolism of this place can well be compared with owning an apple device.
It is located at posh Park Street location. Parking was not very difficult even on a Sunday (it's lonely at the top, right?). The restaurant covers a humongous area on such high end locality. It's super spacious. Distance between tables needs special mention. A ping pong match can be arranged in between 2 tables. The ambiance was soothing, stuff were utmost cordial.
Now about the food. Oh wait, first the delivery time. Any item will take at least 20mins to deliver, even dessert. Yes u read it right, even dessert. We ordered some continental items. But obviously due to less quantity we couldn't be full, thus had to order few Chinese items as well. Needless to say all items tasted great. But not extra ordinary. In yesteryears probably their menu was unique but now there are ample number of better players. They have to keep up with the competition.

Pros:
1. Location
2. Spacious
3. Cordial stuff

Cons:
1. Long delivery time.
2. Low quantity compared to high price.
3. Food Quality is great but not extra ordinary.

Visited this place on girlfriend's birthday and these guyz made the day even more special . 
Two things about them that definitely demands a mention : 
1. FOOD : EXCELLENT is an understatement . Both taste and presentation , just wow ! 

2. HOSPITALITY : From the waiters to the manager everyone is so well behaved ! The person who greets you right when you enter , needs a special mention . We had to wait for like 15 minutes and during that time , when i asked him , he gave a clear overview about their outlet , what are the special menus they serve and that somehow made me feel , Marcopolo is different than the other restros in park st. These guyz are preety awesome and humble at the same time .

Marco Polo has been a pretty steady act for quite some time. This time round we tried the Sopa de Mariscos, chicken wantons and barbecued bekti for appetisers. The soup has a pleasant mild taste but is rather light on the prawn/fish content given its pricing. The wantons and bekti were quite good with the barbecue sauce being a bit towards the sweet side. The Bekti Meuniere turned out to be a delectable main course with a mild lemon cream sauce and parsley/butter flavoured rice. The Lebanese lamb chops though were again rather sweet though the meat was delightfully tender. The tutti frutti and ice cream sandwich were both satisfactory as desserts.
P.S. While ordering continental cuisine do verify if it is going to be sweet. Meat and sweet may not be too pleasing to the Indian palate. Also maybe stick to the tried and tested soups.

Park Street being the abode of delicious Chinese food serving restaurants, this place too lives upto its expectations.

My love for dimly lit places adds an extra thumbs up to the ambience. Good food, economical and courteous staff.
Although the quality of food is very good, a tad bit disappointed with the quantity on plate.

The spicy lemon fried chicken from the Chinese starters were one of the best I ever had. The lemon tinge added to the spices satiates your inner foodie. The other dishes tasted pretty well too but this deserved an honorable mention.

Overall a nice experience and will look forward to coming back again :)

One of the many famed names in the Kolkata food arena tat sadfully I hv missed...finally made to the Marco-Polo with my collegues on a Friday evning...
dark and soothing the ambience is perfect for a early weekend brunch topped with alc..Service was prompt and to the mark and since the late afternoon or early evning didn't see much crowd we were swiftly attended.....Coming to the food..Its one of the best place to try continental dishes and if you are a fan of Masterchef Australia or if you are a foodie interested in continental lineup this place is sure to tantalize your taste buds...Must try is the Chicken Stronganoff,The Lamb and Pork chops,Grilled Bhetki to name a few....and u can wash it down with some alcohol if you want..Price is slightly on the higher side of the graph but the food is worth it...only u myt not find some regular routine dishes available if u go late otherwise this place is going to bamboozle you with its menu...

Best place for a quiet date or a quiet night out. Calm ambience with dim lights to soothe your soul. 

This restaurant justifies it's status as one of the best in the city! With sumptuous food and awesome decor and even better ambience, if you haven't visited this place, you're missing out on gold! A bit costly, but every good thing comes with a price right? 

Loved it, and plan to visit it again someday maybe.

Marco polo had always been in my bucket list but somehow due to various reasons I could not make to the place.  Yesterday thankfully my friend treated me there  and the place went off my bucket list.  :) 

Situated beside mama goto in parks Street,  the place reflects sheer elegance and calmness.  The waiters are extremely polite and well  behaved.  I liked the ambience a lot. 

Now the food- we had ordered for prawn cocktails ajwaini  mahi  tikka as the starters and to complement them we ordered ginger Gill,  sunrise point and angel's share in the mocktails.  
The menu on the starter list was very good.  Especially the prawn cocktail.  The fish tikka was good too.  
For the evening we chose continental as our main course menu. 
We ordered penne Al  pollo,  Bhetki A la  meuniere,  chicken steak poivrade. All the dishes were good.  Only the steak was a little dry.  One good thing that for the pasta and spaghetti you can personalise and choose your sauce and whether you want chicken, prawn or lamb or nothing.  
Overall a very good evening spent over good food.  :)

Visited this place on ashtami for lunch. They were having lunch buffet. They had a lavish spread with lots of options. In the starters I really liked the chicken wings. There were fpur other non veg options as well, but they weren't anything special. 
In the maincourae the chinese section was better than the Indian dishes. The chilly prawn was mind blowing . But the Biriyani disappointed us. The taste was bland. Grilled bhetki is also worth mentioning
What real3 stood out was their dessert section. No buffet place I have experienced before had the items. It consisted of chocolate mousse , shahi tukda, darsan, and vanilla ice cream. The chocolate mousse amd shahi tukda will leave you craving for more, bit unfortunately we were too full to stomach any more. 
Coming to the price, they billed us for RS1000 each taxes extra. So the whole amount came out to be 2360. Considering the pujas I found it pretty decent. 
We ate a lot. Though every item was not mind blowing, and some items even below expectations, we enjoyed our time and lived the ambience.

Been here during pujas. Well it was less crowded thankfully. They have lower the rates which is again amazing. Food quality was good. Nothing very special about any dish. Fettuchi Maria.. it was a spaghetti pasta with chicken.It tasted different from the other pastas which we usually have. So must try this one. Apart from all these the major problem is service. Extremely bad quality of service. Totally disappointed. They are careless and always is a rush to serve food.  I was cutting the  cake since it was my birthday but we waited for an whole of one hour then they served us water. I mean I was thristy af. The waiters don't even listen to the calls of the customer. And one of them were so dumb that he forgot to see we were four people on the table. He poured the water in three glasses instead of four. Such irresponsible people! They need good training. Moreover there were less number of waiters and a hell lot of customers. So the management needs to solve this problem. This is just nothing but putting a bad impression on the customer service.
Overall view about food and quality is is not bad. So I rate 3.5
Oh yes they have a very good ambience. Cosy and comfortable. If someone wants to have dinner can try Marco Polo. And also good for parties and celebration.

In search for a place to have family dinner, decided to have a visit here. Traditionally it is very well known. However, since we had not visited this place earlier and being one of the few good places which served both Chinese and Indian, we decided upon this.
Started off with Lung Fung Soup and Chicken Malai Tikka. Didn't quite like the malai tikka as it could surely have been prepared better. Also had pan fried fish and again found this to be little on spicier side than generally pan fried dishes are. Soup was good and nothing much can go wrong here. The main course is what was impressive - Chicken Pan Fried Noodles, Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce, Garlic Chicken, Chicken Makhani and Butter Naan. Must appreciate Pan fried noodles as it was different and well prepared. Also must mention Butter Naan which was amazingly soft and one of the best naan I have ever had.
Overall good family restaurant and can be supplemented for other purposes as well because ambience and decor is good.

This was my first visit to the place and was impressed. The decor and setup is nice and the staffs are courteous. 
We started off with chicken Lung Fung soup which was quite good. This was followed by Afghani chicken kebabs and Pan-fried chilli fish which were equally tasty.
For the main course we ordered tandoori roti and butter chicken tikka masala and it was an instant hit. 
Most of us were in mood for some Chinese main course and hence we ordered chicken pan fried noodles. This was one of the best and authentic Pan Fried noodles (other places serve the Cantonese noodles in the name of Pan Fried noodles). For sides we ordered pepper chicken and garlic chicken. The former was good but the latter was the least liked item of the night.
To end with, there was a gamut of mouth freshners which when mixed together gave the feel of opening up a sweet paan and eating out the masalas inside. üòÄ
I will definitely come back again.

I visited this place on 17th of September,2017. So at around 3:00 pm we have reached there. 
We had ordered grilled bhetki, murg malai nazaqat, murg tikka dilmun, chicken fried rice, fish in garlic sauce, mutton biryani, fried fish, chilli prawn.
The food was proper. Not very good though, specially the saut√© veggies were undercooked and oily. It was not upto the mark. The rest of the food was okay. 
Quantity was a bit less and pocket pinch a bit high.
The waiter was courteous though.
And the service was a bit slow.

Anyone who has played Age of Empires 2 knows that the cheat code Marco Polo opened up the whole map along with treasures in the games!!Well Marco Polo has been a sort of treasure for gastronomic experience of kolkata for some time now!!And hence 5 of us decided to have a go
Ambience-Excellent dim lighting..lovely surroudings and a brilliant atmosphere..with comfy seating arrangement
Food-We ordered Grilled pork chop,lamb chop, grilled pork rib,sliced chicken in tobanjan sauce,schezuan fried rice,yang chow fried rice,chicken stroganhoff,grilled betki and caramel custard..
All items were top notch but the pork chops,grilled pork,caramel custard,lamb chops were heavenly and easily falls under the best continental i had in a while

Only let down for us was chicken stroganhoff which didnt meet our expectations..had tasted better versions before
Staff-Courteous,polite and well behaved
Cost-On the higher side compared to portion but the overall service somehow makes up for it
Overall recommended for a fine dining experience!!would be going back definitely!!

Such an amazing ambience, the interior is soothing.
We had ordered quite a few dishes.
Among them bhetki was the best. Food quality is really in here and so are the services. Just takes a little long time after you order. Other then that everything was good. They have very good items in the 'grill' section.
Surely a 'must visit' place.

Its a quiet place to be in if you are aware of the noisy environment that one finds in restaraunts located on Park Street. It serves Chinese, Continental and Indian cuisine. The best part is that they have small..individual size servings of starters enabling small groups or a family to mix and match. The bar is well stocked. The pricing is reasonable if you consider the ambience and food quality. The service is good. Another plus point is that the tables are well spaced....you dont feel as if someone else is looking down your throat. The place deserves a visit for sure and then I leave it on your personal liking.....üòÄ

I am very much disappointed as I'm writing this review about a very Well known restaurant in Kolkata... 
We had reached there by 3 in the afternoon.. The place is almost empty. As soon as we have settled "The Manager" informed that If we had to order any Mughlai or Bengali cuisine thn the order must be done as early as possible coz Kitchen is going to close soon.. üò±.. Utmost inefficiency on part of such a big house.. So we decided to skip Bengali cuisine.
We ordered 
1. A fish starters claimed to be made of Pure Bhetki... But Can you all imagine... Its made of some poor quality fish.. and some part of it had bad smell.. not only that they didn't even bother to serve any sauce or pepper with it... Complete waste of money.
2. Chicken Cantonese Noodles : I never had such a tasteless noodles in my life... Yyeeaakkkk... 
3. Conjee crispy lamb : Okay.. Quality of the lamb is fine.. but again taste is missing.. 
   So in a nutshell.. Complete waste of money... 1035 rupees of mine gone with the wind.
N.B. - As we are having our disastrous food, one of the visitors were also complaining about Tandoori Roti.. As they were completely brunt.

Well ,we visited this particular restaurant around 3.30 p.m. And the first thing that they told to us was that ,we can order only from the Tandoor and Chinese section and not from the Indian section. That did put us a little bit off , but anyway we ordered from Chinese section , which consisted of very few countable items. Anyway.
We ordered :-
Crumb Fried Prawns (The taste was fine but the quantity was ‚Äúvery‚Äù ‚Äúvery‚Äù small in accordance with the price they charge for this particular dish. Actually, in a huge plate 2 ‚Äúmini‚Äù prawns were served , with a bit of decorations.)
Konjee Crispy Lamb ( It tasted okayish. Actually , the deeply fried crispy strips of meat were crispy to such an extent that it was hard to determine that those strips were meat of lamb or chicken or what )
	Yang Chow Fried Rice [chicken] ( Well, this probably was the only dish l actually liked. It tasted quite good.)
	Szechwan Chicken ( It was spicy and a bit too hot. But that‚Äôs what Szechwan chicken is all about. Therefore fine , but nothing extraordinary or fantastic.)	  (They both tasted sweet and that‚Äôs all.)


The good part about this restaurant is that the ambience of this restaurant is fantastic. The d√©cor was fine . It is well styled .
But the service is just horrible. And the menu should have more variety.

This place oozes of a old charm with nice classy interior. But food is expensive when you compare the quantity they serve. Continental, Chinese, Indian all cuisines are present in their menu. The staffs are courteous, delivery is prompt. Go there if you want to splurge for food that would satisfy neither your tummy nor your taste buds.

I usually see a very high rating for Marco Polo. Maybe I had an unlucky day but my single visit there was so disappointing that I might not visit it ever.

It was the Saptami of 2016 durga puja. A time when you would expect all the restaurants at Kolkata to be at peak of service. We reached around 12 pm. Followed the manager through the wonderful decor to the mezanine floor where he gave us a table. Two minutes seated a cockroack walked over the table. I informed the attendent nearby. He said a 'oh' and that's it! Though surprised I ignored the casual approach and concentrated ob the menu. When questioned about a few options they weren't available. Hmm...then on asking they advised some delicacies which we ordered. The food was good but half-way through lunch another cockroach crossed the table. This time I informed the manager. He asked one of the helpers to see if anymore are there and thats it! That also helped me to come to my conclusion of the place.

Pros - Very nice decor but thats it! Food tasted good but I wondered how many cockraches have tried that before me.

Cons- Unhygienic; careless attitude to complaints; compartively over-priced to Petercat/Mocambo

Went there for a date night.. Ordered all continental dishes namely the chicken povirade, the fish ala muniere and the jumbo prawn thermidor. They gave complimentary bread rolls to go with the dishes..For drinks I got the pink heaven and my partner got beer. Everything was brilliant. We had the best continental food in a while. The mocktail was also soo yummy comprising of lychee strawberries and pinapple. We had decided to order one more dish and a dessert but in the end of three amazing dishes we had no space left in our stomach. Definately a 5.0 experience. Worth every penny.

Marco Polo at Park Street has been a highly visited restaurant for a long time. The interiors may be bit dark & gloomy, but the food certainly is mouth-watering & lives up to expectations. We had ordered Hilsa Sorse (since there was a Hilsa festival going on in their menu). The hilsa was soft & well cooked, totally boneless.. Though the hilsa fish by itself did not have much taste... Next we tried grilled bhetki which was superb. Finally we also ordered Chinese dishes Mixed fried rice and Chicken in black pepper sauce. The quantity was abundant so much that we were filled up & had to parcel the rest. The Chinese dishes were okay especially the fried rice. All in all Marco Polo offers good quality food at a pricey range. Ideal for special occasion treats though. However I wish they would make the interior decoration bit more cheerful as the black walls & black chairs seemed kinda melancholy to me.

This was my first visit to Marco Polo. Located in a very convenient place, Marco Polo has a good ambience and courteous staff. Coming to the food. We had the lebanese lamb chops which was really delicious and I would recommend this to everyone. Then we had the deep-fried chili potato which was good but a little spicy. So if you like spicy food, you can go for this. For the main course, we ordered veg fried rice, paneer butter masala and pan fried chili fish. All were good but the fried rice could have been a little better. Along with these, I had two mocktails, pink heaven and sunset point. The pink heaven was better than the latter I think. We did not order any desert because it was my birthday and I had already eaten so much chocolate cake beforehand, so I cannot tell you about that. But if any of you have any recommendations regarding the desserts here, you can tell me. I'll definitely try them the next time. Overall, it was a good experience.

I went to this place with my wife to celebrate our 6months marriage anniversary. It was an amazinggggggggggggg experience all together. Lets start with food.
In starters we ordered crumb fried prawns and spicy lemon fried chicken along with a Long Island Ice Tea and a pineapple juice.
Both the starters were delicious specially the lemon fried chicken.
In the main course we ordered 1 Jumbo prawn thermidor and 1 Grilled pork chop. Both of us had the best continental dishes of our life. Its way better than Mocambo.
In the dessert we had Creme Caramel which was perfectly made to sweeten your tooth at the end.
All of these cost us around 2k which according to us was pretty reasonable considering the dishes we had.

The interior decor was really classy with chocolate and white based walls and dining arrangements. This gives you a perfect ambience for dinner.

The staff were really prompt and courteous.

Overall a perfect place to dine in at Park Street.

Visited this place a month ago though still here writing the review of the place.As it is almost in the heart of the park street just next to mamagoto it can be easily located. We were there in rainy afternoons when the place was not busy at all. Only a few customers were there. Coming to the nxt part of food i would say that the place is overrated in zomato. It average in taste though u might be amazed with the quantity. Coming to the decor it's really soothing with some good woody pieces on the wall. And the ambience is getting enhanced by some good low intensity lights. Talking about the staff they are really courteous with a good hospitality. But  about the service they took a pretty long time to get the food delivered on the table. Even we had to wait for a long time for the main course after appetizers and it really sucks. They really need to improvise their service if they are interested in higher ratings.

2) Jumbo prawn thermidor- I've loved d prawn here!! Its too much uncommon dish , I've visited too many restaurant , but still this types of dishes , I've never found anywhere. I'll suggest to try it.. 
3) Schezuan fried rice - Very good. If u think u will take it 1 plate for two , then u will make out  that it's not enough for two people . But the recipe is wow!!
4) Hookien chicken - Different kind of taste , marvelous...
5) Tuttifrutti - Just amazing!!

The staff is very very nice and responsive
I made a boo boo today and broke a glass by mistake, but they were very helpful
Ordered the following and trust me.. everything was good, the dessert though was to die for

I used to love this place 2 to 3 years back. I went there yesterday after a long time, and had my first heartache.

Their ambience is no doubt really good, and their staff is courteous. It's their food which is a let down.

We ordered the Murgh Malai Nazaqat, which doesnt really dissappoint, but used to be better. Then comes the Jujeh kebab, which was a huge dissappointment. The meat lacked proper flavour. Finally the barbeque smoked fish, which as the name suggest is just fish cooked in barbeque sauce.

Then in the mains, we had a Chicken Stroganoff with rice that made us cry. It lacked any flavour that a good Stroganoff should have. I couldnt taste the wine, the sauce was too thick for the meat, which was a layered and clattered mess.
We also had a Fettuccini Maria, which used to be my favourite pasta dish in all the city back in my high school days. Now, it is just a shadow of its former self. The fettucini pasta itself was okay probably because their chef knows how to boil pasta and that's about it. The sauce lacked any of the flavour it should, the cherry tomatoes were all over the place. It was too watery and lacked any creaminess that a good pasta sauce typically should. It was worse because of how fond I used to be of this dish.
The Lebanese Lamb Chop tried to save face. It was beautifully presented, amazingly decorated and well garnished. It had lamb shanks on a bed of flavoured mashed potatoes. The potatoes for some reason tasted really good, the meat, not at all. It wasn't too well cooked, sticking to the bone, and being too chewy to classify as food from fine dining. It wasnt well glazed with saue and failed to absorb the flavour.

For desserts we had a chocolate mousse, an ice cream sandwhich and a caramel custard. I must say, the desserts were pretty spot on, and the ice cream sandwhich was just a darling to look at and eat too. The mousse was thick and consistant and the custard was wobbly, exactly how I like my custards.

We also had 2 mocktails, a Pink Heaven and a Mediterranean Delight, both of which were impressive but I've had better.

Now, coming to quantity. Their initial quantity was less anyway, but they have reduced it further under the pretext of avoiding food wastage which honestly pissed me off. For that price, some new places will feed your family for 2 days. They say they've reduced both the price and the quantity, but the quantity has reduced more. They now give 2 kebabs for Rs 100 which is honestly very arrogant according to me. Their washrooms were dirty, wet and didnt have water. Even roadside dhabas have this better. The fine dining tag is questionable. This place used to be a favourite. Not anymore.

Perfect for a quiet date evening! The ambience is so calm and relaxing, unless you have the misfortune of being seated next to a group of noisy people. The service is prompt, the food is affordable and the overall atmosphere puts one at ease. The starter portions are just meant for one. So don't rely on one plate of starters to feed two! The quantity of the main course dishes is sufficient for three people of moderate appetite. Loved the dal makhani, dahi kabab, butter chicken and achari kabab. Definitely one of the better North Indian food places in kolkata.

Marco Polo is undoubtedly the best place for dining in Park Street Area. Last Saturday me and my sister went there for Lunch and we were totally mesmerized by the ambience, the quality of food and service. We ordered Grilled Betki, Afghan Murg Tandoori and last but not the least Chelo Kebab along with Cosmopolitan and Apple Blast cocktails. The food worth every penny you spend on it. 

Once you visit Marco Polo you will feel like visiting again and again! :) :)

Situated at a prime location of Park Street, this is inarguably one of the best places in the city.

We went there on a Sunday evening. Although there was rush but the service was really upto the expectation.

We ordered Chinese starters which were finger-licking good. The main courses included Lamb chops, Chicken steak,Fish Mornay and Chicken Pasta in white sauce which were so tasty, delicious and so sumptuous to look at . The dishes were so nicely decorated and served that it really impressed us.

The staffs were very courteous and generous.

Total of 18% tax on Food (9% CGST + 9% SGST) and no tax on alcohols, but this is temporary and exempted for some new GST roll out implementation effect . 
The only thing that needs to improve is the variety of desserts. The options are really limited.

Overall a very nice place to visit with friends and family. Highly Recommended !!

Bon Appetit!

In order to get the fine dining experience we went for,
‚Ä¢Murg Malai Nazakat: tender & juicy pieces of chicken marinated in white sauce topped with curd.
‚Ä¢Murg Tikka Dilmun: usual chicken tikka kebab.
‚Ä¢Jujeh Kebab: a persian kebab which had its own flavour of uniqueness.
It is to be noted that all kebabs are served in TWO pieces only.
‚Ä¢Pan Fried Chili Fish: big slices of fish properly fried & tossed in a very spicy chilli sauce. Highly Recommended for spicy lovers.
‚Ä¢Yang Chow Fried Rice: a very subtle rice will go with any gravy.
‚Ä¢Chilli Garlic Noodles: Usual noodles as found in many other joints.
‚Ä¢Chicken in Tobanjan Sauce: sliced chicken in red gravy had a little tangy flavour to it. Went well with the rice.
‚Ä¢Grilled Pork Chops: surely the show stopper, a huge chop grilled to perfection served with nutty mushroom sauce sided with some veggies, bread & butter.
I have to say except the kebabs all the other food portions were quite sufficient.
Fine dining itself asks to pay a lil more from the pocket no doubt in that.
Overall a very good experience, satisfied with the prompt service, points cut for limited options on the menu.
P.S. They only charge GST as additional tax.

I just love the prawns here! Everything they make is amazing. Although they have an option for indian food I would recommend you to eat Chinese there. If you're looking for a place for family dinner this is perfect.

Marco Polo is one among the many great family restaurants at park street.
The place was very spacious and the ambience was great.
As it was a weekday there wasnt any rush or crowd.
We had cocktails, Green Apple Margarita, fresh lime soda and Pina Colada. Margarita was nicely punched.
The pina colada could have been better.
 
We had a variety of starters. Drums of Heaven, Chicken Afghani kebab and Kakori kebab.
Honestly, didnt like any of the starters, all tasted average. 

For main course there was chicken fried rice along with Zhai Zhao chicken and crispy chicken in honey sauce.
The items were decent, liked the Zhai Zhao chicken.
The honey chicken was too much sweet but was going well with the rice.
The rice was good but was very little in proportion.
We had order two bowls of rice thinking it would be enough for the four of us but what they gave seemed like it was for single person.
Yes, this place has an issue with the quantity.
The quantity is really poor.

For dessert we had chocolate mousse and walnut brownie.
The dessert were also small in quantity but well I really liked the chocolate mousse.
It was perfect and thats why I couldn't deduct more then one from their rating.
The brownie was decent too.

Overall a good place.
Expense is high and it really pinches as the quantity is very little.
They should improve their quantity.
I also felt that they should incorporate some more items in their menu.
Worth a try but their food portions may upset you.

Going there regularly since my childhood,this eatery maybe  turns out to be my most visited restaurant. I have paid my visit to this particular outlet numerous times but for the Southern Avenue outlet,I wish to increase the count. Anyways,this restaurant has large dining halls with a soothing ambience. I always prefer for the comfortable couches while eating here. I had tried out many of their dishes-

Chelo Kabab,Dahi Chicken Kabab,Grilled Vetki,Murg Biryani,Crispy Babycorn,Pan Fried Noodles,Fish in Shanghai Sauce, Chicken 'something'( Gosh! I don't remember the name!).

The Chelo Kabab is not so good as the Peter Cat one but still it's a good pick.
You can definitely opt for their Kebabs and Murgh Biryani. The Biryani is light but it tastes heavenly. If you have love for lamb,then you can also settle for their Sikander Biryani.
Quantity of the Biryani is fair and the taste is awesome.

For dessert, I only had their Darsan. It rightly matched my sweet tooth.

Staffs are courteous. Ambience- I have already said,it's mind blowing.
Price was a bit high but every penny is worth it. Highly recommended!

We liked the food and service but was disappointed with the cost cutting strategy of the restaurant - no toilet paper or hand tissues in the washrooms. What kind of an upscale, premium, fine dining restaurant doesn't keep toilet paper in the washroom? 
Dear management, for God's sake, find a different method for  cutting costs but do not deprive your customers of a pleasant, clean, hygienic washroom experience. Don't be so cheap. Am sure your restaurant can afford toilet paper rolls.

0n a rainy aftern00n, Parkstreet 0ffered us this beautiful fine dining that is quite aged and pr0minently situated opposite to the Park Street P.0.
Their c0ntinental dishes taste distinctive. But in c0mparis0n t0 the price, they can definitely c0nsider increasing the proportions specially the starters - Milanese Fried Chicken and Crumbed Bhekti - that plated only 1 flaky piece respectively. The Chicken Steak craved the presence of mashed p0tat0es and a little bit more boiled veggies. The Chell0 Kebab with the Lamb-Chicken kebab c0mb0 was h0wever superb!

Being a foodie my wife spoke to them about them about different taste but guy insisted that it was schezwan only. Staff was not attending at all and they were busy among themselves.

Let me start with the good part. The food was worth food binge. Over and over again. It was that great. But then why such an obnoxious rating right?
Well then here comes the catastrophe:-
1) Though the food tasted like paradise in mouth, the amount served was reminiscent to a 'teaser', so to speak. Maybe that is their way of incurring second serving by their customers. So if you are not the one who worries about tummy flab, think twice before you go to this place, you might end up returning to stir up some Maggi for yourself.
2) We kept on waiting for at least 15 minutes before the menu booklet was served to us. However, waiting for two other members to arrive we ourselves were killing time doing this and that. So were the expertise in hospitality then, waiting for us to stop clicking selfies to serve the menu? :0 estrange isn't it?
3) The menu was served after all- and to our horror, along with a menu booklet we received a complimentary cockroach. The menu booklet was changed.
4) while we wanted to access the ladies restroom, we had to return in utter disgust, because the state of it made us fear we might just be embraced by UTI, a minute more in that place.
5) We were at our wits end however, during paying our cheque. So here is the climax for you. We decided to divide our bill in cash and card. The half amount was paid in cash and the nominal amount left to pay were to be divided equally between the two cards (due to the lack of smaller denominations of cash at our disposal). The amount to be debited from the two cards was around a mere amount of 600 or so. The waiter at aid, nodded his head in absolution, took the money and the cards and deducted THE ENTIRE BILL AMOUNT FROM MY CARD. They were delving into further cacophony and confusion by trying to cancel that debited amount, without realizing that ONCE AN AMOUNT IS DEBITED, ONE CANNOT GET IT CREDITED AGAIN.
6) Icing on the cake, while we were waiting for our ride back home, the staff there made a passing comment at us saying "no tips".
Here's to that staff and on his face - well Sir your service did not even deserve the payment for the food , leave alone an extra tip. Also, your service charges are always added to the tax we pay to eat in your "fine dinings", so please Sir, educate yourself on the same lines and for Lord's sake, improve the service and maintain those loos. It's more than sickening. Thanks .

Long story short - amazing food, good ambiance, all destroyed mercilessly by the most disgusting service ever. Beyond expectation from a dining chain like Marco Polo.

First of all the ambience of this restaurant is fantastic. Since it is surrounded by so many famous restaurants it is less crowded. No need to stand in a queue. We ordered chelo kabab, murg changezi and masala kulcha. Each and every dish was very tasty. I was a bit disappointed with the amount of food they serve. In murg changezi they served just 3 pieces of chicken. Staff behaviour was cordial.

It has been long since I wanted to visit Marco Polo and I finally visited this place. The ambience is warm and calm with dim lights creating a very romantic scene. 
So we ordered Old Fashioned. : Very tasty and smooth. The cocktail was accompanied by PRAWN COCKTAIL. Which was good but not so much quantity. 

In the mains we Ordered PORK CHOP and CHICKEN STRAGONOFF. 
First let's talk about PORK CHOP. This dish is a bliss to your taste buds with a beautiful tender meat. The mushroom accompanied with it was one of the best mushroom sides I have had. A perfect dish for a single serving. 

Second was Chicken Stragonoff. We ordered it with Mash Potatoes. Good quantity with really nice aroma. Tasted very good. Mash Potatoes was average but the chicken chunks we're very tasty. A 4/5 for this dish. 

Overall a beautiful experience and a satisfying visit to Marco Polo Park Street. I will surely visit this place once again.

Well, a very soothe d√©cor, nice ambience, very well trained nd well mannered staff...
We have ordered...
1.Jujeh Kabab....
2.Mix veg pulav (2plates).... Here, 1plate is more than enough for one.
3.Murg Changezi.(3pieces)
4. Malka -e -dariya(3pieces)
Quantity, quality ,taste all r just more than perfect.......
I would definitely love to go again , for their continental nd chinese platters. Our bill was Rs.1,175 exact incl.vat and taxes.
It have found is aptly reasonable.

One thing is certain.... At Marco Polo once you walk in and take a seat, you forget the world and just let the soothing ambience get to you. Relax, shut your eyes and play tic tac toe with the menu... cause the food is THAT GOOD. You can order with your eyes shut and for sure the food will not let you down. This restaurant has been serving the foodies of Kolkata with their delicacies for a long time now. And the high standards have been maintained.
On this particular visit we ordered Gambas Al Ajillo, Kakori kabab, Murgh Malai Nazaaqat for starters. The Kakori Kabab was so soft that it just melted in the mouth and was surely one of the highlights of the afternoon. Gambas Al Ajillo was a Prawn dish and was an innovative item. The Malai Nazaaqat was another delectable dish.
For mains we ordered Lebanese Lamb Chops, Chicken Steak Poivrade and Jumbo Prawn Thermidor.
The presentation of each item was esthetically pleasing. The mains were delightful and went very well along with perfectly toasted Garlic breads.
For desserts we ordered Walnut brownie and the brownies were some of the best that I have had in a long time. The service was exceptional...as always.
In the end, I can say that yes... the all round standards have been maintained. Very few in Kolkata can boast of that. Marco Polo sure can.

It is located in Park Street; just a crossing away from St.Xavier's College; Kolkata. The interior is v nice; the inside looks elegant with nice ambience. The food tastes good; the prices look less;but the portions per plate is less (like a plate of rice wil suffice only a single person) . The staff behaviour is good. A good place to dine wid friends and family.They have a separate bar facility.

The potato appetiser is filled with cheese and corn and served with a delectable thick dressing. Their service is also something that you would not complain about. It's a restaurant which you will not regret visiting.

We went to Marco Polo a week back. We ordered Lat Mei Kai in appetizers and it was brilliant. Just the way we expected it to be. In the main course we ordered Chicken Steak Poivrade and Betki a la Meuniere in the main course along with fresh lime sodas. The food was too good specially I loved the freshness of the fish. The staffs were very cordial and very courteous. The ambience was good as expected. 

The only negative thing which unfortunately happened was while taking the order order the staff asked us if we wanted to order Garlic Bread or not, we said yes, but it never arrived. We again asked them, but unfortunately it never arrived.

But despite the negative incident, the food was enough for us to give a thumbs up and recommend this restaurant to others. We are actually planning to visit this restaurant in the near future again.

This is my first visit there. As I have visited the place in the mid week so I don't have to wait. Before‚Äã reaching there I have checked the zomato reviews and the place is exactly like that. I really had a quality time. I have ordered afghani kebab, fried rice, black pepper chicken and ice cream sandwich. Ice cream sandwich is a must try. After having so much orders on the table you may think that it will put some strain in the bank account, but honestly I have experienced the reverse scenario. 
Food:-3.5/5
Ambience:- 4.5/5
Decor:- 4/5
Hospitality :- 4/5

N.B:- The most unique thing happened to me is when I was there some old japanese cartoon music was going on in the background. So its definitely enchanted me to resurrect my childhood days. üòäüòä

If you are looking for a romantic getaway in the middle of Park Street, this is the place! The classy decor, dimmed lights and soft music gives this restaurant a beautiful ambiance. Since it was a weekday afternoon, it was quite empty so that was an advantage. We started with the appetizers by ordering the Gambas al Ajillo- a pan fried prawn dish that tasted heavenly! From the tandoors we tried the Jujeh Kebab and Murg Tikka Dilmun, both of which were delicious. We were tempted to explore their Chinese section as well, so we ordered the Lat Mei Kai which was absolutely perfect! Coming to the Main Course, the Pardewali Nun with the Murg Tikka Makkhanwala (which really needs no explanation) tasted good. The Bekti a la Meuniere, a baked bhetki fish dish served with rice was unique and yum. This place is a bit on the expensive side because the quantity served for each dish in the starters is enough for only one person and so you'll have to order more. ¬†The service was fast, the staff was courteous and it was an interesting experience.

For starter we ordered Crumb fried prawn with sweet lime soda, size wasn't that great still we relished well.

And we had ordered 2plates of just one thing. Chicken steak! And the time taken to take the order is just another story. We didn't date to order anything else. Given that the food was fair enough. Steak lacked seasoning. Quantity was on the lesser side but then again the brand!

Marco polo a multi cuisine restaurant was on my must go to visit list for some time. We reached there for lunch on a family outing on a week day. The decor is nice..and we got down to our task with the huge menu. We ordered 3 diff mocktails...one lychee..one called Mediterranean beauty and 3rd one Angel's share. Tasted wonderful especially the lychee drink. Then came our starters...prawn cocktail..yummy...chkn kebab(2pieces)..and spinach cheese roll. All very tasty but why only 2 pieces make a plate is beyond me. Then we ordered cantonese rice noodles and sliced chkn mahti..chkn cooked in a spicy sesame sauce...very very tasty. One of us ordered fish meuniere...very fresh fish served with aromatic rice and veggies. Then came lebanese lamb chops..well cooked and melting in the mouth. The presentations were delightful. Lastly to satisfy our sweet cravings we ordered chocolate mousse..so..so in taste and creme caramel..light and very tasty. The prices are quite reasonable and an experience worth repeating.

It was saturday evening and we entered the place early (early for dinner) The place being nicely decorated with two floor of sitting araangement with just the right amount of luminary required for a  romantic cozy dine out. So we ordered for some drinks to start with and as straters with ordered spicy lemon fried chicken. It was really tasty and you can customise your degree of spice before ordering. Chicken pieces were tender. After that we ordered chicken fried rice and sliced chicken Mahti...as my friend didn't want to experiment much...since it was her 1st visit...Overall my experience with food was great..what pinched me most was the tax I had to pay...but thanks to Modi Govt. that future service tax in restaurants will be not mandatory....Looking forward for my next visit to Morcopolo, Park Street. They have another outlet in Kolkata.

I had the chicken steak poivrade. It was slightly dry, and definitely smaller in size than we anticipated. I also had the spinach cheese rolls. In all I found the food average but the presentation was brilliant. The staff was courteous, albeit slightly slow in responding, and we had to wait over half an hour for our food to arrive. Would recommend going there if fine dining is the objective.

I went here last evening, for the first time ever. The beauty and design of the dining halls took my breath away. Soothing music added to the pleasant atmosphere.
The following dishes were ordered:
Bruschetta : Though I hate tomatoes, I loved the Bruschetta. The garlic bread base is good, and the toppings with cheese makes the Bruschetta a great starter to try out.
¬†Kakori kebab: It was too tender and tasty. One long, hollow piece per plate.
¬†Murgh malai nazakat : The kabab was good. Nothing special about it. I've had better kababs, but still it was delicious
¬†Pan fried chicken noodles ¬†: This was simply AMAZING! One of the best I've had in the city till date. The quantity was okay for two people to share, along with other dishes
¬†Zhai Zhao chicken : Another excellent chinese dish ! It has an amazing flavour, and one has the option of taking the gravy or the dry variant. 8 pieces per plate. ¬†¬†
¬†Icecream sandwich : Honestly, I expected a slightly bigger size out of greed. It was great.

We had crispy chilly babycorn followed by chilly garlic noodles, Hakka noodles accompanied by vegetable coins. The food was good, really tasty but the service was so unwelcoming and so unaccommodating that it wasn't a pleasant visit and nor do I intend to visit again. Better to go to Mamagoto or Flavours of China.

Sumptuous amount of luscious food items is nothing but a piece of heaven on plate. Low light ambience sets up the perfect mod to enjoy the culinary recommend that this place offers. Staff is so courteous and service is equally pleasing. Pocket pinch is bit of a set back. Of course they charge big bucks but every penny is worth. I would love to visit this place soon but frankly speaking I can't. :P
Atleast not in coming 4 months. That's how costly this place is.

Had the unfortunate experience to order dinner from Marco Polo on Park Street on the 17th of April.
Strongly advise against anyone repeating my mistake.
Highly priced. Terribly small portions. Bland, tasteless, ordinary fare, unable to live uo to its promises, I felt cheated and vowed never to visit again.
the pork items (ribs) were just fat rendered.. no ribs at all.
the honey chicken was batter fried with capsicum and pineapple.
the chilly chicken while tasting good had lesser pieces as advertised.
maybe the problem lies with take away.

So it was my birthday and after a real long planning we decided to hit it out here as it was a favorite of my mother.¬†

The ambiance is really sassy, although i personally felt with a little more of light would have been perfect.
We started off with two appetizers as we had a prawn dish and a chicken satay to be precise that was prepared in thai style.

for coolants, we had 4 different drinks to refreshen us that involved orange syrup pinapple and mojitos

For main course we had pardewali naan with seasme seeds, and hyderabadi chicken dish as the side. we also ordered their classic dum phukt biriyani.

From the continental plate of theirs, we went for betki a al meuniere which was in a way a bit of a disaster as the fish was undercooked, but the white sauce was spot on.

For desserts we had the classic caramel pudding, which was a delight as always

As a name suggests you too can wander the elaborate choice of India and continental cuisine. Though it's a expensive place but the food and ambiance would definitely match up the tag. Though the mezzanine is brighter but the ground corners are bit gloomy. Culinary expectations would b fully match up...the starters be it chicken, fish or prawns or the the main course would definitely tickle your taste buds. My personal favorites are the baked bhetki and ice-cream sandwich.
Their other branch in Sarat Bose road(not sure of the park street) also organise hilsa festival in monsoon with a wide range of choices is a must visit.

Marco Polo is one of the oldest restaurants in Park Street and one of the major food attractions in the city. My wife and I decided to celebrate her birthday here. This was the first time for both of us. We had heard a lot about the place and it lived up to our expectations. We had ordered Chicken Stroganoff and Grilled Pork Chops, and both were delightful. We had also ordered Long Island Ice Tea and Creole Fish Fingers. Everything was just fantastic. It's a must try for all foodies!!

Went for lunch on 07/03/2017 with my fiancee. I was utterly disappointed to find that only items from tandoor and Chinese were available. Rest were not. So decided to try out murg malai and spicy lemon fried chicken.. the murg malai was mediocre, however the spicy lemon fried chicken was good. Rated 1.5 because of not availability of most of the items on the menu and because of the average murg malai.

I have been to Marco Polo thrice now over the years. Since it's an expensive place to eat we generally choose an occasion to visit. The ambience is warm, soothing and almost spa-like. The food is quite good but very highly priced. I have eaten the pork chops, Chateaubriand stake and tasted a bit of the Indian food from my family over the visits. Also tasted the chelo kabeb but it was a sad disappointment compared to Peter Cat. Over all experience was good, specialy for the ambiance.

Starting from the decor up until the dessert that was served.. Marco polo earns full points from me.. 
For appetisers we orders prawn marinated in cheese Garlic sauce and soup. For entree we chose to go for oriental preparation and grilled bhetki with vegetables which was delicious. My favourite was ending the meal on a sweet note. The chillaye mousse was absolute heaven. It wasn't overly sweet and was very smooth. Loved the experience.

Yesterday we tasted food at Marco Polo, Park Street with hope that it will stand with the reputation of good restaurants in Park street area. The ambience was nice and comfortable with good service but food was not good at all. We ordered crispy lamb which was nothing close to lamb and it was burned to death. The mushroom dish from appetizer also was same . When we told the manager he didn't take any action and we had to pay for the food we couldn't even touch after having one bite. The only good news was the chilli fish which was balanced dish.

So as a whole I am disappointed with food which is the main attraction of a restaurant and a chef should understand better the difference between crispy and burned.

I actually wanted to go to Peter Cat on my visit to Kolkata. But I was at the wrong time there, Christmas lunch and it had minimum 50 people waiting. As I had a bucket list of sight seeing before my flight I decided to go to Marco Polo instead. This place was really really amazing. I had a veg pesto pasta and a cocktail. Both were excellent. The pesto was just right. Not too bitter and not too creamy. Would definitely love to visit again next time I'm in Kolkata. The staff was really courteous and soft spoken.

The staffs were friendly and welcoming with good advice on menu selection. The ice cream sandwich is a must try.

It's actually known as Marco Polo in China but don't misjudge it to be a Chinese restaurant. It has its equal offering of both Indian and Continental cuisine too. 
The decor of the place is simply outstanding and very soothing to the eyes. The best part is unlike few hotels of the park street area , here the 2 adjacent tables are not that close to each other. Hence every group have their own Space. 
Coming to the food , today we started with 3 starters Creole Fish Finger ( they use authentic river Bhetki) , Gelawat ke boti ( tender lamb kebabs), Pan Fried Chilli Fish. Each of the starters were winner in its own way. Extremely tasty. 
In the main course we had Chicken Stroganoff and Prawn Newberg. Here I would like to mention that this prawn newberg is more of an Indianised version with little more oil and yellowish texture unlike what actually we know it to be originally. But the taste is good. Chicken stroganoff however is certainly not the best in the town and can be improved. 
The dessert Walnut Brownie is a killer one. Great taste and even the Vanilla icecrean that comes along with it is top notch. Not sure but won't be surprised if that belongs to Buskin Robbins.
Only concern area may be the picket pinch. Just a bit too heavy to the pocket. 
Overall .. surely recommended.

Marco Polo saved our 31st night yesterday. From the moment, we reached Park Street, we felt it was a bad decision to be there on 31st Dec. The rush nearly choked us & we tried to escape asap. It was 11.30 PM already and had no idea where could we grab dinner. 

Entered Marco Polo while crossing by. We were relieved to see serene condition inside. We had to wait hardly 15 minutes before getting a table. Ordered Lat Mei Kai as starter & 2 types of fried rice, one spicy fish & another pork side dishes. Every single item not only tasted great but also felt like made with love. Great food & ambience - everything we wanted to spend 31st night with special friends.  ( Baby Pork ribs at Chili's was better though)

As we were there at Midnight, noticed something beautiful. Marco Polo Chefs came down and all the staffs exchanged wishes with each other & all customers. Must mention that all Marco Polo members were really nice.

Great first impression. Looking forward to visit again soon.

I don't know how could I miss reviewing Marco Polo!¬†

One of my favorite fine dining places in Kolkata, Marco Polo needs no introduction and stands tall among the numerous big and small eateries at Park Street.

This place is quite spacious and has 2 levels. Decor is classy and interior is semi dark. The menu offers an array of North Indian and Continental dishes.

I absolutely love their Lat Me Kai, Fried Prawns with Sesame Seeds, Chicken Stroganoff and Chocolate Mousse.

Price : Little on the higher side.¬†

Service : Great!

25th Dec, and we found only this place to be empty. Lovely ambiance and decor, but the staffs were in a bit hurry.  No complaints though, Christmas night after all. We ordered a pasta with cheese and herbed sauce, chicken noodles and fish manchurian. It was my first experience in Marco Polo and I did not like it much. The pasta was ok, noodles way below my expectation, the fish was however good. Overall, it was an average experience

I visited the place for lunch, on a weekday, was surprised to see the floor jam packed. We got a seat though. The staff like all classical places were well versed with the menu and also in convincing what to order. The food was great. I was especially surprised by the presentation. I found it really unique for a classic restaurant to focus so much on perfectionism and presentation.¬†

Well, my stint with restaurants based out of Park Street basically starts with Marco Polo. You hear and read superb reviews about this place, but it is definitely not as great as it is presumed to be ‚Äì especially, if you are a herbivore (Read:- vegetarian) and preach ‚Äúteetotalism‚Äù (Read:- Non-alcoholic).

My 1st visit to them and they definitely fancy you by their ambience. They operate both @ the ground and 1st floors with the ground floors being primarily occupied by the ‚Äúserial drinkers‚Äù.

We started our 5 course meal with a cream of tomato ‚Äì which was very nice and neatly served with soup sticks. Next followed American Corn, which was decently served in a basket and salad decorated around it. However, coriander and mint chutney served along fell below expectations.

Crispy Babycorn came next and was a delight ‚Äì indeed crispy! We also had a Paneer tikka starter which was very tasty, specially, when engulfed in mind boggling salads and chutneys! However, it was disappointing to see the niggard quantities of all the starters ‚Äì and we definitely struggled to serve everyone!

Next followed main course:- they serve you complimentary salads in the form of a kachumbar of onions, carrots and sliced ginger ‚Äì have seen such a serving fir the first time in my life! In came Dal Makhani:- superb on presentation as well as taste, also the quantity good. We ordered their parda naan ‚Äì expected to be a naan which does not become soggy with time efflux ‚Äì however, was way disappointing! It did have some sesame seeds atop, but that did not make any difference to its texture! Their regular naans were much better at cheaper rates.

Their Tandoori roti deserves a special mention ‚Äì hot and fresh, just out of the tandoor! Subz Kolhapuri was a disaster ‚Äì a look very promising, but the taste quite pathetic! We also had paneer ‚Äì which was out of the world! Malai kofta was another major turn off! We also ordered some papads for accompaniments!

For mocktails, I had their Ginger Gill, a ginger based mocktail, which was superb on both ‚Äì presentation and taste! My bro went for a fresh lime (sweet and salt mixed), which was fine, but definitely ‚Äì a 250 ml of fresh lime does not justify the price tag of Rs. 250/-

Since we were already quite full, we did not opt for any desserts. We rather ended with the mouth fresheners ‚Äì which were perhaps, one of the best, we ever had ‚Äì specially, the minted saunf as well as the fruit supari.

Service is exemplary and they try to accommodate all your preferences. Only debarring factor is the hole-in-the-wallet burning factor which definitely limits your frequent visits to this place.

And no, I will definitely not mention our pocket pinch for 6 ‚Äì as that might discourage you from visiting this place ‚Äì which is overall pretty nice and gets a recommendation from me!

I don't know how could I miss reviewing Marco Polo!¬†

One of my favorite fine dining places in Kolkata, Marco Polo needs no introduction and stands tall among the numerous big and small eateries at Park Street.

This place is quite spacious and has 2 levels. Decor is classy and interior is semi dark. The menu offers an array of North Indian and Continental dishes.

I absolutely love their Lat Me Kai, Fried Prawns with Sesame Seeds, Chicken Stroganoff and Chocolate Mousse.

Price : Little on the higher side.¬†

Service : Great!

25th Dec, and we found only this place to be empty. Lovely ambiance and decor, but the staffs were in a bit hurry.  No complaints though, Christmas night after all. We ordered a pasta with cheese and herbed sauce, chicken noodles and fish manchurian. It was my first experience in Marco Polo and I did not like it much. The pasta was ok, noodles way below my expectation, the fish was however good. Overall, it was an average experience

This is one of the most fancy restaurants on Park Street. I'm sure that whenever you pass by the Classic White Marco Polo gate, you think of going there once.¬†
I visited the place for lunch, on a weekday, was surprised to see the floor jam packed. We got a seat though. The staff like all classical places were well versed with the menu and also in convincing what to order. The food was great. I was especially surprised by the presentation. I found it really unique for a classic restaurant to focus so much on perfectionism and presentation.¬†

Well, my stint with restaurants based out of Park Street basically starts with Marco Polo. You hear and read superb reviews about this place, but it is definitely not as great as it is presumed to be ‚Äì especially, if you are a herbivore (Read:- vegetarian) and preach ‚Äúteetotalism‚Äù (Read:- Non-alcoholic).

My 1st visit to them and they definitely fancy you by their ambience. They operate both @ the ground and 1st floors with the ground floors being primarily occupied by the ‚Äúserial drinkers‚Äù.

We started our 5 course meal with a cream of tomato ‚Äì which was very nice and neatly served with soup sticks. Next followed American Corn, which was decently served in a basket and salad decorated around it. However, coriander and mint chutney served along fell below expectations.

Crispy Babycorn came next and was a delight ‚Äì indeed crispy! We also had a Paneer tikka starter which was very tasty, specially, when engulfed in mind boggling salads and chutneys! However, it was disappointing to see the niggard quantities of all the starters ‚Äì and we definitely struggled to serve everyone!

Next followed main course:- they serve you complimentary salads in the form of a kachumbar of onions, carrots and sliced ginger ‚Äì have seen such a serving fir the first time in my life! In came Dal Makhani:- superb on presentation as well as taste, also the quantity good. We ordered their parda naan ‚Äì expected to be a naan which does not become soggy with time efflux ‚Äì however, was way disappointing! It did have some sesame seeds atop, but that did not make any difference to its texture! Their regular naans were much better at cheaper rates.

Their Tandoori roti deserves a special mention ‚Äì hot and fresh, just out of the tandoor! Subz Kolhapuri was a disaster ‚Äì a look very promising, but the taste quite pathetic! We also had paneer ‚Äì which was out of the world! Malai kofta was another major turn off! We also ordered some papads for accompaniments!

For mocktails, I had their Ginger Gill, a ginger based mocktail, which was superb on both ‚Äì presentation and taste! My bro went for a fresh lime (sweet and salt mixed), which was fine, but definitely ‚Äì a 250 ml of fresh lime does not justify the price tag of Rs. 250/-

Since we were already quite full, we did not opt for any desserts. We rather ended with the mouth fresheners ‚Äì which were perhaps, one of the best, we ever had ‚Äì specially, the minted saunf as well as the fruit supari.

Service is exemplary and they try to accommodate all your preferences. Only debarring factor is the hole-in-the-wallet burning factor which definitely limits your frequent visits to this place.

And no, I will definitely not mention our pocket pinch for 6 ‚Äì as that might discourage you from visiting this place ‚Äì which is overall pretty nice and gets a recommendation from me!

A jewel of park street 

Just after entering after receiving the warm welcome from the gatekeeper you will start feeling that its 19th century olace in eastern europe.

The wooden floors the people the food all adds upto the feeling 

Although i was disappointed with the preparation of noodles one time but once i complained the changed it quickly which is a rare behaviour. 
I recommend this one for a cool and calm sunday evening dinner

Been there with a friend.Was below expectations, i would say. Located at park street, it doesnot give competition to the top restaurants in that area. Ambience is the only thing i liked there. Staff members were also cooperative. But food was not at all satisfactory as per the prices. Would not recommend anyone.

I¬†heard a lot¬†about Marco Polo before I visited this place for an official dinner... Tried out few Mocktails and Starters which were quite impressive... Not to forget about the Main Course which I found was quite normal like any other standard Chinese Restaurant...The food I found was too expensive by its standards as we can get really good Chinese food at China Town at places like Beijing or Golden Joy where there the ambience might not be upto the mark as compared but Chinese Food lives upto its standards...Not impressed...

Park street has flamboyant range of restaurants. This was in my list for long time. Went there on a family dinner for a special occasion. Located on righ hand side while coming from Chowringhee road. The ambience is quite charming- amalgamation of light and dark. Hospitality extremely satisfying. We went for the lemon garlic soup , a little tangy but tasty, well boiled food. Continental food we preferred for main course. Chicken Stroganoff as well as lamb chops were quite tasty. Meat well cooked, soft and succulent. Coming to dessert, i really liked the ice cream sandwich, the concept , the look as well as the taste. A great place to dine out.

Visited this place on aa casual lunch out with family. Located at hot spot area of Park Street, Kolkata;this place offers good Indian and continental food. Ambience is soothing, no background music to add ur mood. Staff is polite & clean. Food quality is really very nice, I cannot ask for better quality. Taste of food was also excellent. Honestly they make excellent chicken and paneer dishes. Although I am yet to try out other options. A bit expensive, 2k+ approx for 2 people. Would definitely recommend to others for a try. My menu -
Murg hariyali, Drums of heaven, Veg Pulav, Paneer Butter masala, Butter Naan and fresh lime soda.

The restaurant has fantastic interiors and the ambiance is great. The staff are very well behaved and help you with your order. The food however is nice but not worth the price, to top all of that are the high tax rates so if you have a treat from one of your friends, you will notice you could easily have a small snacks party with the amount of money you gave as taxes. So this really hurts your pocket.

Wanted to try out a new place at Park Street beyond the usual beat - so Marco Polo it was last evening with my wife. I had been to their Lansdowne property years back and had good memories.

Ambiance is top drawer and the courteous service must have special mention. The upper floor where we sat has a very minor and initially unnerving quake like feel to it, probably floor resonates to the vibration of traffic on the outside. But the waiter reassured us and soon we took no notice of it.¬†

We had Galawat ke Boti kebab - nicely spiced and tender.¬†
Spicy lemon fried chicken - too dry for my liking, but at least was spicy and lemony.
I had a Long Island Iced Tea and my partner a Sunset Point - good quality there. But at Rs. 225 + tax for a mocktail I expected a bit more than just a regular glassful.¬†
For mains we had a Chelo Kebab - I would not compare it with the more famous rendition available in the locality - the rice would, in my opinion, taste better without the fragrance. A Grilled Chateubriand medium rare - this was the best of the evening. Maybe went a wee bit over the fence for a medium rare but the pieces were succulent, the brown sauce just right and the jacket potatoes and veggies kept good company.¬†
Had no tummy space left for any desserts, that should be ¬†reason to drop by again.
With prices on the higher side, I would suggest increasing the portion sizes a bit. But overall a very good experience. ¬†We just loved the big space, it is so relaxing compared to so many other restaurants where tables are absolutely crammed in.¬†
I wonder why is the menu not available at this website?

This time we four went there for a dinner on Nabami evening....wait time was around 15-20mins...

We ordered fish fingers and soup for starter...
For main course we ordered 
Grilled vetki, another continenal fish dish(vetki), a prawn based continenal dish and kasha mangsho+ naan
ALL CONTINENAL DISHES WERE AWESOME....
Only disappointment was the kasha mangsho....

Had heard a lot about this place. A fortuitous trip took us right adjacent to this place and hence our experience.

The entry is good with eager smiling usherers.
Me and my mom seated ourselves comfortably in the upper floor. The decor and ambience is modern, rich and niche with optimal lighting.

The food:
The grilled bhetki was delight from the word go what with its adequate grill and the soft subtle aroma of the herbs effusing towards ones nostrils.

The pan-fried chilly fish was a huge let-down what with the fillets deep and hard-fried. As the name suggests they ought to be shallow-fried/tossed. I reckon this faux pas is quite common in kolkata.

The hara-dhania murg failed to impress me. The chicken was of the bigger variety and hence the taste not appreciable. The aroma of cilantro was completely amiss.

The verdict: I need to revisit this place before paying a final judgement. My heart tells me that this must be really good for continental food. Additionally they also have Chinese and North Indian fare to offer.
My culinary experience all these years tell me that rarely does a multi-cuisine restaurant fare well in all its cuisine owing to the staff, chef and ingredients being short-changed

I've heard a lot about this classic fine diner from friends, but didn't get a chance to visit there until recently. And as expected, it has lived up to my expectations. To begin with, the ambiance was awesome and peaceful. To start with we ordered a plate of Boneless Hilsa and Spice Lemon Fried chicken. The chicken was very much tender and the aroma of lemongrass was good. As part of the main course, we had Fish n Chips, Lebanese Lamb Chops and Chelo Kebabs. All of the items were delicious. However, I liked the desserts most among all these items we had. Both of the ice-cream sandwich and Tutti-Frutti were one of the best I had so far in the city. Also, the service was very good.¬†

PS: Don't forget to ask for the corporate discount as they provide it for a few companies.

This place defines the image a person might think of while saying 'restaurant'. One of the most coziest and posh restaurants I have been to till date. Extraordinary ambience and the decor was calming as well. We stuck to the Indian cuisine and ordered Murg Hara Dhania, Jhinga Tawa Masala and Tandoori Roti. The rotis were sufficiently crisp and soft at the same time. The other dishes were amazingly well-seasoned with just the right amount of spice. The staff was@ alert at all times and very helpful while waiting on us. Definitely a place to visit for a fine-level dining experience.

Went out shopping with my sister and ended up at one of my favourite restaurants. I wonder why I haven't reviewed this yet. If you are someone who is into fine dinning and are ready to pay a good amount for it, this is a must visit for you. The price is definitely on a higher side but the food is worth it. We ordered a cosmopolitan, a pinacolada for cocktails. Learned they are running boneless hilsa festival. I am someone who love hilsa but refrain from having it because of the scary fishbones. Thus my happiness crossed all boundaries on seeing the words boneless and hilsa together. Without wasting a min, I settled for a baked hilsa and the preparation was lovely - just too perfect. We also had cottage cheese polau and hyderabadi chicken which were equally good. The dessert I would say could have been a little better. Nonetheless me and my sis came out of the restaurant as two happy souls fully energised for the pujo shopping venture.

I am not recommending you to visit during this time; but urging you to go.¬†
Try the Illish Biriyani for sure. Go for the Bhapa Illish and the Borishali Illish with regular Steamed Rice to understand the aroma and the flavor of the fish.
In short, Illish Festival at Marco Polo is soul searching in my opinion.

Then we took chilli garlic noodles along with chicken schezwan for the mains. For dessert, it was tutti frutti and chocolate mousse. Nothing much to say, I would just use a single word, OUTSTANDING! Do visit everyone :)

I had visited here last christmas, already the mood was all set for grabing tasty food, and the expectations from marco polo was upto the mark.

The manager was managing the queue waiting very patiently and professionally.

I exactly dont remember the name of the dish as it was quite a while ago but it was a spice lamb dish and mixed rice, which was enough for me and my partner to feel our stomach and equivalent to the quality of taste it added..

A very good restaurant in the park street area... Ambience is good.. Quality of food is pretty satisfying, service is also good... I don't like eating lamb at any random place... But the lamb dishes here are really good...

Been a long time since I've been there. Had tried out a fruit punch as an appetizer.
The lamb noodles are my favourite, besides the obvious Chinese cuisine.

Classy, Elegant and Delightful - Marco Polo is another gem in the star-studded list of fine-dines in Park Street Area. Kolkata is seeing a sudden upsurge in trendy food joints & restaurants which are trying to refurbish the dining concept for masses. But, places like Marco Polo remind us from time to time that no amount of competition can take away the 'legendary' moniker that such places rightly deserve. Marco Polo was our to-go place for any kind of celebrations - big or small. Amazing decor, peaceful ambience, extremely efficient and amicable staff and overall a great experience every single time. Location is excellent and their Chinese sections and grills are a must try. If you are looking for one of the best dining experience in the city, outing or a date - This is highly recommended!

For dinner-the seekh kebab was optimal along with the spicy green chutney - the lachha paratha a little too thick for my liking-the aloo preparation along with the Chana were good to taste - nothing spectacular or ordinary. The only misadventure was paneer butter masala with the paneer cubes being sour in taste with a bland gravy. A restaurant worth your visit if you desire good food, nothing extraordinary though.
The seekh kebab was the stand out prep.

Well to start off i must say this is one of my favourite restaurants in Calcutta with an excellent decor,classy approach,finnesse and cooperative service.Food served here are authentically prepared with sumptous flavours.I had dined at both of their branches.During the few visits i had grlled bekti, prawn cocktail, chicken stroganoff, fish and chips, pasta carbonara,awadhi biryani, kakori and boti kebab and lot more. All of them had such intense flavours that nobody can ever forget. Nothing was over or undercooked.Grilled bekti for me was the best with some refreshing and light flavours and flaky flesh. The pasta carbonara with bacon and eggs were nicely prepared with no such gross eggy flavour.I had their caramel , chocolate brownie with ice cream for dessert and they were also made with immense love. I would love to revisit there and try nrw dishes and thanks to their team for building up such a consistent classy food joint.

Starting from its most convenient location on Park Street to the most beautiful ambience, Marco Polo hasn't yet lost its old style and sumptuous flavours, in the face of stiff competition from the upcoming restaurants in the city. I love their grills, pastas and some of the dishes from the Chinese section. But of course my favourites would be the Carbonara, Bolognese, Fettuccini Maria, etc ..actually everything! Will always have fond memories at this restaurant.

A perfect place if you wish to spend quality time with your loved ones. First I went there with my fiance (üòûnow my wife). The cozy and plush ambience brings in a sense of love fr the place and the person with whom you r withüòÇ. First visit followed few more and their Dahi Kabab is a fantastic piece along with Black Dal. I generally repeat both every time. It's seldom crowded except on weekends and a great place to be in always.

We had Bruschetta con pomodoro e basilico, Prawn cocktail, Drums of heaven, Barbecued smoked fish, Szechwan fried rice, Mixed hakka noodles, Prawn cantonese rice noodles, Chocolate mousse, Walnut brownie, and Ice cream sandwich. Loved all the dishes. The food was really tasty, very fresh, and of good quality. So, if you are planning for some weekend dinner over there, gosh just go for it. The pricing is little high, but i can assure that you won't regret paying that amount for such awesome dishes. Much Love..
We were too hungry to click all the pics, could manage few though.. ;-)

Went there for another office party. The place is adequately lit with wooden floor and big stairs to reach the upper deck, gives you an upscale feeling of the place.
- Food quality and taste was pretty good, not lip smakingly good but quite tasty
- Had 4 starters, about 8 in the main-course and ice-cream and chocolate mousse as desserts
- Staff was courteous and easy to interact with
- Overall it was a good experience, though I had the opportunity to visit it earlier also and that was a pleasant experience too

One of the finest continental restaurants in town. Ambience was very peaceful and soothing. Went with my best friend who's a vegetarian. We ordered Veg Lasagna in starters, which I loved a lot even being a full fledged non-vegetarian. It was so well cooked that  I never realised I was eating spinach, and the crust was also perfect.
In main course we ordered something which was pretty spicey, that was our bad.
In Dessert, you should obviously try their Chocolate Mousse. It's smooth like heaven and tasted awesome.

Had a really great experience.

Last night, after finishing some work at Park Street, my Mother and I were in a mood for some light dinner which led us to Marco Polo.. This was the first time we went to their Park Street outlet.. So we were surprised to see Chinese options on their menu.. and when they have it, Chinese it will be.... Simple order- Moon Fan Rice and Fish in Chilli Ginger Sauce.. The rice was beautifully fragrant with loads of mushrooms.. The fish was extremely fresh and very nicely prepared in a mild gravy ( They serve Kolkata Betki here ).. We loved the food as well as the service.. The ambience was lovely.. Overall, everything was perfect :)

Another classy restaurant at park street with a mesmerzing ambience coupled with great food that makes it a perfect dinner outing with family/friends!! So far, I have only had the oppurtunity to try out their oriental cuisine and it has not disappointed. From crispy aromatic duck, lebanese lamb chops, stir fried chicken , chicken fried rice, chilli garlic noodles to other delicacies..each one was superbly cooked. It is however, a bit costly as expected. Looking forward to coming here soon for their other cuisines!!

I have been to Marco Polo twice with my parents and both the times, my experience here has been really good. The restaurant is spacious, has a soothing ambiance and is located in one of the commercially best areas of the city.¬†

Apart from the ambiance and the courteousness of the staff, the food here is quite good. I had my Chinese food favourites - pan fried noodles, fried rice, chicken, and of course, sweet lime soda, all of which tasted quite good.

Had heard a lot about the food and ambience of Marco Polo but still the dinner there exceeded all expectations. The ambience is one of the best I've seen in Kolkata. The staff too  is very courteous. But lets face it, a restaurant ultimately is all about the food it serves and in that aspect Marco Polo brilliantly lives up to its name. Just ask them for their signature dishes and they will guide you brilliantly. Basically whatever you order is most likely to be very good in taste so this place is a very safe bet. The main course is very filling and the desserts are yummy. Although the restaurant is a bit on the expensive side but for the ambience they provide and the food they serve, I would say it is value for money. Highly recommended for Chinese lovers.:)!

Well to be very frank this may become a biased review as Marco Polo is one of the restaurants close to my heart. Many memorable occasions have been celebrated here.

Went out for dinner on 03rd April. The ambiance is what it should be, the waiters were very polite and apt.¬†

We ordered Pan fried chilli fish as started along with Screwdriver. For main course we had Mix Fried Rice, Chicken Hokkian Style, Butter Nan and Chicken butter masala. Each and every item was real tasty and just as spicy as it should be.

Very much recommendable.

Marco Polo holds a special place in my childhood memories, where I remember having eaten here with my Aunt & Uncle & having loved every morsel of the food that we had ordered. There was one particular dish of which I remember almost nothing other than the fact that it was a fish starter & that it was lipsmackingly delicious. Sadly, after growing up & discovering my love for food, my experiences here havent been so good as those childhood ones. The decor is very classy and peaceful. The entire seating arrangements, and the interior decoration, are two things I love about this place.

The food is where I have had mixed experiences. Combining my two visits, one was good, and the other was quite disastrous.
The food I had had during my first visit was:

Pan Fried Chilli Fish - This was very tasty. The fish was cut up in big chunks, and the batter was light and crispy. The sauce was really good.

Chicken Strogranoff - This comes with an option of either rice or mashed potatoes. We had opted for the latter. The stroganoff was good, but the mashed potato was really bad. It tasted like the "aloo shedhho" we have at home. It had not an ounce of the buttery richness that a good mashed potato needs to have. 

Ice Cream Sandwich - This was really very delicious. The nuts, along with the cake and ice cream, added different textures to this dessert & made it the delight that it was.

My second visit was on Christmas last year (2015). We had had the following:

Lat Me Kai - This was the worst version of this starter I have ever had. The pieces were very small, with negligible amount of chicken, and it was fried so deeply that it felt like eating pieces of rocks. Such an experience, that too with hardly any chicken.

Chicken Hakka Noodles - This was very average. Did not like it too much.

Schezwan Chicken - We took this as the main side dish. Again, it was very average. The chicken was soft and juicy, but the sauce was too bland for my liking. I hardly had more than 3-4 pieces.

Chocolate Mousse - Really delicious. Their desserts are overall quite good.

When one has to pay around Rs. 375 for a plate of noodles, and Rs. 495 for a starter and side dish each, you cant help feeling disappointed when the taste is not upto your liking, especially when you can get much tastier versions of the same at half the prices at nearby restaurants like Bar-B-Q.

Their service is good and has nothing for me to complain about.

Since Marco Polo has a soft corner in my heart mainly due to nostalgia, it pains me to say that I dont know whether I will have the courage to go back again very soon. I might revisit to try out more of their Continental and Italian dishes. But I really hope that there will be a day when I will get to taste something that will justify the memories of the dishes I had had when I was a little child.

But only negative thing that I must mention that considering all the positive facts,still it's a bit over priced restaurant.

Continuing my food pilgrimage of Kolkata- this place was a gem. I still remember first time I had food here was very recent ( 4 years back) and I realized why I didn't have food here so long!Anyway coming to this restaurant: this gives a feeling of British Kolkata. How? They have a spacious place just at entrance where you can park your umbrella and courts if you enter in. They have 2 floors to sit on to. I personally prefer the second floor. Coming to menu: they have a lavish spread of Continental, Chinese, Bengali dishes. My personal favourite is Lamb Shank. What I like is that the waiter personally helps a lot in understanding the dishes and preparation which gives you an insight on what dish to choose. This place is explorer's delight. Go fetch a helpful waiter and try out some delicious continental dish if you have a penchant for that. You can settle down for Chinese/ Bengali/ Indian if otherwise.The ambience is a killer, soft and very soothing.

Last Tuesday I visited Marco Polo restaurant in park street for lunch. I must admit after a long time I had a great lunch. First of all I must say that the hospitality of the restaurant is world class. The ambience is also very nice. I tried with an Indian starter 'Murg ka dilmun'. I must admit that it is too delicious. For a once I thought of ordering the second plate but later i controlled myself by saying that the main dishes are yet to come. In main course I ordered 'Mixed fried rice', 'Chilli crab' & shredded chicken dish. There is really no words to describe the taste of the food. In one word it's too tasty. But the pick of the item was 'Chilli crab'. I must recommend anyone who likes sea food must taste this dish here. Its awsum. 
To conclude I must say really kolkata got a really awesome restaurant.

Marco Polo is one of the most renowned restaurants of Kolkata. This restaurants has two outlets -one at Park Street and the other one at Sarat Bose Road. This is the outlet I love more, because this outlet serves authentic Chinese cuisine as well. To start off, this restaurant has got the most versatile menu card ever, consisting of the cuisine of the North Western Frontier of India like Murgh Biriyani, Ghost Biriyani, their signature Murgh Makhanwala, Kesari Malai Kofta, Kakori Kebab, Murgh Malai Nazaqat, Murgh Tikka Dilmun, delicacies of Bengal like Chingri Malai Curry, Kosha Mangsho, all time favourites like Pork Chops or Lamb Shanks, continental specialities like their flawless Chicken Stroganoff, their huge selection of Pasta, Penne Pasta being the all time favourite, famous salads like Caesar Salad and last but not the least - the best part of their menu,the super delicious and authentic Chinese menu consisting of delicacies like Chilli Garlic Noodles, unique yet simple Fried Rice, highly recommended Hokkien Chicken Dry, Szechuan Chicken, Butter Garlic Prawns! They have a very diverse section of cocktails, mocktails and desserts as well. Coconut Caramel Custard is the best among their desserts.
Another reason which makes it a crowd puller are the various festivals,organised by Marco Polo throughout the year. The Chello Kebab they make during the Persian Food Festival can be the able competitor of Peter Cat! ;)
They have their famous Hilsha festival and they have Christmas special menu as well.
My most favourite festival is the one that is held during Poila Boisakh (Bengali New Year).
They have an extensive Bengali menu and the dessert Doi Mihidana is one of the most exquisite desserts EVER!! Make sure you try it during Bengali New Year.
The service is good enough and the ambience and behaviour of the staff is extremely commendable.

Will keep on coming back here time and again! Thumps up for Marco Polo..!

This place is Legendary!
The decor was amazing! They do have very efficient staff who attend you every now and then taking a feedback on the preparation.

I visited this place on Christmas where Park street was teeming with youngsters! The food is real good and the chicken was too soft. We did order a dish on lamb too which was cooked to perfection. Marco Polo does not disappoint its visitors although we did have to wait for sometime before being seated.

The price might be a bit steep, but Marco Polo does not fail to deliver. There is enough quantity and quality to make your go happy!Overall - 4Staff - 4

I find the food to be really nice. All items I have tried are fresh and cooked to perfection. The sauces, the flavor and the aroma is so orient! They should work a bit on their ambience though. It's too monotonous.

No second thought comes when your are near Marco Polo. Decency is the word which perfectly suits this highly well maintained posh outlet. As it was the Christmas night we were in a queue for more than half an hour which eventually made me more hungry. Juz took a bite of POTATO PROVENCALE from my friend, MAN!!!!! we were simply looking at each other as if a cricket match was started with a BIGGGYYYY. It was a preparation of soft mildly spicy paste comprising of corn pounded by boiled potatoes. We were forced to order this dish twice in a row. Galawat ke boti was the mutton kebabs we had in our plates. Along with that we also opted for KOH E AWADH and PARDEWALI NAAN. KOH E AWADH was a mutton delicacy which simply melted like butter on my tounge. The Naan was soft and non oily. Last but not the least, we took SHAHI TUKRA as dessert which made our night more special and memorable.¬†

Nothing more to say, really feel good factor works automatically whenever those moments pop up in my mind.


Note: For the night it was all Martini Dry that is worth remembering.

My family and me had our last lunch of 2015 at Marco Polo, Park Street. We ordered chicken tikka dilmun, 2 plates of murg awadhi biryani, Cantonese rice noodles (chicken) and sliced chicken in tamarang sauce. There were 4 pieces of chicken in the starter (tikka). 2 plates of the biryani were sufficient for 3 people. Same goes with the noodles and the Chinese side dish. All the items were well cooked and had a unique taste of its own. 

The restaurant is a little pricey. Our bill was 2821 INR. But given the quality and quantity of the food along with the service, ambience and decor the money was well spent on a nice lunch with family.

Sorry but the visit wasn't worth a remembrance!
The most disappointing thing was that the Continental Menu wasn't available at all! They said they only have the Kebabs and the Chinese Menu available.
The LIIT was good though! It didn't come in a fancy long glass and a pipe but it tasted good enough.The ambiance was quite likeable and that's the only takeaway for me on 26th eve!

Substandard food. The southern avenue one is much better. Prawn aijillo - tough meat as if it was cooked twice, lemon garlic soup - pretty decent clear broth soup, chicken in black pepper sauce - below average.

Good decor but would advise to look elsewhere. Park street has many more choices for Chinese, Continental or kebabs.

It was my sister's birthday celebration the last sunday and we were amazed by the marco polo experience. Posh set up , dim lighting , warm hospitality , multicuisine menu ,speedy service , authentic cooking , truely wonderful and worth the price there. I recommend to visit there during lunch and dinner hours and get youself comfortable on the six seater couches uptairs , which remains closed for the rest of the time. We sampled almost all the cuisines and were highly pleased with what was served.
KOH-E-AWADH a mutton delicacy with four chunks of tender meat in delicate and subtly tasting gravy (unlike the rich mutton curry as i mostly we prefer) was delectable, and the PARDEWALI NAAN was light flaky non oily with sesame seeds sprinkled on it was truely an amazing combo.
From chinese section, we tried CHICKEN YANG CHOW FRIED RICE and it came in a huge bowl, more than sufficient for two pals and SLICED CHICKEN IN TOBANJAN SAUCE which was mildly spicy but really tasty, infact one of the tastiest chinese preparation i had in a while.
From the conti list , we chose SPAGHETTI BOLOGNAISE and this was by far my most favourite dish in that afternoon.
For desserts , we had TRUTI FRUTI and CHOCOLATE MOUSSE which were good in their ways , but somehow i felt the chef could have been more experimental or indroduce some more items in the desserts menu other than the classical ones.
Now to talk about the negetivities, which was negligible here ; still i prefer continue my meal and conversation in a light musical ambience or some intrumental tunes can really uplift and soothe the soul. The music part is just absent here.
Next , even after mentioning about her birthday while making prior reservation , it should have been their part to make the ocassion even more special, it being a competitive market let me remind , most places do that!

Marco Polo is a place to be for a perfect dinner date. The ambience makes it all the more perfect. Stunning interiors. First time we tried Chinese food and frankly speaking  the food was just mediocre.  Nothing great. The second time we went there we had proper Indian food and I must say we were bowled. The starters, and the food all were great. Would surely love to go back again.

Amazing Food.
I can rave on about the close to authentic but peaceful an ambience of the place, give words on words about the dark wooden world within the doors ..Really efficient and careful a staff- even the manager was rigorously mopping away water for the comfort of seating.
The comfort of going out with dad- he calls the orders, and damn they are Goood! 
Prawn salt-pepper, chilly fish and my order of Prawns cocktail.No complaints about the first two 
Tasty and juiced/sauced up the cocktail - for That price - was really disappointing a portion. :( 
Mains - unfortunately the rice noodles, the Szechuan fried rice,and chicken - all turned out to be - chicken.The PAN fried noodles and the the prawns - Amazing!! The noodles should have been a bit more crisp- but taste wise- kudos!
Could Not do desserts - I Had The Whole Plate - of veg Pan fried! 
Chocolate mousse - was a winner , the Caramel custard a pleasant end too! 
The end assortments - with the variety laid - the only thing amiss - were betel leaves :p 
Loved it!

In the last week of October, 2015, a few of us had lunch in Marco Polo, Park Street.
Quality of food was in general good but I can't say it is very good. Service was also lousy given the fact that the restaurant was not at all crowded. Fish and chips were very good, chicken kababs were good ¬†but Kakori kabab was not that great ... biryani was also of non-descript quality. Price is reasonably high for the quality and quantity of the food.

On the occasion of a team dinner,I visited this place yesterday for a corporate affair.Our company had booked the entire restaurant.The dinner was at around 7 so we arrived at 6:51.The staff was very courteous and welcomed us.On arriving we were provided with a green drink which was refreshing.Now since it was booked by our office we had a predecided menu.For starters we had chicken kakab,mutton kakori kabab,paneer tikka kabab,palak paneer wanton,chilli baby corn,fish fry.All of them were yummy specially paneer and chilli baby corn.For main course we had an array of dishes like pulao,naan,murg makhani,dal makhani,dum aloo,koh e awadh and 2 other veg dishes.I tried the murg makhani,pulao and naan and it was too good.The chicken was too much soft.The dessert was however less only gulabjamun,creme caramel and ice cream.Overall it was nice experience,would visit again to try the ala carte.

Never ever try out their Lamb kakori kebab .. We were a group of four and were awfully disappointed with this starter dish .. The cost was high and the quality was equivalent to a shabby food stall. 

Other dishes were good, though! Ambiance perfect. The best part is the hospitality, they really take care of their guests ..

Went to Marco Polo today with my mom and dad and was really impressed once I entered the resturant with their decor and the ambiance. The waiters are really friendly and serve you well. We had ordered sour pepper chicken soup which was very tasty, next we had ordered Kakori Kebab which is a minced lamb preparation similar to mutton seekh kebab. This was pretty good taste wise and had a very sweet kind of aroma. For main course we had ordered Pardewali naan which was the waiter's recommendation and was really great taste. With the naan we had ordered Tadkewali daal which is basically yellow daal fry and is extremely tasty. Also we had ordered Koh E Awadh which is again a lamb preparation, it comes with 6 pieces of lamb with curry and tastes really good. i would recommend the kebab and the Koh E Awadh to everyone. Lastly I had ordered a Martini-Sapphire which I found the mix to be better when compared to a lot of places in kolkata that serve Martinis. The Martini was very smooth and refreshing. Our total bill came around 2800 which was ok considering the quality and quantity of food and also the resturant. I gave this resturant a 4.5 only because the waiters were a bit forgetful when it came to refilling the water glasses even though the resturant was quite empty and there was no pressure. :P I would recommend this resturant to people who love GREAT AMBIANCE AND GREAT QUALITY FOOD. :)

A great place for family dining. Ambience on the dim side but goes just fine with a cozy dinner. Parking is a problem here though. Now about the food. Whatever we ordered tasted great. They reshmis and galoutis (not authentic) were soft and just melted in your mouth. Their breads are super tasty. Not like the regular parathas you get in every restaurant. The continental is top of the line. Prepared perfectly and served artistically. But do not go for the biryanis. The meat they serve in them are not good. Stiff and a distict smell is there. Hope they will look into it after this review. Service takes around 15 -20 mins. A bit high on pocket but you wont mind. Dinner for 5 costed us around 7k but an evening well spent.

To start with, beautiful interiors. Next, the staff was well mannered. Now, coming to the food, good portions considering the price. We ordered a garlic lemon soup which was pretty good. It was followed by spinach and cheese cr√™pes I think, which were not french pancakes but more of puff. They were really well made. For the main course we had the Cantonese noodles which were nice and soft. But the highlight of the day was three treasure mushroom which is a must try.

Marco Polo is one of the most elegant restaurants in Cal. I would like to put it in the category of 'fine dining', very few of them in Cal unless you go for the 5 star hotels. Though it is multi cuisine, I have almost always tried the grills and the bakes from the continental part of the menu. Grilled betki which is served with butter lemon is one of the best dishes here. The complimentary bread basket is excellent here. Deep fried crumbled prawns and garlic prawns are good to start off with as well. In the main course you may go for pasta, which can be totally customized as per your taste buds, strognoff or a continental platter which has stuffed chicken, vegetables, mashed potatoes and some rice. Though I have never had Indian food here, I hear that Biryani is very good in taste. Apart from the food, what stands out is the peaceful and serene atmosphere here with dim lights and very comfortable sitting. An ideal place for a family dinner or celebration of a special ocassion like anniversary / valentines day.

My favourite has to be their mushrooms-three-ways dish - it gets me happy every time!
One point I have deducted, and that is because there are two things that are not quite up to the mark yet: the service and the cocktails.

A good ambience provides for a great dining experience, this is the philosophy that Marco Polo strictly adheres to. One of the oldest fine dining restaurants of Kolkata, Marco Polo seeks to satisfy high expectations. The decor is classy and oozes character, it's comfortable and cozy with a lovely atmosphere.

The beautifully presented food is equally impressive and appetizing. I am yet to try the North Indian dishes here, but the authentic to the core Chinese food was mesmerising. The chicken stroganoff had me captivated, it blended really well with the shredded chicken in gravy and mashed potatoes, though I would have preferred if the potatoes were fried instead, that's a personal preference. The lamb too was delicious.¬†It does not have a marquee dish which fails to mark itself on the culinary map.

Though the price is on the steeper side, Marco Polo is an excellent recommendation and sure to leave one enchanted.

It was a visit to Marco Polo (Park Street) after a gap of 3 years. And like 3 years ago, this time to it was for my birthday celebrations! And boy, they didn't let me down.

The food was excellent! We had assortment of kebabs and some continental dishes. The Galawti was really good. But the Pork Chops and Tenderloin in Pepper Sauce stole the show.

The service guys are always alert and that's what makes one feel special at Marco Polo. What's the best thing is that it's spacious, less-noisy compared to most Park Street restaurants and that adds to the comfort level.

Located on the Park Street, Marco Polo reminds you of the restaurants which would have been a rage in the 1990s with less competition around. The Chinese and continental food that we tried was pretty good, nothing out of the world though, when compared to a little-steeper-than-should-be prices that we coughed up.¬†The place is quietly elegant and the staff well-behaved. A little rehash and this place could do wonders!

Though its located in the food hub of kolkata-park street it disappoints big time in terms of food! Their charge is like top of the sky in the stratosphere may be but the quantity is only a handful. One of my orders there was rice noodles and it was awful! Rest were okay but not at all going par with the price they charge for it.

One of my most favorite restaurants when it comes to " super real good food" and "no concern for wallet".. :P 
¬† The ambiance is very pleasant.. A real good place to spend time with family and friends for couple of hours over plates and plates delicious food.. Service is excellent.. The price is a bit too high but that surely compensates with the quantity and taste that they offer.. Honey chicken was my all time favorite until the last time I visited, but since the last time "Ilish macher biriyani" has become my most favorite dish of that place.. It was so sooo delicious and its a must try for all fish lovers..

Grilled bekti is a must try there! The perfectly tender fish cooked to perfection tastes faboulous with the sauted vegetables and lemon butter sauce!!!Also the chinese cuisine is cooked to utmost care..the lemon fried chicken is a must try which comes under starters.Fried rice and noodles too are a perfect food to savour.And Yes,keep some space in your tummy for the wonderful ICECREAM SANDWICH !!!
The serene ambience and the warm behaviour of the staff complels me to go there quite often :)

Spread over two floors its spacious and the decor and ambience is too good. coming to its food, its just mind-blowing, best continental dishes can be found here. The grilled bhetki and kakori kebabs are a must try here. the kakori kebabs just melt in the mouth. its really awesome dish. the price is a little bit on the high side but the experience is completely worth it.

Spread over two floors this restaurant is spacious and has a nice decor. The staff is courteous. But when it comes to food, the restaurant disappoints big time. The grilled pork chops that I ordered was chewy and tasteless (even though I asked it to be medium done). There is nothing to write home about the litchee with ice-cream either. Pretty ordinary stuff, especially considering the prices they charge.

Went there with my friends for a birthday celebration with a group of 30. were well serviced by the people. However not a good place to give a treat as the pricing is too high.

Marco Polo has been a foodies paradise for ages..One of the oldest and most celebrated restuarant in Park Street this place has been a symbol of cullinary excellence..I believe it not just the food that we eat but the ambiance,the overall experience that counts,that adds to the pleasure..good food when accompanied by charming environment,proper hygeine,flawless service and interesting company makes it more enriched..Thats exactly what you feel when you visit Marco Polo..A perfect spot to take your family or loved ones for a memorable fine dining experience..The seating arrangement of this joint is literally Huge,two storeys, classy interiors,chandeliors,wall arts sets up the mood for a romantic evening.. The service here is just stupendous..The way they pamper their guests right from the moment you enter is indeed unparalleled..Coming to the food the Chinese menu is superlative,prepared with utmost cares,love the authenticity of the ingridents and the unique taste and flavours which is quite distinct from the ones we taste majorly in Kolkata.. Though this place is known for its Chinese delicacies I would highly recommend their Kebab items..just melt in your mouth and provides sheer joy..Also in this season on monsoon do not miss out on their signature Boneless Hilsa menus.. Only flaw is indeed the extravagant pricing but given the experience and the quality of food served its acceptable..Also the portions are huge,last time 3 of us couldn't finish two plates of Fried Rice..Overall our total cheque the last time we went was Rs.4800/-(incl tax) for 3 of us covering F&B..Highly Recommended.

This is my first time reviewing in Zomato. But I had such an amazing experience at Marco Polo, I just had to write about it. 
I was really pleased by the service there. They probably have one of the best staff in all of Kolkata. 
The ambience is truly beautiful. 
The food was pretty good. I think I liked the kakori kebab and lat mei Kai that we had for starters the best. However, the prawn in butter garlic and chicken hokkien style also deserve a special mention.
I would definitely recommend you to try Marco Polo if you are thinking about it.

Marco Polo is located in the busiest office blocks of Kolkata, park Street.
An hub or a centre of Chinese delicacies Marco polo has won every award imaginable and has the fame and support of its customers only a handful on restaurants in the country have.
The restaurant has two levels a lower level with the bar and large tables while the upper is the main dining area. So to start off we had:
 The Chilli Fish: a very generous portion size with a perfect cook on the bhetki that cuts as smooth as butter; with a distinct flavour profile of sweetness hotness all blending in amazingly. 
Mains: 
Chicken Fried Rice  and Chilli Crab: beautiful light rice with loads of shredded chicken.  Now to the Crab. Holy hell! Took the 4 of us almost 30 minutes to finish this gigantic full crab. Am awesome barbecue rub on it we didn't even use the cracker but put or teeth the test! We ate like monsters with both are hands sweating slurping breaking shells the experience was unforgettable. 
Finally after finishing we had to use finger bowls to clean up before starting our
Mains II :
Veg. Hakka Noodles and Sesame Spicy Chicken : delicious noodles . A rather tangy and light chicken again very generous portions which we totally loved since the chicken was smashing. A beautiful way to end a meal. 
Desert: we just went out and had some Paan Lol. 
A wonderful experience of food flavours and I'll be taking home a lot of memories just hoped they would hurry up with the frequency of bringing dishes to the table once a course is over.
But all in all an epic restaurant that lives upto it's hype and delivers.

Marco Polo which was once upon a time Marco Polo in China was another leading Chinese restaurant situated in the food hub of Kolkata - Park Street. Now they serve lip smacking continental dishes too! 
According to me this place till date remains a little underrated .Just opposite of Veda and the famous store Rajniklal, this is a must try for everyone who loves good food along with a nice quiet ambience. Totally a family restaurant, staff seems a little laid back but nevertheless provides a good service. The interiors are nice and pleasant with mahogany finish wooden floors and plush seating. As far as the food is concerned you will find everything out here from Indian to Chinese to continental, quite recently we tried their chicken stroganoff and fish and chips and both of them were really good. It's been a while that I went inside this place and was pleasantly surprised with my last visit. Will surely be back soon for some lip smacking dishes.

When it's Park Street & when it's Chinese, the name should be Marco Polo. Only one statement shall justify the mood "Chinese ho toh Marco Polo jaisa ho, warna na ho". Gonsu lamb stays my personal favourite. A decent environment with a feel good factor compliments the dining. The only hiccup is the delayed service.

Well, Marco Polo has cemented its name as one of the finest restaurants in town and has been delighting its visitors with their culinary finesse. It has two joints in town, one in sarat Bose road(nearby deshapriya park) and this one located in park street(opposite park street Post Office). 
The moment you step inside this restaurant, its elegant and enthralling interior setup gives you a luxurious and cordial welcome. With multilevel sitting arrangements, it has gigantic capacity to host hefty number of visitors. This exquisite eatery is spread over a generously spacious area, with a sophisticated decor and the ambience over here is just heaven. The cozy couches complimented with fluffy cushions, the soothing lights, the sleek and artistic wall decors everything compliments each other and takes the complete atmosphere into a whole another level. 
Now coming to the massive variety of lucrative foods offered here- from Chinese,to tandoor, Indian, continental; everything is offered here with perfection. It offers a generous variety in each and every cuisine. Especially their delectable chinese offerings are among one of the best offered in town; be it the all time favorites like 'Hakka noodles' to cult authentic Chinese dishes like 'chicken hokien style" etc; everything are just succulent. 
Their bar is also massively well stocked and your cherished cocktails are served by the efficient bartenders with perfection. 
The staffs are very well groomed and courteous and are always more than happy to help you make an informed choice. The service over here also very swift.
Overall an outstanding restaurant which will make you feel pampered till the end and where you would savor their offerings till the last bite.

Marco Polo is a gem tucked in park street area. Have come here for lunch today and I am impressed. Food selection varies from italian/ indian to chinese. I ordered a pesto pasta and absolutely loved it. Service is efficient and pasta was served hot from the oven !! A little pricey which actually works to u r advantage as u can come here for a quiet meal and select a table u want. This is indeed a rare commodity in park street. I give Marco polo my thumbs up. Perfect for couple having a romatic meal too.

The ambience is great. The service is quick. The food is decent. Not very good. The reason why I'm giving it a moderate rating is because the food is ridiculously over priced. Two bottles of water cost us 300 INR.

The only reason I brought my parents here was because of the name of this place. The dishes were overpriced but delicious. The ambiance was awfully quite and gives you the feel of sitting in a high end place where talking was strictly prohibited. In my opinion, this is one of those places where you wont be at ease while dining. I will suggest once in a while, we can throw a feast but not always.

We were a group of three and were looking for a perfect lunch spot for my treat and after finding a couple of nearby good restaurants completely occupied headed over to Marco Polo. The manager warmly welcomed us and politely guided us to our tables in the ground section just beside the bar. 

After a quick glance through the menu we decided not to order any drinks and settled for a common starter and a main course each. From the menu one can easily figure that they have tried to mix and match the Italian and Bengali cuisine to suit the Bengali tastes with certain subtle combinations in the items up for offer. For the starter we had something similar to skin flicks which is basically crispy potato skins filled with cheese and chicken and veggies. There were six in the plate and a nice dish to start off with.

For our main course we tried the fish and chips, chicken stroganoff and lamb chops. They were very generous when it comes to the size of the fish fillet that is served and is beyond doubt one the best and largest I have had anywhere. Guess betki fish adds an entirely different feeling to it! The chicken stroganoff was equally amazing and blended really well with the combination of shredded chicken in a semi gravy type sauce and mashed potatoes that formed the bottom half of the fish. The chicken topped sauce was a flavorful mix of spices and vegetables elegantly prepared to go really well with the mashed potatoes. Lamb chops too was exceptional.

The overall experience was nice and service top notch with the manager coming at times to our table and asking if everything is good. Be prepared to wait for a while once you give the order but the food makes up for the wait. Would love to visit again and recommend it to others too!

If you prefer aristocracy over economy, then you can opt this undoubtedly. Foods are quite good. But a full tummy will cost you around 1500 for each. Continental comes here  in its finest form. The ambience ,along with the well-dressed waiters will fill up ones mind. Quite a romantic place, suitable for both couple and family hangouts

Nowadays park street has a different buzz altogether. It's well decorated and lighted to charm your way through.. And today was the day for us to take down one another legendary restaurant in the park street area -Marco Polo. 
We arrived after 3:30 in the afternoon and to our dismay their continentals were not available!!
The decor of the place is soothing and classy, soon you will get the feelings of comfort and relaxation. It's a classy duplex where the elegantly decorated wooden staircase leads you to the cozy upper floor. Staffs were courteous and very helpful at the same time attentive. 
I was a bit disappointed for not getting the chance to taste their continental delicacies'.. Their helpful manager quickly came up to our rescue and suggested us a fish kebab appetizer, moon fan fried rice, shredded chicken in honey ginger sauce and one soft drinks. 
Fish was very tender, succulent, lightly spiced that had a little kick and delicious. The quantity was not enough especially after taking on account the price they charge for it, could have been better. Moon faan fried rice was aromatic with pieces of mushroom. It was different in a good way. The chicken dish with it was great. The rice and chicken side dish were perfect match for each other. Again the chicken was little spicy, seasoning was perfectly balanced, chicken pieces were very soft and moist. We thoroughly enjoyed our food there.

I would certainly recommend this place for their north indian and Chinese offerings. Next time I will make sure that I get my hands into their continentals. Just a thing I feel that I must confess, this place is a bit pricy than I thought it would be. Nice experience anyway..

Ambience: This extremely classy restaurant is built in the style of a duplex with a beautiful staircase taking you to the upper floor. The lighting, the music, the seating arrangements leave little scope of complain. I rate it 4/5.

Food: I had tried the North Indian section. It was very tasty and worth having again. The dal makhani and masala kulcha were scrumptious. I rate it 4/5.

Service: The well-behaved staffs are always on their toes to serve you. Speed is medium. I rate it 4/5.

Price: Slightly over-price but you won't mind once you step in.

Overall I give it 4/5.

Great joint! I'd rate it higher, but when you compare it's food with the absolute elites in catering, it struggles. Don't get me wrong, it still serves food of great quality and presentation. I walk past Marco Polo very often on my way to college and the smell from inside always tempts me to skip class and have a hearty meal!

The service too is very good, I had no issues. The d√©cor is good, dimly lit in the evenings to provide a sense of serenity. The restaurant structure isn't the best, but that won't bother anyone once the food is served. The joint deliver great Continental cuisine, but doesn't do too well with the Indian section. However, I have heard the exact opposite from other people, so it boils down to the customer's fancy.

Eaten here twice only, and I would love to return for a third time, and maybe more. I've had a couple of the best evenings here, so I'd highly recommend Marco Polo to all the fanatics out there. Better with friends than with family in my opinion.

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

the whole ambiance, the set up & decor, everything around the place is cool, calm & pleasant. the food is nice but not extra-ordinary something that one may expect. the starters are succulent, some are crispy & in a word fabulous. but the main course like blackened chicken & smoked lamb are pretty good but not mention worthy. yet one thing that would remain my favorite & a must have for every visit i make is pink lady cocktail - just love it.

- Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce has always remained a favourite for all at home ; though i personally liked the crispy honey chicken more¬†
- the succulent fresh Prawn tossed with fresh leaves¬†

Marco Polo is spread over 2 floors. Spacious and Neat. Food is expensive though. 
Ambience is Classy . The Multi Cuisine gives you a range of options to choose from. Hakka Chow and Soup are nice. I even loved the Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce and the Jumbo Prawns were tasty as was the Caramel Custard Yummy to the core.

After experiencing a sultry weather and the frustrating queue in front of of mocambo and peter cat the night before....we decided to try Marco Polo
I was accompanied by my friend ,Mark who was visiting India from France after quite some time. He's quite choosy about food and a strict vegetarian. So i was really worried about trying a new place to eat.
BUT then......Marco Pole turned out to be quite a nice one.
beautiful yet minimal and neat decor...
Good service from the waiters
And a variety of food to choose from
We were too hungry and so directly went for the main course
While my friend settled for pasta i decided to have spaghetti bolognaise¬†
Loved the spaghetti which was cooked perfectly......and just the right amount of spices went into the meat sauce which made it so splendid.
The pasta was good and fresh....and i really loved the dressing ...it was quite different from the ones I'd had at other places.
For dessert we had Chocolate mousse and Caramel Creme.
the desserts just stole my heart
while the mousse was rich fluffy and light
the other one was soft and subtle...with the not-too-sweet flavour of caramel lingering in my mouth for long
I would love to come back to this place once more...for the sea food....
And for the ones who want to have good food at park street do come here.....sit back...and enjoy!

Marco Polo  offers you authentic Chinese anytime. The ambience is quite satisfying with delicious and loads of items. The quantities of each items seems sufficiently good to satisfy your empty tummy. Chinese compared to Indian seems much tastier. Exceptional quality of chicken, prawn, lamb, pork is obtained here. The price of items is on the higher edge but if you love food with amazing quality one must visit the Park Street outlet of Kolkata.

Have been there loads of times. Used to go there on my birthdays. Anyway, this time I dragged my friends along on a friend's treat. This was during the pujas, hence the 1 hour wait. We were cool with it since we got good seats afterwards. We split-ordered Indian and Continental. We took Cheese Pasta, Stuffed Chicken Steak, Paratha and Kosha Mangsho and a chicken gravy dish. 
Food was great but too pricey for frequent visits. Also, the quantity is unpredictable. Pasta dish was huge while the chicken was less than expected.  All in all, great option if you want good food and less waiting time during Park Street rush-hour.

Great food, great ambience, and time to table for every one of the dishes was commendably fast! Chicken stroganoff, sphagetti bolognaise were the standouts for the day, 3 thumbsup to the skewered chicken for the appetiser! This place is a must visit!

In Zomato, it is showing 1000 Rs. for two people, a false information..........2000+tax at least, without liquor.

Marco polo...its not only the name of the great discoverer but also one of the Kolkata's eminent restaurant of Kolkata...i have visited this one in 21st birthday so I can vividly recollect my 1st experience...now 
1.ambience -its excellent
2.reception-its too excellent
3.food-kebabs are okkay but somehow I didnt like the main course dishes
4.price-its a bit high but still its manageable..
So final verdict just give it a try...you may repent after that but still you should give it a try...

Well i went there today with my Girlfriend for celebrating 5 years of togetherness. Anyways as we reached there the staffs are quite friendly and greeted us with a warm smile. We ordered two virgin drinks(forgot the name),drumsticks,hakka chow,schezwan fried rice,and chicken in honey sauce.
We didn't had to wait long for the food to arrive. The drinks arrived within 5 mins. Those were quite refreshing. After that drumsticks arrived and it was just delicious. the outer layer was crunchy and a nice juicy succulent. After that the main course i.e the Fried Rice,the Hakka Noodles,and the Chicken dish arrived. The amount of food given was just too much for a single person to finish. I recommend if you are not a huge foodie then you should share the dish. Anyways the food was delicious. I would give this restaurant a five star. The ¬†service was awesome. The staff was very friendly. And the food was delicious and plenty. :) :)

Last Saturday we had gone for lunch. At the very entrance the ambiance and hospitality won my heart. Then came the food. For starters we were advised to have pom fret roast which was delicious and mouth watering. Everything was perfect about the dish, properly roasted, garnished and the grand size. I was highly impressed with the suggestion.

For main course we had boneless Hilsha for the first time and trust me the experience was just awesome. Hilsha and without bones seems impossible but they have made it possible with utmost perfection. Sitting in Marco Polo, I had a homely feeling eating the steamed rice with boneless Hilsha .¬†

The duck was yummy but a little spicy. Again the brownie for dessert was excellent.¬†
Everything was really great except the price which was a bit on the higher side. Overall I had a fantastic time in Marco Polo and will love to get back to it.

The jumbo prawn thermidor n d chilli crab .. u ll fall in love. And as for rice u can go in for the five spice rice. Also try the tsing hoi chicken. Its a killer. What is great is the ambience.. the slow music.. n the courteous staff who ll guide u through.. though marco polo is not for the college goers who dont come in with their families.

I went there yesterday with my friends . .

For quality it doesn't need any words to describe this place ..
Marco Polo is not just a restaurant, its a brand ..

the Decorum, Comfort, Service, and specially the food everything is excellent..

the Section in charge attended us well, with a proper description of the recipe before placing each order . . .
as I like spicy food, so I have no complain with the Dishes..
the "GRILLED BHETKI" is a must try..
they serve good quality of boneless Bhetki, well grilled with a tasty lemon souse..

but one thing must say . .
The price is really bit more than other same quality restaurants of Park Street..

overall I liked the place very much, and Hit the place again to try the other dishes which are left this time..

went last night with my wife to celebrate my promotion. I heard a lot abt this restaurant being one of the best n oldest in Chinese in Kolkata . However it serves Italian, Chinese and Indian cuisine . As starters we ordered prawns saut√©ed in oregano sauce & galouti kebabs . Tastes really nice . In main course we went for chkn gravy chow n tung pao chicken . tung pao was nice and had avert distinct flavour to it. In dessert we orders walnut brownie which was really nice . 
Cons 
Pricing on a very higher side 
takes lot of time to serve
in the end they will ask for tip . I had a bill of 3570 of which 750 I paid as service tax . Then what's the tip for . for a restaurant such old as  Marco Polo  , this is really deploring!!

Located in park street, Marco Polo presents itself as a fine dining restaurant and indeed manages to please its guests. Great food, ambiance, service ensure a very satisfying dining experience but at some premium, which tends to get highlighted considering the extremely competitive rates at nearby restaurants.

The place impresses from the moment you get in. The decor is very elegant and not overly done. Being spread over two floors, seating has been kept very spacious and grand. The staff are pretty polite and warm with reasonably quick service.

They serve north indian, chinese and continental cuisines. The chinese food is decent but i love their north indian and prefer the same hands down. The chinese starters are decent be it their tofu preparations, crispy chilli babycorn or spring rolls, love their soups though especially the hot and sour soup that i tried recently. The north indian food especially the kebabs are really good and they are the main reason i have never managed to try their continental food. One of the best seekh kebabs in the city i make sure to order it every time i am here. Paneer tikka, tandoori aloo are my other favorites. The main course is excellent with rotis well customised, brilliant black dal and nice paneer preparations. The choco mousse is pretty good, dont remember having tried any other dessert.

Overall i have not never been a regular here for reasons unknown to myself, but this is one place that never disappoints. The other places in its league are veda, machaan, sigree, aromas but i would prefer marco polo any day over them !!!

I remember visiting here in 2007, when my friend Kaustav gave me and my friend Ansuman a treat before leaving for Oman. Great food with great ambience. Service is just as you should expect. I orderded some dishes to be packed from our table which was delightfully executed. Awesome experience for me.

I have been there several times. Today I went there with my parents for a lunch. I always liked the ambience. The waiters are well behaved. The floor manager was helpful in selecting the dish I was looking for. The approx price for the main dish (rice/noodles) is 375/-, side dish (chicken) is 500/-, side dish (prawn) is 650/- and desert 250/-. I had : Lat  Kai Chicken (appetiser) which was dry with small pieces of chicken tossed in red sauce and onion which was not good, sweet corn soup which was good. In the main course, I had Schezwan Mixed fried rice which was pretty good and spicy. Earlier I had mixed fried rice which was also good. The quantity for the fried rice is good and is more than enough for one person. I also had  Quai zao Chicken : boneless pieces of  chicken having a red spicy gravy. I liked this item. The chilli garlic 
Prawn was spicy and was very good having 4 big pieces of prawn, well marinated  and soft.
In desert we had Chocolate moosez (good), Tuti fruti (average) and Walnut brownie (very good)

The ambience was nice, the staff was courteous and the food was amazing . Some of the best dishes I had. We took grilled bhetki , kakori kebab and chicken stroganoff amd all three of those dishes was very well done interms of presentation and texture. Looking foreward to my next visit.

Marco polo is one of the best restaurants in Park Street. Soothing ambience and awesome food. But its a little dark :P
 Tried out cantonese chowmei, penne pasta and a cocktail (forgot the name), which were excellent in taste and aesthetically served. Made up of unique spices and herbs which is generally not available in market.. Aromatic, tasty... food here is enjoyable by taste looks and feels.. highly recommended. A 4! from me.
only con i that the items are overpriced.

This multi-cuisine restaurant has two branches, one on Lansdowne and the other on Park Street. They serve popular Bengali, Chinese and Continental delicacies. Split-level seating, elegant wooden interiors and courteous service welcomes you. The novelty in Marco Polo√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s menu is their crabs and lobsters. The one on Park Street concentrates on Chinese specialities like Stir-fried Chinese Greens, Qhaizoo Chicken, while the Lansdowne branch hosts local festivals like Boneless Hilsa in season. The other dishes that do well are Kakori Kebab, Dahi Kebab, Jumbo Prawn Thermidor and Chilli Crab. However, the ordinary preparations and the regular portions do not justify the exclusive pricing.

After being in my wishlist for so long, I finally headed to this place one evening with my office colleagues.Located in the heart of the city of Kolkata,Marco Polo is a multi cuisine restaurant.It can definitely give you the experince of a perfect romantic dinner with its amazing ambiance.The service was smooth and the ppl are courteous.The starters were too good. Every one must try Gambas Prawns which are very fresh and delicious.Although the food is little heavy on the wallet but the ambiance, lighting and music is what that would take me back to this place!

An absolutely elegant and a dimly lit interior creates an aura which is magnificent.
A typical Park Street restaurant with a good spread of menu. Being comparatively newer, this restaurant although as good, misses out the coveted grandeur of Mocambo and Peter Cat. One thing it lacks is a signature dish and an absolute standout.
All the dishes we tasted were quite good, esp. the Chicken Stroganoff but didn't give any reason why we should choose it over Mocambo the next time we visit Park Street.

Visited Last Week. But all my expectations were not upto the mark. I ordered the Buffet platter so I tasted almost every items. Except the Kebabs and the Deserts,all other items tasted really bad. So if You are Looking for a Chinese restaurant,You can easily avoid Marco Polo and move on to some other places.

Crispy chilly baby corn: Well prepared and was crispy but I found to be too oily,

Chili Garlic Noodles: It was a bit on the spicy side, but tasted good.

Dessert:

Chocolate mousse: It tasted really good and if you love chocolate it worth giving a try.
======================================================================
Pros

‚Ä¢ Fast service 
‚Ä¢ Polite staff
‚Ä¢ Served hot.

It was my sister-in-law's bday and she decided a treat at Marco Polo. It had been a long time I had had Chinese. Felt super happy as I entered and loved the ambience of Marco Polo. We ordered 2 starters which were awesome. Later, we ordered Fried rice which was decent and nothing extraordinary. Noodles were very yummy. Manchurian was good too. The dish that I crown as king was American choupsy. It was just mouth watering. Not extra sweet and not extra spicy. Just balanced to be perfect. We also ordered 2 vegetable gravy which was good. Service was quite fast. Rates are a bit high, not much. However what I disliked the most was they serving chloromint after we were done eating. That is just below standards.

I visited Marco Polo, Park Street branch few days back. I really liked the politeness and helping attitude of the staffs. The food was very good ‚Äì I started with the ‚ÄúCream of Mushroom‚Äù soup, which was very tasty.  Then along with the main course  I ordered a soft drink ‚Äì ‚ÄúMediterranean Beauty‚Äù which was also great. In the main course I went for ‚ÄúChicken Stroganoff‚Äù and that was delicious! As a takeaway I took ‚ÄúKakori Kabab‚Äù with me for home and got a good feedback from my family members as well. The ambience was good but I think the brightness of the lights was too low which created rather an eerie atmosphere! They also have a good buffet option which is around Rs. 750/- including Tax.

So, this really elegant and fab restaurant called Marco Polo is a total catch.
As my friend and I walked in for a quick lunch, we were awestruck with the interiors. Really impressive and they have this seriously beautiful orchestra music in the backdrop that totally lifts up your mood.
I am never complaining about the behaviour of the staff because they were extremely polite and hospitable, very very well-behaved indeed. Brownie points for that! :)

We cudnt resist ourselves from salivating at the mere thought of ordering chinese and so,
We ordered the following :

Grilled Bhetki
Chilly Garlic Noodles
Gansu Lamb
Chocolate mousse

The grilled bhetki was fabulous. The entire fillet was delicious, the smoked taste of the bhetki with the lemon butter sauce on it was just tantalizing. I loved it. They also gave baby corn , potato balls with it. It tasted just great. A full  marks for the starter.

Now, lets come to the main course. The chilly garlic noodles were REALLY spicy so we really cudnt eat properly much but yes I really liked it. It tasted great except for the fact that they had made it extremely spicy.
And coming to the lamb, its really really sad that the lamb turned out to be a disaster.

Both the dishes turned out to be super spicy and hence were not edible. I had to give away a large amount of it.

The saving grace was the chocolate mousse that seemed to soothe my parching tongue bit I really wasnt happy with the lunch today. I suppose it cud've been much much better. :(

And guys, it is not 1000 bucks for two. The price shoots up to almost 2000 and up. In our case, it was 2500/-

Anyway.
Happy eating guys.
Cheers! :)

Located on Park Street, however at some distance from the more popular restaurants, opposite to Park Street Post Office. Being on Park Street, I did not expect the place to be so empty when I went for the first (and only) time, and, that too during dining hours on a weekend.
The restaurant is spread over two floors with nice ambiance and decor. Much more spacious and comfortable than the peers located nearby. 
Being a Vegetarian, I could not found many options to choose from. Food was very average nothing great for the steep price. 
Would prefer to go only for a business lunch/dinner as the place was not so noisy.

Quality of food is good, but when you put all the perspectives in place It is not value for money! It is not really a fine dining restaurant, given the presentation of the dishes! The ambiance is nice, but its too dark for me and the matter of the fact is I prefer low lighting. The pricing is pretty steep as well!

The service is pretty nice, but if I need to burn a hole as big in my pockets, I will opt for other options, which by the way are plenty!!

The smoked lemon fish for me is a true star. Also had the Kakori kebab once and it simply melted in my mouth. Fantastic place and one I would certainly recommend. Only downside being the pocket pinch...but hey as long as the food tastes this great its worth it.

I always rank Marco Polo along another famous place, Oh! Calcutta for the fact that they are so similar; in terms of the food quality, in terms of the flawless service, in terms of a very good choice of menu and also in terms of being overpriced. Just like the latter has its similarly qualifying and better priced counterparts, so does this place. I don't mean to undermine Marco Polo and I really admire the establishment. Right from the time you enter, its neat, spread over two floors and the seating is comfortable. The choice of starters is good and the choice of drinks is greater, The menu is very standard and what you would expect really in a place like this. What I really liked is their choice of liquers; from Kahlua and Bailey to even Cointreau. The pricing could be a little more competitive I feel. Otherwise, a 4 on 5.

I haven't tested their hilsha dish which have a significant place in my wishlist.So I would suggest,if you are in park st and want to taste something other than chello kebab,go to marcopolo without any hesitation.

I am a Bengali & what made me enter this place was the banner displaying 'Boneless Elish' along with a sumptuous picture of an Elish dish. Wow! But this place loses out on customers mainly due to the immense competition in the same locality. So I am rating it a descent looking '4'!

Anyone heading for Marco polo, i Will suggest them to take the Chinese preparation without any hint of doubt.The lower row is better for its ambiance,which allows you with two large sofas facing with cushions.opposite to it is the bar counter.
I would suggest anyone for dinner in Marco polo,specially for its mixed less peppered Hakka & Flaming lamb which is a bit spice but worth the quality.
The rate is also quiet reasonable,vodkas & mock tails are off to bit on the higher side but thats manageable as ur not coming here regularly for dining.
so go guys, have a jump....cheerz....!!!

A Memorable Christmas -Thank you MARCO POLO 
=======================================

Well for the last 3 years visiting Park Street on Christmas is a habit for me . This time I was kind of hell bent on trying out Marco Polo on Christmas . When I reached there with my gang I found the queue is exceptionally small . I was wondering what could be the reason ; is it just not worthy ? 
The ambiance is rather dark to my liking .But the food ? In short - the best I have tried out in Kolkata . The Cantonese rice noodles , garlic fish and BBQ Pork ribs were a treat to the taste buds and most importantly they were cooked in the most authentic manner .

Thank you Marco Polo for this awesome experience .


Updated 28th December 2014- I am not going to talk about food coz that's always brilliant ; but are you guys not paying your support staff properly? Post lunch the constant whisper near my ear requesting for 'tip' was major downer for me this year. From support staff to security guard at least 3 person did that. This never happened before and I certainly did not expected that this year.

Wonderful chinese food. Great decor and polite staff. Service time is fast too. But I did not like the dark ambience. Somebody give the owner a few CFLs perhaps? :) 

Anyway, the food is awesome though I would prefer the noodles to be less oily. 
Cover is plenty.
The only downside is probably the price. Its a huge premium you have to pay for a normal chinese food fiesta. Will burn a hole worth 3000 INR for a threesome chinese fiesta ;)

Marco Polo would not have been proud...Phew!

One of the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. From my early age, i am used to go there. So, I love the place. Undoubtedly food are too tasty, ambiance is so soothing & service is very pleasant. One of my favorite place for ever.

Marco Polo to me is one of the best restaurants in Kolkata. Definitely a bit expensive but it is value for money. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Hilsa prepared during the time of Hilsa Festival here. Few of the continental dishes here are pretty authentic. Overall, the feel of it was impressive.

Though this restaurant tries to position itself as a fine dining place, their service is way below average.

Their staff is non-cooperative and unpolished with pathetic communication skills. They are not even sincere in getting the order correct. They would blatanly reject your request for any customization of food.

And, please don't be surprised if you find mosquitoes/flies around.

In short, this restaurant doesn't live up to the expectations of 'Park Street' category of restaurants.

Marco Polo.. One of the better restaurants on Park Street.. Although its a bit on the expensive side (a proper 3 course meal for 2 costs around Rs 2500), this is a perfect place to satisfy your taste buds. The ambience is perfect for a family gathering, the waiters and the stuarts seems to have a fair knowledge of the food they are serving apart from being genuinly interested in serving their clients.
Three stars from me :)

Food is authentic, delicious and honestly overpriced. Though I liked it better when it was "MARCO POLO IN CHINA", the revamped nature of it serving continental dishes is not that bad either. But it's chinese still remains on top of other cuisines.

The ambiance is good, though tending towards the darker side. 
The food is pretty average for the price it is served at. We ordered Pork Chops, something which is hard to go wrong with, considering the intrinsic taste of pork. Sadly the pork was not fresh and the cooking was very ordinary. 
The Rice Noodles and the side dishes were quite good, though.

On the drinks side, my Bloody Mary was way too sweet and was quite difficult to down. 

Service is good and very quick.

Overall, too pricey for the quality especially for a place like Calcutta.

ambience,service and most importantly food quality remarkably good. the crispy chilli babycorn or the fish items in the starters will make sure you eagerly look forward for the main course to arrive which also would not disappoint you. price is a bit on the higher side but the quality of the food they serve deserves accolades

I visited Marco Polo with my friend. This is definitely one of the best restaurants in the city, however it is really expensive and probably not worth the money spent. We ordered a veg pasta, a soup and garlic breads and it did a Rs 1400 damage to the wallet. If you don't mind spending this amount, surely worth it.

The ambiance and service is pretty good. The food is good too but the portions are not meant for voracious eaters. Try the pork ribs they are excellent. But its very expensive and a meal for two with alcohol and without desserts will set you back by Rs 2000. One bottled water cost a whopping Rs. 90!
