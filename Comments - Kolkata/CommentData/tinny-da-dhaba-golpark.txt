I home delivered makai roti and sarso saag alongwith chicken tandoori recently.

The makai rotis are good, thick and properly cooked. It was delicious with the sarso ka saag. The saag was awesome. These two dishes are seasonal.

The chicken tandoori was average.

Went to the place with a friend somedays back. It was 12.30 pm and the place was open. We sat upstairs. But to our utter disappointment the first thing we saw was stained tablecloth. We were the first visitors so that means the stains were of the previous day. The chairs had pieces of rice fallen on it. We complained and took another table. The Ac wasn't on and even the fans were not working properly. The food didn't take long to be served but to our utter disappointment it tasted horrible. The jeera rice tasted like steamed rice with lots of jeera and the egg dopiyaza was too spicy. We could hardly finish the whole food. Though hungry, yet we left the place after paying. 
One suggestion is to improve the food quality and Ofcourse, to look after the cleanliness.

This used to be a wonderful eatery in Golpark. I am using the term "used" because it's history now. How I loved their mutton Rarha Punjabi and their tandoori. But I can see a decreasing trend in their food quality. Secondly the dining area is pretty small but not uncomfortable to me atleast. The worst part is they do not accept cards now. But I remember they used to take cards before.

There is absolutely nothing good to write about this place. Let's start with the quantity of food, which is miserly. 3 places of chicken bharta, priced at 170 per plate, was nowhere close to sufficient for 5 of us, and we're not too big eaters. Chewing their tandoori roti was like gym for the teeth. No ambience to write about.
1 mark for the a.c and the tv which played b4u channel songs.

Quantity is pitiable. Food quality is average at best. And service is just deplorable. Do yourself a favour and stay away.

Dhaba for Tiny pocket

I have had chicken roll from here on many occasions, its great in its quality, in terms of flavour and also quantity of chicken pieces. 
But, was dissapointed with the main course. 
Had ordered Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Kadai, Kuchumber Salad. 
The biriyani lacked the aroma and flavour, the chicken side dish was extremely oily and spicy, though the chicken was moist. 
The salad was very different but was tasty.
Service was good, the owner is a chef, he comes and takes feedback.

Inspite of the mixed reviews here, we went forward with ordering food from this place. Our order consisted of Boneless Pahari Chicken, Mutton Adrakh Ke Panje, Koyla Chicken Tandoori, Mutton Tadka, Veg. Tadka and Tawa Rotis. The food was delivered on time. There were a lot of positives and negatives, and I sincerely hope the management addresses these issues. The food business in Kolkata today has seen a boom and if one needs to be on top, the performance in all aspects has to be right on top.
POSITIVES:
1) The Boneless Chicken Pahari was an amazing dish, cooked to perfection. The gravy was awesome.
2) The Tadka (both mutton and veg) were non oily.
3) The Mutton pieces were big. The mutton pieces in the tadka were tender and juicy.
4) Flavours of Ginger in Mutton Adrakh Ke Panje came through very well.
NEGATIVES:
1) Packaging of the food was very very ordinary. A roadside eatery would do better. In today's world the packaging does matter a lot (especially when you are charging Rs.56 for the packaging alone.)
2) Koyla Chicken Tandoori was saltless. Yes...you read that right...there was zero salt in it and that made it an absolutely horrific thing to consume.
3) The Mutton pieces in Adrakh Ke Panje were big, but a bit too fibrous for our liking. 
4) The tadkas were a bit less on salt. A little more salt and they would have tasted perfect. Unless specific information is given, there is no need to put less salt into the dishes. Same too for the Adrakh Ke Panje.
I would say the Kababs need a lot of improvement.
We had hoped to be better served. I believe if they are serious about what they are serving to their customers, they will look into these niggles with sincerity and try to solve them.

This is the kind of restaurant you'd go if you're looking for a taste of punjabi food at a cheap price. They also give you 20% discount from your next visit so yay! Typical punjabi food. bharta, chicken butter masala, kulcha and lassi- this is our classic menu in general. About the interior, the less I speak the better. However, for me, food matters so a 3.5 instead of 3.

A super small place, just next to Aminia in Golpark. You see it from outside, and you'll never think of going in. Looks shabby. I had heard that they make really yummy aloo parathas, so thought of ordering one day. They were pretty good. So I ordered in the next day again. This time the parathas were without any filling I suppose. Had also ordered mutton rara. It was too oily and stinking. And that was it. They should really improve the cleanliness of this place.

It used to be one of my most favourite joints.. but alas! For the last 3 to 4 times that I have placed home delivery orders they have disappointed me consistently. Mutton kebabs are almost never available.. The lady on the phone mentions that it needs to be ordered at least 6 hours ago ( though i didnt find any such notification in their menu in zomato). And madam.. 6 hours prior to my meal i dont even know whether i will have anything for my dinner.. selection of the particular mutton dish is a far off thing.. Zomato says that restaurant will deliver at a particular time (90 mins after placing order) and when i call them after passing of 105 minutes they start comparing their delivery to the delivery of a baby by a gynaecologist... the similarity according to them is that the exact time cannot be promised!!! i was really amazed by this argument and being a doctor myself decided not to argue against this horrible comparison. The food was satisfactory... the tandoor items were good but the gravy item disheartened me. Hope they improve their services and their availability of dishes just as they used to be...

Tinny da Dhaba used to be a decent eatery serving ok-ish Punjabi food. However, on my recent visit, I was appalled to see the sorry state of affairs. The eatery is literally in doldrums. The interiors are shabby, the kitchen looked dark and gloomy. Still hoping for a decent enough meal, we ordered a chicken bharta, butter naan and a non-veg thali. A restaurant really needs to pull up its socks when the only thing that you enjoy at a restaurant is the butter naan. The bharta was heavily laden with kewra water; this made it inedible. Each and every item in the thali had an overdose of salt. We informed the management about the food being not Upto the mark, but all we got were some un-interested faces. God help them; they had potential, but if they dnt value customer feedback, nothing can save them.

Now comes the food part..
A punjabi speciality.. Chicken Tikkazzz are large in size compared to other restros and mouth watering... Chicken Tandoori is da one to indulge upon..

Kachumber salad is great and butter naan are soft and fine in taste...

I am really shocked to see such a low rating of this place. However I had heard recommendations from Poorna Banerjee  and hence thought of trying this place. Now the only reason I give it 4 and not 5 is because this is perhaps not the kind of place where you would like to sit and eat. Apart from that this place deserves high recommendation as far as the food is concerned. Also the pocket pinch is very very minimal. Naturally this has become a regular delivery joint from us whenever we feel like eating Punjabi kind of food. I love their egg biryani, any tarka from the menu, keema masala (not for the faint hearted people), yellow daal fry, kebabs, lasooni naan. We have also tried the mutton biryani but found it just okay compared to all the other stuff we have tried from here.

Tinny Da Dhaba happens to be a decent place with a variety of food from North Indian delicacies. The price is also not high plus the staff also behaves with you nicely. The best thing about this place is that the owner of the Dhaba asks you about your experience with the food there just like homely people.

The only let down thing is the toilet. If you want to relieve yourself or wash hands before eating you'll be disappointed seeing the condition of the toilet. I hope there will be a solution made by the management about this soon.

A pocket friendly place. It is pocket friemdly place . Always I went to the place for take away. So I cant share the dine in experience.
One day we ordered Tandoori roti, eeg tadka and chicken bharta for home delivery . 
The delivery was smooth and the delivery boy was well mannered. 
Now the food was really good. I never had such a finger licking tadka before. The bharta was also very. But the tastiest thing was the tadka. Tadka cant be better than that. Roti was soft enough. 
Overall the restaurant is pocket friendly and a good place for north indian food.

Mervelous place made me feel like home. The food was nice, kabab was a killer followed by biriyani which was very well made wth a  homely touch in it even so late at night. Overall great fun, will visit once more very soon. But one suggestion need to work on the decor a bit..  :)

Well it was after we got out from school. My friend and I were really hungry. So we decided to try this place. It was 1 pm and we were the only customers there. Ofcourse it had been overshadowed by Aminia and CCD. We ordered butter nan and chicken kosha. The butter nan was extremely delicious and the chicken kosha was average. They need to improve the decor. And they took some time to serve the food. Overall it is a mediocre restaurant. The prices are on the lower side. Cheers!

This one has got mixed reviews. I personally didn't find it to be great. The quantity is good but the quality differed from one item to the other.
One could drop in when he/she has no better alternatives in mind.

I have been to this place twice. My first entourage was quite good, their Peas pulao and Chicken Tikka being quite up to the mark. But the second time I went there I found the food's quality level to have gone down by a pretty good amount. They served us rotten Tikka Kebabs and refused to acknowledge that it was rotten. I don't know if this occured due to 'the puja rush' but I was pretty disappointed the second time.

Horrible!! I went to this restaurant yesterday in the evening. Ordered Veg Biryani which came after around 15 mins (time told to us while taking order was 10 mins.) without any alu peices with it which is normally provided. However we started eating and after taking few bites a stick left out in my mouth. Taking it outside I felt and get it confirmed by the waiter that they made a mistake and it had chicken in it. I am highly disappointed with their mis management due to which I being a vegetarian guy had to eat non vegetarian due to these silly fool people. I advise others to kindly think twice before coming to these restaurant.

So this was the first time I went there. All I can say is it's not as good as I thought. The washroom was horrible. Prices were reasonable, but when I tasted it, I felt it lacked attention. The salt put was not adequate, as to my taste. And when i called for it, the guy duly forgot. This time it was crowded but there was only one guy serving, cleaning and taking orders on ground floor. It made an unusual delay for delivery.

We suddenly landed in this place with no plan for dinner. But once we get in we decided to have dinner. The owner asked us to order punjabi food becoz that it is their speciality. So we Ordered tandoor roti, chicken rara masala, tarka, chocolate shake. Food was very good. But waiter lacks professionalism. for example they forgot to serve the food. Tissue paper was not there in the holder

A cozy joint in Golpark steadily losing ground to Aminia. I remember, when Aminia at golpark used to be just a street fast food corner selling biriyani, while Tinny da Dhaba was the bestselling restaurant around. It's a pity looking at it appear like an old shack beside the colossal Aminia as it is today.

However,they have a wide range of assorted kababs which are certainly worth trying.But,truth be spoken the biriyani and mughlai dishes are definitely better in the restaurant next door. 
If you are feeling like having different kinds of kababs try this place out.

This restaurant is quite underrated in my opinion, maybe because people compare it with Aminia (located just beside). Tinny Da Dhaba actually turns out quite a descent restaurant serving North Indian and Mughlai cuisine. Ordered today using Zomato Online Order for the first time, and got them delivered the food.

I ordered Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Chicken Malai Kebab, Chicken Butter Masala (gravy) and some Boondi Raita to enjoy with biryani. Chicken Biryani was just about descent but quantitative. It had a large piece of chicken, a potato and an egg which I rarely find nowadays (except for Special Biryani). Kebabs stole all the attention as they were really big in size, much bigger than what Aminia offers. The Chicken Tikka Kebab was grilled to perfection, spiced up and well smoked. Same goes with Chicken Malai Kebab, which was equally soft and juicy. Chicken Butter Masala is nowhere behind, it had large boneless pieces of chicken and was well flavoured. Just one con is that it was oily. In fact I should mention that the kebabs were also a bit oily, but still under control. I have seen much oily kebabs and biryanis from other places before. Boondi Raita was 'as-it-should-be'.

Pocket pinch came out to be under ₹1200 for four people which is standard these days with taxes going haywire. Quantity wise the restaurant is great, more biryani, larger kebabs, large pieces of chicken in gravy...what else do you want.

Service was fast I would say, Zomato online order said that they would deliver within half an hour, but considering that I stay 5kms away from the restaurant and it was a Sunday evening, it would have been difficult to match that time. Still to they managed to deliver in 45 minutes, without calling me for directions. The delivery boy called when he was right next to my apartment.

Packing was a bit disappointing. Biryanis were not properly packed and the boxes were falling apart. Moreover they used plain boxes without any labeling of the restaurant name.

No idea about the ambiance as never visited the place. But from what I can make out, it's a pretty tiny area. No worry for me as long as they deliver.

Final words, a descent restaurant that could be tried out as an alternative to Aminia. I would probably try this place again if Aminia is not able to deliver (happens a lot these days).

The place might not be a well decorated one but one has to give credit how they managed to utilize the space and sneaked in two floors combining which you have around 10 to 12 tables..

The place serves decent kebabs  and all the food comes at a very low prices.. very much pocket friendly..food ain't lip smacking maybe but not bad either..considering the low prices..

Its recommended if you are planning for a low budget north Indian dine in

A small food joint,  near golpark aminia. We ordered pahari kabab, masala kulcha, tawa rooti and chicken kassa. Kabab was good, 1 plate is enough for 2-3 persons. Masala kulcha was  yummy,  soft.  Chicken preparation was good, nothing extra ordinary. But service is little bit slow. Waiters are good, well behaved.

Nice place to taste chicken dishes.. I visited this place two times. The most recent visit is with my father. This time i did not oder any non veg dishes instead i order chana bhatura and lassi..  What a taste.. The  taste of the food made my father so happy that he want me to take him again to this place..i must say the best place to taste punjabi food.. Lassi and channa bhatura was mind blowing. Both non veg and veg punjabi dishes are equally good here.

This is a tiny little joint right next to Aminia in Golpark. 
Their USP is obviously their price, their menu is extensive. Home delivery service is fast and the food served is fresh. 
Dal Makhani, Delhi Murg butter masala, Keema Nun & stuffed cheese mushroom kebabs are a must try out here. 
The flavours are intense and bit on the spicy side but it's very well made. 
I wouldn't recommend their kebabs because personally I didn't quite like the quality or the taste, a little too dry and a little too hard for me. 
It's a good place where you get good food at reasonable prices! Give it a try!

Tinny Da Dhaba is one such place where you get value for your money. Once you are in the place and get to taste the food that they have to offer you would definitely feel that the food is worth every penny you have paid. My rating is primarily for the food that they serve and not for the ambience, though the food is good but space is a big issue and not quite the place for private dinner. I prefer their home delivery service and more so over they deliver food at your place even for a bill amount of Rs 300 as against any other food joint.

The food deserved a better rating but the punjabi gentleman who owns the store acts too smart and behaves as if he knows everything and is very inflexible if you want to make slight customisations to the order.
the PUNJABI food scenario has gone down the dumps in Kolkata and it seems very few outlets can rustle half a decent punjabi fare...to top it if they act too smart,it makes one not order food from such places...they would charge for the container when they send their kebab in a paper box..no redressal...service is also important over and above good food.....I hope Mr.Tinny reads this and does not take it as a personal criticism,their food does deserve a better service standard.

My friends and I wanted to go for some biryani and one o us suggested this place. Well it is a bit tiny and the order comes a bit slow, but the food was good and very cheap. We ordered pahari kebab, mastana kebab, lasuni kebab, mutton biryani, tikka masala and tandoori roti. I loved the kebabs, they were spicy and good. The biryani was different, with fried onions on it. the tikka masala too was good. I loved this tiny place.

used to visit there a lot because of two reasons- very near to my college, and amazingly pocket friendly. there was a time i used to visit the place once almost every month. and if you are a regular customer you will be given a 10% discount pass as well for the next time you visit. the biriyani is very average and surprisingly the chinese items are better than the biriyani. though most items were unavailable on the menu, w(my friends and i) used to go safe-butter nan/tandori roti with chicken tikka masala or chicken reshmi masala...the chicken were really good and the thick gravy..yumm! good ambience as well.

One of the most pocket friendly restaurant that makes no compromise with taste I believe.  Situated  right beside Aminia Restaurant, a hub for most of the students around Tinny Da Dhaba owned by a very humble Punjabi man who seems to be doing a great job not only with the dishes, but with his friendly attitude.I and my friend visited the place 6 months ago.The huge LCD and interior like an old movie theatre with balcony was an eye catcher. We were fairly hungry and since we both love North-Indian cuisine. We ordered a number of dishes from the menu suggested by the friendly staff.We ordered1. Murgh Tangri Kebab (Full): Rs.160 
2. Chicken Biryani: Rs.100 (2 plates, Rs.200)
3,Murgh Tikka Masala(Boneless) : Rs.160
4. 2 glasses if soft drink: Rs.30 (x2= Rs.60)

We asked them to serve it order wise, and the service was pretty quick. As I ate I realized that they had prepared the food freshly and not steamed or microwaved prior-cooked food. I regretted ordering so much, as I had no idea that the quantity they provided was enough for 4 people to eat, per plate. The Tangri Kebab was fleshy and well seasoned, the Biryani was fluffy and the chicken was juicy, the potato was well cooked and seasoned and the egg was boiled hard and fried, The biryani had an extra-sprinkle of fried onions which was like the cherry on top! The Chicken Tikka Masala was very tasty with the exact blend of spices, the spice blend was so well that you could almost understand what ingredients have been used to cook it. I personally believe that the soft drinks should be charged according to the retail price. Yet I won't complain as the food had won our heart! Our bill was Rs.580 which I believe was fair enough, as we had ordered food equal to four people! Anyway, if you are planning on a low budget treat for friends without them complaining of you being a ''kanjoos'', take them out right there. I could recommend this place for an immediate visit!

This is situated beside Golpark's aminia & is a small place but has adequate sitting arrangement.. We had ordered Naans,Chicken Tikka masala,Reshmi Butter Masala & Salad. The service was quick enough & the staff were friendly. The food was tasty & the naans were light to eat and was perfectly made..

So it was a good food experience on a weekday afternoon :)

Located between Aminia and Rallies this place serves good quality punjabi food. I have tried many of their items but mostly fond of their veg food items. On a recent visit I took naan, paneer butter masala and chana masala. All were cooked really well. The best part is the behavior of the owners of the place.

Review edit: Revamped decor. Much brighter and cleaner now. Revamped menu. Try out the Chicken Reshmi Kebabs. Medium portions, enough for two people as appetizers. Love it!

The location, the staff, the food, the ambiance.
Went there during the latter part of the day and ordered Chicken Biriyani, Paneer Pulav and Murg Reshmi Butter Masala. 

It's a cozy eatery with a large LED TV on the wall and with two kinds of dining area.

The ambiance is really warm and didn't have to wait long for the food to arrive. 

Paneer Pulav- Really plain at first glance, but when I started eating it, I couldn't stop! With small chunks of paneer and a certain aroma, probably of dalda or maybe ghee, I don't know, the taste still lingers in my mouth. 

The biriyani was spicy, and probably also had too much of "ator".
Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala- Sheer awesomeness. It was enough for two and the pieces were succulent and kebab-like only dripping with the gravy, which was smooth and buttery.

This place offers cheap but awesome fare and is a must-visit for anyone looking for awesome food at good prices.

Masala kulcha was excellent I generally don't eat kulcha but in this restaurant it was excellent.. then the chicken tikka was brilliant... I loved it.. the ambience was okay sort of.  If u ever go to this place please try the kulcha..

The bathroom (if u can call it so) is very untidy and unhygienic. We ordered chicken bharta, which had no chicken. And the roties were bad too. All in all, i was really unsatisfied with the food. Service was fine.

Tinny Da Dhaba is a tiny little eatery sandwiched between Aminia  and another restaurant (sorry, can't remember the name). On Saptami eve, after finding really long queues in front of both Koshe Kosha and Aminia, we decided to enter this place. Quite naturally, the place was extremely crowded.
 Ambiance cannot be called very impressive. The place was really cramped, however they made good use of the space, managing to fit even a large screen TV there. We ordered Tandoori Rotis, Chicken Reshmi Kabab and a Chicken Butter something something Patialvi. :P The service was extremely slow, but that's understandable considering this was during the pujas.
The food was good, nothing extraordinary. The Tandoori Rotis were a little too burnt, according to me. My friend thought they were fine, though. 
All in all, it's just another average eatery, the one's you go to when nothing better's open.

Tinny Da Dhaba should have been called Tiny Da Dhaba because its actually a small little place that has opened up beside Amina and Rallis in Golpark. I often pass by and have been wanting to try it for a while so I finally got around to it ! Ordered a takeaway of Chandigari Mutton Saagwala ,  Dal Tadka and Naan based on my esteemed fellow foodie Poorna's recommendation. I quite enjoyed the meal except that I wish the mutton was boneless and cooked more consistently. The taste was good and I look forward to trying more items on my next visit.

I had heard a lot about this Dhaba from friends and fellow reviewers so decided to give it a try tonight. Placing the order was easy and the delivery was prompt. However, the food was disappointing. We ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Laccha Paratha, Keema Naan and Murgh Bharta.

The Reshmi Kebab was stale and dry. The Keema Naan was ok, except it had pieces of bones in it which spoilt the overall taste. The Murgh Bharta was edible, yet most ordinary. The only redeeming feature was the Laccha paratha which was nice and crisp and well layered.

I was pretty disappointed with the overall experience.

I once been here in tinny da dhaba. They were having fund crisis at that time. The electricity was gone. In the exam break i went there to eat. I ordered an egg chicken roll. I was very pissed off. Then i was served. When i took the first bite  it gave me a wow effect. It was so tasty. However, tinny da dhaba is a very good place to eat. If u want a good taste u must visit there. Its great.

This is one of the worst place I have ever visited. How will I start!!!Last Sunday I went there with a Timesdeal coupon , when informed the waiter about it, he directed me to a different person sitting inside, who seems to be completely unaware of the deal and said that the contract with Timesdeal has ended long time back. When insisted, he checked with Timesdeal and confirmed that there was a deal , however said he was unaware of it. Is that person is a manager of a restaurant or clown??We waited for 30 mins, and after that waiter took the order .Again after 15 mins we got the kesar pista lassi, which was also awful in taste. We thought of having kulfis as well. However the utter experience and ill mannered staffs gave us a thought of going to CCD on the next road. Never ever visit this place.It actually redefines the meaning of poor customer service.

Alright... so some one asked me to give this a shot instead of Jai Hind or the other options that i take in my drinks parties at home... and i was genuinely surprised to see that the food here is just very very good...

we being vegetarians... ordered for Dal Tadka, Paneer Butter Masala, Aloo Do Pyaza, naans, masala kulchas...

to begin with i have never been to this place ever and i ordered it at home. the delivery was on time as described by him and the person taking the order was nice and courteous. the person who came to give the delivery was just the same. spoke nicely. the great part was that he was carrying a counted change for my bill and just handed the whole change in a seconds time. 

as for the price this place is like really cheap for the food they serve which is really good and mouth watering. 

for the food... my friends and family loved the Dal Tadka and everyone took more than 1 helping of the same. the paneer was excellent and soft. the aloo do pyaza was a little oily but tasted just great. the kulchas were good and soft and packed properly. 

all in all this is my new place to order for North Indian Food at home if it is before 11 PM. the thing i loved about these people is that we called up at 10 50 pm and their closing time is 11 and they still were like sure we will deliver for you. 

normal places would just refuse saying that it is almost closing and cant deliver.

thank you Tinny da Dhaba for a great evening and great food...

I have been here once with my friends. The quality of the food is average. Also it would be safe to say that at their food prices, one is bound to get better quality of food in the vicinity. After having food here, u will probably won't want to come again. Not that impressed at all.

Only visit then place when your pocket is on the lighter side & you have a lot...I MEAN A LOT OF TIME TO KILL...

Decor:: Very mediocre, a large screen tv where the programmes are played according to the mood of the staff & owners, thus at times you may find yourself staring blankly at some weird serial being played even though you don't want to see it. 
Major problem in space,you will be very much cramped for it,so if you have a group along with you then deffo avoid this place, just because of space problem.

Service:: simply a horror, water gets served after 5-10mins along with the menu, and dish you order will take more 20-30 min to be served in total one has to wait around 30-45 min to even get a whiff of the things you order,and if you complain about the slow service they will say" we were cooking it and want to serve it sizzling hot" ,I mean seriously!!!

Food:: THE ONLY SAVING GRACE OF THIS PLACE & that's why I'M RATING IT 3... food is really good

Kabuli Naan:: The dough is finely mixed with spices & a tinge of herbs topped with small sweet-lings, the layering is such that its soft yet doesn't tear apart when you pulling off portions from it. Taste wise its really good as you will have the tinge of the herbs mixed enticing your palate and the aroma of it will surely appeal to your senses.

Chicken Bharta:: Quantity is good enough for two, the chicken are shredded in the right proportions so as to now to be too finely chopped. The gravy is a thick broth of where one can distinguish the different ingredients that has gone into its making with a good amount of ghee, the aroma is strong enough to get your attention bigtime. The chicken provided in the dish is off good quality as you dig into it,you will be able to actually relish the spices seeped deep in it. and for egg lovers two slices of it will surely appeal to you as toppings 

Gulab Jamun:: Ahhh...one of the best I had,was in this place, warm,seeped in sugar syrup which is thick but yet it wont cringe your taste buds with sweetness. Thus when you let it melt into your mouth ,one can actually feel the warmth of the gulab jamun enticing you palate to its full glory.

These guys definitely need to upgrade their service and decor,else food alone can't be their saving grace for long.

Well. What to say? Interiors are good. They have a large TV. Chairs are comfortable. Menu looks good. Rates are okay. And that concludes it all. There is seriously nothing more to say. Its a restaurant where the cook and the waiter happens to be the same. I mean what? And what? And what the hell? 
You sit down. Then He gives you water after 10-15 mins along with the menu card. You decide on your order and wait for Him for another 15 mins. Then comes the real thing. Tandoori Roti and Chicken takes 45 mins. And it was a normal afternoon, no rush, just a few customers. This place redefined the meaning of  worst place to eat.

This is the shittiest place i have ever visited. Ok on the day of panchami we went there. fine its just a TINNY place as the name suggest. very narrow and small place with poor decor and very low light. after entering and seeing the other customers shouting for late service i understood it was my mistake. From the menu what ever i was supposed to order they did not have it. they did have only 3-4 items from the menu. ok then i placed the order according to their choice.. they served the order exactly after 40 minutes instead of repeatedly asking for the food. Finally the food came. which was really tasteless and not properly cooked. Now come to the main point. I ordered the something called ADRAKWALE MUTTON for side dish which in the menu it was written that  they will serve 4 pieces of mutton even the waiter also confirmed that also. instade of that they gave 3 pieces of mutton. Then when i asked the waiter he replied that  it was a misprint in the menu actually they give 3 pieces. Then i said what kind of mistake is this??? You are saying something and u are actually giving something else??? then he called the manager. He came and said that their mutton got finished so they have given the BIG PIECES OF MUTTON FROM BIRIYANI... What the hell????? is this they way they should do??? then i when i said but you did not say that before the order then the manager got angry and started showing his anger promptly he took the mutton from my plate and said ok i will cut into pieces and then i will serve you... what the hell??? I am eating and he is touching my food from my plate and he is trying to snatch it??? what kind of bull shit is this??? does he know minimum hospitality?? he is a manager and when i complained about something which was actually their fault he started showing his anger???Did I go their to see his anger??? Then i said no need of replacing he went away and after a while he came back with a little piece of mutton  in a plate which was only bone no mutton was in it. and he threw the plate on the table and said "TAKE AND EAT"... bullshit again. when he was supposed to go back i called him and asked him Are u showing me anger??? I am not here to see your anger. So keep your bloody anger with yourself. Then He replaced no no i am not showing anger i am just giving u another piece of mutton. What more to say to that uneducated uncultured . So we finished our dinner there and finally came out of that hell with a half stomach.  Please please avoid this place .If zomato would have a provision of giving 0 rating i would give that. but unfortunately i have to give 1.They deserve  so.

Tinny da Dhaba is undoubtedly one of the pocket-friendly North Indian restaurants in town. The food here is really tasty, be it the tandoori murgh, tangdi kebab, roti or the murgh tikka masala. Though Tinny, the entrepreneur seems to be a TAJ accredited chef through blown up frames of certificates on the wall, I possibly cannot deny the hilarity of it. This is not to criticise their food quality but the ambience. Dark, unappealing, and yes, funny! There is a way of doing things, which if the management pays attention to, will help them go a long way.
Coming to the food, as already mentioned before, it was freshly cooked with a perfect balance of spices. A hungry soul and North Indian food like tandoori roti and murgh malai tikka can create a beautiful story, and that is what I recollect about my Tinny escapade. 
My friend and I wanted to order kulfi from the dessert section when Mrs Tinny suggested some special kulfi, off the menu. I have no idea what it had but DEFINITELY THE BEST kulfi I have had till date. All I could remember on my second scavenging here was to mumble good-awesome-you suggested-kulfi to Mrs Tinny and she said it was not available because it is only made rarely. With the belief they freeze awesome kulfis, I tried their custard one and nice it was. 
I wish Tinny da Dhaba promoted itself well!

The food was really very hyeginic and tasty,specially all the veg items.Prices are fair and worth it. 
Food served was really quick,pleased with it.The place has a real 'AT HOME' feeling to it. nice usage of space.The only cons being as follows:
1.Staff needs a bit of training.
2.TV at high volume should be replaced with nice sound systems,will increase the ambience of the place 4 times.

Overall,i would love to go back again their.Time and again.:)

The place is located just beside the Aminia restaurant..We had a take away from here. The lady there was very friendly and suggestive..She continuously helped us with our order..Anyways we ordered Reshmi chicken,Kadai chicken,Sahi panner and panner butter masala and naan. The reshmi chicken was not upto the mark it felt like a tasteless chicken dish to me,but the kadai chicken was out of the world,just a little extra spicy(but that's the way i like),the chicken was tender and perfectly cooked.
Both the panner dishes were nice,the were just cooked the right amount with perfect blend of spices..The only thing that stops me from giving it a 4.5 is that the quantity of the food is very less but the price is on the higher side..But overall its good and would like to visit the place again to dine-in.

Why should an authentic Punjabi restaurant have pictures on their walls of idli and dosa? (Is it that silly movie—umm Chennai Express?)! Wait! Why should an authentic Punjabi restaurant ever serve me Chinese dishes? If I am going to Tinny Da Dhaba – I have decided to eat Punjabi. Thus, I don’t want the restaurant’s attention to be shifted toward its ‘non-area of expertise’ (if that term at all exists).

Décor & Environment & Staff: My first impression was thumbs down. The place is small and it looks smaller with the giant pictures of the owner sharing the frame with Sanjeev Kapoor and Vikas Khanna. The place is all cramped up with larger-than-needed LCD Tv where Mr. Tinny decides to watch Bolly flicks at high volumes! Argghh…!

Have you ever visited a professional restaurant where the table cloth has several holes, the wall shows signs of getting a damp and the color is fading? Having a perfect environment and décor is of utmost importance when I eat, specially when I am not visiting a roadside shop.

Poor job with the décor and maintenance. 

Only one staff (not a waiter for sure) who was busier with his ‘dumbphone’ than listening to what we were ordering: As a result he repeated half the stuffs. 

Menu and Food: As for the menu, yes you have a plenty to order from. However, the menu was a piece of photo-copied sheet – showing yet again the lack of professionalism this restaurant is “not cared about”! 

Also, another photo-copied (laminated but torn from the sides) enlisted the Chinese dishes. Let me repeat : Will you get Punjabi options in Chowman? It is very important for any restaurant to understand what their domain is, if they are not so intelligent – they need to understand what their name is!

Browsing the menu, we decided to go for the all-time favorite Chicken Tengri Kebab coupled with Murg Lasuni Kebab. 

Here I would agree that after all what we observed – Chicken Tengri kebaba was the only bright point. It was well cooked and had the flavor of Punjab in it. Finally, I was impressed! Next came the Lasuni kebab, and its taste was not so good. 

It was time to relish Reshmi Butter masala with Butter Roti. Alas! With a price almost that of other popular restaurants in Kolkata, the reshmi butter masala was nothing but a disaster. I can hardly relish the food and I was wondering where am I betting my money one.

The vegetable rice was plain and tasteless. My friend and I had to struggle to finish that tasteless rice and the Pickle was our messiah for the day.

The rating that I am avowing to this restaurant is purely because of the Tengri Kebab. 
If I ever go back to this place, most likely I will not, its not only the Tengri Kebab that I will order.

Stay Away!

At first look, nothing is striking about this place except the collages of pictures (at the entrance) & photo frames on the wall (inside). I’m sure you will be dumbfounded by their self promotion. Few of them might give you a hearty laugh too. Yeah, some of them are really funny ! 

The ambiance is not at all pleasing and has a congested seating arrangement. The service is bit sluggish. The attendant was not at all hospitable & had a ‘bossy’ body language. While noting down our order, he was still busy with his cell phone. Now, what would you call that ?? Most interestingly, way to the washroom was like an adventure. Oh yeah, the high volume of the Television kept beating our heads till we left the place. It’s highly annoying when you don’t want to watch a particular channel that is being played loudly. Isn't it ?

Very mediocre food, must say. In spite of a wide range of menu, nothing stands out really. We ordered quite a mix of everything. Even though, Chicken Tandoori was good, others were really average on the scale of taste. The Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala lacked authentic flavors and the Chicken pieces were not at all tender. The Vegetable Pulao was little better, but interestingly, the sugar grains used to slightly sweeten the dish (which should have been completely melted) kept bothering us till we finished it. The quantity (of both) was also less as compared to other places. I think the price is not at all economical according to its taste & quantity. The good thing, the quality is not compromised and thus, it adds up to my rating.

This restaurant might attract youngsters who can adjust with such environment, but I would recommend families to give it a miss. Overall, visit this place - only - if you are sure about it !

a moderately good restaurant specially for kabeb lovers. biriyani not that good. but kabebs are really very delicious, and the other chicken dishes are good as well. restaurant owner is friendly, but service is very slow at times. they make rotis/ indian breads out of wheat flour which is a very intelligent choice.

I have visite this place numerous times and tried many dishes out here.Though the food wasn't that tasty it was hygienic and most importantly the prices are low here and they also give a 20% discount coupon for the next visit..

The  food is of decent quality,the place can accommodate groups even though being a small area,service is so-so.They also have accommodated a TV and a music system even after being such a small place though they continue to watch the boring soaps of their  own choice..This place needs renovation and the staffs are not well trained...

Anyway for a cost friendly north indian meal u can visit Tinny Da Dhaba if u get a place to sit.:P at night sometimes it remains crowded..

Overall, a decent place.

Tinny da Dhaba- located near the Ccd gol park 2 mins walking from there. Serves Indian food and kababs.

I like the way they have utilised the small place. Divided into two sections - ground floor and after climbing few stairs upper area. Basically the upper one isn't a floor but just made to accommodate more people though a little crampy. Good for people who want to spend quality time alone. :P 

I had tried many dishes out here. Never the less, even though food wasn't that tasty it was hygienic. Kababs are a set back. 

Coming to the pros and cons

Pros:-
1) Prices are moderate
2) food is of decent quality 
3) liked the way they have utilised the whole area
4) can accommodate groups even though being a small area
5) service is moderate. 
6) have accommodated a TV and also music system even after being such a small place

Cons:-
1) Need to do renovation
2) food's deliciousness can be improved much more
3) kebabs can probably be improved more
4) Dining is little congusted
5) Staffs needs training. 

Overall, a decent place.

REASONABLY PRICED FOOD @ TINNY DA DHABA!
3.5 out of 5

Located very near the Golpark post office is the very small but pleasant food joint called Tinny Da Dhaba. This establishment can evoke mixed reactions in a first timer. The food joint is situated in one of the many dinghy lanes that dot Golpark. Yes, the ambience and decor of the place are very ordinary, but the quantity of food is stomach filling and the prices are low. The staff is friendly and efficient; the food takes very little time to reach the tables from the kitchen making it a great choice for a fast dining experience. They have two sitting sections; one is the inner air-conditioned sitting area and the other is the non air-conditioned outer area. 

They are well known for their wide array of kebabs which are mostly available. Some well made and highly popular kebab items are tandoori fish, tandoori prawn, chicken pahari kebab and adrak ke panje. To go with their piping hot and soft rotis some of the dishes that you can try are mutton saagwala, egg curry and dal makhani. Even their nans and kulchas are soft and light; for instance, their masala kulchas are filled with a generous amount of masala stuffing. Likewise, for vegetarians their paneer items like Kadhai paneer, shahi paneer, palak paneer and paneer butter masala are also must haves. 

Their meat dishes are always well done (read soft and well cooked) due to the use of the right amount of ingredients and cooking them for the right amount of time. Though it is a small restaurant, it provides a tempting selection of desserts from varied kulfi options to ice creams and sweet meats. They even make some very authentic and genuine liver and brain mutton preparations that you need to order twelve hours in advance! They are also well known for their seasonal delicacies which are not only excellent in taste but are also very reasonably priced.

Tucked between Fresh 'n up and Ralli's this little joint in the same alley as Southern Aminia packs a charged punch when it comes to food. Although I have never sat down for a meal here I have packed food away enough times to know what is good and what is not. For example, they make a great number of kababs, and on a good day, you will get most of them available. I remember ordering the chicken Pahari Kabab and the adrak ke panje (mutton) a number of times, and the meat was good. The mutton on one occasion was slightly more chewy than I would like, but it was that one occasion so I will let it go. 

Their mutton saagwala is good! By good, I mean, you-should-try-it-too good, and pair it, ideally, with some lovely tandoori rotis. The egg tadka is commendable, and so is the dal makhani. If you are lucky, and you have friends in the area, keep an eye out for their seasonal delicacies, and they can bring out some surprisingly tasty stuff for very reasonable prices.

this pint-sized restaurant is surprisingly good..found it by chance as we were headed to Aminia for dinner and didn't find a place to sit..just then the owner from the place cordially invited us to give tinny da dhaba a try..and i was sweetly surprised by the quality of food..keema naan was simply yummy..teamed with tikka butter masala and mutton bharta..for starters they have a delightful selection of kebabs..the main plus is the warmth and hospotality of their owner-cum-star chef..his chit-chats make the dining experience all the more enjoyable..prices are quite within the range..overall a nice place to try..

went to tinni da dhaba today itself. The entrance doesn't look at all appealing. It's in a dingy lane in golpark and the space is quite small inside. We ordered for a takeaway so doesn't know the A.C.seating arrangement.The pricing is reasonable.I ordered for dal makhani and tawa roti. Their service time was prompt. It took about 15 min approx. The roti was big but little bit tough to tear off. May be when i ate it, it grew cold so that can be the reason. The dal makhani was unimpressive. I had it better at Bawarchi, Jadavpur anyday as theirs is rich in flavour and taste and they serve it with dollop of ghee too. All these were missing in tinny da dhaba's dal makhani as it tasted more like spicey and diluted tadka. May be, i shall visit this place in future and try out their other dishes. But overall i felt that this place is more suitable for take away.

I would rate 2.5

If you are looking for delicious north indian dishes,,,then TINNY DA DHABA can be a good choice. Fish Tandoori Butter Masala is the best of all for me. Staff is okay and ambience is ordinary. Prawn tandoori is good too but I do not like tandoori or kababs of prawns.Prices are reasonable. I would rate 3.5

When I visited the place I had mixed reactions. The place is situated in Golpark inside one of the lanes. The place is quite small and the ambience ok but not very impressive. The food tasted somewhat good but nothing great. Their 'Chicken Tandoori' is nice and other items so so. The quantity isn't bad and the pricing is very reasonable and quite low. So going and trying their food once won't be a bad idea. The staff are quite friendly and warm and owners are trying their best to improve the food and attract more customers. 
The effort and the hard work of the owners and reasonable food should be rated 3 in my opinion. This is just the start hope gradually it picks up and competes well in the race of all the A listed restaurants.

A little restaurant located at the heart of golpark grabbed my attention while I visited this place first will my friends. Though the enterance is not very attractive, the ambeince inside was quite pleasant to our suprise. The interiors is over-crowed with pictures of the owner and enlarged version of certificates which you can't really over-look...apart from that the food is taste really good at reasonabe prices which is the main factor of college going students. The tandoori chicken and chicken reshmi masala with butter naan is a must have...the thick rich gravy and varieties of kebabs calls me back each time. Nowdays Tinny da Dhaba is quite often visited with my girlfriend and I'm sure she'll agree wid me to :)

Ambiance and decor of the restaurant is pathetic. Taste of the food is very inconsistent. If you are planning for home delivery from tinny da dhaba please cook something before hand bcoz they deliver the food only after two hours the order has been placed, and even after that they don't have the minimum decency of saying sorry...

today went to Tinny da dhaba, nice little place, having 2 parts ,ac restaurant is inside and outer small sitting area mainly for rolls and chowmins etc. i opted for take away, ordered masala kulchas, chicken reshmi masala, chana masala, punjabee aludum and chicken tangdi kebabs. no mutton items were there,its little surprising. all the items were very good and extremely tasty, specially liked the reshmi masala, though the aludum and chana were excessively oily but they tasted good, kulchas were soft tender. service was quick also, they served within 20 mins.. the ambience is not great but its a nice place for good food in cheap price.. i will recommend this place mainly for take away..

Had heard about this place from my sister and caught my sight on the way to golpark one day. So I thought of stopping by for a quick snack and the entrance didn't seem pleasing at all. We were given a table downstairs where the owner of the restaurant (seemed so) was lying down on a row of three chairs engrossed in conversation with her mom. The food you get here is the typical 'balle-balle' Punjabi food, but I must say the roadside dhabas taste way better. And on top of that the frequent opening and closing of a door next to our table (marked as the washroom, but wasn't)  was annoying. I could catch a glimpse of few boy laying on a cot on he floor on the other side of the door and were deliberately doing so to disturb us (I was with 3 of my friends, 2 of them being girls). On complaining to the waiter he didn't seem to pay any heed and just smiled away. Horrible experience overall. I would suggest you ignore this eatery.
