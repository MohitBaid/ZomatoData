Beef biryani was good. But the beef bhuna was so so. Tandoori roti was not so good. The service is ok. But if you like beef then this restaurant is a must try in reasonable price.

The food is delicious and worth every penny you spend.Located at the lane beside Zeeshan ,this small eatery is not that well maintained.In fact it would look absolutely shabby.The only suggestion is do not go by the look.We ate our heart out at this place.The order for the evening

üçÅBeef biriyani--Two juicy pieces of beef on a plate full of rice and an juicy aloo.A wholesome meal is what i would choose to describe the biriyani as.Though i found the rice could be better in quality but then again 65 rupees for a plate justifies it.@
üçÅBeef Korma--The korma on the other hand was spot on.With soft pieces of beef in the delicious gravy and half an egg to top it off.The gravy taste lip smacking good and retained all the juices from the meat.

If you want to taste the kebabs drop sometime in the evening or before 3pm or they run out of all the delicacies.

Nafeel is most pocket friendly beef joint i know. 
Food quantity- more than enough!
Food quality- great!
Service- fast! 
Pocket pinch- minimal!
For beef and biriyani lovers this place will fill your hunger pangs without a tickle in your pocket!
Unknown fact- do try their tea when you get a chance! It's sweet and creamy as hell. Also the kathi rolls!

Location wise it's pretty easy to find out. Why?
Park Circus 7point from there move towards Syed Amir Ali Avenue. From first signal take immediate left. See on the right foot.

Ambience not upto the mark; Decor minimalistic & you can't expect all of these in a low price tag. So, that's it. We want the menu card the boy told they haven't that. So we opened Zomato to order the food.

We ordered #beef_biryani & beef_handi_kebab. Before took this 2 we were thinking to take something more items from nafeel. But very after when we started, first we think we should told them to bring the bill. Firstly in biryani there was lump in the rice, it's not tasted like biryani at all. Second the side dish kebab. When we asked how they plattered their handi kebab they told us i.e. come with a little gravy & the beef is little roasted. But truly if that was little gravy then I have to order everywhere dry instead of gravy when I need gravy also. We thought that if the kebab tastes well then we will order any parathas or rotis to fill our stomach but there also we failed.

Overall I will not go there second time because on that day we went in an another restaurant to grab some food. It wasn't a good experience at all. A foodie always want good food over ambience decor service which was really missing on that afternoon.

A very old eatery with a non attractive decor which serves mind blowing FIRNI at a low price. 
Yes that's what  Nafeel was for me!
I have had tasted the Chicken and Mutton Biriyani too which is good in taste and quantity wise is okayish.
You get Beef biriyani over here(although I don't eat but have heard) which is worth eating.
The prices are very reasonable.

Used to go here during my school days back in 1999-2005 when I was in Cal. It was the best place to catch up with friends and have a meal. I remember going in a group of 25 guys,sitting in the family area and still being allowed to eat. The staff even let us rearrange the tables and made us feel at home.  Winter Nehari and puris were something out of this world and being such regulars that the staff would keep the best pieces of meat even when we turned up late. Recently been there and was so happy to see some of the old staff and even happier when they recognised me. Love this place for its staff and food.

This place is a paradise for beef lovers. Situated in the heart of the city, it serves lip smacking dishes such as beef chaap, beef bhuna, beef kabab, beef biryani, chicken items are also available.

The dishes to relish upon here are their beef biryanis and chicken chaap. The firni had a mediocre taste, but nonetheless it was good. A pocket friendly restaurant with a simple decor. The interiors are not lavish but one can bring their family here for a giant meal. The staffs are friendly and soft spoken, the service is very fast. A big thumbs up to this place.

I have known this place for quite some time now. Its always a satisfaction whenever I visit this place. Its a hidden gem amidst numerous Beef 'Kings' & 'Queens' sprouting here and there in the ever expanding "Mohollah" of Kolkata. This place was never on my bucket list. But a sudden revelation pf this beef "joint" a few years back is all that it took! It forged a long-lasting bond between a 'foodie and his food'.¬†

So yesterday, I was in Quest Mall with a friend of mine. So after some evening shenanigans we decided to visit this place for the third time (if I remember correctly!). So super excited, We had a great meal and a great food chat with our server ‚Äòchacha‚Äô getting us the food one after the other. As we sat and looked at the fading menu card on the wall, we realized not everything is served everyday. So we ended up ordering everything best one can possibly order in a limited time!¬†

Now the good news is hat in West Bengal beef still is cow (unlike buffalo in Delhi and Mumbai). Hence taste is way better. Beef chaap was outstanding- robust, rustic flavours and outstanding taste of gravy. Loved the soft well cooked meat and overall delightful. One of the best chaap I have had in a while. Beef stew was a relatively lighter gravy without the obvious oil oozing out from all over. Both spices and meat flavors made their presence felt. The meat was soft and nice. Loved the gravy. All these went perfectly with piping hot Tandoori Roti. Now to try something out-of-the-box, we braved ourselves ordering Beef Magaz (Cow's Brain). As suspected, our bravery went in vain. Overloaded with spices it formed a creamy gooey layer, which wasn't very pleasant. So we half-heatedly ordered Beef Khiri (Cow's Udder). We were unsure whether it would match the one's at UP Bihar Restaurant. To our surprise, beef khiri turned out to be really delicious. It had the obvious floating oil but the taste made it calorie worthy. I would rather eat it and lament later than not eat it at all. The curry tasted very good. We polished off the gravy till the last drop. The pieces were succulent and juicy.¬†

Oh yes! forgot to mention earlier, while we waited for our food to arrive we chatted over a cup of evening tea! If you still haven't been here, wait no more! This place is sure to charm you with its lip-smacking dishes and warm service (unlike typical Muslim eateries).

This is one place to visit when you're near Quest Mall, looking for something to eat in a limited budget and won't mind a place that dabbles in the true definition of old charm and rusticity. Yes, it might feel like too many conditions but when you conveniently strip down the barriers of sophistication and the pampering doled out by fine dine-in restaurants, you'll find yourself appreciating the down-to-earth bustles of this place.

I was introduced to this place in my college days, the perfect juncture in life when one appreciates the cheapest eateries with as much flavour it can suckle out. I appreciated their rolls of 15rs. The middle-class student in me, with probably 50rs in pocket or 200rs after getting fees from my student, was really happy strutting down to the next lane of Quest in between reading a novel at Starmark and calming the wolves with such humble a delicacy to fuel myself for the next 2-3 hours of flipping pages. Occasionally, with my classmate, sharing the cost, I had their kebabs with paratha/tandoori roti and cold drinks. The succulent bits with hot parathas were heavenly and so was their haalim. However, their biryani is nothing to reminisce about, which I had once.

The staff here are of two types...either they will be really friendly, who would even be happy with our meagre 10rs tip(shared between us), or like an indifferent person who keeps the plates on tables with a rude thud and you would dare not mess with. Whatever it was, a mixed bag of experiences or a vignette of nostalgia being furnished, this place is an acquired taste...either you are repelled by it or you are pulled into it! Nafeel, I'll visit you soon!

I've went there a couple of times. I tried out quite a few dishes including Biryani, handi kebab, bhuna, haleem, and phirni. So ya the biryani was quite nice, and knowing that it's just worth Rs.60 makes you happy. The handi kebab was really nice, and had really nice flavours with good soft and juicy shreds of the meat. The bhuna was pretty good as well, although it got overshadowed by the handi kebab a bit. The phirni tasted fine, but the quantity was very little, and ya you can't call that cheap, it was just like less quantity for less price. The haleem was really unimpressive though, it totally disappointed me.

Well now let's not talk about the poor ambience, when you have awesome food in front of you on the table. But I would like to mention though, that the waiter literally asked me, "sir mere liye tip". And I was like, wow new experience for me, waiter being so confident that he literally asks me for tip. That's the reason basically why I'm rating the restaurant 3.5 and not 4. I'd have actually rated 3 but then my inner voice said me, come on boy the tasty food deserves another half a point at least.

It is in Park Circus- two minutes walking distance from the seven point crossing. You must‚Äôve been to Zeeshan . On a good day, it can give many giants a run for their money. But, no, not them. This one is just on the adjacent lane to it. Yes, I am talking about Nafeel (Google location). No, biryani is not their forte. But, if you‚Äôve ever heard of the name of handi kebab, this is the go-to-place. Their beef handi kebab, with the subtle after-smell of cardamom and black-peeper (or was it kebab chini ? ) and that slight chewy feeling, just makes a sad, day happy. The beef kebab is good (not the best)- damn good in fact. But, it could somehow never cross that thin line between being good and being great. Don‚Äôt bother asking for the biryani (pretty ordinary) and firni ‚Ä¶ with Royal  (Park Circus branch)just opposite to them, it‚Äôs just not worth.

I believe this is one of the best places in Kolkata where cheap and tasty Beef dishes are available. Even though the restaurant isn‚Äôt a very hygienic place to sit and dine at yet the homely environment covers it all. If you are not comfortable in dining there, then parcels can be taken and enjoyed comfortably at home. I would like to recommend a few dishes: 
1.	Beef Nehari: A warm soupy dish with beef pieces and lemon, makes you crave for more and more. I suppose this dish is only available during winter season. 
2.	Beef Roll: Small laccha paratha with beef pieces, which is only available at 15 bucks, is worth trying. 
3.	Beef Biryani: Extremely tasty Beef biryani can be found here at a minimal cost of ‚Çπ 60. The meat is very tender and the taste of the biryani is definitely different from the Chicken and Mutton biryani.

This is the best place in kolkata, to bite on some juicy beef dishes .Just spend 300 ‚Çπ and you can eat almost the entire menu .Again the meat is soft and just melts in your mouth.Its just beside Zeeshan in park circus.

Cheap food. You can't expect a God level Biryani here.  Service is not at all good. They don't even show you any menu card. Ambience is also not for a whole family dinner. Food is good and cheap. That's it.

The beef bhuna is a real relish here. The prices are quite reasonable . Looking forward to visit this place again. üòÅ The biriyani has a different flavour. And one of the places where beef can be relished with pleasure.

Ordered chicken and mutton biriyani (1 piece meat, rice, half potatoe, no egg), they were edible definitely, but the mutton was stiff as rubber (we suspected it was beef - since they also serve beef biriyani) and the rice was overtly moist and felt heavy (not in a good way). Their food items are priced quite cheap, and possibly for reasons such as these. Also, the waiters are not organised and yet expect a tip. Overall, I'll probably not go back to that restaurant.

After reading the reviews me n my friend thought of exploring ds place... a bit difficult to find d place at one go bt its jst few mints frm quest mall..
Coming to d food... we ordered beef biriyani, beef korma & firni...
D quality n quantity of biriyani in such a low price is sumthng to dream about.. full marks to d taste... d beef korma too was tasty bt it will taste bettr wd roti...
Nxt d firni, d quantity ws less bt d taste ws simply grt.. we cud not stop ordering it twice..
U wont get all d items at d same time.. ws dissapointd for not getting tandoori roti or rumali roti at 3 p.m in noon.. bt overall d experience was awsme n will surely visit it again to try d other stuffs... üòãüòã@Kaustav Mukherjee

So decided to try this place as it used to be my favorite spot 8 years back when I was in College. 
Seeing this place reminded me of so many incident that had led me come to this shop and have lunch or dinner or simply stroll around. 

So ordered my favorite Beef Biriyani, Chicken Biriyani,  Beef sheek kebab and Laccha Paratha.  The meat was soft and juicy and the way it used to feel back then but the quality of the biriyani rice has gone down. 

It used to taste the same as other restaurants in Park Circus area. Combination of Sheek Kebab and Laccha Paratha is not beatable at all still now. 

So it was worth a try and enjoyed my time  here.

Small place to eat & out . . .

Old days style feeling, actually it is very old and well known place of Park Circus area..
Specially Beef items available..

What surprised me the most, many items displayed in the menu were not available..they don't even serve some of the items listed ever. . .

Foods are just okaish, may be it served very good & tasty foods a long ago..but now a days the food quality is very normal..
I had Beef Biryani & Beef Quarma.. and Firni..all are just OK, nothing more than that.. the quantity is good, but taste nothing special..

Dishes tried: Beef Biryani, Beef Chaap, Beef Stew, Beef Korma, Beef Maguz.

Quality: Probably the best beef I have ever tasted.

Ambience: There's no need for this column when you have awesomeness in front of you.

Service: Very courteous.

Pocket pinch: Dirt cheap would be understating it.

Verdict: I went there for the beef, and I wasn't disappointed. The best beef place in Calcutta, by a mile.

Pricing is dirt cheap.

Went there to try some beef. Ordered beef biryani,  beef bhuna and beef handi kebab.  The biryani was really nice especially considering the price tag of a mere  60 rs it kind of over delivered.  Personally didn't like the handi kebab which surprisingly had sliced eggs in it.  The beef bhuna was somewhat okaish in taste. Ate a wholesome meal for just Rs 96. Good place to try some beef.

I've been here a couple of times now, and the sole reason being their beef items. Absolutely delicious food! Not a particularly fancy place or anything, a very basic and minimalist restaurant serving good food at extremely cheap prices. I've had the beef korma and the beef chaanp with the biryani both times. The biryani is good enough for the price, you cannot expect better. The korma is rich in gravy and flavourful. Very eager to try their nihari this winter.
Recommended to every beef lover.

Tucked in a shabby lane of park circus, Nafeel restaurant serves pretty average biriyani. My friend wanted to try the beef biriyani because of her sudden food craving. I accompanied her just to try their chicken biriyani since I don't eat beef. 
I was served a cold biriyani with undercooked rice and chicken.
Definitely not going to come here the next time.

Also tried their beef chaap and tandori roti. And phirni. Some of their items weren't available. And we were quiet early. Around 8 at night. The service was very very fast but the decor is very simple and minimum. The food is rich and oily, but the taste is incomparable. 
Later, the waiter might ask you for tips.
If you want to have some quality beef, please visit. 
Because I'm gonna visit soon, again!

If you are looking to try beef delicacies, this is the one you should try at least once in your lifetime.
Located just opposite of Park Circus Tram Depot, it hardly speaks to make its presence felt.
You might have heard a lot about Zeshaan & Arsalan in Park Circus Area, but, this is one of the best, provided you want to have beef items.
The outlook of this restaurant is shabby, seems not good enough enough; but the tables are relatively clean and the food served is pure.
The one who takes order will hardly smile at you but they won't treat you in undignified way. You will feel a sense of satisfaction once you complete your meal.
You might be reluctant to enter, but, my request is that you must try it once before forming any opinion.
Starting from beef biryani to beef chap, beef rezala to beef dal - all tastes really awesome. I personally didn't try the beef brain(moguz) but it is heard that they do this too very brilliantly. At evenings, you have the chance to have beef roll, ie, beef seekh kebab in a paratha and damn - You'll surely love it.
With just 200 bucks in your pocket, you can not only treat yourself and your better half, but also enough to spare for tip!

Qs) Should you visit this?
Ans) If you are fond of beef, this place is a must visit.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) Taking into the taste and quality of food, I wanted them to give all the five stars. But, since the look of the restaurant is not very admirable, I have deduced half a star.

A near-to-heaven place for any beef lover. My case, my first time for beef. And so I searched far and wide Zomato where to get the real feel of this dish and found this place.¬†
I ordered a plate Beef Biryani, Beef Bhuna and Firni. The whole dinner cost me a hundred bucks only. The biryani was delicious along with the bhuna. The beef was chewy and juicy as it is supposed to be. But the dish which really took my heart away was the firni, directly from the God's abode, it seemed.¬†
The people working in this restaurant are extremely well-behaved, the place not horrifically unhygienic and the place sits well within Park Circus opposite the famous Zeeshan, where college-goers can easily reach after an hour of window-shopping at the Quest. What else needed for a perfect friends' evening-out!

Absolute heaven for beef lover!!!
This place is a hidden gem for any beef lover in Kolkata.. situated at ParkCircus tram depot just beside the famous Zeeshan..
Ambience is not at all upto the mark.. avoid if possible..however the place is not filthy or dirty..and is fairly clean and basic.
I have hogged on almost all the dishes in the menu that are beef.. mind u, they specialize in beef so it ll b better if u stick to dat.. for chicken and mutton..go to the nearby zeeshan..
Now u can have ur breakfast, lunch, evening snacks as well as dinner here..so practically open for all purposes..
I love the beef biryani that they serve.. long grained rice with good aroma and taste..not oily or too dry.. two pieces of beef( sometyms u myt end up with the beef fat portion)and a customary aloo..a coup for 60 bucks..
Next will be the beef korma(must try) and beef chaap(superb) and beef bhuna(oily).. all are delicious..the beef here is cooked really well with many spices and the toughness of the meat ll not be felt..feels like mutton sometimes..
Not a fan of their tandoori roti..hard and cold..not served fresh..
Beef chaap is reccomended very much..
The beef kababs are succulent..marinated with spices, they are simply charred over coal and served..they are not actually kabab..but roasted marinated beef..u ll gt the smoky flavour..mayb overpowering fr some but i love it! Best paired with the laccha paratha served here..its thick and crisp and the best staple to order since it goes well with all the sides!!!
Firni is a great dessert. Lovely fr 20 bucks. Served cold.
If u r in a hurry..grab beef rolls frm here..just 15 bucks..worth it..they use the same kebab as fillings for the roll..
Extremely affordable..very nice place to gorge on beef item..
Havent tried their breakfast menu yet!! Will be posting more pics soon

One of the popular places to have beef items in Kolkata.

Located in park circus more, only a few minutes away from quest mall.


Well, not an attractive place as per decor and service but the fragrance of beef kebabs will definitely tempt you. 


The kebabs were good but not great 

Yes they were juicy tender and you will enjoy. 

The bhuna is really awesome and goes well with the paratha. 

Lastly the firni, well every time I visit minimum I have 3-4 firni for myself only. 


Lastly it's definitely pocket friendly.

This used to be one of our go to beef places during college days, when in South Calcutta. Returned during the Ramzan time to taste Haleem couple of years back. It was decent. The beef kebabs though were not up to the mark. Tasted good, but was not soft enough and chewy. Service was good and friendly. The place is pocket friendly, so if you are around and want beef, do visit.

One of the popular places in Kolkata to have beef. Located close to Zeeshan, the fragrance of Beef will attract you even from a mile away. They specializes in Rolls, Biryani, Bhuna, Kebabs and other delicacies. Not for calorie-conscious people of hygiene-freaks, I had dropped here only once long time back, and had tried their Biryani. Rich and aromatic Biryani with soft mutton portion, the price was so undershadowed by the quality of the dish. Try this place, if you are around, and am sure you won't be disappointed.

One of the best places for beef biriyani in town with beautiful fragrant rice and succulent pieces of beef. Prices are quite low, which is not surprising since it's beef. The Beef Bhuna, Qurma, and the tiny sheekh kebabs are absolutely delicious too. It's a tad bit dingy though, so if you don't like the set-up you could get their amazing biriyani packed.

Not an attractive place as per decor and service. May not appear very tidy, however never heard a single complaint about the hygiene and the freshness of the produce. A mini heaven for beef lovers. Excellent place for beef biryani, bhuna beef, beef rezala, beef chanp, beef rolls. Don't miss the beef nihari on the winter mornings and the beef halim is a must try during the Ramjan month.

I'm doing my yearly Ramadan food tour so I had to check in here to taste their haleem. And I was not disappointed. Not a fancy place, in fact as basic as they come, but decent food, and really inexpensive. Their firni is really good and the service super friendly.

If you don't believe in religion hypocrisy and if you are all ruled by your taste buds then this place could be a heaven for you . one of the best beef (read well cooked, tender and juiciest beef ) joint in this city . though it doesn't have a decent ( sometimes uncomfortable as well) interior but it's a worth try if you are a meat lover . All the biriyanis are mouthwatering and kebabs are best match with it . and most interesting part is you don't have to pay more than 150 rupees to pamper your stomach . yes ! It's that much pocket friendly.

I had to shell out Rs 149 for 2 people and we had 4 nun, 2 plate beef chaap, 2 plates of beef kabab and 1 phirni. If we would have had the same thing at a bigger and posh restaurant the price would have been 10 times more than what I had to pay.
If you are a true blue foodie, then the ambiance will not bother you.¬†
The moment you step into Park Circus, the tantalizing smell of kababs, rolls, biriyani, chaap and what not hits you both from Nafeel and Zeeshan and pulls you towards them.¬†
Try out the beef biriyani and the chaap..The meat melts in your mouth and the firni, is not too sweet and just perfect.
People who are cleanliness freak, avoid this place, but people who love to eat do drop in.

Located in the same lane as Zeeshan(park circus). You can smell their beef kebabs from a kilometre away. This us the place where I had beef for the first time three years ago. 
Don't expect nice ambience, decor and all that stuff. This is a non-AC restro and u might often find the plates,in which you have been served ,has broken edges.
But food tastes awesome. Juicy succulent pieces of beef marinated in spicy masalas being grilled on a charcoal flame is quite a sight. 
All beef items are great. Beef rolls, beef kebabs with laccha paratha, beef biriyani, beef qorma. Not a huge fan of their chicken dishes though. Highly recomended if you are low on budget and doesn't care for decor and all that stuff. This eatery is very easy on the pocket.

There was a time when i used to visit this place at 4-5 times a month with my friends. Biryani bhuna and beef korma and some onions.. thats what we used to order everytime. Had the desire to try the lacchha paratha but couldnt resist myself from ordering biryani¬† (everytime). A bit uncomfortable during the summer months since this place is not air conditioned. But i would suggest all beef lovers out dere to try this place atleast once.

I have had the fortune of eating breakfast, lunch & evening snacks over here. Best will be breakfast, evening snacks & lunch will come last. You must try beef nihari (available only in winter) with puri. It's heavenly. In the evening, Nafeel's beef roll is a must have. Their beef is soft, succulent, juicy & great. In lunch, I've tried bhuna, chanp, biryani,, rezala. They all are good. RECOMMENDATION: YES

You will hear most in Kolkata raving about Zeeshan at Park Circus, but tucked away in that very same lane is one of the most amazing beef biryani and kabab joint you will find in the city. With succulent chunks of the holy meat, the rice is cooked to a divine perfection and aroma ‚Äì and the very thought induces me to kneel down in reverence. With 100 bucks in your pocket, you can have a blast at this place. Their beef kababs are super too. Do also try out the Beef Tikiya for 9 rupees and be prepared to have a mind totally blown apart from the oily happiness. Not to mention the Beef Bhuna, which is also immensely tasty.

Residing in the hub of Mughlai delicacies, I have always been very inclined towards Biriyani and Kebabs more than anything. Nafeel has been my threshold for including beef in my diet.
With a calm and cosy environment, Nafeel is a very pocket-friendly place. I am ardent fan of their Beef Chaanp, Bhuna and Kebabs. The Biriyani isn't that impressive. Their occasional Handi Kebab is another star. I give Nageel five star!!

If you're in a mood for beef and have a little in your pocket, come and dig in. Apart from their kebabs, biriyani, rolls and bhuna, beef dal ghost will be a nicer option to go with tandoori rotis. And of course a firni is needed to end with. The dec√≥r isn't impressive enough. Still, what else could you expect other than some holy delicious pocket friendly beef..!
Worth trying.. :-)

P.S. Do try their handi kebabs. And 'mutton paya' during winter. A must try. Beef nihari is only served in morning (7-8AM) that is yet to try! with Arunabha Saha

Probably the "Cheapest" place in calcutta, where you can have a full course meal within 200 rupees,  and the meal included beef biriyani, beef korma, or beef hundi kebabs... though the area is shady but the location of the restaurant is on the main road,  but not at all impressive in decor or taste.

If you seek sophistication, go away. If you crave mainstream meat, don't bother. If you shudder at the thought of eating beef, grab a mushroom pie elsewhere. Or if you're waiting for a modicum of confidence to manifest, comeback later.¬†Check in only if your frantic obsession with (trying) beef roll is burning your gut. Even if you have to endure a long drawn, harrowing journey from the other side of the town, do it. Just a small bite will be worth your while.

Let's start with the bad points..The salad is nonsense..its just shredded onions and cucumber with sliced lemons.

That was the worst part..but the food is Damn tasty..We had beef biriyani with beef chap and starter were beef kababs

Kababs were ok and the chap was  awesome..so awesome that we ordered tandoori roti and lachcha paratha..which by themselves were great..

I should take a moment here to say the roti were perfect beyond belief ..They were as fluffy as they can be and not one inch of any of the roti we had were scorched...simply ultra brilliant ..

Coming to biriyani..It couldn't believe it was beef..The texture was as of mutton and so soft..It was very good ..


Definitely a place to hit your sweet spot if u are into beef..and it's Damn cheap..so much food for three persons and it came to around 350 bucks..For perspective a good continental dish for one person will cost you around 350 to 450 at a standard place..

"Ek plate beef biryani, acha boti daal ke" - ahh how I love that cry from the friendly waiters at Nafeel. Situated bang opposite Zeeshan and Park Circus tram depot, this is one very beefy resto.

Once you are inside, you can easily ignore all the chicken, mutton and veg dishes and simply settle for the Beef biryani (I always end up eating 1 1/2 plates) with those super soft and crispy beef pieces and a plate of beef korma/stew. If you are in a hurry, simply pick a beef roll or two.¬†

It's not so clean or upscale, but it always suited my budget and tastebuds since my college days, when the beef biryani out here used to sell for Rs 35.

Nafeel is located right behind Zeeshan near the Park Circus crossing. You can't miss it - it's the one with 'A F E E L' written above it. It's a miracle they haven't been blown out of the competition yet, considering they're surrounded by all of Kolkata's famous Biryani joints. Perhaps it's because they serve beef.

Nafeel doesn't seem like a very hygienic joint, nor does it feel very clean. So to sit and eat might be a problem in many cases. If you don't have a major issue with this, then Nafeel is as good as any other eatery. They are a friendly lot and their service is fast - very fast!

Their food is somewhat polar. Everything related to beef is outstanding. Everything else is below standard. Their beef biryani is delicious, so is their beef chaap and all other dishes they can conjure up by adding beef. Their chicken dishes don't even offer competition. Granted it takes a lot to beat a well made beef dish, but their chicken based dishes are frightful. If you ever do visit Nafeel, be sure to order the beef. One plate of Beef Biryani and Chaap is plenty for a single person and you won't need to pay a rupee more than 100. In my book, that's brilliant. I also did try their rolls at a point and they sort of felt very oily. Not very good and I'll be avoiding them. Their beef though, quite easily tops Nizam.

Be advised that weak stomachs won't be able to handle the redness of coe meat. So eat carefully and be sure to not over eat. Love this place!

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

An open entranced, pure Muslim style eating house I rather say. They cook the chaps outside. The tandoori rotis are nicely done here.
The Beef attracts me here, along with the price. Biriyani is nice, unless you start comparing to the big shots in the area. The beef Biriyani is tasty and the beef bhuna is a yum.
Beef lovers can pack to their heart's desire without getting empty pockets. Go for it!

This place keeps calling me everytime I visit park circus area. There are more than one reasons why even you would love this eatery. Firstly, although it's located in the heart of park circus there's no such reflection in their rates. Secondly, tastiest food amongst what I've tried here. Be it their rolls, parathas, kebabs and gravy, there's nothing which will let you down. You can have a sumptuous meal in less than 100( hard to believe right?). Try the mutton or beef dishes. You will thank me for this. :)

Tucked away opposite Zeeshan, this is one place that you shouldn't judge by looks. Unassuming and shabby, you wouldn't even bother taking a second look at what is otherwise, arguably, the best place in the city for beef Biryani. The meat is tender and well cooked. They give you two chunks with each plate. The potato is perfect Kolkata biryani standard. It's best accompanied by their beef bhuna or chaap. The beef bhuna or beef stew are best had with naan or paratha though.
The pocket pinch for this place is roughly 100 per person if you order a lot. The staff are friendly and courteous and the food is served on time.

The melt in the mouth 'boti', the perfectly flavoured rice and the potato biryani dreams are made of. If you are not brave enough to eat there, just get a pack or two to go home. You will definitely wake up the next day craving for some more. The chanp is good as a side order. But if you are purist like me you wont need it. If you love meat go for the special biryani. And for those you don't like biryani much, the beef bhuna and beef stew are brilliant. You can try their breakfast too.

An extremely affordable place to eat beef as I never found my bill going more than 60 bucks. The food is more than good for the amount of money spent.

Amazing food, biriyani is a must along with beef bhuna, the biriyani comes with 2 pieces of tender beef, one f my friends got a boney piece of meat but the waiter was prompt to change the piece. All in all good joint , value for money, must if you are craving beef.

Well dnt just judge it by the appearance, rather judge it for the quality food it serves. Am quiet a regular at this joint. Whenever we friends go for an outing we make sure we dine at this place.. 
Its better known for the beef dishes it serves. All are tasty as hell and the best part is they are soo cheap..
My patent dish is the beef biryani and beef chaap but the other dishes are equally tasty..
So if you are a beef lover then don't wait anymore..

Best beef in the city? Well, definitely in contention for that.

Don't get fooled by their exterior, it's actually a pretty nice, legit place. The Beef Biriyani here is supremely delicious, and the Bhuna isn't too bad either.
The Firni is a bargain at 20 bucks, and it is one of the few beef-serving restaurants where a proper meal for two comes up to less than 250 bucks.
Definitely a must try.
Would have given this a 4/5 if it weren't for the dirt surrounding the tables. However, I've been here many times and not a single time was the stomach ever upset. :P

the food they provide is of great quality and taste. till now as many times i have been there with my friends, the eating experience is good. but my overall rating has got affected because of its very poor ambience. it is highly uncomfortable for women and girls. you will feel it too. apart from this, the eating experience is incomparable. think and give it a try.

Had a quick lunch. Plan rice, bhuna and kebab. Only for Rs58. What more could you ask for? Forget about the ambience, although it is far better than the famous and overly priced dada boudi's biriyani, at barrackpore. And yes, the waiting was smiling too. :)

If you are broke and you want to eat North Indian food, this is the place. Tasty beef dishes at dirt cheap prices is the USP of this place. 

Check out the menu for the unbelievable pricing! But do not be fooled. This is a proper restaurant with decent seating facility and not just a roadside food joint. 

Convenient location, friendly staff, prompt service.

Verdict:

Food: 4/5

Price range: 5/5

Service: 4/5

Staff: 4/5

Ambience: 2/5

USP: Beef dishes are a must-try!

If you have that sudden craving for beef and mocambo and other continental restaurants are way above your pay grade, this is the place to be. Now expecting something fancy out of this place is a mistake. This place provides a hearty and filling meal at dirt cheap prices. Beef biriyani, beef roll, beef kebab, beef bhuna, beef, beef and more beef.
If you are a beef lover and don't mind a lack of ambience, then this is the place to be. Actually I wouldn't say the place lacks good ambience, it is just different from other restaurants. The service was prompt and the waiter was very friendly. He came to check on us often. He even started a conversation with my dad which I really enjoyed. They understand that friendliness is as important as the did they serve.
I usually come here for the biriyani but none of the dishes ever let me down. You cannot expect them to be of the finest order, but they're worth it and makes me visit frequently.
Some of the items on the menu seems to be always unavailable. Which sorta bugs me. A lil variety would go a long way.

Good prompt service, tried firni n tea. Best firni in park circus. Menu is very low priced and food is good. Lively characters(servers) keeps u smiling through out ur dining experience. To rate the place-
Food - 4 off 5
Ambiance - 3.8 off 5
Price - 5
Overall it gets an 3.8 off 5
Though it is in a muslim based area and serves beef, but its spread for chicken is also good but limited.. overall a good experience

On a rainy evening on Eid, I went to Nafeel with my wife with only 1 ambition - have lots of beef :D . The first thing that I liked very much was the extremely cordial behavior of a server with a constant smile on his face. It made the evening ten times better and gives a very important lesson - the behavior is as important as the food. Returning to the food, we had Beef kabab, Beef Biryani, Beef Bhuna and Firni. All of them were very soft and delicious and the rice in the biryani was long grained and separated with each spoonful. Very good experience indeed. The firni was also something out of the ordinary - it was not rice infested as usually firnis are and concentrated more on the kheer part making the taste very unique. Will visit time and again specially at such incredibly low prices.

For the cheapest kathi rolls. And beef biriyani, with oodles of dalda, that drips down to the elbow - kind of what the Calcuttan favours. Dirty cheap beef and mutton on the go.

This place deserves, only three rating points. I had the beef roll which was dirt cheap, setting me back by Rs. 14. The parathas tasted average (not even close to the parathas served across the street at Snack's Corner, which for some strange reason does not exist on Zomato). The beef was succulent in portions while certain parts were a bit chewy. 
But the size. The roll was half the size of a roll served anywhere else. I would have gladly paid double the amount for a size twice as the one I had. Now I know one visit is not enough to rate a place but the first impression was not that great.
Maybe, just maybe I will visit again one day and have reason to give more points.

Okay, so I gave this place a second chance and had the beef kebab and¬† beef tikiya. To put it plainly the kebab was bad. Too salty and not as tender as it should be. Some pieces were also burnt. The tikiya however, surprisingly exceeded my expectations. It was not only delightful to taste it also had a texture. The outer layer was firm enough to hold it together and the meat itself was tender inside. Overall not bad. But we warned, the earlier their items are concerned the better or be prepared for a layer of dalda on the roof of your mouth.

Thought I'd pop in for a couple of quick beef rolls for lunch but was disappointed to find out they do not do rolls at lunch time...So next best thing was a plate of beef keema mattar and a couple of rotis - service was almost instant but...the rotis were cold. So while the keema was good enough, the overall experience was a teeny bit of a letdown...

Ambience was on par with the likes of what  Shiraz used to be, Nizam's, Arsalan et al...Was expecting the bill to be in the region of Rs 75-100 so was pleasantly surprised to be presented with a bill of just Rs 30! Have been back many times and on one such visit discovered the excellent Beef Handi Kabab!

Nafeel is pretty much old school for me, with the beef rolls taking me back to my college days when we would be hungry enough to consume four at a go (at that point, it was around 4-5 rupees a roll) for a quick, satisfying, and very full meal. Cut to 2013, I went there for the chaap and bhuna a few days ago and was disappointed. The meat was simply too tough for me to chew, and after Arafat, I must say I have been spoiled. Also, the quality of the gravy had fallen, and I was not too happy with it. Undaunted, I went back to pack food a second time in another couple of days, and again the bhuna was too tough for me to chew, although the chaap was okay and so was the biryani . Sigh, Nafeel really needs to clean up its act or it risks losing a lot of business.

Located on the lane beside zeeshan and just opposite the tram depot,this beef serving restaurant in park street is just the right place to chew on some really mean beef kebabs which are both succulent and spicy at the same time. The kebabs are skewered only during evening hours so suit yourself accordingly foodies. You can always have beef biryani during lunch hours though,which is equally good. But i would rather give it a miss if ambience is my concern,plus no ac,so obviously avoidable during summer months. Overall i would give this place a try only for their amazing beef kebabs. For proper mughlai food,their neighbours are real charmers and they just fall flat!

If you dont have a problem with Beef and you prefer food over ambience then this place is worth a visit.
Located in the Park Circus area this places probably serves the best beef biryani,beef chap,beef roll in town.They also make Beef kebabs during the evenings which are also brilliant.Some items are available only at particular times of the day(like the kebabs in the evenings).But whenever you visit the place you will get some item or the other and i dont think you will feel let down.
But on the flip side the ambience is not at all good to say the least.There is no air conditioning either.The items other than the beef ones are not worth it.
Considering only the food the place surely gets a 4.But taking the limited availability of food items and the ambience into account it gets a 3.
